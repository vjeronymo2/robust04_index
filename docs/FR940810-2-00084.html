(Applicant) has applied to the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an incidental take permit pursuant to Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The Applicant has been assigned permit number PRT&hyph;793122. The requested permit, which is for a period not to exceed 10 years, would authorize the incidental take of the endangered golden-cheeked warbler ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Dendroica chrysoparia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> ). The take would occur as a result of the construction of and operation of a residential development on a 270-acre tract in Austin, Travis County, Texas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service has prepared an environmental assessment/habitat conservation plan (EA/HCP) for the incidental take permit application. A determination of jeopardy to the species or a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) will not be made before 30 days from the date of publication of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments on the application and EA/HCP should be received on or before September 9, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Persons wishing to review the application may obtain a copy by writing to the Assistant Regional Director, Ecological Services, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O.

However, the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species if such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered species are at 50 CFR 17.22.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Applicant plans to build a residential development located northwest of Austin near the intersection of Ranch Road 2222 and City Park Road in Travis County, Texas. The development will occupy approximately 116 acres with the remaining 153 acres proposed as a conservation area. These activities will permanently eliminate about 107 acres of occupied golden-cheeked warbler habitat. The Applicant proposes to mitigate the incidental take via preservation and management of about 153 acres as a golden-cheeked warbler preserve through a conservation easement. Additionally, the Applicant will conduct territorial mapping surveys on lands adjacent to the proposed development, provide operating and maintenance funds for the lands (on-site 153 acres) to be preserved, conduct the necessary biological surveys, minimize clearing of lots, establish a 300-foot buffer of no construction from a golden-cheeked warbler territory during the breeding season, and revegetate with native plant species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Applicant considered three alternatives but rejected two of them because they were not economically viable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> James A.

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / East, west - home's best: FT writers examine Mercedes-Benz's decision to locate its new plant in Germany rather than elsewhere in Europe Just three months ago, Mr Helmut Werner, the elegant Mercedes-Benz chief executive, gave the Financial Times an exclusive. Chatting enthusiastically about his planned Vision A car, the company's first venture into the small car market, he said Mercedes was looking for a European site to be devoted exclusively to making 200,000 annually. Four countries were under consideration: Germany, the UK, the Czech Republic and one other. A week later it emerged that France was also on the list. According to Mr Werner, a decision would be made by the end of the year. The rush was on. In Britain, for example, the Northern Development Company, NDC, responsible for economic regeneration in north-east England, reacted within 24 hours to a request from the Department of Trade and Industry for details of potential 250-300 acre sites. Bidders now admit it was curious that Mr Werner should publicise sensitive plans at such an early stage. It was even more curious that he should be scouting around for a greenfield site when he had a perfectly good, state-of-the-art factory standing almost idle in Germany. Was it conceivable that the ultra-respectable Mercedes was playing an elaborate game? Was it cynically using its international prestige and credibility in an attempt to bluff or brow-beat its German workforce into accepting tough new working conditions in return for the job of building the new car? The story and the issues it raised were ignored by the German media. They were preoccupied with the Daimler-Benz subsidiary's demands that its 85,000 workforce must accept cuts in perks, bonuses and other benefits which would save Mercedes DM200m (Pounds 79m) a year. Days later, Mr Edzard Reuter, group chairman, was piling on the agony at a press conference. Productivity at Mercedes had to increase 40 per cent by the end of 1997; the group workforce was to be cut by 44,000 in 1993 and 1994, and 27,000 of those jobs would be lost from the automotive arm, he said. But the Mercedes workforce representatives, aware that the A-Class project and 3,000 jobs were at stake, were not going to give up DM200m easily. The pressure on the workforce increased: Daimler's Deutsche Aerospace subsidiary promptly announced the closure of six German factories and sites. Management in the AEG division made sure the world knew of an impending sell-off, including the off-loading of its domestic appliances to Electrolux. The Mercedes workforce was left in no doubt that group management, after years of talking about restructuring and changes in attitude, was now taking action. Last Wednesday, when Mr Reuter revised the group-wide job loss total up to 51,000, a somewhat flustered Mr Werner told journalists that the A-Class was to be built at an existing, one-year-old Mercedes works in Rastatt, close to the eastern French border, and that a package of DM200m cost-savings had been agreed with the unions in an early-hours dash the previous night to meet the management's deadline. A similar message was sent out simultaneously to the foreign contenders for the A-Class factory. 'We still thought Arras was a serious contender right up until Wednesday morning,' says a local authority official in the northern French town. Mr Patrice Joosep, director of economic expansion at the local chamber of commerce, says he was disappointed. 'But we always knew Germany would be a stiff competitor. That's the name of the game in projects like this,' he adds. The British contenders, aware that the Rastatt plant was already built and under-used because of a collapse in demand for cars, say they had additional cause to doubt the earnestness of Mercedes' approaches. It was unusual for a site-search of such importance to be announced publicly, and the three-month timescale was curiously short. But they swallowed their scepticism. According to Mr Robert Haymon-Collins, head of marketing at the West Midlands Development Agency, the short notice made it difficult for his office to put packages together. 'It was all off-the-shelf stuff,' he admits. But given that Mercedes would need easy access to an east-coast port  -the A-Class is intended as a strictly European city car - his area dropped out of the serious running fairly early in the process. Chatter, gossip and exchanges of notes between local authorities and London ministries indicated that this was the way Mercedes was thinking. Even so, Mr Haymon-Collins says: 'We treated the project with due credibility, although one could have predicted the outcome.' The NDC, which has wide experience in the inward investment maze and 375 foreign successes, including the Pounds 900m Nissan car plant in Sunderland, says it was well aware that Mercedes might be using the foreign search as a lever in its negotiations with domestic unions. 'But we all take the view that until a deal is done there is everything to play for,' says Mr Les Henson, chief executive of the County Durham Development Company, which worked together with NDC on the project. 'When an agreement depends on negotiations with a third party which may not succeed, then 'plan B' (a move outside Germany) would come into play. We treated it very seriously on that basis,' he added. Mercedes, too, handled the search with convincing thoroughness, underlined by personal site visits from Mr Werner himself and Mr Peter Martens, director of the A-Class project. Mr Chris Fraser, operations director of the NDC, remains convinced by the seniority of the people involved and their methodical approach that the Mercedes team was seriously evaluating real options. It was shown two sites, both in Newton Aycliffe, during a one-day visit on November 2. The agencies' efforts were reinforced by the involvement of Mr Ian Gibson, head of the local Nissan operation, and Mr Llew Aviss, personnel chief of the nearby Fujitsu microchip plant. The Yorkshire and Humberside Development Association, YHDA, offering sites at Doncaster and Hull - both ports already used by Mercedes for shipping parts and vehicles - was chary at first. 'But then it got very serious indeed,' said Mr Mark Saville, the association corporate affairs manager. 'If it was all bluff, we are convinced the people looking here did not know anything about it.' A German team, led by Mr Martens, garnered more information than even companies that had actually moved into the region in the past. Two YHDA staff were seconded to the project full-time. Mr Martens appointed local agents and consultants to assess the sites. The association produced an exclusive promotional video for screening in Germany. The touring party also apparently paid serious attention to the Czech Republic, where four towns volunteered themselves. The Stuttgart team descended on a 100-hectare former army base close to the Skoda engineering works in Pilsen. Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, trade and industry minister, was not very optimistic when he emerged from follow-up talks on November 22. After all, earlier talks with the group on establishing a Dollars 250m trucks joint venture, had collapsed only in March. After the Rastatt announcement, the disappointment appeared greatest at the YHDA, which at one stage put other jobs to one side and set all its 30 staff to work on the project. There was more stoicism further north. The NDC's Mr Fraser found the experience valuable. 'Being on the shortlist will stand us in good stead in future,' he said. His County Durham colleague, Mr Henson, agreed: 'An experience like that makes you better prepared for the next large project that comes up. We're just waiting for the next one now.' As Mr Henson suggests, optimism is a far more valuable quality than scepticism in real-life business dealings. Events of the past few days tend to prove the thesis. As the FT has since learnt, the Arras town hall spokesman was right that his area was in the running until the last minute. The northern French town had been top of the Mercedes reserve list. The company had made all the necessary arrangements for a press conference in Paris last week to announce that the plant was to go to Arras. But the media invitations were not faxed. At the last minute, German union officials swallowed their scepticism about the seriousness of Mercedes' threats. They surrendered the DM200m savings demanded by management, and secured 3,000 German jobs.

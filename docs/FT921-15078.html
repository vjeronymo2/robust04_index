			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (19): Bumpy drive for the car makers  -Motor vehicles and components / The performance of the leading groups in a year when profitability nose-dived and competition intensified EUROPE'S publicly-quoted car makers and automotive components suppliers lost favour with investors last year, as profitability nose-dived, competition intensified and some vehicle producers fell into loss. Virtually without exception the ranking of motor industry groups represented in the FT500 list has deteriorated with the leaders of the western European new car market, Volkswagen of Germany and Fiat of Italy, suffering two of the biggest drops. Fiat, which has the broadest spread of automotive operations of any of the European producers, has suffered a significant fall from grace dropping from 15th place in 1990 to 53rd in 1991. The Volkswagen group of Germany, now the clear leader of the western European new car market, fared little better in investor sentiment, however, as it plunged from 32 to 78 in the FT500 list. Its growing sales volume has failed to remove financial analysts' scepticism about its underlying profitability and the magnitude of the investments it is planning during the next five years. At the same time Peugeot of France, which includes Citroen, has also lost ground, slipping from 59th to 83rd in the FT500. Along with Fiat its European sales faltered badly during 1991. In the western European new car sales league it was overtaken by General Motors and Ford, the two US car makers and slipped from third to fifth place. The Fiat group now includes virtually the entire Italian car industry with the Fiat, Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Ferrari and Innocenti marques - it holds a 49 per cent stake in Maserati - as well as the Iveco commercial vehicle operations and a majority stake in Magneti Marelli, one of the biggest European automotive components suppliers. It staged the weakest performance of the big six volume car makers in the European new car market last year with a drop in sales volume of some 9 per cent. This depressed its market share to around 12.8 per cent from 14.1 per cent a year earlier. Fiat has come under heavy attack in the domestic Italian market. It is more dependent on its home market than any of its rivals among the big six volume car makers in western Europe and appears to be one of the European car makers most vulnerable to the growing Japanese presence in Europe. In the first 11 months of 1991 the Fiat group captured only 46.9 per cent of the Italian new car market compared with 53.2 per cent in the corresponding period of 1990 and 58 per cent in the same period of 1989. The operating income of its car operations declined to L907bn (Dollars 739m) in 1990 from L2,300bn (Dollars 1.9bn) a year earlier, and the group's profitability declined sharply again last year. In Europe, the German vehicle makers fared best in 1991, as they were buoyed up by the extraordinary surge in new car sales in the domestic market in the first half of the year fuelled by reunification. Important new models have been launched including from Volkswagen a new generation Golf, Europe's best-selling car. In the past two years demand patterns have diverged sharply in different European markets, as sales in several key volume countries such as the UK, France and Spain have nose-dived, while sales in Germany surged to a record level. According to industry estimates western European new car sales in the first 11 months of 1991 at 12.714m were virtually unchanged with an increase of 0.3 per cent from the same period a year ago. However, registrations were lower than a year ago in each of the four months from September to November. The dramatic surge in German new car sales, which was the main prop to western European new car demand in the first seven months of the year, is abating, while key markets elsewhere, such as the UK and France, have remained in deep recession. The big jump in German new car sales last year masked the sharp fall elsewhere. Excluding Germany, sales in the rest of western Europe in the first 11 months at an estimated 8.764m showed a drop of some 9.1 per cent. Groups such as Fiat and Peugeot, whose main strengths are in southern Europe, suffered accordingly, while the producers with a strong presence in Germany - including General Motors (Opel) and Ford - all gained ground. The same pattern could be seen among the European executive and luxury car producers, although they faced the added problem of the recession in the US. Daimler-Benz still fell from 5th to 10th place in the FT500, however, while BMW dropped from 81 to 99. Volvo, the Swedish car and truck maker which has slipped from 92 to 109 in the FT500 list, suffered an operating loss of some SKr1.5bn (Dollars 260m) on its car operations in the first nine months of last year and had an overall group operating loss of SKr1.26bn in the same period. After a false start early in 1991, European car stocks appeared to be returning to favour with investors in the late autumn last year amid suggestions that the earnings of most manufacturers would turn upwards in 1992. However, the prospects still remain uncertain. Until 1991 European car makers had had a rough ride since their peak in 1986. According to James Capel, the London stockbrokers, European car shares outperformed their respective markets by 19 per cent in 1986, but then underperformed by 17 per cent, 3 per cent, 6 per cent and 25 per cent in the following four years. The sector rebounded at the start of 1991, but sentiment weakened again later in the year. The outlook for 1992 remains problematical. According to the latest forecast from DRI Europe, the London-based automotive analysts, the western European market is forecast to fall by 2.4 per cent to 13.15m in 1992, largely reflecting an expected 19 per cent drop in German new car demand to 3.3m. Excluding Germany, the demand outlook is more favourable, with western European sales elsewhere growing to 9.8m next year from 9.3m in 1991.</p>

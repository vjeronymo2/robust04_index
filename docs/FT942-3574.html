			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Warning against direct controls on derivatives: BIS backs better disclosure by firms to reduce risks Market-friendly methods, rather than direct controls, should be used to regulate derivative financial products, the Bank for International Settlements urged at its annual meeting in Basle yesterday. The BIS, an international organisation that promotes co-operation among central banks, said improved disclosure by individual firms, capital adequacy standards that relate to market risk, and improved settlement systems were the key to controlling the potential risks caused by derivative instruments. In its survey of world economic conditions, the BIS suggests that the US Federal Reserve may have been too slow to increase interest rates. 'It could plausibly be argued that keeping real policy-influenced interest rates negative for too long risked contributing to a build-up of inflation.' The Fed has recently moved towards a 'neutral' interest rate policy. The BIS, in its annual report, says - as did the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development last week - that the solution to high unemployment is to make the labour market more flexible. Its emphasis on derivatives follows fears that the complexity and scale of markets in derivatives, such as futures and options, might lead to growing financial instability and so-called systemic risk - the danger that the failure of a market participant might cause a meltdown of the financial system. Some government officials believe that the use of derivatives may have compounded the decline in world bond markets that followed the increase in US interest rates on February 4. In the US, the General Accounting Office last month issued a report calling for legislation on the use of derivatives. But Mr Andrew Crockett, the BIS general manager, said: 'It would be a mistake to assume that policymaking would be easier if financial instruments could be limited or capital movements controlled. 'Global markets are now so highly integrated that suppressing the symptoms of investor preferences in one market would simply lead to their manifestation elsewhere.' Although the BIS report says the 'potential for instability in these markets is extremely high', it suggests that by strengthening disclosure and internal controls, market participants can be protected from their own mistakes. Mr Wim Duisenberg, BIS president, told the meeting it was important to strengthen the resilience of individual financial institutions. 'Promoting a sharper awareness of risks on the part of market participants and encouraging the adoption of internal risk-management procedures suited to the new environment are two such examples,' he said.

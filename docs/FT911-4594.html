			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Public-sector deficit exceeds expectations THE GOVERNMENT recorded a deficit on its public-sector finances last month of Pounds 3.1bn, the highest for three years. The figure, released yesterday, illustrates the deterioration in public-sector finances in recent months, largely as a result of the recession. It underlines fears in the City that the government's forecast Pounds 8bn deficit in 1991-92 may be over-optimistic. Some economists believe the deficit will turn out as high as Pounds 12bn. The deficit for March, the last month of the 1990-91 financial year, was roughly Pounds 600m higher than anticipated in the City. It was caused mainly by a surge in local-authority borrowing and lower tax revenues than expected. Borrowing by local authorities was Pounds 1.4bn last month against Pounds 118m in February and Pounds 901m in March 1990. Total local-authority borrowing for 1990-91 came to Pounds 3.5bn, more than for the four previous years combined. Councils have been forced to borrow more, largely as a result of difficulties arising from the poll tax. Tax collected by the Inland Revenue in March amounted to Pounds 5.3bn, against Pounds 5.7bn in February. Growth in total tax contributions is likely to fall off over the next year as a result of slower growth in incomes and a fall in company profits. For the whole of 1990-91, the government showed a surplus on its public-sector finances of Pounds 400m, as against a surplus in 1989-90 of Pounds 7.9bn. In last month's Budget, the Treasury forecast a surplus for 1990-91 of Pounds 800m. The projected deficit in the current financial year will be the first since 1986-87. Net spending by government departments in 1990-91 came to Pounds 181.4bn, 16 per cent up on the previous year. Much of the extra spending was due to bigger outlays on social security payments. Privatisation proceeds for 1990-91 amounted to Pounds 5.3bn, of which Pounds 1.6bn were received in March, mainly from the first instalment of the sale of PowerGen and National Power, the electricity generators.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Reincarnation of the Censor...."] </F>   [Text] The IZVESTIYA editorial office has received an  "official warning" signed by V. Volodin, first deputy chairman  of the Russian Federation Committee for the Press. We received  the latest "reprimand" for the same reason -- because IZVESTIYA  published in issues Nos. 14-18 1994 an article by I. Dementyeva  entitled "War and Peace in Prigorodnyy Rayon."    Quoting several sections from the article, the author  explains why the "warning" has been given. Certain claims and  statements "serve to kindle ethnic intolerance and enmity."  Following this formidable, peremptory criminal-legal diagnosis  it only remained to cite Article 74 of the RSFSR Criminal Code  under which the offender should be indicted..... But the point  is that the Russian Committee for the Press has clearly gone  beyond the bounds of its competence and exceeded its authority.  The only bodies that could in this instance determine the legal  nature of the article are the prosecutor's office and a court.  But things did not reach the courts since the Russian General  Prosecutor's Office refused to institute criminal proceedings in  respect of the publication of I. Dementyeva's article owing to  absence of criminal events and corpus delicti.    You get the impression that when formulating its decision  the  Russian Committee for the Press availed itself of the ruling on  this matter produced by the Court of Appeal for Information  Disputes, whose findings the editorial office categorically  rejected (see IZVESTIYA No. 59 for 30 March this year). But  even this ruling does not say a word about kindling ethnic  enmity. It is quite possible that some third body, which has  arbitrarily assumed the functions of a reincarnation of the  censor, will draw an even more radical conclusion.    Incidentally, attempts to take charge of the press are  becoming more and more aggressive. Recently a certain current  information center sent to IZVESTIYA the actual ruling of the  Court of Appeal for Information Disputes and the Republic of  North Ossetia Supreme Soviet decree. The accompanying letter  peremptorily asked for these documents to be published and ended  with the unprecedented postscript: "Please inform us of the  dates of publication." The center's leader A. Remizov could not  find anything to say in response to our official query (a purely  rhetorical query, to be frank) as to the normative documents on  which this request was based and he did not press for his  demands to be met.    There have recently been repeated attempts to subordinate  IZVESTIYA and you know how they have ended. The editorial  office and the creative collective are resolutely rejecting the  latest attempts.</p>

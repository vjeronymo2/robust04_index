			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Philips Profit warnings are a hazard at this stage of the cycle, but for Philips they have become alarmingly routine. Yesterday's unexpected announcement that net income this year is likely to be no better than about half the 1991 result, for example, contrasts with an admittedly cagey but markedly less gloomy statement in its report at the end of the second quarter. The trouble for the market is gauging precisely the extent of the problem. The company was clearly not alone in mistakenly seeing an early end to the recession, but it is hard to believe that the dollar exchange rate is the major issue. More worryingly, this may be a smokescreen for the extent of price weakness and volume decline in European consumer electronics. The question for the shares - down 7.5 per cent yesterday - must be whether the latest action on costs is going to be enough.</p>

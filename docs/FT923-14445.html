			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / CBI calls on EC to tackle economic priorities CONCERN about ratification of the Maastricht treaty could distract the European Community from the severe problems facing EC businesses, the Confederation of British Industry warned yesterday. 'It seems to us there is a danger of what is essentially a political question overshadowing this crisis of business competitiveness,' said Sir Anthony Tennant, chairman of the CBI's Europe committee. Sir Anthony, who is also chairman of Guinness, the UK drinks group, was in Brussels to highlight the CBI's priorities for the British presidency of the EC, which began last week. He urged the UK government to press for completion of the single European market, which would be the best way of halting the decline in EC competitiveness. However, in its memorandum to the British government, the CBI calls on the presidency to ignore 'bogus single market measures', such as draft legislation to harmonise company law, data protection standards and social policy. The CBI believes these measures would add little to the creation of a single market. Sir Anthony pointed out that the Community's share of world export markets had declined by 30 per cent in volume terms over the past decade, and Community productivity was growing at only half the Japanese rate. But the CBI stressed that it was not advocating an interventionist policy, and sounded a note of caution about the European Commission's budget plans for the next five years. The Commission envisages targeting increased EC funds on improved research and development and professional training. Mr Dick Price, the CBI's deputy director general, said the organisation, which represents 250,000 British companies, was 'instinctively wary' about anything that might involve 'officials taking decisions to pump public money into the promotion of individual sectors'. 'That's the quickest way of wasting people's money that anybody has ever thought of,' he added.</p>

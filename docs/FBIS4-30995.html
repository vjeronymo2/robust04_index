			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, June 1 (ATA) -- On May 30-31, the foreign  minister of Albania, Alfred Serreqi, met with senior officials  of the diplomatic missions of the European Union member  countries and Security Council member countries accredited in  Tirana. The topic of the meetings was the latest developments  in Albanian-Greek relations.    Minister Serreqi said that as opposed to Albania's  insistence  on resuming dialogue there is an escalation of tension by the  Greek party which does not hesitate to use unexisting causes for  this purpose. Mr. Serreqi said there has been no arrest among  the Greek minority, except the six persons made known in the  communique of the Tirana Attorney's Office. No Albanian citizen  of Greek or Albanian origin summoned as witness has been  arrested, and as you know, the courts are independent and  processes open and unbiased.    The spread of false news as in the case of the socalled  arrest of 31 persons from the minority and others like this, the  minister said, intends to destroy the image of democracy in  Albania, like in the case of the late Sh.M., who months ago died  of heart attack, but in which case the Greek propaganda  machinery managed to deceive the European Parliament, which  described the case in a resolution as a person killed by the  Albanian police.    Regarding Greece's blocking the European Union's economic  assistance for the balance of payments, the Albanian Government  says that this is a real cause to block reforms in Albania and  destabilize the country. It also intends to lead Albania away  from its course of integration into Europe. But, Mr. Serreqi  said, this will meet with failure. This action also shows the  wish to penalize the regional policy of Albania which serves  peace and stability in the region.    Under these conditions, Albania asks the European Union  member countries not to allow compromise with the course of  reforms and not be reconciled to the aid freeze. Also, Albania  emphasises that it is open and ready to cooperate with the  European Union and the Security Council to overcome a tense  situation between the two countries. Minister Serreqi said that  Albania has been the first to ask for this assistance and  continues to be open to it.</p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / International Company News: Corning bids Dollars 370m for Damon CORNING INC, the US high-technology group, yesterday launched a rival Dollars 370m bid for Damon Corporation, a medical testing laboratory group which last week agreed to be acquired for Dollars 258m by National Health Laboratories. Corning already runs one of the largest clinical lab businesses in the US, called MetPath, and the takeover of Damon would put it in contention for the leadership of the sector with first-ranked SmithKline Beecham. Corning's cash tender offer, which values Damon at Dollars 23 a share compared to NHL's Dollars 16 a share, was regarded on Wall Street as a probable knock-out blow, since a much higher offer from NHL would substantially dilute its 1993 earnings. There was no immediate reaction from Damon. The offer was welcomed by the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, Damon's largest shareholder, with 9.6 per cent. Last week it said it would try to block the NHL bid because it was 'well below' fair value. Mr James Houghton, chairman of Corning, said the takeover would be excellent for Corning financially, since it was expected to have a neutral impact on earnings in the first year and contribute significantly to earnings thereafter. Analysts said the bid would be good for Corning in that it would strengthen the company's position in several local markets, and that it would keep assets out of competitors' hands.</p>

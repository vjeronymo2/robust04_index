It advocates the movements'  aims and complies with its struggle and political programs.  However, its ranks will remain open to all the sons of our  people, regardless of their political affiliations."    This came in a statement issued yesterday by Haftar. It  includes an affirmation that the opposition army is "an integral  part of our national Armed Forces inside the country, and it  considers itself a vanguard force for all honorable  oppositionists, regardless of their political affiliations....  It is an army for all Libyans in order to achieve the aims of  national struggle."    The statement adds: "The Libyan National Army, which has  decided to split from the National Front for the Salvation of  Libya to look for a new struggle formula through which to carry  out its national tasks, considers itself a partner in the  establishment of the Libyan Movement for Change and Reform...,  but its ranks will remain open to all the sons of our heroic  people who are prepared to offer their lives and contribute on  the field for the sake of their country's cause, regardless of  their political affiliations and as long as they are committed  to the basic aims of national struggle and the army's laws,  rules, and practical programs."    It also stresses the army's commitment to "the national  character of the battle" against the Libyan regime, and its  "belief that this battle should rely entirely on national  material and human energies and capabilities inside and outside  the country and through a comprehensive plan in which all  efforts and capabilities should be united for the sake of  serving and achieving the major strategic aims of our heroic  people's struggle."    The statement also stresses "commitment to the  constitutional  legitimacy represented in the affirmation of the noble people's  right to be in charge of decisionmaking with regard to all that  concerns the system of government and to choose their own  institutions." The army's implementation of "its practical  struggle program will be parallel with the political struggle  espoused by the Libyan Movement for Change and Reform, aimed at  achieving legitimate national demands through the programs of  political and military action."    It then appeals to "all the sincere sons of the homeland who  are seeking salvation and freedom...to take a strong,  courageous, and unified stand and rise up to close ranks, unite  their efforts, and channel their energies and capabilities to  achieve the strategic national aims represented in our people's  aspiration to a life of pride, dignity, freedom, and democracy."    The statement welcomes "the joining of the army by the  honorable brothers Staff Brigadier General Salim al-Hajjaji,  Major Ahmad al-Fituri, and Captain Anwar Abu-Ghaliyah, who have  joined the army," hoping that their position will be "a blessed  start for this new phase in the march of Libyan national  struggle."</p>

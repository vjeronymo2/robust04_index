			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tripoli, 12 Feb, JANA -- The brother leader of the  revolution has made the following statement to JANA: The world  laughs from ear to ear when it hears the American President's  report to Congress to the effect that Libya represents an  extraordinary threat to the United States. The American  President himself does not believe in what he presented to the  Congress, because if Libya was like a threat, then America would  not have been able to treat it in this inhuman way, but it seems  that the American President is obliged to say this to Congress  for several reasons: First: He himself is a victim of  aggressive imperialist circles and because he is part of the  their game and is under their pressure.    Second: He thinks of America's regime as being dictatorial  in  accordance with the emergency law that allows the American  President to rule in a completely dictatorial manner if  America's interests abroad are threatened. This was the very  pretext of Reagan when he wanted to shed the blood of Libyan  children and when he wanted to rule America with absolute and  autocratic rule for eight years -- this was in fact what he  achieved.    Third: Orders may have been issued from Tel Aviv to the  White House to make the above statement, and this is the most  probable. In all cases, the American President must prove this  to the United Nations to whom Libya will necessarily have  recourse for investigations into this serious accusation. Or is  it congratulations from the American President to the Libyan  people on the occasion of Ramadan? On a personal level, it  might be a reply to the condolences that al-Qadhdhafi sent to  him following the death of his mother, although most analysts  believed that there was a typing mistake and the one intended  was Japan and not Libya.</p>

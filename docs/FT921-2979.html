			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Eaton faces a challenging drive LAST Friday, Mr Robert Eaton was extolling the long-term nature of General Motors' commitment to Hungary as he drove the first Hungarian-built car of modern times off the assembly line at GM's new car assembly plant in western Hungary. After 29 years, his own commitment to GM had only hours left to run, however. Having taken his leave of Mr Jozsef Antall, the Hungarian prime minister, Mr Eaton rapidly changed aircraft, changed scenes and changed companies. By yesterday he was in Detroit to be presented to the world as the chairman-elect of Chrysler, the smallest of the big three US car makers. The Chrysler board's choice of Mr Eaton was 'a sensational decision,' said Mr Lee Iacocca, chairman since 1979 and not a man to shrink from hyperbole. 'Bob Eaton has impeccable credentials and an incredibly successful track record at General Motors.' But Mr Eaton, who becomes vice-chairman and chief operating officer of Chrysler with immediate effect and chairman and chief executive officer from the end of the year, has seldom taken a greater risk. As president of GM Europe, Mr Eaton, 52, led probably the most profitable volume car maker in Europe last year. He is giving that up in favour of taking sole charge of a corporation which last year suffered a net loss of Dollars 795m on a turnover of Dollars 29.4bn, and whose senior management is nursing several badly-bruised egos after being overlooked in the hunt for a new chairman. Mr Eaton had the good fortune to take over as president of GM Europe when the operation was riding a wave of unprecedented financial success. For years GM had been the poor relation of Ford in Europe, racking up heavy losses. The corner was turned in 1987, however, when GM Europe jumped to a net profit of Dollars 1.3bn from a net loss of Dollars 343m a year earlier. Mr Eaton's success has been to keep GM Europe on course, and the figures have clearly not been lost on Chrysler. He became GM Europe president in mid-1988 and in the three years 1989-91, under his sole charge, the operations accumulated a total net profit of Dollars 5.5bn. To a Detroit awash in red ink, such a performance excuses Mr Iacocca's hyperbole, particularly when it has been achieved in four years when Ford of Europe has collapsed from record profits to record losses. Mr Eaton came to Europe as one of GM's most accomplished engineers and since 1982 had been vice-president of the Advanced Engineering Staff. Throughout the 1970s he was in the forefront of GM's efforts to 'down-scale' its products in response to successive oil crises, and for a period he was chief engineer for GM's small family car project at the Chevrolet Engineering Centre. In Europe, his broader management skills blossomed. He led one of the best-motivated senior management teams in the European car industry from GM's tightly-run headquarters in Zurich, and in the past three years has proved himself to be a formidable deal-maker. Caught napping by Ford in 1989 in the battle to take control of Jaguar, the UK luxury car maker, Mr Eaton turned the tables only months later by stealing Saab, the Swedish executive car maker, from under the noses of Fiat of Italy. It was also fitting that Eaton's last act for GM was to drive the first Opel Astra off the new assembly line in Hungary last Friday. He has been the architect of GM's ambitious expansion in eastern Europe with important projects in eastern Germany and Poland as well as in Hungary. He has led GM Europe's efforts to increase its capacity by 25 per cent by the mid-1990s, and has kept the company's vital new product programme on track, most recently with the launch of the new generation Opel/Vauxhall Astra. In Europe, he has undeniably enjoyed a following wind, but at Chrysler he will have to prove that he can hold the helm through much stormier conditions.</p>

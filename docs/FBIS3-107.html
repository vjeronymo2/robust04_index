The French troops are  said to have arrived at Yaounde airport base carrying light  machine guns. The troops were deployed from the Central African  Republic where they are stationed. Apart from this, a  high-level French delegation of senior diplomats and military  officials are also in Yaounde to hold discussions with Cameroon  President Paul Biya and Cameroonian authorities. The delegation  includes the head of African affairs in the French Foreign  Ministry and President Francois Mitterand's personal military  chief of staff, General Christian Quesnot. France has a defense  pact with Cameroon.    Foreign news correspondent Stephen Eshep was at the defense  headquarters in Lagos for the reaction to the latest  development. The Director of Defense Information Brigadier  General Fred Chijuka said there was no cause for alarm and that  the same French delegation now in Yaounde is expected in Nigeria  within the week.    [Begin Chijuka recording] I cannot say what is going to be  the government reaction to what they are going to discuss, but I  feel that everything is tending toward finding a peaceful  solution to what the other side considers as our incursion into  their territory whereas we are convinced that...[pauses] we are  also considering it as our territory.    Every day we have reports from that zone telling the defense  headquarters what is happening and so on. What they have got  this morning is that everywhere is calm so we will be there on  the spot. And this is what they have told us. We have no reason  to doubt it. So the general situation after that report is that  the situation is very calm. [end recording]    French officials are reported to have said that the  paratroopers would not be deployed in Bakassi. But the  (?interesting) aspect is that there is a French military  presence in Cameroon. There are speculations that the military  presence has to do with the protection of French interests and  the oil-rich peninsula. Tension has been increasing in the  peninsula since last December, when Cameroonian gendarmes  attacked villagers in the Bakassi peninsula in an attempt to  take over territory which historically belongs to Nigeria.</p>

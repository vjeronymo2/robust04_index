			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Booker changes reporting periods BOOKER, the food distribution, agribusiness and prepared foods group, is changing the reporting periods for its results. Starting in the current financial year, the group will base its figures on 13 four-weekly periods rather than 12 calendar months. Booker said the change would make no difference to its dividend policy, but would make management accounting more efficient and help the group's treasury department. Booker shares rose 1p to 482p. As a result of the accounting period change the current financial year will end on December 26, while the next year will end on January 1 1994. When interim profits are announced in September they will cover 24 weeks to June 13, rather than six months to June 30. However, an indicative pre-tax profit figure on the old basis will also be given. Booker yesterday published the 1991 interim results on the new basis. These figures will provide the comparison for the current year's interim results. In the first 24 weeks of 1991 turnover was Pounds 1.44bn, pre-interest profits were Pounds 44.3m, and pre-tax profits were Pounds 32.9m. Earnings per share were 11.56p. Mr Jonathan Taylor, chief executive, said that the change would cause some distortion as the summer period was a peak trading time for the food distribution activities. In the last two weeks of June 1991 Booker had made pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.9m on sales of Pounds 125.9m. The group also announced it was buying a fish processing complex in Grimsby from Findus, part of Nestle. Findus said it would sell the site nearly a year ago. The purchase price is not disclosed, though analysts reckoned it would be be only a few million pounds. Booker is also getting a 'substantial' grant from the Department of Trade and Industry.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / World Trade News: South Africa and EU agree on closer ties The European Union and South Africa yesterday signed a co-operation agreement, laying the foundation for closer political and economic ties and marking the conclusion of a four-day visit to South Africa by Sir Leon Brittan, the external economic relations commissioner. The agreement, which was signed in a ceremony at Pretoria by Sir Leon and Mr Thabo Mbeki, South African deputy president, is primarily concerned with boosting co-operation in trade and development, although it also deals with questions of human rights and democracy. It will also allow the European Investment Bank, which currently has Ecu300m (Pounds 236m) earmarked for South Africa, to begin lending activities in the country as well as setting the legal basis for the expansion of EU-South African economic links. Both the agreement and Sir Leon's visit testify to the growing prominence of the EU in South Africa as an institution separate from its member states. More importantly, they lay the groundwork for the negotiation of a formal trade agreement between the EU and South Africa. The EU is currently South Africa's biggest trading partner and receives more than 40 per cent of South African exports, while providing 33 per cent of the country's total imports. Two-way annual trade amounts to R63bn (Pounds 11.5bn). Although South Africa was admitted to the Generalised System of Preferences in September, there is currently a debate over whether the country should also seek accession to the Lome Agreement, which provides 69 developing countries with preferential access to EU markets, or whether it should instead draw up a separate agreement with the EU. Speaking at the signing, Mr Mbeki said he hoped that the resolution of this question could be reached as 'quickly as possible' but warned that any final deal would first require consultation with other states in the region. Sir Leon echoed these sentiments and said that he hoped that the EU also hoped to contribute to broader regional development. However, he warned that urgent action first needed to be taken by South Africa to dismantle its existing trade barriers if it wished to become an attractive market for European investment. 'Such a protectionist system (as South Africa's) makes no sense today,' he said. 'I have stressed that further liberalisation is essential for both trade and investment.' Earlier on his trip, Sir Leon announced plans to form a joint EU/South Africa Business Council to help promote business ties and trade links. Meanwhile, on the aid front, the EU has long been South Africa's largest single donor of unattached grant assistance for development, having spent R1.2bn since 1986. It plans to spend a further R440m a year on various development programmes, especially in education and health.</p>

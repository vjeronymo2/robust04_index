			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich has substantially  left behind his contenders in the presidential marathon.    According to preliminary data of the Central election  committee as of Thursday morning (the information was received  after the verification of the ballot papers with the signatures  of the republic's citizens in support of this or that candidate  to the presidency in the regional and city electoral commissions  and annulment of signatures recognized invalid), it appeared  that about 364,000 citizens of the republic have nominated  Vyacheslav Kebich. (The minimum number needed for the contenders  to be registered in the Central election committee as an  official candidate to the presidency is 100,000 - Interfax).    In addition, the constitutional majority of the parliament,  236 people's deputies under the necessary minimum equal to 70  votes, are in favor of Kebich's promotion.    Leader of the opposition Belarussian Popular Front Zenon  Poznyak occupies the second place. His initiative group has  collected as many as 215,000 signatures.    Vasiliy Novikov, who was nominated by the Party of Belarus'  communists, is on the third place with 180,000 signatures.  Leader of the former parliamentary commission to combat  corruption Aleksandr Lukashenko who has managed to collect  152,000 signatures follows Novikov.    Ex-speaker of the Supreme Soviet Stanislav Shushkevich  occupies the fifth place in the list of contenders (as many as  122,000 signatures). Representative of the Agrarian party  Aleksandr Dubko is not far behind (113,000 signatures).    The team of the chairman of the Party of Popular Accord  Gennadiy Karpenko handed over 109,000 signatures to the  electoral commissions. However, after invalid ballot papers  were annulled there remained only 86,000 votes; that's why he  has no juridical right to continue the struggle for presidency.  Karpenko's hopes to become the parliamentarians' nominee failed  as well. Though he managed to collect signatures of 78  deputies, on Wednesday as many as 11 of them, predominantly  representatives of the Social Democratic party, unexpectedly  recalled their signatures. IF Note: During his conversation  with our Interfax correspondent leader of the Belarussian  social-democrats Oleg Trusov who heads the initiative group of  the ex-speaker explained this behavior of his single minded  deputies by the revenge for the "gentlemen agreement" between  the candidates representing the right-wing forces not to  interfere with signatures collection which was allegedly  violated by Karpenko. In Trusov's words, Karpenko managed "to  appropriate" several thousands of signatures collected in  support of Shushkevich.    Belarus' Central Elections Commission reported to Interfax  that the final results of signatures' collection for the  promotion of the candidates to the presidency would become  public in the evening of May 27.</p>

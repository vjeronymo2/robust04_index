The purpose of this second stage is to  sign the peace agreements.    Ruiz has been in the headlines because of the death threats  he has received and the demands of certain San Cristobal de las  Casas conservative groups' that Ruiz leave the San Cristobal de  las Casas diocese. Ruiz said the meetings with the EZLN rank and  file are in depth and serious. If this is so, the delegates  would return in two weeks and the beginning of the talks would  be announced 24 hours beforehand.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public Law 103&hyph;208 also amended section 435(m)(1)(A) of the HEA to provide, effective October 1, 1994, that institutions will have an opportunity to review and correct errors in the information provided by the guaranty agencies to the Secretary for use in calculating cohort default rates. These regulations add paragraph (h) to &sect;668.17 to establish procedures for this review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the regulations, the Secretary will provide each institution which has a draft default rate equal to or in excess of 20 percent with a copy of the records provided by each guaranty agency in regard to loans made to borrowers for attendance at the institution which were insured by that guaranty agency. Institutions with draft default rates under 20 percent may request copies of the records. These records will be accompanied by a notice indicating the institution's draft default rate. This draft default rate will not be considered a final agency decision and will not be otherwise voluntarily released by the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After receiving the information from the Secretary, the institution will have 30 calendar days to review the information and notify, in writing, the appropriate guaranty agency of any information included in the cohort default rate which it believes is incorrect. The institution should also send the agency any evidence which it believes supports its contention that the information provided by the guaranty agency to the Secretary is inaccurate. The guaranty agency shall review the institution's challenge and respond within 30 calendar days. If the guaranty agency agrees with the institution, the information used to calculate the cohort default rate will be adjusted prior to the release of the official cohort default rates. If the guaranty agency does not confirm the error alleged by the institution, the institution may use the data provided by the guaranty agency as part of an appeal of the calculation of the default rate based on the allegedly erroneous data after the rates are released.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary intends to continue his practice of allowing institutions with a cohort default rate equal to or in excess of 20 percent for the most recent year for which rates have been calculated to challenge the calculation of the rate based on allegations that erroneous data were included in the calculation. However, all institutions must satisfy the time deadlines for filing challenges under the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that section 435 only provides an opportunity for the institution to review and correct errors in the information provided to the Secretary by the guaranty agency. The statute does not contemplate that all allegations of error will be resolved prior to release of the final default rates. The regulations, therefore, allow an institution to appeal the calculation of a cohort default rate based solely on allegations of erroneous data. However, to ensure that appeals can be decided on a timely basis, the regulations provide that an institution can only base an appeal on allegations that were raised to the guaranty agency during the review of the draft cohort default rate. The Secretary believes that this process will benefit the institutions, guaranty agencies and the public by shortening delays that have been experienced in the appeal process and will result in more timely decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Effect on Pending Default Rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary received a number of comments regarding the effect of the changes to section 435(a)(3) and (m) on the current official cohort default rates. As the Secretary noted in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice, Public Law 103&hyph;208 does not specifically provide for reopening prior final determinations. However, the Secretary has been convinced by the commenters to allow institutions to challenge their current cohort default rates on the basis of allegations of improper loan servicing or collection. Accordingly, the regulation allows institutions identified in section 435(a)(3) of the HEA to file an appeal of the current cohort default rates based on allegations of improper loan servicing. Thus, institutions with cohort default rates equal to or in excess of 20 percent for fiscal year 1991 (including institutions subject to the loss of SLS participation based on a fiscal year 1991 cohort default rate in excess of 30 percent) may challenge the 1991 cohort default rate. Similarly, institutions which are subject to the loss of FFEL program participation based on cohort default rates for fiscal years 1989, 1990 and 1991 may challenge those rates. The regulation specifies that the time limits for challenging these rates will begin on the date that the regulations become effective. The Secretary intends to notify institutions of the effective date of these regulations once that date is determined. The prior default rates will be considered effective until the appeal process is completed and a new rate issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary notes that cohort default rates for fiscal year 1992 will be issued during the summer of 1994. Institutions which are interested in challenging their current cohort default rates may want to wait until after the new rates are issued. An institution with a cohort default rate in excess of one of the threshold levels for fiscal year 1991 may find that its fiscal year 1992 cohort default rate is below the threshold and that the institution is no longer subject to sanctions based on excessive cohort default rates. Thus, an institution may want to consider whether filing a challenge of the current default rates is worth the time, expense and resources needed to prepare and submit an appeal of a rate that may soon be irrelevant. The Secretary also notes that the regulations provide that once an institution has challenged a cohort default rate for a particular year and received a final decision from the Secretary, that decision is binding in any future challenge to the default rate filed by the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Comments and Responses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenters provided a number of different definitions of the term ``improper servicing or collection'' of a loan. A number of respondents to the request for comments suggested that the Secretary should remove from the calculation of the cohort default rate any loan that was not serviced in strict compliance with the Department's due diligence requirements in 34 CFR 682.411. Some commenters suggested that a loan on which a default claim has been paid should be considered properly serviced or collected on the grounds that a claim would not have been paid if servicing was not proper. Other commenters suggested that the Secretary should consider a lender's failure to grant a deferment to be improper loan servicing or collection. Some commenters also suggested that guaranty agency collection efforts should be considered in evaluating whether improper servicing or collection has occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary's view of the satutory term ``improper servicing or collection'' is discussed earlier in this document. The Secretary does not agree with the suggestion that Congress intended to establish a new standard for proper servicing or collection. Instead, the Secretary believes it is appropriate to rely on the concepts and requirements developed and applied by the Department over the years. The requirements in &sect;682.411 are designed to ensure that lenders and guaranty agencies that are requesting Federal benefits meet certain standards in collection as a requirement for receiving those benefits. These requirements have never been intended to set forth standards which if not followed in their entirety provide an excuse for borrowers to refuse to repay their loans. Similarly, they are not intended to provide protection for institutions that fail to meet the statutory requirements for continued participation in the loan programs. Congress has determined that the institutions bear a significant responsibility for defaults in the FFEL program. The Secretary does not believe that a lender's failure to strictly satisfy the requirements for Federal benefits should excuse the institution from the statutory consequences of its high default rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Decision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The applicant has requested from OSHA a variance from the provisions of 29 CFR 1910.106(b)(2)(viii)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> f <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). This standard requires that filling and emptying connections that are made and broken during the transfer of combustible/flammable liquids shall be located outside the buildings at a location free from any source of ignition and not less than 5 feet away from any building opening. Such connection shall be closed and liquid-tight when not in use. The connection shall be properly identified. This standard assures worker safety by preventing fires and explosions that may occur during transfer operations involving combustible/flammable liquids. This purpose is accomplished by: Providing sufficient ventilation at combustible/flammable liquid transfer sites to prevent concentrations of vapor-air mixtures (resulting from spilled liquids) from exceeding one-fourth of the lower flammable limit defined under 29 CFR 1910.106(a)(31); and prohibiting sources at the transfer sites that could ignite these vapor-air mixtures. Due to a conflict between the OSHA and EPA standards, as discussed above under section II, the applicant's filling and emptying connections are made and broken inside the building compared to outside the building as required under the OSHA standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assure maximum employee protection during flushing and draining operations, the applicant has implemented specific procedures to assure that the above OSHA standard will be met or exceeded. These procedures include: Providing supervision of employees during the transfer of PCBs or ignitable materials; inspecting draining and flushing areas daily to assure that ignition sources are not present; forbidding waste-handling operations that may generate sources of ignitions from occurring when hot work permits are issued for repairs; prohibiting smoking in the process building; providing a large-capacity fan and several roof-mounted turbine vents to prevent the accumulation of diesel fuel vapors inside the building; securing and grounding transportation vehicles to prevent movement and potential static discharge; minimizing, containing, and expeditiously removing any PCB ignitable liquids spills; continuously inspecting drums, hoses, and connections; wearing appropriate protective clothing and respirators when controlling liquid spills; and training general employees and inhouse fire brigade personnel in pertinent emergency procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA has determined that the applicant, by using the above-mentioned operational procedures and engineering techniques, will provide employment and a place of employment as safe and healthful as required under 29 CFR 1910.106(b)(2)(viii)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> f <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in preventing the accumulation of hazardous vapors generated from combustible/flammable liquids used in its processing operations, and controlling ignition sources at the transfer sites. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, in the event of a fire or an explosion, every employee at the facility can notify the Emergency Coordinator by either the internal telephone system or a two-way radio. Upon notification of a fire or explosion, the Emergency Coordinator manually activates the appropriate alarms. All employees, except trained fire brigade members, are evacuated. This emergency training program conforms with OSHA's policy to allow fire brigades under conditions in which training, organization, and planning are adequate to assure employee safety and health. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the basis of the variance application and supporting data, OSHA has determined that the specific safety procedures used by the applicant during the draining and flushing operations will provide employee protection equal to, or better than, the level of protection required under 29 CFR 1910.106(b)(2)(viii)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> f <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Therefore, based on the record discussed above, OSHA finds that compliance with the terms of the Order set out below will provide employment, and a place of employment, that are as safe and healthful as would be provided if the applicant complied with 29 CFR 1910.106(b)(2)(viii)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> f <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Order <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 6(d) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the Secretary of Labor's Order No. 1&hyph;90 (55 FR 9033), and 29 CFR part 1905, it is ordered that Envirosafe Services, Inc., is authorized to implement the following conditions in lieu of complying with the provisions in 29 CFR 19(b)(2)(viii)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> f <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

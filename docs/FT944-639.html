			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (UK Equities - Winners and Losers): Famine follows a market feast - It has been hard to avoid losing money this year. David Wighton looks at some sectors that bucked the trend After three years of plenty came the famine. Between the beginning of 1991 and the end of 1993, UK share prices rose by more than 60 per cent. It was hard not to make money in the stock market. In 1994, it was hard not to lose it. Even those shares that did well showed dramatically lower gains than in the previous year. In 1993, four members of the FT-SE 100 index more than doubled. In 1994, only one rose by more than 20 per cent. The fate of particular sectors also contrasted sharply with 1993, reflecting the (for the UK) unusual character of the economic recovery. While industrial profits have risen sharply, companies closest to the consumer have struggled, particularly those related to the still stagnant housing market. So, general retailers and building merchants languished, while engineers and paper and packaging companies did much better. The strong showing of the latter sector illustrated the importance of another of the year's trends - rising prices for raw materials. Many manufacturing companies saw such costs increase alarmingly but had difficulty raising their own prices in the new, low-inflation world. As a result, many had their margins squeezed. But paper and packaging companies - including Bowater, the sector's largest constituent - managed to pass on most of the increased costs to their customers. De La Rue, the bank-note printer, also had a good year and gave the sector another boost before Christmas with its bid for Portals, which makes paper for the notes. Portals' shares took the top spot in the FT-SE Mid-250 index (the companies ranked from 101 to 350 in terms of stock market value). One of the companies responsible for other manufacturers' higher raw material costs is British Steel, which is surging back into profit helped by a string of price increases. Metal ore prices also rose, pushing the mineral extraction sector up the table. The oil price improved over the year, too, helping the exploration and production companies, while the integrated companies like BP also saw recovery in their chemicals operations. BP capped a good year by regaining its position as the UK's most valuable company. While British Steel's top placing represents the continuation of a strong run - it was the Footsie number two last year - others have seen a sharp reversal in fortunes. In 1993, shares in leading supermarket chains tumbled on fears of an escalating price war. But Sainsbury and Tesco seem to have held off the discounters' assault this year and the shares have staged a strong comeback. Tesco, which was six from bottom in the Footsie in 1993, is fifth from the top this year, with Asda fourth. The pharmaceuticals companies also had a much better year, with SmithKline Beecham enjoying a particularly good run. Passing them on the way down were the commercial property companies, which won prizes in 1993 but languished near the bottom of the class this year. Another fallen star is HSBC (the Hongkong and Midland Bank group) which, on top of the general fall in world bond markets, has been hit by the slump in the Hong Kong stock market. So, too, has Cable &amp; Wireless, which gets the bulk of its profits from its stake in Hongkong Telecom; while C&amp;W's Mercury subsidiary has seen profits dip due to competition from BT and other new entrants into the UK telecom market. Given the sharply higher profits being reported by UK insurance companies, the poor performance of their shares might seem odd. Both Guardian Royal Exchange and General Accident were in the last 10 of the Footsie, and the sector was second from bottom. As usual, the stock market is looking ahead. Investors in the sector are worried about the impact of low-cost direct insurance operators on the established companies, while life and pensions business is expected to be hit by regulatory changes. At the same time, the companies' investment returns will be hit by lower share and bond prices. Shares in BAT Industries, which constitute the bulk of the tobacco sector, were affected because of the group's insurance companies as well as the regulatory and legal threats to its US tobacco business. But the regional electricity companies had another good year thanks to a friendly regulatory review of Trafalgar House's bid for Northern Electric. Eastern took the sixth spot in the Footsie.</p>

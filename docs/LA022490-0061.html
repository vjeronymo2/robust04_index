			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CUSTODY CASE CHILD IS SAID FOUND SAFE IN NEW ZEALAND  </P> <P> Seven-year-old Hilary Foretich, whose mother spent more than two years in jail  rather than let her visit her father, reportedly has been found safe in the  custody of her maternal grandparents in New Zealand.  </P> <P> The daughter of Dr. Elizabeth Morgan was found at a motel in Christchurch with  her grandparents, WRC-TV reported Friday.  </P> <P> District of Columbia police spokesman Quintin Peterson said police were  attempting to confirm that the girl was in New Zealand.  </P> <P> But Sgt. Russell Hawks, a detective investigating the case in New Zealand, said  she had been living in the city "for some time."  </P> <P> "She's fine, in a healthy state, no problems there at all," Hawks said in an  interview.  </P> <P> Another police official told the Associated Press that the case was already  before a family-court judge and that the girl was in the custody of the  grandparents. He declined to be specific about the case, and would not confirm  that the girl in question was Hilary.  </P> <P> Morgan and Foretich were not immediately available for comment. Hilary's  court-appointed guardian, Linda Holman, and one of Morgan's attorneys, Adrian  Roe, had no comment.  </P> <P> Morgan spent 25 months in jail for civil contempt of court rather than disclose  the girl's whereabouts. She maintained that Hilary's father, Dr. Eric Foretich,  had sexually abused the girl, and she refused to give him court-ordered  visitation rights. Foretich has denied abusing the child.  </P> <P> Morgan was released from jail in September after President Bush signed a law  limiting civil contempt in District of Columbia child-abuse cases to 12 months.  </P> <P> A reporter for Radio New Zealand, Jill Gallop, told the television station that  police had confirmed that Hilary and her grandparents, Morgan's parents, have  been in Christchurch for three years. The grandparents last year sought  permission to live in New Zealand permanently, she said.  </P> <P> The girl's identity was revealed when New Zealand authorities checked with U.S.  officials to determine if there were any outstanding court orders pertaining to  the child, Gallop said.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for a Morgan support group said the group was upset that Hilary  had been found.  </P> <P> "We hope New Zealand will give her sanctuary," said Alice Monroe of the Friends  of Elizabeth Morgan. "There's no reason for her to be sent back here."  </P> <P> Morgan has vowed that she would go without seeing her daughter until the girl  turned 18, if necessary to protect her.  </P> <P> Foretich has created a fund and appealed for donations to pay for efforts to  search for his daughter. He said the costs of his legal battle with Morgan and  fees charged by previous private investigators have left him financially  strapped.  </P></p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (13): The choice is wide but value varies - Life assurance LIFE ASSURANCE is a misnomer. A more accurate description might be 'death insurance'. In its simplest form, family breadwinners buy an insurance policy, paying premiums in the same way as for more general insurance. It protects dependants from the financial consequences of losing their breadwinner. But the life industry has sprawled beyond this, and now accounts for the lion's share of Britain's long-term savings. The reasons for this are historical. Unlike general insurance, life insurers do not need to worry about 'moral hazard' - there is rarely much dispute over whether someone has indeed died - and mortality tables allow them to plan their commitments with a strong degree of certainty. Thus, life funds were soon able to move into more ambitious investments. They made profits. Then they started returning the profits to investors. Hence the 'with-profits' policy. So 'life insurance' now includes a number of products that are competitive as investments, but do not offer good value life cover in themselves (see Q for Qualifying endowment policy, and S for Single-premium investment bonds). The remaining products in the life companies' arsenal make sense for those who merely want to protect their families. They come in two variants: Term assurance insures your life for a fixed period. If you die before that period has elapsed, your family receives the pay-out. If you live out the term, the company keeps all your premiums. (Endowments are conceptually similar to term assurance, but guarantee a payment at the end of the term, even if the policyholder has survived. They should not be regarded as protection policies, but mainly as investments.) Whole-of-life assurance, as its name implies, offers a pay-out throughout your life. Even if you live to be 100, the insurance company will pay out when you die. Which of the two protection policies will make the most sense? As ever with insurance, a lot depends on you. If you have cash-flow difficulties at the time you first have children, it makes sense to go for the cheapest option, even though this could work out more expensive in the long run. If not, then it might be better to aim for the longer term. But one principle is definite - use an independent broker, preferably one who charges fees or at least splits commission. Different insurers choose to aim for business from specific groups. Thus, the company with the 'best buy' for a 29-year-old man may not provide the best value for a 39-year-old woman. Some may make flexible versions of their contracts particularly attractive. So generalisations about which offices offer the best and worst value are impossible. But if you go to a tied agent, you will be limited to one company, which may not offer a competitive deal for someone like you. An independent adviser can shop around for the best rate to suit your requirements. A lot depends on your attitude to undergoing a medical examination. Some companies will set a maximum level for the cover you can receive without submitting to a medical, although this is often very high - Pounds 200,000 or more. Other medical criteria can vary - smokers, for example, are unlikely to get good value from a company which offers a discount to non-smokers. Much has been changed by Aids, which has smashed through many actuarial assumptions on mortality rates. While the chance of a full-blown Aids epidemic among the UK's younger population remains, life insurance deals will probably remain more expensive, and less flexible, than they were. Aids has effectively finished off some of the better-value ways to take out cheap term assurance. However, term assurance is always the cheaper option. When you have children, it is often good value to take out insurance on a 'joint life, first death' basis - in other words, it pays out after the first partner of the couple dies. The premiums for term assurance depend on your age when you start the policy, and the length of the term - the older you are and the longer the term, the more you pay. You can thus save money by starting with a short term, such as five years. This will be very cheap. But be warned. If, during the five years, you have a heart attack or anything else which would show up on the standard questionnaire and render you uninsurable, you would not be able to buy a further term. Another term would, in any case, be more expensive, because you would be older. This leads to a number of complex contracts, which begin to merge term assurance with whole-of-life: Renewable term guarantees that you can re-insure yourself at the end of the first term, even if you have fallen seriously ill in the meantime. You would still have to pay a higher premium on the second term, based on your age. Convertible term is the same, but also allows you to convert to a whole-of-life policy, even if you have fallen ill. Increasing term allows you to increase the amount of cover automatically during the term. You can short-circuit the problem of reinsuring yourself by buying a whole-of-life policy. This also carries the benefit that you can receive a 'surrender value' - in other words, if you decide you do not want to continue the policy at some point, you will receive some money back. Many policies allow you to link a whole-of-life policy to a choice of funds. Whole-of-life policies do not stand up as investments in their own right. But the ability to derive a surrender value, once you have no dependants and no need for life insurance, does go a long way towards justifying the extra cost when you start the policy. There can be no hard or fast rules - if you are strapped for cash, look at one of the renewable or convertible term policies; or if you are confident you can afford it, a whole-of-life policy. Whatever you do, go to a broker. You might also want to look at a new breed of policies. Changing demographics have forced life offices to offer protection against contracting a serious illness and surviving it, or living into an over-lengthy retirement. This has led to critical-illness and long-term care policies (see H for health insurance). Some offer good value and others do not. But they have not rendered basic life protection obsolete. Term insurance is cheaper than it was, and if you have children, or have taken out a mortgage, it would be the gravest folly not to buy cover.</p>

			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Clash over threat to French gold mine Miners clashed with riot police in southern France yesterday over the possible closure of western Europe's last gold mine, Reuter reports from Toulouse. Officials in Carcassonne said at least 100 miners, angered by plans to close the troubled Salsigne gold mine, dumped stones in front of the regional government headquarters. Fighting broke out when a miner charged his lorry into police guarding the building, slightly injuring two officers.</p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A woman who was attacked after telling police she could identify the men  allegedly hired by the Rev. Jesse Jackson's half-brother, Noah Robinson, to  kill an associate recanted on the witness stand. Denise Rosemond, who testified  as a defense witness, said she cannot identify the men who gunned down Leroy  (Hambone) Barber in 1986 in Greenville, S.C. Robinson is charged with hiring a  Chicago street gang to kill Barber, a longtime acquaintance. Rosemond, who  witnessed the killing, originally identified the men for police in Greenville,  and testified about the shooting before a grand jury in Chicago. Rosemond has  testified that she was later attacked by gang member Freddie Sweeney, who said  that he was hired by Robinson to kill Rosemond to keep her quiet.  </P></p>

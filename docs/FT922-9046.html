			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Books: Citizens in uniform THE CHIEFS: THE STORY OF THE UK CHIEFS OF STAFF by General Sir William Jackson and Field Marshal Lord Bramall Brassey's Pounds 30, 508 pages THE PROCESSES of deterring or waging war by industrialised democratic states require that those charged with the execution of operations by armed forces have a clearly defined subordination to elected governments. The alternative is military dictatorship or the evolution of a state within a state, of which von Moltke's 'Great German General Staff' provides the best-known example. The authors are right to devote a third of the text to narrating, in considerable but necessary detail, why the period from the late 1880s to the outbreak of war in 1914 was one in which Conservative and Liberal governments, agreed on the necessity for creating a workable defence organisation in the face of increased armaments by prospective enemies, were also united on the necessity to keep the admirals and generals in their place. British governments during this period did succeed in attaining their objective - thus giving all successors clear constitutional guidelines  - but Britain being, in Campbell-Bannerman's apt phrase 'a fighting but not a military nation', they failed to grasp that bureaucratic reform, whereby the Admiralty and War Office did establish some semblance of co-operation, was not the same as thinking hard about strategic issues. The establishment of the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1904 was a step in the right direction, but failed to provide governments and the armed forces with the logical corollary to strategic thought, namely a staff structure which would plan for deterrence or war, on a national, not an individual Service, basis. The price for ensuring that the British sailor or soldier remained merely 'a citizen in uniform' was demonstrably one which British democracy had to pay, but the cost of subordinating strategy and the means of implementing it to administrative reform was high. The authors, having thus cleared the ground, put us further in their debt by tracing the course of successive changes from 1914 to the present day: a Cabinet Secretariat; the establishment of the Chiefs of Staff Sub Committee of the CID in 1923 - but lacking an effective intelligence and planning element until the 1930s; the evolution of a Ministry of Defence from the second world war onwards; the rather crab-like course pursued by successive Chiefs of Staff since 1945, whereby the Chief of the Defence Staff has gradually become the focus of strategic thought, tri-service planning, and the execution of operations in war, not their delegation to commanders in the theatre. The authors' commentary and their candidly expressed opinions really come to a sustained critique of a central element in modern British history: adhesion to imperial commitment, aversion from the Continental commitment. The Falklands war in 1982 and the Gulf war in 1991 must be seen as a very late flowering of imperialism, and however much one says that neither conflict has any lessons for the future, and that Britains's primary strategic role must remain in Europe, the authors clearly think otherwise. There is merit in their arguments that 'out of area' crises and conflicts are not only likely but will make demands on Britain's armed forces, but there is a touch of casuistry in the supposition that if Britain had always pursued an imperial (or strictly speaking maritime ) strategy and eschewed the Continental commitment much British blood and treasure might well have been spared. For which the answer would seem to be: two world wars might have been prevented if Britain had honoured the Continental commitment in time. But the Chiefs of Staff were not only 'terrified' of such a commitment in the 1930s, whether in relation to France or Russia (the word is that of an official historian, not this reviewer); their predecessors before 1914 were united in hostility to Haldane's concept of a British Expeditionary Force. The authors, in narrating the Falklands war from the inside, do, in a sense, have the last word. What does emerge from their account is that the "War Cabinet" was notably more belligerent in public than in Downing Street, and that the resolution of the "Chiefs" was certainly needed at critical moments. The Falklands war was not made by the Brass Hats, but the Frocks certainly had cause for gratitude in that they ran it with both skill and imagination. The Chiefs remained citizens in uniform, just.</p>

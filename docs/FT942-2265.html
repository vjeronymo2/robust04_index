			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Electricity in Europe (2): Sparks fly in a high voltage business - Andrew Baxter examines the international battle to equip Europe's power stations One of the biggest controversies in the electrical industry over recent years has been generated by the European Union's Utilities Directive, which came into force at the beginning of last year and requires utilities to use open, competitive, purchasing procedures for their equipment and services. The directive sparked a big row between the EU and the US, because of its Article 29 which said a purchaser may reject any bid that contains less than 50 per cent of the total value sourced from within the EU, and that, where there is no more than a 3 per cent difference between the price of an EU and a non-EU bid, the non-EU bid must be rejected. Amid allegations that the EU was trying to build a 'Fortress Europe,' the controversy was finally defused in April last year when it was agreed that, for the electrical sector at least, Article 29 would not be applied for works and services contracts. In return, EU companies would be exempt from the Buy American Act when tendering for works and supply contracts from US public utilities. But the controversy does not end there. The broader question is whether the directive will even achieve its aim of ensuring that consumers will benefit from lower costs, through the application of competitive contracting under which the lowest cost supplier wins. The Commission has long believed that the tendency of public agencies in the EU to buy equipment and services from domestic suppliers meant that costs were higher than if contracts had been allocated on the basis of full and fair international competition. Hence the Utilities Directive, which covers equipment supply and works contracts for electricity - although not the supply of energy or fuels for energy - and requires any contract over Ecu400,000 for equipment and Ecu5m for works to comply with a series of conditions that allow for the maximum degree of competition. Broadly, there are three types of procedure permitted: open, restricted and negotiated. The directive also covers water, gas, heat and transportation services in the EU and is aimed at both public and private companies which meet the criterion of public supply. However, a report earlier this year by researchers at Sussex University's Science Policy Research Unit suggests that, at least for electrical transmission and distribution equipment, the directive could be counter-productive and may even lead to higher equipment prices. According to the authors, Mr Steve Thomas and Mr Francis McGowan, the directive appears to be designed to overcome two particular pressures, for utilities to favour national suppliers - whether in response to their government's industrial policy or their own national chauvinism - and for utilities to enter long-term arrangements with suppliers to minimise their administrative burden even when such arrangements are not in the interests of consumers. But, they say, 'while there probably still remain vestiges of the practices, which when viewed through today's perceptions of the need for free trade and competitive bidding appear unacceptable, the line between non-competitive procedures and sensible long-term strategies is often a fine one.' For example, what might be seen as national chauvinism in procurement might actually be a sensible policy of ensuring that the equipment supplier is close at hand to provide back-up in the event of technical problems. And what might be seen as wasteful procurement by not placing orders exclusively with the most economically attractive supplier could be a far-sighted policy which ensures a competitive industry is maintained for the long-term. So measures that ensure that unacceptable practices cannot be continued run a risk of proscribing policies which are in the long-term interest of utility customers. Most of the leading equipment suppliers, after all, are multinational in character and are therefore much less likely to receive support from national governments. Also, the electric utility sector is in the middle of important restructuring with the emphasis on allowing the forces of competition to be brought to bear on it, so that it functions efficiently. In addition, there has been considerable progress in adopting common standards in Europe which will allow suppliers more easily to compete in all markets. The authors point out that by making it more difficult for utilities to enter into long-term agreements with suppliers to develop and purchase new designs of equipment, it may be harder for them to stimulate the market to produce the equipment with the necessary performance characteristics. It also runs counter to the modern trend in supplier-customer relationships in industry, where old-style adversarial relationships are giving way to partnering and long-term co-operative agreements. In the equipment supply industry, meanwhile, the process of rationalisation over the past two decades has been promoted strongly by the European Commission, but does bring dangers with it, according to the authors. The presence of three large European companies in the electrical equipment sector - Asea Brown Boveri, GEC Alsthom and Siemens - ought to ensure a competitive market, they say. But if the market size is such that all three can be comfortably supported, the pressure on suppliers to beat their competitors might not be very strong. In addition, they say, it is not hard to imagine circumstances in which the field could shrink to two with the second tier of suppliers offering little extra competition. 'While the old nationally-based structure tended to produce overcapacity, the removal of national protection, together with the high barriers to entry and the cyclical nature of demand mean that the new multinational structure will tend to produce too small a supply network. Thus, any assumption that the market will behave competitively without strong prompting must be questioned,' they say. In transmission and distribution equipment, they contend, there are few suppliers outside Europe which could be used to maintain competitive pressure. GE and Westinghouse are big players in power generating equipment  -turbines and generators - but no longer supply the biggest items of transmission and distribution equipment. The Japanese companies - Mitsubishi, Toshiba and Hitachi - appear not to have made any 'concerted effort so far to penetrate European markets.' Overall, say the authors, the Commission's initiative on procurement may not have paid sufficient attention to the actual structure of the market and the nature of the relationship between the supplier and purchaser of equipment. 'Given the dangerously concentrated nature of the equipment supply industry, a much greater threat to the economic welfare of consumers may be posed by the non-competitive forces in the equipment supply industry than is posed by the policies of the electricity supply industry.'

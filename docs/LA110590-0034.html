			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> LONDON CLASSICAL PLAYERS MAKE SOUTHLAND DEBUT  </P> <P> The Orange County Philharmonic Society had the good fortune to host the  Southland debut on Saturday of the hugely successful, controversial London  Classical Players under conductor Roger Norrington.  </P> <P> Norrington &amp; Co. are part of a movement dedicated to respecting long-dead  composers' presumed intentions by scraping obfuscating interpretive overlay  from their scores.  </P> <P> With this particular ensemble there is a difference: Its hackle-raising  specialty is taking popular 19th-Century repertory -- on Saturday by Beethoven,  Schubert and Mendelssohn -- rather than the relative esoterica of the Baroque  and Classical eras and subjecting it to thorough cleansing.  </P> <P> Apparent in the welcoming acoustic of the Orange County Performing Arts Center  was that the Classical Players sound is less alien live than on recordings.  Such elements as the (on disc) overbearing shotgun blasts of the old timpani,  played with hard sticks, retain their impact in the hall but are better  integrated with the ensemble, while the gut strings sound less pinched, more  sweetly plaintive, and the brass less raucous.  </P> <P> Balances are just, but instrumental choirs retain their individual timbres and  the light-toned solo winds sound clearly in Norrington's well-thought-out  seating arrangement: horns and trumpets (valveless, of course) on opposite  edges of the stage, basses divided in half over a similar span, winds at top  center, first violins to his left, seconds to his right.  </P> <P> The amount of orchestral detail heard in Mendelssohn's once-familiar-in-concert  and, as was proven Saturday, still-ravishing "Scottish" Symphony was startling.  Here, too, Norrington blasted the canard that he is a compulsive speedster. The  slow movement sang gently, elegantly, the vibratoless strings' quick attack and  release maintaining the lyric line where usually their sound hangs endlessly in  the air, obscuring pitch and impeding momentum.  </P> <P> Earlier, Norrington and his crew fleetly dispatched Schubert's Fourth Symphony  ("Tragic"), attentive not to the Romantic images conjured up by the nickname or  imagined Beethoven associations, but rather to the outer movements' ancestry in  Sturm und Drang Haydn.

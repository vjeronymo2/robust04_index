			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Guns wait on the war of words: Robert Mauthner on who is going to give the orders over Bosnia If the Bosnian Serbs are not rushing to comply with Nato's ultimatum giving them 10 days to withdraw their heavy weapons 20km (12 miles) from the centre of Sarajevo or place them under UN control, failing which they will face air strikes, that is hardly surprising. The confusion created by the contradictory statements of Nato and United Nations spokesmen about who, in the last resort, is responsible for ordering these air strikes has given the Bosnian Serbs a heaven-sent opportunity to stall and pin their hopes on yet another international fudge. General Sir Michael Rose, commander of UN troops in Bosnia, has said, somewhat imprudently, that the responsibility for launching air strikes is his - as if such a crucial decision could ever be taken by a military man alone without the express consent of his political masters. By contrast, large Nato countries such as the US and France have indicated clearly that, if the Bosnian Serbs fail to comply with the terms of the ultimatum by the deadline next Monday, then air strikes will definitely go ahead. It seems almost as if the various parties have paid scant notice over the past few days to the relevant texts on which the UN's and Nato's policy has been based. From these texts it is clear that the Nato decision 'to prepare urgently' for air strikes was taken on February 10 at the express request of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general. In a letter to Mr Manfred Worner, the Nato secretary-general, Mr Boutros Ghali referred specifically to Security Council Resolution 836, under which '. . . . member states, acting nationally or through regional organisations or arrangements, may take under the authority of the Security Council and subject to close co-ordination with the Secretary-General and Unprofor (the UN protection force in former Yugoslavia), all necessary measures, through the use of air power, in and around the safe areas in Bosnia-Hercegovina, to support Unprofor in the performance of its mandate. . . .' Mr Boutros Ghali goes on: 'I should be grateful if you could take action to obtain, at the earliest possible date, a decision by the North Atlantic Council to authorise the commander-in-chief of Nato's southern command to launch air strikes, at the request of the United Nations, against artillery or mortar positions in or around Sarajevo. . . .' The arrangements for the co-ordination of such air strikes would be worked out through direct contacts between Unprofor headquarters and Nato's southern command. It appears very much as if the UN secretary-general was making a distinction between a decision by Nato to authorise air strikes and a joint UN/Nato decision to implement them. No mention of a deadline in Mr Boutros Ghali's letter, as there is in the subsequent Nato ultimatum. Moreover, the communique issued after the North Atlantic Council meeting also specifically mentions that the launching of Nato air strikes would take place at the request of the United Nations. Formally therefore, the decision to launch the bombing of Bosnian Serb positions, lies with the UN. However, the dispute about who has the ultimate authority to launch the air strikes would be of less import if the UN and Nato were pulling in the same direction on the ground. But there are increasing signs that this is not the case. Only two days ago, the Unprofor spokesman in Sarajevo, Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman was quoted as saying: 'The 10-day ultimatum is a Nato ultimatum. It is not our ultimatum.' Taking advantage of the uncertainties in the western camp, The Bosnian Serbs maintain that what matters is not where the guns are located or under whose control they are, but whether they are being fired or not - in other words that the ceasefire negotiated last week by the warring parties under the aegis of the UN is respected. The UN and Nato still have a few days to sort out their disagreements and to persuade the Bosnian Serbs that they must comply with their demands, or face dire consequences. But it is difficult to see how Nato, after all its posturing, can make compromises and go back on its threats without losing all credibility.</p>

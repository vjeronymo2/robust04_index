			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Russian budget is passed as economic fears grow The Russian parliament last night passed the 1995 budget against a background of increasing difficulty for economic policy and growing doubts among international financial institutions expected to provide assistance. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the first deputy prime minister, said the passing of the budget in the lower house - after 14 attempts in three days of voting - 'strengthens the overall stability of the country, which is very important in the context of a nervous social and political situation of the last few days'. Mr Sergei Alexashenko, deputy finance minister, welcomed the vote - by 230 to 127 - but said the main battles would be fought next month around the precise spending and revenue items when deputies put forward amendments to the draft. The budget foresees a deficit of 7.7 per cent of gross national product, and predicts an average monthly inflation rate of 2.5-3 per cent. Inflation last month was 14 per cent. The Duma agreed to provide Rbs18,000bn from central bank funds to cover expenditure in the first quarter of 1995, when income is small. This appears to contradict an earlier decision not to use bank funds to cover the deficit. However, two large issues loom over the budget strategy, which depends on almost Dollars 13bn from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Neither institution is willing to grant the aid until the issues are settled. The first, according to a senior finance official, is the still unknown cost of the military operation in Chechnya - a bill which Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the Yabloko faction, estimates will soon run into trillions of roubles. Officially, the cost so far is put at around Rbs400m, with a further Rbs1,000bn to reconstruct Chechnya after the military operation is completed. However, the official stressed that these figures were guesswork, and a prolonged operation could radically change the expenditure needs - especially if the military is successful in demanding higher defence spending as a price for their actions in Chechnya. Second, and more serious, the government is considering a draft decree which would replace the regime of quotas on oil exports with an even more restrictive regime of domestic quotas. Mr Chubais said this week that a decision on the draft had yet to be taken, but most estimates point to its being supported by powerful figures in the government and the presidential administration. The finance official said that the new regime would slow the pace of reform and tend to discourage foreign investment, particularly in the energy sector. More important in the short term, he said, would be its effect on budget revenues, since an energy sector which could not recover its production costs because of very low domestic prices would not be able to pay taxes, nor could it bear losing the exemptions from import taxes which the 1995 budget has promised to eliminate. 'If you're trying to get the budget deficit down,' said the official, 'then letting the energy sector flounder will have a very profound effect on your efforts.' However, the official said that, if these two large obstacles were overcome, the Fund was 'very positive' on the possibilities of stabilising the economy next year. Mr Chubais said yesterday he believed the chances of agreement with the IMF were 'very high'.</p>

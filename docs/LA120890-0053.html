			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATO ENDS SESSION, AGREES TO FOCUS ON NEW 'OUTSIDE' THREATS  </P> <P> The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, citing a "profound transformation" in  Western Europe's security situation, on Friday identified aggression by Iraq  and instability in Eastern Europe as threats that must dominate alliance's  future planning.  </P> <P> In another development of significance to NATO, Secretary of Defense Dick  Cheney revealed that he has decided to remove permanently from military  aircraft a Europe-based nuclear-tipped missile called SRAM-2. He said they pose  safety hazards.  </P> <P> Cheney had ordered the missiles removed from "alert status" in June after  receiving reports that the weapons could leak radioactive material if they were  caught in a fire. In announcing their permanent removal Friday, Cheney  acknowledged that the SRAM's safety problems cannot be corrected easily. He  added, however, that the missiles would be available for use in emergencies.  </P> <P> In two days of meetings here, NATO defense ministers focused mostly on newly  perceived threats to the alliance. But they also agreed that the organization  must keep some forces deployed in traditional roles in Europe in spite of the  disappearance of old Cold War confrontations.  </P> <P> "Even in a non-adversarial relationship, prudence requires NATO to  counterbalance residual Soviet military capabilities, and risks to alliance  security can also rise from instability in East and Central Europe and from  elsewhere," the defense ministers said in a final statement.  </P> <P> The meeting marked the first time that NATO leaders have agreed to address  problems that until now have been considered outside the alliance's charter.  </P> <P> These problems include possible actions to forestall the economic collapse of  Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. NATO's position on Iraq, backed by  Cheney's appeals for additional help for Operation Desert Shield, also could  lead the way toward an alliance role in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> Cheney said that allies offered "generally favorable" responses to his requests  for more combat forces and logistical support in the gulf. But many allies have  been reticent to act jointly in addressing that crisis or the economic turmoil  of Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Most recently, for instance, Spain opposed a proposal to send a joint NATO  naval force to Egypt to underline the alliance's concern about developments in  the Middle East. The opposition has effectively torpedoed the proposal for now,  NATO officials said.  </P> <P> Cheney said that Operation Desert Shield is likely to speed the permanant  shrinkage of U.S. forces in Europe. Many of the American units sent from Europe  to the Middle East will probably return directly to the United States, Cheney  told reporters after the meeting.  </P> <P> The defense ministers also agreed that NATO can make "further dramatic  reductions" in its nuclear forces in Western Europe. But they insisted that it  must continue to base modern nuclear weapons in Europe to keep the peace.  </P></p>

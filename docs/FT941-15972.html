			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Debenham Tewson ahead 77% Debenham Tewson &amp; Chin-nocks, the property advisory company, yesterday announced a 77 per cent increase to Pounds 1.65m in pre-tax profits for the six months to end-October. The outcome, up from Pounds 936,000 last time, was struck on turnover of Pounds 27.1m (Pounds 17.5m) and reflected a marked recovery in the property investment market and the successful integration of Bernard Thorpe, the chartered surveyor. Mr Richard Lay, chairman, said the results were achieved 'despite the fact that the recovery in the property market is patchy and that we operate in a very competitive environment.' Bernard Thorpe has now been 'totally integrated', following the completion of the merger in February 1993. The enlarged group retains debt of approximately Pounds 4m, but the merger has created synergies for the companies' London offices and has enabled expansion into regional property markets. The group has experienced a sharp increase in its fund management business, which now manages a Pounds 5bn portfolio, and acted as agent for property transactions worth Pounds 600m in the first half. It is also building up a European network, and now has representative offices in all EU member countries, except Italy. Earnings per share amounted to 2.49p (1.81p); the interim dividend is 1.5p (1.2p).</p>

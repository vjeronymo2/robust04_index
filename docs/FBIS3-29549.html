			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA in Cambodian  publishes in its 19 February issue an approximately 1,000-word  report on actions by government forces against trespassers in  the O Bek K'am area in suburban Phnom Penh.    The report says that an appeal was made by Prince Krompreah  Norodom Ranariddh, first prime minister, to armed persons who  illegally occupied land in the O Bek K'am area. One day after  the appeal was made, these persons still refuse to leave the  expropriated land. "To resolve the issue peacefully, the  government used airplanes to drop leaflets containing the appeal  of the prince on the disputed area, which is reported to be  about 200 hectares.    "Faced with the stubborness of these armed violators, on the  afternoon of 17 February at around 1430, combined forces  comprising troops from the special military region, the military  police, and the Interior Ministry security police, accompanied  by six tanks and armored vehicles, entered the area. The troops  fired the first salvo against targets believed to be the  positions of the ringleaders of the illegally armed persons."    "It is to be recalled that 80 percent of these land  violators  are armed and the other 20 percent rely on them."    "According to reliable reports, the ringleaders are a former  FUNCINPEC (National United Front for an Independent, Neutral,  Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia) general, a field grade  officer; a former lieutenant general and a major general of the  Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party. Ten percent of this group is  demobilized soldiers; some are former Cambodian People's Party  troops."    "According to preliminary reports, the combined forces are  in  complete control of the area. They have arrested more than 20  trespassers and are burning houses built by them. According to  reports from some people living near the area, by 1800 on 17  February four persons were killed in the assault."    In its 20 February issue, REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA continues its  report on the operations against the trespassers, saying that  "about 1430, [on 18 February] the armed group, which according  to reliable sources comprises about 100 armed persons, was still  in the area and had fired two B-40 rockets at the special  military region forces stationed nearby." According to the same  sources, the special military region command and the Phnom Penh  police received authorization following this incident to act to  stop the violence.    "His Excellency [H.E.] General Tea Chamrat, co-defense  minister, and co-Minister H.E. Yu Hokkri, accompanied by H.E.  co-State Secretary Khan Savoeun, went to the scene. They issued  orders to the forces in cooperation with the armored vehicles  and tanks to launch an operation against the anarchic armed  group."    "After a clash lasting about an hour and a half between the  anarchic armed group -- which one source says consists of former  Sereika movement troops led by Seng Phirom and Yim Vanna -- and  the royal government security forces, the situation was calmed  because many group members surrendered and others were arrested  by the royal government forces. Realizing this unfavorable  situation, the `ringleaders' of the anarchic group managed to  escape and take along some weapons."    "According to preliminary reports on the operation to  eliminate armed anarchy lasting a full afternoon on 18 February,  many anarchic structures in the 200-hectare area were dismantled  and burned by the combined forces. Furthermore, some forces  have disclosed that as a result of this clash, the royal  government's combined forces finally arrested 48 members of the  anarchic group and the people staying in the area, including two  women, and confiscated many weapons. "According to a reliable  source, this brief armed clash resulted in a number of  unspecified deaths and injuries."    The paper concludes the report saying that "on 18 February  at  about 0915, many members of the military police and the police  force surrounded a building on Sivutha Road north of the Phsa  Depo market in Tuol Kouk ward. The goal was to search and arrest  some members" and that "a military policeman has disclosed that  the combined forces arrested four suspects and took them to  military police headquarters for questioning." According to  this official, "what is regrettable is that a suspect, believed  to be one of the ringleaders with the rank of major general,  escaped before the search."</p>

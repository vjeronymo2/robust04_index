			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / The Property Market: A contrast in measurement AT THE risk of confirming Mark Twain's jibe about lies, damn lies and statistics, Hillier Parker, the chartered surveyor, has come up with some figures which suggest that property did not under-perform equities during the 1980s, after all, writes Vanessa Houlder. The market deluded itself, it says, by contrasting equities, which use geared capital, with property that has no gearing. 'One is therefore comparing apples with oranges,' it says 'We believe that the perceived problem of under-performance of property only really arises from the different implicit financial structuring of the total return indices for property and equities,' says Mr Alan Patterson, author of the report. To make his point, he adjusted the performance of a property index to include a hypothetical debt component. The result is that the returns achieved by property over a 10-year period are almost identical to those of equities. (If, however, the chart had been brought up to date, equities would be well in the lead). Hillier Parker has chosen a level of gearing well above that of equities for this exercise, on the grounds that each form of investment is geared to its appropriate level. The property gearing ranged between 40 per cent and 45 per cent, so the investment income should service the current income payments, compared with equities' gearing of between 30 and 40 per cent. Hillier Parker claims that this method is no more an artificial contrivance than constructing an index assuming 100 per cent equity capital. The difference, however, is that institutions show no inclination to gear up their property holdings. So it seems that the traditional way of comparing equities and gilts has more validity where they are concerned. Investors could interpret the results as making a case for introducing gearing to a property portfolio. The disadvantage is that this destroys a key traditional virtue of property, which is its lower volatility compared with equities. A more surprising conclusion is that the counter-cylical nature of property and equities actually increases when the property is geared.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  believes Japan should weigh the possibility of slapping  sanctions against North Korea as part of efforts to talk the  communist state into fully disclosing its suspected nuclear  program.    The premier, in an interview printed in the Thursday morning  edition of South Korean's daily TONG-A ILBO, repeated Tokyo's  position of seeking a peaceful resolution on the issue through  dialogue. Hata also made clear that in response to North Korea's  alleged push for nuclear arms, Japan will take "responsible"  action within the bounds of the constitution, which bans the use  of force in settling international disputes.    Noting Tokyo wants to forge future-oriented ties with  countries in the Asia-Pacific region based on repentance of its  wartime wrongdoings, Hata said the Japanese Government is  contemplating how to express remorse toward South Korea.    Historians say around World War II, Japan sent to  battlefront  brothels an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 women, mostly from the  Korean peninsula, then under Japanese colonial rule.    Because Japan and South Korea are neighboring countries with  common values of freedom and democracy, Hata said, Japan will  strive to promote exchanges at all levels, deepen mutual  understanding and step up bilateral cooperation in the  international community.</p>

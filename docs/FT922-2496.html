			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Thailand urges Khmer Rouge to co-operate with UN plan THE newly-appointed Thai government yesterday urged the Khmer Rouge, the left-wing Cambodian guerrilla group, to co-operate with a United Nations peace plan for Cambodia, following reports of renewed fighting this week in the north of the country. Mr Arsa Sarasin, Thai foreign minister, met Mr Khieu Samphan, the nominal Khmer Rouge leader, in Bangkok and said he asked him to soften his stand for the sake of Cambodia. 'I told him, 'don't miss the boat',' said Mr Arsa. Western governments and the UN have asked Thailand and China, the main supporters of the Khmer Rouge, to press the organisation to adhere to the peace plan following its refusal to co-operate with the second phase, which provides for the cantonment and disarming of the four factions, starting last Saturday. Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister, said during a visit to New Zealand yesterday that it was too early to write off the Cambodian peace process because the issue was 'very complicated'. Cambodian government forces are reported to have launched a counter-offensive against Khmer Rouge guerrillas in the central province of Kompong Thom on Monday. Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of UN operations in Cambodia, blamed the Khmer Rouge and said government troops had the right to defend themselves. The fighting will obstruct Mr Akashi's efforts to raise some Dollars 600m (Pounds 324m) for Cambodia's rehabilitation at an aid conference in Japan. Before leaving Cambodia for the Tokyo meeting, Mr Akashi described the ceasefire violations as 'pretty serious' and said the Khmer Rouge appeared to have returned to the offensive in northern Cambodia. Yesterday Mr Khieu Samphan reiterated the Khmer Rouge view that it was impossible to co-operate fully with the UN until it confirmed there were no Vietnamese troops left in Cambodia and until it gave more power to the Supreme National Council at the expense of the Vietnamese-installed caretaker government.</p>

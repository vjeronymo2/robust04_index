			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUSTICES ASKED TO OK FELONY-MURDER PROSECUTIONS IN DRUG-DEATH CASES  </P> <P> She had gone to a Santa Ana motel room to inhale "lines" of cocaine and to  smoke hand-rolled cigarettes made of cocaine and tobacco that are known as  "coco puffs."  </P> <P> Soon, she was sitting in a glassy-eyed stupor from the effects of the illicit  drug. Her two companions realized she had stopped breathing and took her  outside for fresh air, but to no avail. When paramedics arrived on the scene,  they found that Jennie Licerio, age 19, had died from acute cocaine  intoxication.  </P> <P> The young woman's death set the stage for a widely watched test case to be  argued this week in Los Angeles before the state Supreme Court.  </P> <P> A coalition of state and local prosecutors is asking the justices to permit  authorities to bring second-degree murder charges against Sandy Patterson, the  Tustin man they say furnished the drug that killed Licerio.  </P> <P> The prosecutors want the high court to rule that providing cocaine is an  "inherently dangerous" act and to overturn previous rulings they say have  effectively prevented murder prosecutions in cocaine deaths and also have  imperiled use of such charges in deaths involving heroin and other drugs.  </P> <P> The case comes before the justices in the wake of reports of massive use of  cocaine in the United States and a steady increase in the number of deaths  attributed to the drug.  </P> <P> Authorities now estimate that more than 20 million Americans have used cocaine.  According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a survey of medical  examiners in 27 metropolitan areas show the number of cocaine-related deaths  rose last year to 1,582 -- triple the number in 1983.  </P> <P> The prosecutors say the ability to press murder charges for cocaine-related  deaths would provide a useful weapon against drug trafficking and justly punish  dealers whose wares prove fatal.  </P> <P> "If someone sells or otherwise furnishes a substance like cocaine, they ought  to be fully liable when death results," said Thomas J. Borris, an Orange County  deputy district attorney. "It's just like administering poison."  </P> <P> Attorneys backing the defendant in the case argue that while cocaine undeniably  is a serious national problem, its use has not been shown to be inherently  dangerous to life. Many more people -- perhaps hundreds of thousands annually  -- die from cigarettes and alcohol, they contend.  </P> <P> Permitting a murder prosecution for merely supplying the drug would unfairly  impose harsh sentences for wholly unintended results, the lawyers say.  </P> <P> "When you talk in moral terms, it's simply not fair to classify someone as a  murderer for something that was completely unanticipated and that no reasonable  person could have foreseen," said state Deputy Public Defender Philip M.  Brooks. "If these people are drug dealers, let them be prosecuted, but  prosecute them as drug dealers, not murderers."  </P> <P> The case arose in 1986 when, according to Orange County authorities, Licerio  and another young woman met Patterson and agreed to go to his motel room, where  he provided them with cocaine. After Licerio's death, prosecutors charged  Patterson with furnishing cocaine, a felony, and with second-degree murder in  the death of Licerio.  </P> <P> California, like most other states, permits murder charges to be brought when  death results during commission of a felony, even when a killing is unintended  or accidental. The aim of the felony-murder rule is to deter crime by holding  criminals strictly liable for the consequences of dangerous and violent acts.  </P> <P> State penal statutes specifically provide for first-degree felony-murder  prosecutions for killings in a robbery, rape, arson and certain other crimes.  The punishment for such murders range from 25 years to life in prison or the  death penalty in some circumstances.  </P> <P> The courts have also permitted second-degree felony-murder charges when death  results from a crime found to be "inherently dangerous" to human life. A 1958  ruling, for example, allowed such charges for furnishing a victim a fatal dose  of heroin, but later decisions have raised doubt about the validity of such  prosecutions. The punishment for these second-degree murders is 15 years to  life in prison.  </P> <P> In the case the justices will hear this week, Patterson pleaded guilty to  furnishing cocaine -- an offense punishable by three to five years in prison.  But he won dismissal of the murder charge in Orange County Superior Court. A  state Court of Appeal in Santa Ana upheld the dismissal, saying it had no  choice under state Supreme Court rulings it said had brought the law "to the  brink of logical absurdity."  </P> <P> The high court held in 1965 that a felony could be found "inherently  dangerous," and thus support a second-degree felony-murder charge, only if  found dangerous when "viewed in the abstract." The justices said it was  necessary to look at the issue in general terms because if the trial courts  looked instead to the actual circumstances in cases where the result was death,  they would almost always find the felony dangerous.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Another Decision  </P> <P> In 1984, the justices went further by ruling that murder charges could not be  brought if the underlying felony that allegedly led to the killing could have  been committed in a way that was not dangerous.  </P> <P> The state Court of Appeal concluded that, under the rulings, Patterson could  not be prosecuted for murder. Although he was accused of "furnishing" cocaine,  the statute under which he was charged could also be violated in ways that were  not inherently dangerous -- such as "transporting" the drug, the Court of  Appeal noted.  </P> <P> "Although we are, of course, bound by these holdings, we find their rationale  difficult to accept," Appellate Justice Thomas F. Crosby wrote for the panel.  The second-degree felony-murder rule ought to simply be abolished, or, if  retained, modified so that trial courts could examine the defendant's actual  conduct and decide whether it was inherently dangerous, the court said.  </P> <P> In their subsequent appeal of the ruling to the state Supreme Court, Orange  County authorities have been joined by the state attorney general's office, the  California District Attorneys Assn. and the Pacific Legal Foundation, a  conservative public-interest law firm.  </P> <P> The Orange County prosecutors argue that the current state of the law in  California allows many otherwise guilty drug suppliers to avoid felony-murder  charges. Past rulings should be modified to permit trial courts to focus on the  specific way the statute was violated -- such as furnishing the drug -- and not  on the alternative ways the statute could have been violated, the prosecutors  say.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Public Defenders' Support  </P> <P> Stephen Gilbert of Santa Monica, the attorney representing Patterson before the  high court, is receiving support from the state public defender's office and  the Orange County public defender's office in urging the justices to uphold the  Court of Appeal ruling.  </P> <P> Patterson's backers argue that the felony-murder rule is an outdated legal  concept whose continued existence unfairly punishes unintended killings and  deprives defendants in such cases of their right to due process of law. The  rule, they say, should be abandoned. Meanwhile, if someone maliciously uses a  drug to kill someone, he can be prosecuted directly for murder, the attorneys  say.  </P> <P> In briefs to the court, Gilbert contends that contrary to the prosecutors'  contentions, there is insufficient medical evidence to show that cocaine use is  likely to cause death. The reported deaths from cocaine are "a serious problem  to be sure, but a statistically insignificant one when one considers that  millions of persons use the drug," Gilbert said.  </P> <P> Attorneys on both sides say they cannot predict precisely how many  felony-murder prosecutions will arise if the justices clear the way for such  charges against drug dealers. But they note that authorities from throughout  California have inquired about the case and say that in view of the widespread  nature of drug use, the number of prosecutions could be substantial.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, there are a lot of potential cases like this one because drug  overdoses are an increasing problem in the state," said Michael D. Schwartz, a  Ventura County prosecutor representing the district attorneys association in  the case. "Felony murder charges could be an effective tool against the  problem."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deterrent Effect  </P> <P> Anthony T. Caso, a lawyer for the Pacific Legal Foundation, said that  regardless of the actual number of prosecutions, the threat of such charges  could prove a significant deterrent to drug-pushing.  </P> <P> "We're talking about spending a few years in prison for furnishing a drug  against a much stiffer term for felony-murder," Caso said. "The drug dealer  will know that the risk of doing business has gone way up."  </P></p>

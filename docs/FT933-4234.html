			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Strong week for Latin American markets Latin America's emerging markets performed well last week, with Colombia and Venezuela in particular coming to the fore, while there were also good rises in the Philippines, Malaysia and Portugal. US funds have been flowing into Latin America recently, seeking out underperforming markets and attracted by the general recovery in economic fundamentals. Mr Federico Laffan, of Latin American Securities, comments that Colombia, has been driven higher recently by a flow of funds from large US institutions. As a consequence turnover has risen from around Dollars 2.5m a day in the first half of the year, to some Dollars 4m. Foreign money, he adds, has been attracted to Columbia since equities there have lagged other regional markets, while prices are also cheap. Inflation has been coming down, and GDP growth is forecast for 1993 at between 4 to 4.5 per cent, after 3 per cent in 1992, when the economy was affected by a severe drought. Among the smaller European bourses, Portugal has enjoyed a rally since May, coinciding with the devaluation of the escudo. According to the data provided by the IFC, an affiliate of the World Bank, the market has shown a 43 per cent improvement on the year to date in dollar terms, making it the fourth best performer in the list. Mr John Ferreira of Carnegie International says that initial gains in the market had been led by US investors, attracted by lower interest rates and good earnings prospects from 1995.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                         Dollar terms                     No. of       Sep 03     % Change      % Change Market              stocks         1993     over week    on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Argentina            (11)       714.53        +5.1         +23.2 Brazil               (44)       222.29        +5.9         +77.8 Chile                (20)       434.85        +0.8          +3.9 Colombia*             (8)       479.78        +7.0         +12.8 Mexico               (58)       735.54        -0.2          +8.8 Venezuela**           (8)       485.99         6.8          -6.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- East Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Korea***      (130)        93.30        -0.7          -5.0 Philippines          (11)       183.95        +8.8         +37.8 Taiwan, China****    (76)        79.81        -2.2          +8.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- India*****           (61)        90.22        -0.5         -3.7 Indonesia******      (31)        93.86        -0.1        +59.9 Malaysia             (61)       241.03        +4.6        +47.4 Pakistan*******       (8)       218.67        -1.0         +9.2 Thailand             (52)       275.45        +3.5        +19.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Euro/Mid East  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Greece               (17)       246.12        -0.9       +26.0 Jordan                (5)       155.53        -0.8       +33.1 Portugal             (16)       110.26        +4.0       +42.9 Turkey********       (31)       138.92        -2.9      +106.7  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             Local currency terms                                     Sep 03      % Change     % Change                                       1993      over week   on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Argentina                       438,451.77        +5.1        +23.4 Brazil                       30,328,512.55       +15.1     +1,354.3 Chile                               711.19        +0.6        +10.9 Colombia*                           685.43        +6.8        +12.1 Mexico                              987.15        -0.1         +8.7 Venezuela**                       1,049.30        +7.6        +12.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- East Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Korea***                       99.01       -0.8         -2.7 Philippines                         245.54      +10.5        +51.9 Taiwan, China****                    79.96       -2.2        +14.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- India*****                           99.83       -0.4         +4.6 Indonesia******                     107.17       +0.1        +62.9 Malaysia                            226.72       +4.7        +43.7 Pakistan*******                     295.44       -1.0        +27.4 Thailand                            274.96       +3.5        +17.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Euro/Mid East  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Greece                              382.78       -2.7        +34.4 Jordan                              221.73       -0.8        +33.7 Portugal                            126.73       +2.2        +62.6 Turkey********                      759.67       -2.2       +183.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

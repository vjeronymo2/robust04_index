			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Businessman acquitted only to be arrested Mr Malcolm Johnson, an Australian business and mining consultant, was yesterday cleared of stealing about Pounds 1m from Energy Capital, an oil and gas exploration company, to support the company's Pounds 3.5m rights issue in 1988. After his acquittal at the Old Bailey, however, Mr Johnson was immediately arrested and served with an extradition warrant on behalf of the Australian authorities. The Australians want to question Mr Johnson about his involvement with an Australian company's purchase of oil interests in the US Burbank field. Mr Johnson, from Kitzbuhel, Austria, spent last night in custody and is expected to appear before Bow Street magistrates today to apply for bail. The prosecution at the Old Bailey alleged that Mr Johnson stole Pounds 1m from Energy Capital - later renamed Claremont UK - to support the sub-underwriting of its rights issue. The money was used as security for a loan by a Swiss bank to companies controlled by Mr Johnson and acting as sub-underwriters, the jury was told. The defence said he had no involvement in the money transfers. He was acquitted of two charges of theft. The prosecution was part of a much larger case brought against Mr Johnson and others by the Serious Fraud Office. It initially brought a number of charges against Mr Johnson concerning the operations of Duralite Manufacturing, a company he owned. He and two other men were charged with conspiring to induce investors to back a mining venture by the company, by issuing false forecasts about its assets. These charges were dismissed by an Old Bailey judge, who ruled that there was insufficient evidence.</p>

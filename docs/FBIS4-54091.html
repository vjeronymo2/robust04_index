A summit of African independent states was held on May 25,  1963, which declared the inauguration of the Organization of  African Unity (OAU) and adopted its charter.    It was decided at the meeting to observe May 25 when the  organization was founded as day of African liberation.    The founding of the OAU marked an important occasion in  giving impetus to the struggle of the Africans for the  liquidation of the colonial ruling system in the continent,  promotion of cooperation and solidarity among nations and  building of a new Africa, an article of NODONG SINMUN notes, and  says:    On this occasion, the Korean people extend friendly  congratulations and greetings to the African people.    Many changes have taken place in the African continent,  renewing its appearance, thanks to the efforts of the Africans  to achieve the prosperity of the continent by themselves.    The African people are working to expand the peace zone, the  nuclear-free zone in the continent.    The OAU is playing an important role in the efforts of the  African nations to build a new Africa. The organization  discusses and decides on preferential problems in developing the  continent and ensuring peace there at annual meetings of heads  of state and government.    The Korean people sincerely rejoice over all the  revolutionary changes taking place in Africa and will as ever  extend active support to the just cause of the African people.

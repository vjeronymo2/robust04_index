			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / EC accord unlikely on plans for spending EUROPEAN Community leaders are unlikely to finalise spending plans for the next five years when they meet in Lisbon in June, the president of the European Parliament said yesterday, Reuter reports from Lisbon. Mr Egon Klepsch said the parliament would achieve a unified position on the so-called Delors Two package of budget reforms for 1993 to 1997 by June 'to give a push to the negotiations.' 'But I am convinced it will be difficult for the council in June to have the same result as the European Parliament,' he told a news conference at the end of a two-day visit to Portugal, his first since taking office in January. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the EC Commission, has proposed a one-third annual budget increase by 1997, with more spending on foreign aid, industrial policy and help for the EC's poorest states. Britain and Germany say the package is unacceptable and France, Belgium and Italy have reservations. Portugal has already expressed doubts about being able to complete budget reforms before Britain takes over the EC presidency in July. Mr Klepsch, who held talks with Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, Foreign Minister Joao de Deus Pinheiro and President Mario Soares, said the Community had no choice but to agree on a new spending package by its Edinburgh summit in December. 'On the last day of December the present financial structure of the Community is finished,' he said. The European Commission tomorrow launches a new environmental action plan designed to give the Community a world lead in the move towards sustainable, or environmentally sound, economic development, Reuter reports from Brussels. The programme aims to reverse what the EC executive calls a 'slow but relentless deterioration of the general state of the environment' in the 12-nation bloc that continues despite the adoption of over 200 environmental laws in the last 20 years. The strategy, which governments will be asked to endorse but not to approve in detail, is intended as a key step towards the goal of achieving sustainable development.</p>

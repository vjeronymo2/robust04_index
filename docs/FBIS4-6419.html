			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- The recent uptrend in  long-term interest rates will top the agenda at a spate of  international meetings later this month in Washington, Finance  Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Tuesday.    Fujii, speaking at a regular news conference after a morning  cabinet meeting, declined to comment on the overnight tightening  of U.S. credit policy, however.    Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of  Seven  (G-7) major industrialized nations are slated to meet Sunday in  Washington for twice-yearly gatherings through Tuesday of the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.    "I presume interest rates will become one of the major  issues," Fujii said, noting that sustainable growth without  inflation is what G-7 nations want to attain.    Fujii acknowledged there were various views concerning the  tighter U.S. credit stance, such as increasing hopes for an  economic recovery and spreading fears of inflation.    But he said, "I shouldn't be commenting on another nation's  credit policy."    The U.S. Federal Reserve Board announced overnight a slight  tightening of its credit policy, lifting the target rate for the  federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point.    The third tightening since the Fed changed its credit stance  for the first time in five years in February contrasts with  Germany's move last week to cut its key rates to allow other  European nations to follow suit.    The U.S. credit stance has sent long-term market rates  sharply higher, exporting the uptrend to other G-7 nations.    With a credit policy gap surfacing between the U.S., which  is  on the road to recovery, and Japan and some European nations  which are still struggling with sluggish economies, coordination  is expected to become a tough issue for the G-7 meeting.    Concerning Japan's huge trade surplus that is certain to be  another major topic, Fujii declined to suggest remedies, saying  it depends on the coming new cabinet.    Japan is set to choose a new prime minister, with the most  likely candidate being Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata, to succeed Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa who offered to resign earlier this month.    Fujii said he does not know whether Japan will be  represented  at the Washington meetings by its finance minister in view of  the uncertain political situation and the expected start of Diet  debate on the fiscal 1994 budget as soon as a new cabinet is  formed.    Referring to the fiscal 1993 trade surplus released Monday,  Fujii said exports are decreasing and imports are increasing in  terms of volume. The trend shows the effectiveness of the Trade  Ministry's measures, he said.    Japan's trade surplus for the year ended March 31 hit a  record high for the second year in a row, reaching 121.99  billion dollars, up 10.0 percent from the year before.    Fujii said Japan will continue taking action to boost  domestic demand and deregulatory steps to facilitate market  access as included in the February stimulus package and the  March market-opening plan.</p>

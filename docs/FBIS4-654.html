			<p>BFN     [Text] Brazzaville, 13 Apr (AFP) -- A brief clash occurred  this morning between some ministerial reserve policemen and  opposition supporters close to former President Denis  Sassou-Nguesso, in the eastern Brazzaville district of Mpila,  according to witnesses. No details have emerged on the causes  and outcome of this clash, which occurred near the former  president's residence. The machine-gun fire had stopped by  midmorning but there were still signs of tension in the area, an  Army officer said. Defense Minister Raymond Damase Ngollo has  held a meeting with members of the Army High Command and  officers from the north of the country, who are close to General  Sassou-Nguesso, to study ways and means of ending the clashes,  the same officer added.    Security forces have been deployed in Mpila to check the  activities of armed robbers, who have been attacking the goods  trains of the Congo-Ocean railway company, the police said.  Police presence has been stepped up since the death on 3 April  of a soldier, who was killed by a stray bullet during a  shoot-out between security forces and the "cobras," the nickname  of Gen. Sassou- Nguesso's armed supporters. His supporters are  opposed to the presence of the security forces in Mpila and fear  that this could serve as a pretext to attack the residence of  the former head of state, who is presently in his native  village, Oyo, 600 km north of Brazzaville.</p>

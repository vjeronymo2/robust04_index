			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Health hospitality bill criticised The Department of Health spent Pounds 211,531 - Pounds 579 a day - on entertainment in 1992-93, a 74 per cent rise over 1990-91, Labour claimed yesterday. 'Virginia Bottomley has got her priorities all wrong,' said Ms Dawn Primarolo, who speaks for Labour on health. 'This money should be spent on patient care - not entertainment, food and drink for ministers.' Mr Tom Sackville, health minister, claimed the money was spent mainly on tea and coffee. The department had underspent its hospitality budget for this year, he said.</p>

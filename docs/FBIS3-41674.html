Chakhmakhchyan, Russian Federation </F> Government, ``Cuba and Tajikistan Offering Humanitarian  Assistance to Moscow'']    [Text] CIS and other countries throughout the world are  providing emergency assistance to Moscow clinics which accepted  for treatment the persons injured on 3-4 October.    Here are some reports from the dispatches of the Commission  on the Issues of Humanitarian and Technical Assistance at the  Russian Federation Government. Tajikistan, despite its own  misfortunes, sent approximately 50 t of canned juices to Moscow  (apricot, grape, and pomegranate) and 40 t of fresh tomatoes,  grapes, and watermelons which will be sent directly to the  capital's hospitals.    Although it may appear strange, but the list of ``donor''  countries who responded to the Moscow tragedy include Cuba and  Ethiopia. Fidel Castro, in particular, promised to send plasma  and drugs, while the Russian Federation Embassy in Ethiopia and  the Red Cross hospital are sending 400 dressing and bandage kits  and 150 catheters for the military hospital in Balashikha which  is treating soldiers from the Dzerzhinskiy division.    As always, the European Community did not stand idle; its  assistance amounted to 300,000 ECUs. In addition, Moscow  physicians will receive drugs and preparations from governments  and philanthropic organizations in Denmark, Turkey, Switzerland,  Italy, France...    The Russian Peace Fund sent 5 million rubles as assistance  to  Moscow's first-aid workers--physicians, nursing aides, and  ambulance crew drivers who were the first to give assistance to  the wounded during the tragic days of October. In addition to  money, family members of the ambulance workers who have children  will receive toys and gifts.    The fund has specific addresses and lists of persons and  crews who bravely and without fear of danger worked under the  hail of bullets on 3-4 October.    The Russian Peace Fund is appealing to the leaders of  enterprises, commercial structures, associations, and banks to  join them in this charitable action and transfer funds to  Account No. 705001 with a notation ``First Aid'' at the Orbita  Commercial Bank, Correspondent Account No. 161227 at the Russian  Commercial Center of the Main Administration of the Russian  Federation Central Bank, Ministry of Finance, 201791.</p>

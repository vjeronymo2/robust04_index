			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Foolish Ruse To Mislead Public Opinion'--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON in a  commentary today denounces the United States which, displeased  with the proposal and step of the DPRK for the establishment of  a new peace arrangement, is alleging that the latter wrecked the  Korean armistice agreement.    The analyst says:    The United States, far from accepting the DPRK's just  proposal for ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula, is crying  over "the violation of the armistice agreement", taking issue  with it. This is intended to cover up its crimes in having  deliberately and systematically destroyed the Korean armistice  agreement and armistice machine and shift the blame on to the  other.    It is the United States that destroyed and scrapped the  Korean Armistice Agreement. After it was signed in July 1953,  the United States, a signatory to it, began violating it even  before the ink on the agreement was dry.    The U.S. side had shipped new types of weapons including  nuclear weapons into South Korea in secrecy by camouflaged  method, afraid of the Korean Armistic Agreement in the past  days. But now it is introducing and deploying them openly in  broad daylight.    In March 1991 it was the United States that appointed a  "general" of the South Korean army without legal authority or  qualification in view of the Korean Armistice Agreement "senior  member" of the U.S. side, thus incapacitating the armistice  machine from fulfilling its function.    The U.S side's attempt to revive the armistice machine is  intended to persist in war provocation moves and keep tensions  on the Korean peninsula.    The United States will be well advised to act with  discretion, mindful that its perfidious act is not favourable to  it.</p>

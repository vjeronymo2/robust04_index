Sceptics' forecasts were not proved false as an average of  40  per cent of registered Stavropol voters turned out for the  secret balloting in the territory's 25 districts.    According to the preliminary results, the overwhelming  majority of voters preferred those who had already had  experience in running the territory's complicated economy and in  implementing Russian reforms. The electoral mandate was won by  almost all of the municipal and regional administration heads  and law enforcement officials who nominated themselves as  candidates to the territorial duma.    Neither the pro-reform Russia's Choice bloc nor the other  social movements and political parties were able to gather  enough votes to put one of their followers in the local duma,  with the exception of a very few cases.    Bryansk -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Artyushin:    The preliminary results of the elections to the Bryansk  regional duma are in. ITAR-TASS was told by the regional  administration's working group that the elections were valid in  six of the nine three-seat constituencies, resulting in the  election of 18 of the 27 duma deputies. Despite that fact that  the 27 spots were contested by 151 candidates, low voter turnout  in the other three constituencies disqualified those elections.    Of the 18 new deputies in the regional duma, five are high  officials in the regional administration, being the deputy head,  the heads of the regional departments of internal affairs,  agriculture, and labor and unemployment, as well as the chairman  of the department of the regional consumer's union.    Five local administration heads and their deputies also got  seats in the duma, along with three collective farm chairmen,  two industrialists, a teacher, a doctor, and an agronomist.    Cheboksary -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valentina Ivanova:    The voter turnout in Chuvashia's second round of local  elections, held on Sunday, was around 40 per cent, ITAR-TASS was  informed by the Central Electoral Commission. The names of 28  of the 47 deputies in the State Council were determined, while  the remaining 19 seats are still vacant.    Samara -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Belyakov:    Of the 25 deputy mandates in the Samara gubernatorial duma,  only 14 were filled as a result of Sunday's local elections.  The other 11 districts were plagued by very low voter turnout,  and the elections were declared invalid. Overall, of the  region's 2.5 [as published] registered voters, a little more  than 30 per cent showed up at the polls.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hunt optimistic on jobs for Wales GROWING success for Wales in attracting inward investment was forecast by Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, in the Commons yesterday. He announced that agreement had been reached for 10 industrial projects involving investment of more than Pounds 18m and expected to create more than 460 new jobs. He emphasised that in the space of a week he had been able to announce 1,000 new jobs for Wales. 'We are very much on top of the premier league for inward investment and we intend to stay there,' he added. The minister appealed for co-operation in establishing a cross-party consensus over reform of Welsh local government through the setting up of about 23 unitary authorities. He said a white paper would be published later in the year setting out government proposals, which would be given legislative effect through a separate Welsh local-government bill. A Conservative backbencher last night highlighted a 'crisis' in the British forestry industry, saying that the number of trees planted in 1990 was the lowest for many years. Claiming that present incentives were inadequate, Sir James Spicer (C Dorset West) called on the government to make representations 'to try and pressure the Treasury to see some sense.' Sir Hector Monro, a junior Scottish minister, stressed that the government had no intention of privatising the Forestry Commission.</p>

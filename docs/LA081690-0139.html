			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 6-MONTH FREEZE WILL LIMIT BUILDINGS TO TWO STORIES  </P> <P> After nearly three hours of emotional debate Tuesday, the City Council approved  an emergency six-month moratorium on development aimed at controlling  overcrowding and crime in the waterfront district.  </P> <P> The freeze will immediately affect only a small portion of the city's 2nd  District. However, supporters and critics said the action challenges the  foundation of the city's redevelopment policy. Some city officials and  community activists also expressed fear that it raises issues that could  splinter the city.  </P> <P> The moratorium, the most recent in a spate of such actions this year, bans  construction of buildings over 25 feet high -- two-stories -- along the  district's major arteries, including Broadway, 4th, 7th and 10th streets.  </P> <P> A plan developed a year ago called for the city to concentrate multistory  housing along such thoroughfares. But area residents sought the moratorium that  temporarily bans such multistory projects because they blame them for  increasing congestion and crime.  </P> <P> City Planning Director Robert Paternoster said that at least two planned  multistory projects will be frozen by the council's action.  </P> <P> Over the past 10 years, Long Beach officials have been pushed by community  activists to construct low-income housing throughout the city. Such projects  have been a part of an aggressive redevelopment program that has stressed  growth.  </P> <P> But adoption of the 2nd District's construction moratorium, as well as similar  freezes enacted by the council earlier this year for other districts, signals a  shift away from that redevelopment policy.  </P> <P> In recent years, development has increased dramatically in the 2nd District, a  mix of neighborhoods encompassing some of the city's most affluent and most  impoverished areas. It also includes several blocks of middle-class  neighborhoods dominated by old-fashioned California bungalows and palm trees.  </P> <P> A dozen residents of these areas showed up at Tuesday's meeting to complain  that development of low-income housing has increased the number of drug deals,  assaults and robberies in their streets.  </P> <P> "We're fed up with rampant development and the crime it's brought to the  community," said Catherine LaRosa.  </P> <P> But Paternoster called such comments "too simplistic." He said that low-income  housing is being unfairly blamed for the city's problems.  </P> <P> City councilmen, though, have found themselves increasingly squeezed in a  political vice as they try to reconcile pressure from anti-growth residents and  pro-growth real estate agents. On Tuesday, several said they are concerned that  some of the same developments they and their predecessors voted for this past  decade are destroying middle-class neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "Blocks and blocks of bungalows have been replaced with brand new, cheap  apartment buildings jammed with welfare people and other low-income people,"  Councilman Wallace Edgerton said. He said he had proposed the "emergency"  moratorium to cut down on crime in his district.  </P> <P> It passed 7 to 2. The two councilmen who opposed Edgerton's proposal voiced  concern that the restrictions implied that poor people are responsible for the  city's growing crime.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ndjamena, 3 Mar (AFP) -- Chadian Interior Minister  Abderamane Izzo today accused Moise Kette, chairman of the  National Awakening Committee for Peace and Democracy [CSNPD], a  political and military movement operating in the south of Chad,  of causing the failure of the recent peace talks in Bangui.  "Through the CSNPD's fault and because of its intransigence, we  were only able to examine a certain number of problems," the  minister, who led the government delegation to the Bangui talks  at the end of February, stated on national radio. The objective  of these talks, which were held under the auspices of the  Central African Republic [CAR] authorities, was to sign a peace  agreement between the government and the CNSPD. They only  resulted in the signing of a simple joint communique between the  two sides.    "Right from the start, the CSNPD laid down conditions. When  one goes to a negotiation and starts with conditions, it often  does not bode well," Mr. Izzo added. Despite this, he added,  "we examined these conditions, but the meeting was only able to  agree on matters of principle, particularly on the cease-fire,  the withdrawal of the republican guards from the south of the  country, and the free movement of goods and persons."    According to reliable sources, Moise Kette had demanded at  the opening of the talks the withdrawal of the republican guards  -- an elite unit under the exclusive orders of President Idriss  Deby -- as well as the holding of a referendum within a short  time in order to institute federalism in Chad. The republican  guards have been accused of molesting civilians in the south of  the country, thus provoking a massive exodus towards the CAR.  In June 1993, a cease-fire agreement was signed between the  Chadian Government and the CSNPD.</p>

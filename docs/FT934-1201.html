			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / OECD Annual Report: UK expected to see growth of 2.9% next year The recent UK budget will have a negative impact on demand in the short term and could reduce Britain's growth rate by about a quarter of a percentage point both in 1994 and in 1995, the OECD believes. Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, the OECD's chief economist, said that the tax increases and spending cuts were nonetheless a welcome move towards cutting the UK's budget defi-cit. The recent fall in interest rates would partly offset the negative effects on growth of the fiscal tightening, he said. On the basis of a tentative assessment, the OECD believes that the budget measures announced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will have no adverse effect on inflation. In its economic outlook, published yesterday, the OECD says that recovery in Britain is 'well under way' and forecasts sustained modest economic growth with low inflation for the next two years. The outlook, which was completed before the November 30 budget, forecasts that UK economic growth will quicken to 2.9 per cent next year and in 1995 from 2 per cent this year while unemployment should fall slowly to 9.5 per cent in 1995 from 10 per cent at present. It says Britain's short-run inflation outlook is benign, largely because of the legacy of the longest post-war recession. However, underlying inflation, as measured by the retail prices index minus mortgage interest payments, may remain above the mid-point of the government's 1-4 per cent target range. The organisation says the effects of the substantial easing of monetary policy since sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism have yet to be fully felt. Because UK interest rates have fallen sharply since September 1992, the OECD expects little change in UK short-term rates in the next two years. It projects that they will average 5.5 per cent next year after 6 per cent in 1993, before rising slightly to 5.7 per cent in 1995. The OECD believes there is still considerable slack in the UK economy. It estimates that the output gap - measuring the difference between real gross domestic product and its potential - was 5.5 per cent last year, second to Canada's 5.9 per cent in the Group of Seven leading industrial countries and well above the US and German output gaps of 0.7 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively.</p>

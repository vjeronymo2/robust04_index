			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Three senators introduced a package of anti-smoking bills to make cigarettes  more expensive, less addictive and less available, and received support from a  former "Winston Man," who said tobacco ads lie. The government should speak  with one voice in telling the public: "Tobacco use will harm you," said Sen.  Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), who joined Sens. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) and John H.  Chafee (R-R.I.) in proposing measures to discourage tobacco use. David Goerlitz  of Cherry Hill, N.J., was an R. J. Reynolds "Winston Man" model from 1981 to  1986. His ad campaign, depicting smokers as young, robust and virile, "was a  big lie," he said, and urged Congress "to battle the greed and deception" of  the tobacco companies.  </P></p>

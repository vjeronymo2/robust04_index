			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Ferranti's receivers warn about redundancy Ferranti International's joint administrative receivers, Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop of Arthur Andersen, warned yesterday that some further redundancies at the defence electronics group are inevitable. Yesterday they held preliminary meetings with union and staff representatives. Ferranti's workforce had already shrunk from over 22,000 to about 3,700 in the last three years. 'Management had already identified a need for some reductions in overall employment levels to bring production into line with anticipated 1994 business,' they explained. But no immediate decisions are being taken and further discussions are planned. 'Our priority is to stabilise the company's trading operations,' the receivers also said. They added that they were concentrating on restoring trading to near-normality 'as soon as possible.' The two Arthur Andersen partners have begun an initial investigation into the defence electronics group's position.</p>

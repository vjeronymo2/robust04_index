			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly  of the People's Government, has termed his meetings in France as  very positive. France is the third country he visited as part  of a tour of Europe, which, he said, has been very fruitful and  has demonstrated the friendship and affection of the people of  France for the Caribbean island. This has materialized in the  sending of donations, he continued.    In statements to Radio Rebelde, Alarcon said his meeting in  Paris with (Robert Hue), new secretary general of the French  Communist Party, was very friendly. Alarcon said (Hue)  reiterated his party's support for Cuba and vowed to maintain  the solidarity movement toward the Caribbean nation.    Upon assessing his tour, which also included Germany and  Belgium, the president of Cuba's legislative body added that  there is a great and growing interest in Europe in learning  about Cuba's reality. He stressed that the initial amazement  over Cuba's survival without assistance from the now defunct  Soviet Union and the socialist bloc is over.    Alarcon told Radio Rebelde that currently on the continent  there is a great deal of interest in learning about the problems  of the island, how they are being confronted, and the current  development perspectives, because for many people in Europe this  is a very unique case. He added that this is a country facing  serious economic difficulties, which has continued to preserve  firm human values of respecting people and maintaing a feeling  of solidarity.</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Survey of Danish Food Industry 2: A model for eastern Europe  -Advice to farmers With 20m pigs in a country with only 5m people, it is clear that the focus of Danish agriculture must be on finding markets elsewhere. Farmers are increasingly geared towards producing for the export trade. But it is not just pork and milk that are exported from Denmark; its farming advisory service has gained such a prominent reputation overseas that advisers are now exporting the 'Danish model'. The Danish Agricultural Advisory Service is owned by producers and run in a similar way to the co-operatives which dominate farm output in Denmark. Local advisers must answer to a board of farmers which also dictates priorities for research. This structure helps information to be disseminated as quickly as possible to a range of farmers. The advisory service runs 95 local centres at a cost of DKr1.1bn (Pounds 112m) a year: the government provides some of the funds but most is put up by farmers themselves. The organ- isation runs a national head- quarters at Skejby near Aar- hus in Jutland, providing a resource centre for local advisers with a budget of DKr238m. It also helps to chan- nel requests to research bodies. The system has been so successful in Denmark that its advisers are helping set up similar operations in eastern Europe. Danish agricultural advisers are currently working in Poland, and the three Baltic countries: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. One of the advisers points to the difficulties of setting up a system which, in essence, is run by farmers on the ground in countries that have been used to receiving orders from the top. 'We try to stress that we are supporting farming in the same way that fertilisers are: we are just one input,' says Mr Niels Gert Nielsen, an international adviser. The structure of the Danish farming industry, which comprises some 70,000 mainly family farmers, makes it important that advice is offered at a local level and that the process involves as many producers as possible. With the current emphasis on reform of the common agricultural policy in the European Union, and all that involves in price cuts, farmers need all the help they can get.</p>

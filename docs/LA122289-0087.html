			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIABETIC IS PUSHING 80  </P> <P> Question: If someone who is pushing age 80 is told for the first time in his  life that he has diabetes, does it make any sense for him to change the way  he's been living? I think I'm better shape than my doctor.  </P> <P> Answer: The question isn't whether you're in better shape than your doctor, but  whether you are in as good shape as you can possibly be. Measuring your health  against that of your physician serves no useful purpose.  </P> <P> If you're pushing 80, you must have been doing something right all these years.  My guess would be that any changes your physician would recommend in the way  you live would be relatively minor. Moreover, any changes required because of  diabetes would probably also reduce risk of heart disease.  </P> <P> Question: Can a woman have more than one Caesarean delivery? I've already had  one.  </P> <P> Answer: A definitive answer, of course, depends on the individual case. In  general, however, there is no absolute limit on the number of Caesarean births  a woman may have.  </P> <P> For Morton, Wilmington, Del.: The onset of flu is more sudden, and the symptoms  are more severe, than with a cold.  </P></p>

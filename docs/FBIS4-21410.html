			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of state, Mahamane Ousmane, has just  returned to Niamey from Abuja, where he took part in the eighth  summit of the Lake Chad Basin Commission. He was welcomed upon  arrival by Prime Minister Mahamadou Issoufou. The head of state  said it was a historic summit, first because it focused on  essential points including environmental issues, and then  adopted a master plan on the development and management of the  ecological issues of the Lake Chad Basin area. The master plan  includes 36 projects, financed with a total of $85 million, that  is, 51 billion CFA francs.    Within the framework of these 36 projects, the head of state  said that Niger is concerned with 25 projects. The master plan  was adopted by the member countries and guidelines were given to  the Executive Secretariat for implementation.

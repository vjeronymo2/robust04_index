			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Brussels to seek fresh impetus for growth package THE European Commission is considering fresh measures to stimulate growth because the response from EC member states remains inadequate, Mr Henning Christophersen, economics commissioner, said yesterday. Mr Christophersen said after a meeting of EC finance ministers in Brussels that the Commission may put forward new ideas on promoting investment and job creation at the EC summit in Copenhagen in June. 'More needs to be done,' he said. The Danish presidency of the EC has called for a 'jumbo' meeting of finance ministers from the Twelve and the six members of the European Free Trade Area on April 19 in Luxembourg. The aim is to hitch a pan-European effort to the US recovery in an effort to stem rising unemployment which is undermining public confidence in the EC. But only five states - Spain, Germany, Ireland, Portugal, and Denmark - have put plans to the Commission to bolster the growth package. EC officials said yesterday that they looked forward to the UK contribution in today's budget. At the meeting in Brussels, finance ministers hailed the long-awaited solidarity pact between the central government and Lander to finance German unification. 'It will pave the way for lower interest rates not just in Germany but also in the rest of the EC,' said Mr Christophersen. Lower German interest rates are vital if the EC is to attain the 3 per cent growth needed to halt unemployment, expected to rise to 17m in the EC this year. The EC growth initiative combines a modest Community effort to promote lending to small and medium-sized companies through a new European investment fund and greater flexibility in European Investment Bank lending for infrastructure. But the main burden lies in supply-side measures by member states. Separately, EC member states approved an ambitious convergence programme put forward by the Greek government.</p>

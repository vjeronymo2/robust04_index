			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Chesterton pays Pounds 6.25m for consultancy Chesterton International, the property consultancy, has continued its acquisition drive with the purchase of Cyril Sweett, the construction, cost and project management consultancy, for Pounds 6.25m. The consideration will be met by the issue of 4.24m new ordinary shares, Pounds 1.74m nominal of loan notes repayable over 7 1/2 years and Pounds 700,000 of convertible loan stock. Chesterton, which came to the market in June, has this year already acquired Consolidated FPM, the facilities management company and Conroy Hunter, the Scottish property agency. The deal will enable the group to extend its facilities management operation which it believes to be a growth area. Mr William Wells, Chesterton chairman, said: 'This acquisition will significantly increase the range of services Chesterton is able to offer.' Cyril Sweett has operations in western Europe and east Asia. It employs about 190 people and, among other projects, has completed the Lakeside shopping centre in Thurrock.</p>

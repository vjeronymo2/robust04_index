			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Building a platform for growth - James Buxton on the driving force behind the rise of Stagecoach Stagecoach, the biggest company to emerge from the privatisation of the UK bus industry, moved up a gear last week. It acquired two of the 10 companies which run London's red buses, boosting its turnover by a fifth. With the Pounds 25.3m purchase of East London Bus and Coach, and South East London and Kent (Selkent), it now controls 11.5 per cent of the UK bus market and has a springboard to bid for more London routes. However its ambitions do not stop there. It expects the next 12 months to produce opportunities for expansion that may never be repeated. As the reshaping of the bus industry continues, more investors in bus company management buy-outs and employee share ownership plans are likely to seek a way out. To cope with expansion Mr Brian Souter, who founded Stagecoach in 1980 with his sister Mrs Ann Gloag, now concentrates on acquisitions, as does Mr Derek Scott, the finance director. Last Friday Mr Souter told shareholders at Stagecoach's AGM in Perth that it was targeting 'a mix of companies, some of which are underperforming and less expensive to purchase, but with great potential for profit improvement.' Stagecoach, which came to the market last year, is the product of the Tory government's bus policies. It exploited the deregulation of routes, and then the break up and privatisation of the National Bus Group and the Scottish Bus Group. It also has companies in Kenya, Malawi and New Zealand. It now owns 20 provincial bus units throughout the country. Turnover last year was Pounds 191m, including acquisitions, and pre-tax profits rose 46 per cent to Pounds 18.9m. It has successfully combined buying and absorbing a stream of companies with running a far-flung empire. According to Mr Peter Huntley, a transport consultant with the TAS Partnership, it has 'developed a strategy for running bus companies that is head and shoulders above those of the other private groups'. This is because Stagecoach was never a traditional bus company and 'never inherited any cultural baggage' from the state sector, he says. 'You only have to compare its head office (employing 30 people in a small house in Perth) with the marble halls of some of the other companies.' When Stagecoach makes an acquisition, it has bought seven bus companies in the 17 months since its flotation, the new subsidiary is put under the control of one of three main board executive directors, including Mr Souter. They carry out a standard reorganisation procedure which focuses on four areas. Overheads: 'Most of the companies we take over have extra tiers of management left over from when they were publicly owned,' says Mr Souter. Stagecoach cuts them down to four levels above the bus driver or fitter: the main board, the board of the subsidiary (one for each region), the four-person team running the business, and the depot manager. The new management make up the acronym TEAM: a traffic manager, an engineering director, an accountant and the managing director. The acquired company is likely to be streamlined. At Western Travel, the Pounds 33m turnover group bought last year which operates in Gloucestershire, Warwickshire and South Wales, 12 separate companies were merged into three. Purchasing: Stagecoach achieves immediate cost savings of 1.5 per cent because of its superior purchasing power on spare parts, tyres and engine components. The fleet may be renewed. Stagecoach has bought 650 new buses since 1992 and ordered another 680. New buses, built by Walter Alexander in Falkirk using chassis from Volvo and Trinity, yield big savings being more reliable and requiring fewer spare parts. The average age of a Stagecoach fleet is 7.6 years compared with the industry average of 11. Productivity: If labour relations are unsatisfactory the company seeks a consolidated agreement with the unions. What Mr Souter calls 'Spanish customs' are eliminated or bought out. Improving the networks: 'It can take two years to put a network right if the previous management has messed it up,' says Mr Souter. 'That can happen if they continually responded to what the competition was doing and eroded the loyalty of existing passengers.' Once the network has been sorted out, new services can be developed. Fife Scottish introduced a hub and spoke system on its links between Fife and Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee, and has achieved 40 per cent revenue growth. 'Stagecoach is achieving genuine organic growth, which is rare among the new companies in what is, overall, a declining industry,' says Mr Huntley. Mr Souter says there was organic growth in nine subsidiaries last year. Stagecoach is now lifting its target operating margin for its original subsidiaries from 15 to 18 per cent. The company wants existing managers to implement changes so that they 'own' them. Though some senior executives in a subsidiary may leave on takeover, Stagecoach has consistently unlocked the potential of people in lesser positions after it moves in. Once the new subsidiaries have been restructured they are treated as autonomous provided they conform to standardised budgetary controls. Its opportunities for expansion in the UK will tail off when the bus industry settles down, though it aims to achieve UK turnover of Pounds 500m. With the London purchases it will exceed Pounds 360m on an annualised basis. And the Office of Fair Trading is unlikely to tolerate Stagecoach having more than a quarter of the UK bus market. But that would still allow it to double its present UK turnover. Mr Souter talks of Stagecoach having a global turnover of Pounds 1bn by 2000. Stagecoach's subsidiaries are already the frequent subject of OFT investigations, mainly over alleged unfair competition on routes. But Mr Souter says the investigations generally concern very small parts of the group's business. and receive disproportionate publicity because the OFT announces them to the Stock Exchange. When UK growth slows Stagecoach will turn more attention to expansion overseas. The overseas subsidiaries, managed by Mrs Gloag, only make a small contribution to profits but Mr Souter points out that they were mostly acquired very cheaply and sees immense opportunities for expansion as privatisation spreads.</p>

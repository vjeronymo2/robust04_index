			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Texas Air Changing Name: Seven weeks after losing control of Eastern Airlines,  Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo said the company would rename itself  Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. after its main subsidiary.  </P> <P> "The name change was made to reflect the fact that the principal business of  the company is Continental," Lorenzo told shareholders at the company's annual  meeting. He told reporters later that the change doesn't mean Texas Air has  given up completely on Eastern, but he declined to comment when asked whether  he believed he would regain control of the carrier. The name change takes  effect Monday.  </P></p>

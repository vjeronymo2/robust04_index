			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Sunday Times to launch credit card The Sunday Times is launching its own Visa card, claiming to be the first newspaper in the world to do so. The scheme will be administered by North West Securities, part of the Bank of Scotland, and offered to the paper's 3.7m readers this Sunday. Each copy of the paper will carry a temporary plastic privilege card valid for six weeks. This will offer discounts on a range of goods and services. Readers can apply for a permanent privilege card or the full Visa card, which has an annualised percentage rate of 18.9 per cent (20.7 per cent for cash advances). Holders are also offered legal assistance, free personal accident insurance and a facility to take over any existing credit card balance. Using the card earns points to receive the Sunday Times free for up to a year. Cardholders who spend Pounds 300 will get the paper free for 12 weeks. The offer follows the extensive publicity given to the credit card launch by GM, the car manufacturer.</p>

The second privately operated  mobile communications system is scheduled to go into operation  in early 1994. The system will be operated in the Berlin and  Leipzig regions.    Herbert Brenke complains that "whenever E-Plus looks for  sites for its transmitters, it finds that D1 and D2 have already  been there." The managing director of E-Plus Mobilfunk, the  third largest mobile communications company, knew as early as  April 1993 what lay in store for him. He would have to try to  operate in the same market that his competitors Telekom and  Mannesmann had entered two years earlier.    The launching of the new system is to be in eastern Germany,  where the need to catch up in the communications field is still  great. The inauguration of services in Berlin and Leipzig  simultaneously signals the rapidity with which the networks  between Ruegen and the Thuringian Forest will be connected up.    Since unification, Telekom has accomplished an incomparable  feat in East Germany. In its "Telekom 2000 Program," this  government-operated company set forth the schedule according to  which the state-of-the-art of communications in the new federal  states was to be brought up to the level existing in West  Germany.    Telekom is already way ahead of its own schedule. It will  conclude work on the digital communications system this year. In  the first half of 1993 alone, 540,000 customers in eastern  Germany were provided with telephone service, i.e., 53&percnt;  more  than in the entire previous year. Some 3,500 public telephones  were installed this year, mostly in rural areas; 12,000 phones  had to be replaced, 5,000 of which were inoperable.    The rapid tempo was made possible by the expeditious  installation of most of the digital trunk node exchanges and the  500 local digital exchanges. Every second local network was  substantially expanded and modernized. In late September,  Quedlinburg and Gera became the first cities in the world to  have a fiber-glass system in operation.    "These are the kind of accomplishments that bring the  company  considerable favorable recognition from abroad," Dr. Wilhelm  Paellmann, Telekom board member, said. With its 11 billion  German marks [DM] invested, Telekom is the greatest single  investor in the new federal states this year.    A considerable volume of the tasks in data and mobile  communications has already been resolved. Telekom established  its mobile communications sector this summer. The 100&percnt;  subsidiary is called "DeTeMobil." It is designed to make  D1-system users more flexible. D1 has at least 315,000 customers  in Germany. However, neither the subsidiary nor the parent  company enjoys the profits, since all proceeds go into the  common Post Office pot. Nonetheless, Brenke, the head of E-Plus,  has to reckon with both governmental as well as private mobile  communications competition. He has to operate with another  handicap as well. While the D-systems operate in the Global  System for Mobile Communications Standard at 900 mHz, the E-Plus  system is designed for a frequency range of 1.8 GHz. It  transmits and receives in the Standard DCS 1800 (Digital  Personal Communication System). However, given the same  transmitting power, the range of the higher frequencies is less.  Consequently, a transmitting and receiving station in the  E-system can only service a smaller area than one in the  D-system.    In its final expansion, E-Plus will have 4,000 to 6,000  cells  in Germany. Even Brenke doesn't know the final number yet. It  depends on the locations of the base stations. In large cities,  the radius of operation is between one and three kilometers,  while in a flat landscape it can be up to 20 kilometers.    Brenke's wish is for infrastructure-sharing: "We would  gladly  share transmitting masts and other facilities with our  competitors." Unfortunately, the market is a battle field. The  head of E-Plus is now hoping for a developmental breakthrough in  the matter of base stations and mobile telephones. He expects  smaller, lighter, and more powerful equipment and facilities so  that he would not have to incur the same expenditures as his two  competitors.    Brenke knows that there are also certain advantages when one  enters the market later. Potential customers have already  accepted mobile communications. In addition, the technology has  already matured and been perfected and can be procured at  cheaper rates. In late October, ESCOM offered Motorola's  International-3200 Handy along with the D2-card for a measly  DM389. This offer could drive the second million mobile  communications customers, who have been waiting for digital  systems and cheaper equipment, into the open arms of E-Plus  Mobilfunk GmbH.    But even this order of magnitude does not satisfy the  ambitious Herr Brenke at all. In the year 2000, ten million  customers will be using mobile communications systems in  Germany. Brenke will have a large part of them. His marketing  strategy is to open up new layers of buyers. "Mobile  communications must assume the certain aura of elegance. If they  are to be considered affordable, the potential private customers  will have to be convinced that the mobile telephone will create  new possibilities and a greater degree of personal freedom."</p>

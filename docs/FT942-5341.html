			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Arts: Renaissance of the Gothic master - The eccentric pioneer that architecture forgot There is hardly a town in Britain that would not look different today if Welby Pugin, the architect who began the 19th-century Gothic revival, had never lived. His influence spread with the Empire. From Bombay to Melbourne, the Gothic schools, country houses, churches, railway stations and horse troughs that dot the landscape owe their inspiration to him. In his work on the Palace of Westminster he gave London one of its greatest landmarks, Big Ben. As a theorist he was the first designer to formulate the modernist principle of 'truth to materials', and as a pioneer of flatpack furniture his presence still haunts Habitat today. Perhaps the only thing more remarkable than his achievements is the extent to which they have been written out of art history. This has something to do with Pugin himself. He was not by temperament or circumstances a conformist, falling foul of every institution he came into contact with, including Oxford University and the Vatican. After his death, in 1852, the Victorians preferred to forget him. He was born, in London, in 1812, the son of a French emigre illustrator and his English wife. The Pugins struggled to keep up genteel standards, but money was always short. Pugin got most of his education at home among the pupils in his father's drawing office and on family visits to France. A precocious only child, by the time he was 15 he had his first job - designing furniture for Windsor Castle. It was a debut that set the pace for the rest of his short, turbulent life. During the next six years he worked as a scene painter at Covent Garden and set up a furniture business that failed. He became a keen sailor, buying his own boat in which he imported antiques from the Continent to sell in Soho. At 17 he married for the first time, his wife dying in childbirth within a year. By the time he was 21 he had been ship-wrecked, bankrupted and widowed. He decided to become an architect. In 1834 the old Palace of Westminster burned down, watched by a huge crowd that included Lord Melbourne, Turner and Pugin himself. It marked a turning point in his career and in the history of architecture. In the competition to rebuild Parliament Pugin acted as Charles Barry's 'ghost', making the drawings for what turned out to be the winning design. Periodically for the rest of his life Pugin worked on the decorative details of the palace. He provided hundreds of designs for wallpaper, carpets, firedogs, the monarch's throne, from which the Queen's speech is still delivered, as well as the interior of the central lobby and the idea for Big Ben. But he had little respect for what is now his best-known work. He resented Barry's modifications and, as his own ideas evolved, he found himself working in a style he had outgrown. He had become a Roman Catholic - a socially disastrous move at that time - and it was his faith as much as his practice as an architect that shaped his ideas. They were laid out in his first book Contrasts in a series of illustrations comparing the buildings of the 19th century with those of the middle ages - to the advantage of the latter. He argued that modern architecture was not only ugly but inhumane, reflecting a moral as well as an aesthetic decline. Pugin spoke to a generation as troubled as our own about the moral aspects of architecture and city planning. His arguments struck home to a nation on the brink of the steam age. New buildings - factories, gas works and urban slums - were being run up without design. An architecture that was ethically and historically rooted was deeply attractive. Gothic, popular as a novelty style since the 18th century, quickly became a principled, national school of architecture. For 15 years Pugin worked at incredible speed on churches, cathedrals and private houses. He wrote more books, exploring the principles of medieval design and applying them with radical originality to his own work. He employed no clerk - 'I'd kill him in a week' - and fitted in his work for Barry when he could. But he always made time to design any small thing, a tea caddy for example, that his wife might want. Pugin married three times and had eight children. An affectionate man for whom domestic life was central, he never lost sight of the humanising influence of Gothic. The alms houses he designed in Lincoln are still in use. For more than a century the elderly inhabitants have been grateful for the cloister walk that allows them to visit one another sheltered from rain and wind. These small, efficient houses are the essence of the man, as much as the sumptuousness of his great church of St Giles, Cheadle. By the late 1840s his practice had begun to decline. Other architects took up his ideas and won the commissions. Most of them were cheaper and all were easier to work with. Pugin would arrive on site in the sailing clothes he always wore, shout instructions at the workmen and disappear on the next train. He overspent budgets and was spectacularly tactless with his patrons. As a design theorist he began to be overtaken by John Ruskin. On the religious front, the Catholic revival was now led by Cardinal John Henry Newman who made heroic efforts to accommodate Pugin but could not understand his devotion to Gothic. Asked if he would build an oratory, Pugin told the cardinal he would rather design a mechanics' institute. His swan song was the Medieval Court at the Great Exhibition of 1851, which persuasively promoted Gothic as a domestic style. The next year, aged 40, he lapsed suddenly into insanity. He had contracted mercury poisoning from the eye baths his doctors gave him for inflammation. Within six months he was dead. He had always been eccentric and intense, so his final illness made it easy to dismiss him as a madman. He was already forgotten when Gilbert Scott built the Albert Memorial. Finding there was no provision for a statue of Pugin, Scott gallantly gave up the space reserved for his own. Pugin's place in history, however, continued to be denied. Reappraisal of his work began in this century with Kenneth Clark and has now led to an important exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum. At last he can take up the position he deserves, alongside Ruskin and William Morris, in the history of English art and ideas. Rosemary Hill is working on a biography of Pugin to be published by Hamish Hamilton. Pugin: A Gothic Passion opens at the V&amp;A on June 15 from 10.00-17.30 Tuesday to Sunday, and 12.00-17.30 Monday. It runs until September 11. Admission: Pounds 4.75 adult, Pounds 10.50 family rate, Pounds 3.50 concessions. The catalogue by Paul Atterbury and Clive Wainwright, is published by Yale University Press, price Pounds 45 cloth, Pounds 19.95 paperback, 320 pages. The exhibition is sponsored by Pearson.</p>

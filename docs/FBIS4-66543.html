			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kumar Ananda: "Arjun Singh's Opposition to GATT </F> is beginning to be Apparent"]    [Text] New Delhi, 31 March. Human Resources Minister Arjun  Singh is not satisfied with his own government over the General  Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT). He wrote a letter to  Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji about a week ago. He expressed  his concerns over GATT in this letter. This letter was not  circulated. However, he was not ready to respond to the  opposition's allegations although he was the chairman of the  cabinet sub-committee on GATT. Yesterday, Janata Dal's Nitish  Kumar took a shot at him for his failure to speak on behalf of  the government. It is believed that there is very little  possibility of this issue being discussed in the 4 April  Congress Working Committee meeting.    According to some sources, Parliamentary Affairs Minister  Vidyacharan Shukla wrote a letter to some senior cabinet members  asking them to give a time and date to present the government's  side on GATT. Arjun Singh did not think it necessary to respond  to this letter. Secondly, he was in the Lok Sabha for a long  time during the first day of discussion on 29th March. However,  he was missing the next day. Since the Congress Party had not  issued a whip on this debate, there is not basis for a  disciplinary action against Arjun Singh. Also, he was asked to  speak for the government, but was not ordered to do so.    Those close to Arjun Singh call it their leader's opposition  on principle. They argue that half of the Congress legislators  were not present during the debate. They consider their absence  as a disagreement with GATT and agreement with Arjun Singh. As  for the letter written to Pranab Mukherji, Arjun Singh had  supported making the government's stand transparent on GATT.  This letter also mentioned the decision of the cabinet  sub-committee. The sub-committee had talked with the  representatives from different areas including trade and  business about their reactions to GATT. It suggested having  detailed discussion on various proposals included in GATT. Arjun  Singh had asked in this letter to invite opposition leaders and  discuss this with them. Arjun Singh says that efforts should be  made to get the political parties and the nation in confidence  on this issue. However, despite repeated requests, the  government did have detailed discussions on it in the Parliament.    These lines written by Arjun Singh can be seen as a part of  the incident related to George Fernandes, the leader of  anti-GATT group. Fernandes had a long talk with Arjun Singh on  14 February expressing his concerns over GATT. In this talk held  at Arjun Singh's residence, George Fernandes had informed him of  all the dangers. According to George Fernandes, Arjun Singh had  not said any thing, but his expression showed agreement with  him. Fernandes suggested that the effect of this conversation  did not allow his conscience to defend the government.    The issue of one-person-one-position and Arjun Singh writing  several letters to the Party President Narasimha Rao over the  Ayodhya and the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] issues are  considered his challenging for leadership. However, the vidhan  sabha elections in the six states stopped this exchange of  letters. Now the opposition appears to be united in opposition  to GATT as it never was during the Rao administration. The BJP  and the non-BJP parties had divided over the Ayodhya issue.  However, the whole opposition has risen against the government  over the GATT issue. Perhaps, that is why Arjun Singh is  encouraged. However, the Rao camp does not appear to be in a  mood to give much attention to his letter. Mr. Rao's supporters  say that a person who is in the government and is playing the  role of opposition cannot be taken seriously. If Arjun Singh had  such strong feelings then he should have first resigned from the  cabinet.    Secondly, there is a danger in the way Arjun Singh had put a  question mark on Narasimha Rao's leadership by writing letters  repeatedly over the Ayodhya issue. The whole opposition is  accusing the government of selling the country and mortgaging  the nation's sovereignty. The government and the ruling party  want to counter the opposition's propaganda by holding rallies,  meetings, and debates. However, when a senior leader of the  government and ruling party makes his fears public over the GATT  issue, the opposition definitely will gain strength. How much  support will Arjun Singh get within the Congress Party? This is  a matter for conjecture.</p>

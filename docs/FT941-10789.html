			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Lloyd's claims settled below value Increasing numbers of syndicates at Lloyd's of London are striking deals with policyholders settling probable future claims at less than their full potential value. Some observers suspect this practice, known as commutation, could harm the reputation of a market that has traditionally boasted of its principle of meeting all claims in full. But commutation is becoming increasingly common in other areas of the international insurance marketplace and it could help Lloyd's to manage potentially overwhelming liabilities stemming from US asbestosis and pollution cases. 'We are talking to more and more people about doing deals on casualty claims,' said Mr Richard Keeling, deputy chairman of Lloyd's. 'It is a more sensible way of doing business.' Lloyd's, traditionally an important insurer of US liability risks, has been badly hit by a massive escalation of legal awards, especially from asbestos-related diseases and pollution. Lloyd's holds more than Pounds 4bn in reserves to meet future claims, though according to some estimates more money will be needed if the market is to fully protect itself. Detailed figures showing the scale of commutation are not available. But some underwriters specialising in 'long tail' liability business - in which claims may arise many years after the inception of the policy - are settling up to 5 per cent of notified claims in this fashion. Payments vary depending on the potential strength of the claim. Recently some syndicates have paid policyholders in US pollution cases only 5 cents per dollar of claim. In exchange for cash now, syndicates can sharply reduce their liabilities. Both insurer and policyholder can avoid paying potentially crippling legal costs. Legal costs in some US liability cases can amount to a third or more of a total claim. The difficulties of the Lloyd's market in the past two to three years and policyholders' perceptions of financial weakness has made them much more willing to consider commutation. 'Until three years ago the climate was not favourable for Lloyd's to talk about commutation,' explained Mr Peter Matthews, of Matthews Consultants, an actuarial firm. But he said: 'Lloyd's is becoming more commercially aware like the rest of the insurance market.' Mr Alan Pollard, chief executive of Syndicate Underwriting Management, which handles claims on behalf of more than 80 syndicates which are no longer in business, said: 'There is no doubt that the opportunity for reducing old-year liabilities through commutation is really quite enormous.' The number of commuted claims is likely to increase if Lloyd's succeeds in its project to establish NewCo, a reinsurance company, which will be owned initially by the Lloyd's Corporation. 'Now is the time to get certainty,' said Mr Keeling, who is expected to chair the new company. 'Uncertainty costs money. Certainty is bankable.'</p>

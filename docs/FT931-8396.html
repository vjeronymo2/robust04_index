			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Letter: A better beer Sir, With regard to your promotion 'Enjoy Club Europe: two for the price of one - Vienna', I make this comment. The saying Gut, Besser, Goesser is not a typical saying of the Viennese. Goesser is a Styrian beer and Gut, Besser, Goesser is a slogan of the Steirerbraeu AG, a Styrian company, which produces and promotes Goesser Bier. As a Styrian I would like to invite you to Austria and taste the difference between the Styrian beer and the beer produced near Vienna - you will stay in Styria forever.

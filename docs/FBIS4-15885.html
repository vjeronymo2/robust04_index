			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 70 (559); </F> Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by  Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] President Askar Akayev has rejected accusations that  his decree to push forward the agrarian reform was  anticonstitutional.    He told parliament on Tuesday that the decree, allowing the  free sale and purchase of land, among other things, meets all  key provisions in the legislation on land, for instance limiting  the term of private land tenure to 49 years.    Akayev denied "rumors being spread in the press and society"  that the decree allows land to be sold to foreigners. It gives  the right to buy land to citizens of Kyrgyzstan only, he said.    At a government meeting on Tuesday, he reaffirmed that more  radical economic reforms were his government's main task.    He also urged stronger government at all levels. As one of  the measures to achieve that purpose, the president, according  to his spokesman Iman Rysaliyev, proposed strengthening akimat,  the system of local government bodies headed by akims  (governors).    Akayev denied that there is any connection between the  falling production and the crisis of the political system in  Kyrgyzstan. He said that, despite all the difficulties the  economic reforms had brought about, some achievements had been  made, primarily in monetary policy. Thus, last month the  inflation rate went down to 5 percent and the prices stabilized.    Akayev said the main economic goal was to produce within  Kyrgyzstan at least 90 percent of the raw materials the  country's industry needs.    He also called for an end to political speculations about  Kyrgyzstan's gold industry. He insisted that the government  take urgent measures to ensure that foreign companies, notably  Canadian and American, at last start developing the country's  gold fields. IF Note: The Kyrgyz Government, on Akayev's  instructions, recently approved a gold industry program spanning  a period until the year 2010. The program, called The Gold of  Kyrgyzstan, gives technical and economic information on more  than 60 gold deposits, 16 of which are ready to be developed.  Development of more than 60 percent of deposits is to be funded  by investment made by joint ventures to be formed with companies  both from former Soviet and other countries.</p>

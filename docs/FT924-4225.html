			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / GEC caution on dividend disappoints City THE General Electric Company disappointed City optimists with a cautious 5 per cent rise in its interim dividend yesterday, in spite of a near doubling of its cash mountain to more than Pounds 1bn. The company also announced that Sir David Scholey, chairman of Warburg, is to join the board. Sir David had been widely tipped as the next governor of the Bank of England. This would appear to be ruled out by the GEC appointment, as the governor is not allowed to hold outside posts. GEC hailed sterling's recent devaluation as of major importance to its export business. It also said the translation of its overseas earnings at sterling's lower rate would be worth Pounds 40m pre-tax over a 12-month period. The company, which has not always been a supporter of government policy, also welcomed the reduction in interest rates and government plans for private financing of public projects. These should provide impetus for growth and create new opportunities, it said. GEC's pre-tax profits rose 3 per cent to Pounds 356m, on sales 5 per cent lower. Earnings per share were up 4 per cent. In divisional terms, the strongest performance came in power systems, where profits were 18 per cent ahead. Net cash within GEC itself rose to Pounds 1.07bn from Pounds 602m, while its share of cash held in joint ventures rose from Pounds 425m to Pounds 733m. This was partly because recessionary conditions and lower sales had allowed it to reduce working capital. However, the timing of tax and dividend payments meant there might be a small outflow of cash in the second half. GEC's UK business in power generating equipment would not be affected by the debate over UK energy policy, as the company supplies equipment for power stations of all types including nuclear. Demand for its products was affected only by overall demand for electricity, it said. The company said it felt more confident than in recent months about the future of the European Fighter Aircraft, to which it is a leading supplier. It also confirmed that it was interested in principle in combining parts of the defence business of British Aerospace with its own, though there was no suggestion that talks were taking place.

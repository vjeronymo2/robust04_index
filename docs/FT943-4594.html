			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / New measure of inflation trends unveiled A new statistical system for predicting inflation trends was unveiled yesterday by a City bank amid claims that it provides a more reliable guide than those used by the Bank of England. The system, developed by broker Goldman Sachs, sets out to create leading indicators for inflation using a composite basket of economic data - a method broadly similar to the Central Statistical Office's cyclical leading indicators for the UK economy. The concept of creating a composite leading indicator for inflation has recently received considerable attention among economists and academics. Goldman Sachs is the first City bank to unveil a leading inflation indicator. It says that its system is needed because the separate indicators used by the Bank of England to determine when an interest rate rise might be required are not providing particularly reliable forecasts of future inflation trends. At present the Bank assesses whether monetary tightening is needed by taking an overall view of six factors - average earnings, market inflation expectations, commodity prices, corporate profit margins, capacity contraints and M0, the narrowest measure of money supply. The Bank of England said yesterday it was 'watching with interest' the debate about using composite leading indicators. Mr David Walton, senior economist at Goldman Sachs, admitted that one shortcoming of the new system was that the lag between turning points in the series and future inflation trends had been highly variable. Nevertheless, he warned that the series strongly suggested that the downward trend in underlying retail price inflation would end this year, and might have occurred already. Goldman Sachs' shorter leading index - composed of average earnings, import price and long-dated gilt yields data - has risen since the beginning of January. In the past four decades a rise in this series has always heralded a rise in inflation - usually about six months in advance, but the lag has varied between one and 10 months. The longer leading index, which incorporates a range of economic data and appears to predict trends 20 months in advance, has been rising steadily for 36 months. Lags in this series have varied in the past between five and 44 months.</p>

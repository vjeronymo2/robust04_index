			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Newsletter" by GUANGMING RIBAO reporters Zhao Xueli (6392 </F> 1331 4409) and Yuan Xinwen (5913 2450 2429) and XINHUA reporters  Jiang Qianfeng (3068 6929 1496) and Yin Hongzhu (1438 7703  4376): "Make Educational Development A Strategic Priority -- An  Account of Beijing's Practice of Respecting Teachers and  Stressing Education"]    [Excerpts] Beijing, 20 Apr (XINHUA) -- The educational  circle of Beijing experienced two pleasant events in 1993:  After seven years of hard work, Beijing led the country in  basically universalizing the nine-year compulsory educational  system and in essentially eliminating illiteracy among young and  middle-aged people. This was the fruit of all-out efforts by  Beijing Municipality over the past few years to promote the  practice of respecting teachers and stressing education, as well  as the practical turns it did for education. [passage omitted]    In 1982, Chen Xitong, who had just assumed the mayoralty,  attended a meeting of the municipal committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] to hear  opinions. Several CPPCC members presented their cases  passionately, expressing their views and raising questions  before him. Their sharp words revealed their true and sincere  feelings. Chen Xitong expressed his heartfelt thanks for the  "friends who do not hesitate to offer admonition." On a  blackboard in a suburban normal school which he visited shortly  thereafter, he saw a newly composed verse to the effect that  education was not being given due attention, that nobody cared  about the poor teachers, and that "nobody showed compassion" for  education, which resembled an orphan. Once again, the new mayor  was deeply moved by the words. He felt that he would not be  able to justify himself before the people, and would be  negligent in his duties, if he did not make up his mind to  improve educational services in Beijing.    At that time, there was a lack of common understanding about  education. Some comrades asked: If we stress education, what  about other professions? If we raise teachers' salaries, what  should we do about the pay of other workers and staff members?  [passage omitted]    Reviewing that period, Chen Xitong, who is now secretary of  the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee, said: The key to whether  education is truly considered important lies in determination on  the part of leaders at all levels. Only by conducting  investigations and studies in schools can we understand the  conditions of schools, teachers, and the practical problems and  hardships in running schools; only by doing so can we develop  feelings toward education. When leaders at all levels show real  feelings for education, they will develop a common language and  show a common determination. [passage omitted]    Chen Xitong said: Competition in today's society ultimately  consists in vying for professionally trained people. We cannot  merely ferret out such people; the more important thing is to  train them. If we now invest our money in education, we shall  have large numbers of useful people in the future for our  modernization drive. [passage omitted]    During the interview [not previously mentioned; date and  place not given], Chen Xitong told the reporters: The party  Central Committee and the State Council take educational work  seriously. Although Beijing has achieved some success in  educational work, it still falls far short of the demands of the  central authorities and people throughout the municipality, and  there remain quite a few problems. At present, further efforts  should be undertaken to deepen educational reform and improve  teachers' salaries and living quarters. More school buildings  need to be constructed so that schools will not institute the  "two-shift system" to cope with yet another surge in enrollment.  Further efforts should be made to solve new problems and  difficulties in connection with school administration. We must  remain level-headed, identify areas where we are lagging,  continue our efforts, devote great efforts to educational  reform, and resolutely improve education.</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Survey of Residential Property (4): Bureaucracy: the new Berlin wall - Legal and ownership disputes have snarled the market in the former east Germany / International WHEN the Berlin Wall was dismantled in November 1989, those who had never dared set foot in the former east Germany were surprised by what they saw. In spite of the former communist regime's attempts to pull down many fine buildings in east Berlin, some were spared the bulldozers. The Dom, the beautiful Protestant cathedral where some of the Prussian kings are buried, and the Synogogue are just two examples. Both have now been restored. As the visitor drives northwards through the rolling plains of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the Baltic coast, or southwards through small, cobble-stoned villages in Saxony and Thuringia, he or she will see numerous houses standing empty and in need of repair. These properties should have been snapped up by now by property developers, speculators and former owners. But what was once considered a dream, providing rich pickings for those with cash, has turned into a nightmare for some wanting to buy property in the five new Lander, or states. The root of the problem rests with the unification treaty of 1990. The treaty gives former owners, whose property was confiscated between 1933 and 1945 or between 1949 and 1990, the right to claim back their property or seek compensation. The law was amended two years ago to give investors priority over restitution, provided that the claimant could not match the investor, particularly in terms of property development which would provide employment. Once that was proved, the investor paid compensation to the original owner. But as investors and individuals wishing to buy a plot of land are finding out, things are not so simple. Anyone wanting to buy land or property in eastern Germany must first establish whether there are any outstanding claims on that property. This means going to the local Landesamt, which holds a record of some land titles, or applying directly to Barby, eastern Germany's central land registry. The latter contains almost every single land title for the country. The problem is, the 15 kilometres of thick, leather-bound titles are not computerised. Moreover, some of the land registries were destroyed, had pages torn out, or in some cases the Nazis or the communists blotted out the names of the original owners so that - particularly in the case of Jewish families who survived the Holocaust - they would not return and reclaim their property. In a bizarre twist of history, I have been told several times by lawyers that former Nazis who concealed the names of the original Jewish owners are now trying to reclaim that property. The staff at Barby - which was used as a Russian garrison after the second world war, later as a hostel for Gastarbeiter, or guest workers, and then as a land registry tightly controlled by the Stasi, or state security police - have since installed infra-red equipment which can penetrate the blacked-out titles. But the process takes time. At present, 1.21m claimants are seeking restitution or compensation for 2.6m titles throughout eastern Germany. The expiry date for registering a land claim was December 31 1992, but the 4,000 officials processing the claims have only resolved about 22 per cent of all cases. In cities such as Leipzig and Halle, claims have proceeded very slowly; indeed, the success rate is as low as 6 per cent in Halle, the birthplace of George Friedrich Handel. Klaus Rauen, the mayor, throws up his hands in despair. 'Without resolving all these property rights, we cannot speed up investment. Moreover, we need to settle these claims so that we can renovate the buildings in the centre of our city.' Cities such as Leipzig and Berlin are awash with property consultants who set up offices after 1989 in the expectation that they could acquire land quickly and cheaply. But Stefan Brendgen, a consultant for Jones Lang Wootton, the UK property consultant also based in Frankfurt and Berlin, is more realistic. He says property claims are moving a bit faster, but those wanting to buy must have 'patience, money, and a good lawyer'. Patience is needed because the bureaucracy is so slow. Although government officials stress that establishing the title on land can be resolved within two months, claimants and property developers say many cases take at least nine months - if not longer. Moreover, claimants complain that local officials delay in replying to letters and demand more evidence of original ownership. Claimants also say that low-level officials are bribed by property speculators to dissuade the original owner from pursuing a claim. Money is needed because claimants not wanting to regain their property will be looking for compensation at the market rate. And a lawyer is crucial to establish, check, and negotiate the final purchase, restitution or compensation claims. The investor faces another potential problem. It concerns property expropriated by the former Soviet Union when it controlled eastern Germany between 1945 and 1949. Under the terms of the unification treaty, those whose property was expropriated during this period are not entitled to restitution or compensation. The government in Bonn claims that the Soviet Union made the non-return of this property a pre-condition of German unification. Many of these former property owners were aristocratic land-owners and large entrepreneurs. In recent months, Daimler-Benz and other land-owners have begun to challenge the Soviet veto on the ground that Moscow never laid down such a pre-condition for unification. Whether they can prove this in the courts is another matter. But it places a question mark over the status of this land, which totals 13,000 square miles. Some is under the Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising eastern German industry. Some is rented out to small farmers. Perhaps this is an unduly bleak picture of the property market in eastern Germany. But there is hardly an official in any of the five Lander who does not agree that outstanding Vermogensfragen - property questions - is one of the principle headaches of unification. All admit, too, that the problem will need at least 10 years to resolve. The longer it takes, the longer the delay in property prices finding their real market value.</p>

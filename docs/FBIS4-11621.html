			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments monitored through 26 April.    Petroven [Venezuelan Petroleum] directors on 19 April  disclosed that the company earned over $1 billion in profits  from its participation in foreign firms. The Petroven board of  directors met with a group of congressmen to explain the scope  of their foreign business dealings. The company owns 100  percent of Citgo Petroleum Corporation, a refinery and  by-product distribution company on the U.S. east coast. It also  holds shares in other international firms.

The  labor minister says that although urban and suburban minimum  wages were increased to 15,000 and 12,5000 bolivares  respectively, those raises represent an additional expense of  only 10 billion bolivares. He points out, however, that the pay  raise granted by the previous administration to the government's  professional and technical employees will have a greater impact  on the state's passive assets. Meanwhile, the Caldera  administration is working to guarantee that resources are  available to cover the raises granted to professionals and  technicians, which are retroactive to 1 January.

The magazine  commented: "They are powerful figures in industrial development  and represent important trends. Over the next few years, they  will play an influential role on a broad scale."    When he was interviewed again this time around, Rong Yiren  was already the PRC's vice president. Nevertheless, his wise  eyes, kindly smile, and cordial tone remained  unchanged...[ellipses as received]  <H5>  In the New Post </H5>   Rong Yiren was elected PRC vice president at the First  Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] on 27  March 1993. It is now fully 10 months later.    Rong Yiren said: "I was vice chairman of the NPC Standing  Committee, chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and  Commerce [ACFIC], and chairman of CITIC. However, I spent the  better part of my time on CITIC's business. Now that I have  assumed the Vice Presidency, I have resigned my posts as CITIC  and ACFIC chairman."    "In my position as vice president, I mainly assist the  president in some work," said Rong Yiren. As vice president,  Rong Yiren has had a very busy schedule of state functions since  April 1993. He visited Portugal and Spain, and received and met  88 delegations from various parts of the world, as well as from  the Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao area. Shortly after the new  year began, he met a number of important visitors, such as the  Azerbaijani foreign minister, the Zimbabwean foreign minister,  U.S. senators, and the Romanian minister of state.    Asked whether he was busier than in the past after assuming  the vice presidency, Rong Yiren said: "I cannot say that I am  busier because I also had a lot of work to do at CITIC, only  that my current job is more politically oriented and more  demanding."    He said: As vice president, I represent national interests  and the national honor. In dealing with foreigners, we should  brief them factually on China's situation, provide them  information on matters that they want to understand, and  patiently explain things that they do not quite understand. We  should respect both our guests and ourselves, but our main  purpose is to enhance and expand international contact and  friendship.  <H5>  "President Jiang Zemin Takes My Opinions Seriously" </H5>   Rong Yiren said: "In performing my work, I often exchange  views with President Jiang Zemin. President Jiang Zemin takes  my opinions seriously. We cooperate very well."    On his relations with President Jiang Zemin, Rong Yiren  recalled happily: "Our friendship has existed for a long time,  and our relations have always been good. Our contacts were  especially numerous in 1979, when Jiang Zemin was vice chairman  of the State Commission on the Administration of Foreign  Investment and I was the adviser.    "When Jiang Zemin was subsequently appointed minister of the  electronics industry and I was the head of CITIC, we also had a  lot of contacts relating to our work. When Jiang Zemin was  mayor of Shanghai and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party  Committee, I made a point of visiting with him when I went to  Shanghai."    Speaking of his domestic tasks, Rong Yiren said that because  his previous work had primarily been in the economic field, his  main domestic tasks had been to conduct investigations and study  to find out about the situation, as well as to review the  findings and present them to relevant departments in the form of  ideas and suggestions.    On top of his busy schedule of receiving foreign guests,  Rong  Yiren spent a lot of time reviewing materials and studying  issues. Last May and November, he successively visited Jiangsu  Province and Tianjin Municipality to investigate and learn about  the situation there; he gained a lot from those visits. He  said: "By and large, my work has proceeded very smoothly."  <H3>  The Year 1993 Laid a Very Good Foundation for Future  Development </H3>   In evaluating China's economic situation in 1993, Rong Yiren  said: Generally speaking, 1993 was a year in which we  implemented Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, seized opportunities, deepened reform,  developed the economy rapidly and satisfactorily, and continued  to score success. China's situation underwent tremendous  changes after Deng Xiaoping delivered his talks during his tour  of southern China in early 1992. At the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee last year, we finally reached  a consensus regarding the experience we had gained from more  than a decade of exploration: to establish a socialist market  economic system.    Rong Yiren said: The Chinese economy grew at an average  rate of around 9 percent annually between 1980 and 1991, and it  grew 12.8 percent in 1992 and around 13 percent in 1993. This  continuous rapid growth is rare in the world. The reason China  scored tremendous achievements in economic construction last  year was primarily the result of its emphasis on deepening  reform, opening up wider to the outside world, and strengthening  macroeconomic regulations and control, which enabled economic  construction to proceed more orderly than in the past. At  present, China is socially and politically stable, its  agriculture continues to reap bumper harvests, its industrial  production grows rapidly, its domestic market enjoys brisk  business, its foreign trade is active, its people's livelihood  continues to improve, and its overall economic strength is  increasing. All this has laid a good foundation for further  development in 1994 and after.    He said: In light of China's basic situation and the  intrinsic need for establishing a socialist market economic  structure, China's next-step reform will, on the whole, still be  carried out in an orderly way, step by step, and actively but  prudently. Whenever a reform measure is promulgated, the  capability of the state and the people to stand strains will be  taken into full consideration so as to foster both economic  development and social stability through reform.    Speaking of this year's growth rate, Rong Yiren believed the  currently set 9 percent rate is well-founded. He said:  "Although the rate is a bit lower than that of the last year,  it is actually not low. China's economy will follow the course  of sustained, rapid, and healthy development. Nine percent is a  fairly reasonable rate. The growth rate is set between 8 and 9  percent for the entire Eighth Five-Year Plan precisely because  this will help arouse the initiatives of all quarters while  ensuring the healthy and orderly progress of economic  construction."    Rong Yiren stressed: Among reform, development, and  stability, reform takes the lead. Without reform, there would  be no development. Meanwhile, without stability -- that is  without social and political stability -- reform and development  would become idle talk. This is why we consider development the  purpose, reform the motive power, and stability the guarantee.  We hope to promote development through reform. Only with  development of the economy and improvement of the people's  living standards can there be political and social stability.  Moreover, stability will further help deepen the reform. This  is the main experience of China's reform and opening up over the  last decade and more.  <H3>  It Is Still Necessary To Stress Plain Living and Hard  Struggle Today </H3>   Rong Yiren said: Although we have made great achievements in  economic development, we still have a long way to go to reach  our goal. We have set the goal to build the country into a  moderately developed country within half a century. We still  have a long way to go to reach this goal, and we still need to  exert considerable efforts.    He said: "It is still necessary for China to advocate plain  living and hard struggle, and diligence and frugality, and to  make further progress with a strong determination." He  criticized certain localities for being wasteful and extravagant  as soon as their economic conditions improve. He said: "This  development is very bad; it should be resolutely stopped."    Rong Yiren said: We cannot turn China into a modern  socialist country with Chinese characteristics without going  through a long period of plain living and hard struggle to  overcome one difficulty after another. Our principle is:  Strive to minimize twists and turns to make development more  steady.    Speaking of relations between the Chinese mainland and Hong  Kong, Rong Yiren said: Hong Kong, as an important international  financial and trade region, is closely tied to the mainland's  economic development. The considerable growth of Hong Kong's  international trade volume in recent years cannot be separated  from the mainland's development and support. This is precisely  as Premier Li Peng has said: "Hong Kong's economy and that of  the mainland have become inseparable."    Rong Yiren said: Recently, because of the British  Government's failure to keep its words and because of its  uncooperative attitude, the Sino-British talks have broken down.  This has created certain trouble and problems. It is natural  that the Hong Kong compatriots should become worried. However,  no matter what happens, the Chinese Government will adhere to  the principles of "one country, two systems" and "letting the  people in Hong Kong administer Hong Kong." This principle will  not change. Together with patriotic compatriots in all circles  of Hong Kong, we will adhere to the principle of the "Basic Law"  to maintain long-term stability and prosperity in Hong Kong.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Consortium edges nearer to bid for Independent The consortium put together by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the main founder of The Independent newspaper, yesterday edged closer to making a bid for Newspaper Publishing, the company that publishes The Independent and the Independent on Sunday. The consortium said it was considering making an offer for the 52.9 per cent of the company held by institutional shareholders and not already controlled by its members. The move came after Mirror Group Newspapers - a member of the consortium - confirmed it was ready to take 40 per cent of the loss-making company. The consortium also includes the founders of The Independent and the two largest existing shareholders, the Spanish and Italian newspaper groups El Pas and La Republica. Detailed discussions on the price of any such deal are likely to start immediately as pressure is mounting for an early resolution of the struggling group's future. Noting the announcement, Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Newspaper Publishing, said a committee of non-executive directors would consider the proposal. It would also discuss with the consortium the proposed terms. It is believed that potential rival bidders, such as Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland, are waiting to see what the Whittam Smith-MGN consortium proposes before making a counter-offer. However, it now appears that Mr O'Reilly might have to make a full bid for the company if he wants to block a consortium bid. The members of the consortium have signed undertakings that no one else can come in unless all agree. Mr Hay Davison said the board committee would 'assess the alternatives available to Newspaper Publishing on their merits'. Further delay is likely, however. It is unlikely that any alternative bids for the company will be put before this Thursday's routine monthly board meeting. Mr Whittam Smith expressed delight at the consortium agreement. He said it meant 'our editorial independence will be assured and we will be able to reduce our costs with increased investment in The Independent and the Independent on Sunday.' MGN has said it will renounce the right to vote on the hiring and firing of editors. Mr David Montgomery, chief executive of MGN, conceded that Newspaper Publishing would not be a goldmine, but said it represented a good long-term investment that would take the popular newspaper group into a different sector of the market. At The Independent, journalists rejected the proposed deal with MGN as incompatible with the editorial independence of the titles. The National Union of Journalists chapel (branch) resolution also questioned whether Mr Montgomery was a suitable person to be involved with The Independent. Once a formal bid is made, the issue will have to be considered under monopolies legislation. A reference to the Monopolies Commission is automatic for newspaper deals involving combined circulations of 300,000 unless the life of a paper is threatened.

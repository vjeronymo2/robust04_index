			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Keep family and firm together - A feud among relatives is especially harmful when they own a business Once a family that owns a business gets down to serious feuding, both the familial ties and the company are at risk. One remedy is to set up a 'family council' - a practice which has been adopted by some continental European companies. Its aim is to reach consensus on difficult issues. The family and the company are two disparate systems. The family invokes the idea of stability, caring, co-operation and fidelity; the company focuses on change, evaluation, competition and efficiency. Family proprietors have to find ways to minimise the inevitable and dangerous conflicts between the business and the family - or face the risk of a commercially damaging argument. An effective family council comprises chosen members of the owning family that meet regularly to discuss concerns of the family as a family as well as the family business. The council provides a forum that can discuss issues such as: what do we stand for as a family?; what is our responsibility to each other and to the outside world?; and what is the family's role in relation to the business? The council should encourage shareholders, heirs, spouses and other family members to talk to each other, enabling them to anticipate problems, such as a lack of liquid assets or succession, and to seek equitable solutions. The very existence of a council also serves the purpose of reminding employees of the family's continued interest in and concerns for the enterprise. A family council that shares anecdotes about, say, the founder or episodes in the company history keeps alive and refines the traditions that the family - and the business - value. The council can pass these to the next generation, while instilling a sense of responsibility towards company and community. Family council meetings are appropriate for discussing philanthropical objectives, contributions to cultural schemes, improving the company's image by sponsoring social activities, and so on. It can inculcate among family members the notion that the privilege of ownership brings financial advantages but also generates responsibilities. A family council is one of the best ways to help the business family to explore what ties them together - and that helps to prevent conflicts that could harm the company. The council can also develop a family spirit that encourages consensus as well as effective and constructive communication. The tricky issue of transferring ownership and management to the next generation is probably the most significant factor in the demise of family companies. It is important that the ambitions of children, expectations of the retiring generation, the option to sell or merge and the repurchasing of shares, to name a few debating points, are considered and studied freely by the council. Precise rules - such as age, education, training and experience - should be laid down and observed when family members take certain jobs in the company. Conditions for promotion, transfer and leaving should be made explicit. The selection process of a new chief executive officer, whether or not a member of the family, may also be eased by discussion in the il. Many family company boards of directors exist to rubber stamp decisions or to take an advisory role. Such arrangements suit certain companies, but at some point the composition of the board can make the difference between success and failure. The effectiveness of boards whose membership only reflects various interest groups in the family can be seriously hampered. Family councils can be an excellent forum for determining the ideal number and qualifications of board members, family or non-family, thus increasing the board's professionalism and effectiveness. Some families use their council for choosing who represents the family on the board. Resistance to forming a family council tends to come from those who have power and responsibility in the company. They do not like sharing information because they fear criticism and loss of authority. But these concerns can be allayed by keeping to some rules. A family council should not be used for solving problems directly linked to management of the company. Day-to-day operation of the business is not a suitable subject for debate by the council. This means drawing clear lines between the family and the company that are understood by family members and top management. A family council must not intrude on the functions of the board or of the general management, but should keep to its distinct role - defining and preserving certain family values, both as a family and as owners of the business. It is particularly unfortunate if a family council is exploited for influencing or even manipulating certain members of the family to gain advantage in purely personal matters. The council is effective only if the common interests and the objectives of such meetings have been clearly stated - perhaps in a document - a kind of constitution or mission for the family. This would set out the values and aims that the family adheres to and the way they should be expressed towards the company and the community. It would be the basis for fixing objectives and practical strategies, and for steering a joint effort. Family councils are not a cure-all and must be tailored for each family and its business. What they do offer is a formal way of getting relatives to talk to each other usefully and make better business decisions.

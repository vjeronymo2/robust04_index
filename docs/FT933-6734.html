			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Saudis review petrochemicals after plant rift SAUDI ARABIA'S cancellation of an Dollars 800m (Pounds 534m) project to build a plant at Yanbu on the Red Sea coast, for the production of petrol additives, has set off a review of the kingdom's entire strategy in petrochemicals. This could lead to more involvement by Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, in the sector, but is also likely to delay private sector interest in petrochemicals projects for the duration of the review. The planned joint venture at Yanbu was to build a plant for producing methyl tertiary butyl ether - an environmentally friendly alternative to lead in petrol. The venture, known as Arabian American Chemical Company, was jointly owned by Mobil, the US oil company, and Arabian Chemical Investments Corporation - a private Saudi company headed by Mr Luay Nazer, son of the Saudi oil minister. When the project was cancelled on August 9, a Saudi official said this was because of the need to formulate a clear policy for investment by the state and private sector in the petrochemical industries. Mobil expressed its disappointment at the cancellation. The company had been working on plans for the plant, which would have had an 800,000-tonne annual output, for several years. The episode marks a rare public rift between a foreign oil company and the Saudi authorities. Mobil had made many commitments to the project; the company had begun to line up markets for the products and to charter tankers for shipment. The questions over the project were seen in the industry as having arisen from a possible conflict of interest concerning the Saudi oil minister's son being at the head of the private company working with Mobil. However, Saudi officials say the cancellation comes from the need for a fundamental review of the kingdom's downstream activities in oil. This follows the merger of Samarec, the kingdom's refining and marketing arm, with Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company, this year. Saudi Arabia's petrochemicals industry is run by Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, Sabic, which is mostly state-owned but has some private shareholdings. King Fahd, the Saudi ruler, is understood to be looking at rationalising the downstream oil and chemicals industries with a view to making them more efficient and to cut costs. Low oil prices over recent years have left the kingdom strapped for cash. 'They are not flush with cash the way they used to be and all projects will have to be reviewed carefully,' said one industry analyst. Saudi Aramco - the kingdom's main oil producer - provides the crude oil feedstock for running refineries and chemicals plants, often at a fairly large discount. Many in the industry have argued for a bigger role for the company in decisions about downstream investment, although it has no experience of petrochemicals. As part of its review, the government could decide to stipulate that either Aramco or Sabic be a partner in any joint venture project. At the very least it is likely to require some increased input from Aramco on future projects - this could involve setting up a panel for approving new ventures. Aramco has already set up a new business unit to deal with refinery operations after the merger with Samarec in June. It could be expanding its operations to cover petrochemicals in coming months.</p>

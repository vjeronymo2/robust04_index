			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A.: PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> There are, in this endlessly fascinating land of ours, museums devoted entirely  to a collection of cast-iron farm-implement seats, to cheese, to brassieres. So  why not this one, to creatures that may or may not exist?  </P> <P> The Cryptozoology Museum opens this weekend in Malibu, and "we define  cryptozoology as being the search for mysterious creatures," says its curator,  Jon Beckjord.  </P> <P> His assorted studies on the Loch Ness Monster, the yeti and its West Coast  cousins -- Bigfoot, sasquatch, whatever -- and other creatures of fact or  fancy, such as Africa's Mokele M'Bembe, form the core of the display. Also, it  helps Beckjord clean out his garage of at least a dozen years of research by  the former Bay Area city planner, who "got bored (with that work) and went off  to look for Bigfoot and I guess my mistake was I found it."  </P> <P> Not for him the creatures of pure myth -- the roc, the chimera, the unicorn.  Instead, "We're trying to offer the ones that to the best of our knowledge  appear to be verified, or haven't at least been debunked."  </P> <P> Housed for now in a room off the Trancas Restaurant that converts to a dance  floor by night, the collection of "pictures, mostly" is intended to offer  enough alternatives to satisfy everyone, from skeptics to zealots: "1, that  there is no such thing -- and we have uncovered some hoaxes. 2, that they are  rare, difficult-to-find creatures . . . like the coelacanth (a prehistoric fish  thought to be extinct and finally caught alive in the 1930s) . . . 3, new  explanations. . . . This really borders on some radical ideas that disturb some  people, so we'll go at it lightly."  </P> <P> The restaurant itself, says Beckjord, may soon offer a Bigfoot Burger theme  lunch.  </P> <P> Accompanied, perhaps, by a bowl of Scotch broth, in which you think you see a  sea serpent.  </P> <P> Scores of food writers and critics convening here for the International Food  Media Conference had a thoughtful little gift awaiting them at the Biltmore  headquarters. In addition to the usual hotel guest array of shampoo, shower cap  and chocolate mint, these guests were presented with a small shopping bag  filled with Alka Seltzer, Tums and Rolaids.  </P> <P> Food. It's a tough job but someone's got to do it.  </P> <P> The not-to-miss event at "one of the two most prestigious dog shows in the  country," the Kennel Club of Beverly Hills' extravaganza this Sunday: the  herding demonstration, wherein dogs herd ranch and farm animals.  </P> <P> De rigueur training for what to do when bulls cavort through those Rodeo Drive  china shops.  </P> <P> When his rented helicopter lost power and dropped to the ground Friday, Ed  Mauldin adroitly executed an emergency landing called "full down auto rotation"  and put down at a Panorama City construction site.  </P> <P> Too bad the FAA wasn't watching. Because Mauldin had been on his way to Van  Nuys Airport to take the oral exam for his flight instructor's certification.  And when he finally arrived, he didn't pass. "My nerves were shot," the  seasoned pilot said.  </P> <P> That same maneuver is required on the other part of the test that Mauldin has  yet to take. But since he's already done it, "maybe this one will count," he  said hopefully.  </P> <P> In a California champagne-maker's Valentine's list of the nation's most  romantic cities, San Francisco came in first, Honolulu second and L.A. third.  </P> <P> So far, so good. But keep in mind that this is a computer analysis -- and how  many times have you shared a split of vintage brut with a computer? This  computer factored in marriages and divorces, restaurants, sales of flowers,  diamonds and champagne, and miles of walkable shoreline, and also concluded  that the nation's seventh and 10th most romantic cities are Rochester, N.Y.,  and Grand Rapids, Mich.  </P> <P> If only Cole Porter had known, we might have had a different song entirely: "I  love Rochester in the summer, when it sizzles . . ."  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> CITY WON'T BUY BUILDINGS  </P> <P> Plans to buy three buildings that make up the former Pasadena Community  Hospital at 1845 N. Fair Oaks Ave. for use by the city Health Department were  canceled last week by the Board of Directors.  </P> <P> The board made public Tuesday a closed-door decision made Oct. 9 to back out of  the deal with building owners Edward and Laurie Rubin.  </P> <P> The decision was based on a city Finance Department analysis that concluded the  deal was unrealistic because the city doesn't have $7.5 million needed to buy  the buildings and renovate their 61,000 square feet of space. The city would  also have to pay $410,000 annually for mortgage and operating expenses, the  analysis said.  </P> <P> The city had paid a $125,000 deposit, but because the sale was canceled within  60 days, the deposit will be refunded.  </P></p>

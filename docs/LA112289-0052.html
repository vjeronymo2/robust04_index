			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> GEORGIA;  </P> <P> QUADRIPLEGIC GAINS RIGHT TO END HIS LIFE  </P> <P> The Georgia Supreme Court ruled that a 33-year-old quadriplegic has a  constitutional right to withdraw from the breathing apparatus that has kept him  alive for four years. The court said in a unanimous opinion that Larry McAfee's  right to discontinue the treatment falls under privacy rights guaranteed by the  state and federal constitutions. McAfee suffered a severe spinal cord injury in  a 1985 motorcycle accident that left him a quadriplegic and dependent upon a  ventilator to breathe. McAfee has said he plans to shut off his ventilator  after the holiday season.  </P></p>

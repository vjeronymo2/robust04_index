			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POLITICIANS SEE LITTLE DAMAGE TO GATES SINCE NO PUNITIVE FINE AWARDED  </P> <P> Reaction to the federal civil rights verdict against Orange County Sheriff Brad  Gates came quickly Wednesday from his friends and foes, with politicians  generally agreeing that Gates had not been badly damaged.  </P> <P> "I think the fact that there were no punitive damages means he's pretty safe .  . . ," state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) said Wednesday. "He's not  going to be hurt in the long run. . . . I think he's pretty well entrenched."  </P> <P> Mission Viejo City Councilman Robert A. Curtis, a former state Republican Party  secretary still active in party politics, said he doubts that Gates need worry  much about the verdict. "If it was a million-dollar punitive verdict, it would  be a different story," he said.  </P> <P> Preston Guillory, a Gates opponent, was awarded $189,894 in damages but no  punitive damages.  </P> <P> Gates, a prominent local Republican, was first elected in 1974 and won  reelection to 4-year terms by easy margins of 57%, 75% and 64%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Won't Have an Impact'  </P> <P> Eileen Padberg, who has managed Gates' past campaigns, said the sheriff was not  really tried by a jury of his peers and "people who know him and support him  will understand . . . ," she said. "It won't have an impact in a reelection  campaign at all."  </P> <P> Those with a stake in the verdict had varied reactions.  </P> <P> County government was also held liable and will pay the judgment if it stands.  County Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley expressed relief because  "I guess it could have been a lot more . . . ," he said. "They were talking $5  million at one point -- although $190,000 is rough at a time when the county is  in its current financial situation."  </P> <P> Supervisor Don R. Roth said he wanted to reserve comment on the verdict but  pointed out that Gates is "elected by the people and, you know, because of that  I can't really tell him what to do. . . . He's responsible to the people."  </P> <P> Former Anaheim Police Chief Jimmie D. Kennedy, a co-defendant with Gates, said  the verdict exonerating him and other Anaheim officials was "a tremendous  relief to me." He took the opportunity to endorse the Sheriff's Department as  effective and committed.  </P> <P> Mark A. Logan, Anaheim's chief prosecutor, said he was "grateful" that the jury  cleared the city for its role in prosecuting Guillory.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Another Suit  </P> <P> Another lawsuit against Gates, one filed by newsman Chuck Cook, is pending in  U.S. District Court. Cook alleges that Sheriff's Department intelligence unit  investigators illegally tape-recorded one of his telephone conversations in an  attempt to discover his sources for articles critical of Gates' operation of  County Jail.  </P> <P> Cook, who was a reporter for the Orange County Register at that time but now  edits a newspaper in Newhall, said he believes that his case is stronger than  Guillory's. He said he does not expect Gates to escape punitive damages in that  suit.  </P> <P> "If I were still a voter in Orange County, I would have some serious concerns  that the sheriff, one of our highest elected officials, was conducting illegal  acts with a unit that is supposed to be guarding the community from organized  crime and drug activity," Cook said Wednesday after the verdict.  </P> <P> He said the unit is no more than "a political spy unit" and "basically a dirty  tricks unit."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Steve Emmons in Los Angeles and Eric Lichtblau in Santa Ana  contributed to this story.  </P></p>

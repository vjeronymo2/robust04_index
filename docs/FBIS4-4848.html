			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 2 KYODO -- Japan and Vietnam have  agreed to open a flight service between Ho Chi Minh City and the  Kansai International Airport opening in September off Osaka,  Japanese Transport Ministry officials said Saturday [2 April].  The regular flight service will be the first to open between  the two countries since the Vietnam war.    The officials said both Japan and Vietnam will operate  thrice-weekly Boeing 767 flights via Hong Kong or Bangkok.  Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways and Vietnam Airlines plan to  operate the flights.    The two countries failed to agree, however, on opening a  route between Narita Airport, outside Tokyo, and Hanoi since the  Japanese airport has no additional space, the officials said.</p>

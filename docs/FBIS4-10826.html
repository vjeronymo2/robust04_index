			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of speech by General Raul Castro Ruz, minister of </F> the Revolutionary Armed Forces, commemorating the 33d  anniversary of the proclamation of the socialist nature of the  Cuban Revolution and Militiamen's Day, in Guantanamo on 16 April]    [Text] Guantanamo, 16 Apr (PL) -- For many years we have  celebrated in La Cabana Fortress in Havana the 16 April acts to  commemorate the eve of the victorious Bay of Pigs clashes, the  proclamation of the socialist nature of our revolution, and  Militiamen's Day.    Today, we are having celebrations in "Mariana Grajales"  Revolutionary Plaza, in front of the monument to this mother of  the fatherland -- this exemplary woman who wrote a unique epic  for her people with her life and the lives of her children, whom  she fed with the milk of heroism.    What better place is there than this one, where Mariana  calls  on us to kneel and swear to defend the freedom of the fatherland  or to die for it, and where she orders us to stand up and march  to Camp Mambi, like she did with all her children, even the  youngest one?    And what better territory is there than this one, the heroic  east, birthplace of our revolutions, Guantanamo Province, where  there is no beach, path, valley, or mountain that does not  deserve glorious mention in our country's history?    For the glorious deeds of the Mambises people in last  century's three wars against the colonial yoke.    For the most tenacious and successful struggle by peasants  for their land, the 18 possessions of the crown [el realengo 18].    For the solid support that it gave our guerrilla column to  found and extend the 2d "Frank Pais" Eastern Front, giving us  its best sons, sending us ammunition and all sorts of supplies,  surrounding us for nine months with their uncompromising support  until the 1 January triumph.    For its contribution to the victory at the Bay of Pigs.  Perhaps not enough has been divulged about the fact that the  mercenaries sent to land on the coast of Baracoa were to open a  front to divert us from the main thrust of the attack, but they  did not dare step on Guantanamo soil, where a decided and alert  people in arms were waiting to annihilate them.    Faithful to their tradition of rising to the occasion in the  face of danger and adversity, the people of Guantanamo, under  government and party leadership headed by Comrade Juan Carlos  Robinson, faced with courage, energy, and efficiency the  devastating effects of the November floods. With the solidarity  of the whole country and with state support they made their  repairs in silence. Here, nature's catastrophe has served as an  encouragement to work, and it has not been used as an excuse to  not fulfill production plans or defense tasks.    We are also gathered to promote to higher ranks 33  militiamen  and reservists deployed in this province, who symbolize the 33  years that separate us from the heroic Bay of Pigs and represent  all of those throughout the country who today receive this  well-deserved encouragement.    We are also gathered to hand over a replica of Maximo  Gomez's  glorious machete -- as in previous years -- to a group of  writers, journalists, artists, and cultural institutions on  behalf of the Revolutionary Armed Forces in recognition of their  outstanding contribution to strengthening the country's combat  capabilities and our people's patriotic and internationalist  awareness.    It is of great satisfaction to decorate, in keeping with the  Council of State decree, the heroic fighters and civilian  workers of the border brigade, who in keeping with their duty,  have many times risked their lives or have been mutilated in the  minefields that surround the territory illegally occupied by the  United States. To those who have fallen while fulfilling this  risky mission, to First Lieutenant Arturo Ruiz Martinez, and to  soldiers Raul Milanes Labrada, Roberto Navarro Hernandez, and  Wilbert Vazquez Gamboa, I posthumously confer today the "Antonio  Maceo" order.    They have offered up their budding lives, these brave  youths,  worthy followers of soldiers Ramon Lopez Pena and Luis Ramirez  Lopez, who in past decades lost their lives because of  treacherous bullets fired from the other side of the fence. The  sacrifice of those who have been wounded or mutilated forever,  the hard test of thousands of fighters and officers, who  throughout the 30 years since the border unit was created have  repeatedly guarded the fatherland, risking dangers and suffering  the tensions of the border along the front -- all of this is  part of the high price we are forced to pay because of the  existence of this foreign military base on a part of our soil.    We have said and reiterated, from the very triumph of the  revolution, that this base was imposed on the Cuban people by  force, and we demand that it be dismantled and returned to Cuba.  Its presence, in disregard of our people's manifest rights and  their legitimate government, violates all norms of international  law. It is a brutal act of arrogance by the empire.    Today this base, which is obsolete from a military  viewpoint,  constitutes an unnecessary expense that must be borne by the  U.S. taxpayer.    To reduce its uncontrollable military budget, the United  States has dismantled dozens of military installations in the  United States and abroad. Nevertheless, it maintains this one  as a source of constant provocation and humiliation against Cuba.    We will never renounce our sovereign right to this part of  our island -- this part of our national territory.    We reiterate today what we expressed nearly a year ago in  this same plaza: There is not one day in which we are not  reminded that we have a dagger stuck in our country's side, just  a few kilometers south of where we are now standing. We have  never stopped believing that some day we may be able to remove  this dagger in a peaceful and civilized manner in accordance  with the principles of international law.    As everyone knows, our state's social system, as well as our  military doctrine, dictates that we shall never become an  aggressor that fires the first shot.    Everything we do to strengthen our defense is precisely  aimed  at making any aggression against our country a costly  enterprise. Our defensive efforts constitute a deterrent that  will make any war prohibitively costly and unwinnable and, at  the same time, guarantee our people's peaceful and creative  endeavors.    As long as we fail to achieve this legitimate and unyielding  aspiration of recovering the territory now occupied by this  base, our position is to avert incidents along the demarcation  line between this area and the rest of the island.    As we stated several weeks ago, during the past year a  climate of tranquillity has prevailed on both sides of the  fence, and we are inclined to keep doing all that is necessary  to maintain this atmosphere.    This is why we have taken and will continue to take all  necessary measures to prevent any foolish attempts by those who  want to leave the country by way of this route.    To try to cross through those densely mined fields on both  sides of the fence, attempting to evade our checkpoints and  patrols, is madness and, at the same time, an act of provocation  against our country's security.    Two armies are deployed face to face on either side of the  fence. Given the United State's permanent hostility toward our  country and its illegal occupation of this part of Cuba, these  two armies are not exactly friendly armies.</p>

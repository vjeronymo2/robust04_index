			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: CASHING IN ON JACKIE  </P> <P> Producer Lester Persky tells us he has interest from all three networks for the  six-to-eight-hour miniseries of the Jacqueline Kennedy-Onassis story that he'd  like to have ready for next season. He completed his rights deal for C. David  Hayman's unauthorized 728-page "A Woman Named Jackie" -- due out May 3 from  Lyle Stuart, Inc. -- just last week for "substantial six figures," Persky said.  </P> <P> Already the object of intense media heat, "A Woman Named Jackie" reportedly  includes information drawn from some 800 interviews, as well as previously  unreleased letters, White House records and FBI files -- plus a word-for-word  reproduction of the prenuptial agreement she signed before marrying Aristotle  Onassis.  </P> <P> Persky, who produced NBC's miniseries version of Hayman's "Poor Little Rich  Girl," said his new project will cover "Mrs. Onassis' entire life, from even  before she was born." He added, "We will try to do it in a quality way, with  tact."  </P> <P> Onassis' spokeswoman told us that Jackie has no plans to respond either to  Hayman's book or Persky's miniseries treatment of it: "We never respond . . .  we don't encourage them, obviously."

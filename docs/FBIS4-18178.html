			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, March 31 KYODO -- The following is the full  text of a ministerial declaration draft to be announced in  mid-April by ministers from GATT member countries at Marrakech,  Morocco, obtained Thursday [31 March] by Kyodo News Service:  <H5>  Marrakech Declaration of 15 April 1994 </H5>   Ministers representing the (124) governments and the  European  Communities participating in the Uruguay Round of multilateral  trade negotiations, on the occasion of the final session of the  trade negotiations committee at ministerial level held at  Marrakech, Morocco from 12 to 15 April 1994,    Recalling the ministerial declaration adopted at Punta del  Este, Uruguay on 20 September 1986 to launch the Uruguay Round  of multilateral trade negotiations,    Recalling the progress achieved at the ministerial meetings  held at Montreal, Canada and Brussels, Belgium in December of  1988 and 1990 respectively,    Noting that the negotiations were substantially concluded on  15 December 1993,    Determined to build upon the success of the Uruguay Round  through the participation of their economies in the world  trading system, based upon open, market-oriented policies and  the commitments set out in the Uruguay Round agreements and  decisions,    Have today adopted the following declaration    1. Ministers salute the historic achievement represented by  the conclusion of the round, which they believe will strengthen  the world economy and lead to more trade, investment, employment  and income growth throughout the world. In particular, they  welcome    -- The stronger and clearer legal framework they have  adopted  for the conduct of international trade, including a more  effective and reliable dispute settlement mechanism,    -- The global reduction by 40 percent of tariffs and wider  market-opening agreements on goods, and the increased  predictability and security represented by a major expansion in  the scope of tariff commitments, and    -- The establishment of a multilateral framework of  disciplines for trade in services and for the protection of  trade-related intellectual property rights, as well as the  reinforced multilateral trade provisions in agriculture and in  textiles and clothing.    2. Ministers affirm that the establishment of the World  Trade Organization (WTO) ushers in a new era of global economic  cooperation, reflecting the widespread desire to operate in a  fairer and more open multilateral trading system for the benefit  and welfare of their peoples. Ministers believe that the trade  liberalization and strengthened rules achieved in the Uruguay  Round will lead to a progressively open world trading  environment, and express their determination to resist  protectionist pressures of all kinds. Ministers undertake, with  immediate effect and until the entry into force of the WTO, not  to take any trade measures that would undermine or adversely  affect the results of the Uruguay Round negotiations or their  implementation.    3. Ministers confirm their resolution to strive for greater  global coherence of policies in the fields of trade, money and    Finance, including cooperation between the WTO, the IMF and  the World Bank for that purpose.    4. Ministers welcome the fact that participation in the  Uruguay Round was considerably wider than in any previous  multilateral trade negotiation and, in particular, that  developing countries played a notably active role in it. This  has marked a historic step toward a more balanced and integrated  global trade partnership. Ministers note that during the period  these negotiations were underway significant measures of  economic reform and autonomous trade liberalization were  implemented in many developing countries and formerly centrally  planned economies.    5. Ministers recall that the results of the negotiations  embody provisions conferring differential and more favorable  treatment for developing economies, including special attention  to the particular situation of least-developed countries.  Ministers underscore the importance of these provisions for the  least-developed countries, and declare their intention to  continue to assist and facilitate the expansion of their trade  and investment opportunities. They agree to keep under regular  review by the ministerial conference and the appropriate organs  of the WTO the impact of the results of the round on the  least-developed countries as well as on the net-food- importing  developing countries, with a view to fostering positive measures  to enable them to achieve their development objectives.  Ministers recognize the need for strengthening the capability of  GATT and the WTO to provide increased technical assistance in  their areas of competence, and in particular to substantially  expand its provision to the least-developed countries.    6. Ministers declare that their signature of the "final act  embodying the results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade  negotiations" and their adoption of associated ministerial  decisions initiates the transition from GATT to the WTO. They  have in particular established a preparatory committee to lay  the ground for the entry into force of the WTO agreement and  commit themselves to seek to complete all steps necessary to  ratify the WTO agreement so that it can enter into force by 1  January 1995 or as early as possible thereafter. Ministers have  furthermore adopted a decision on trade and environment.    7. Ministers express their sincere gratitude to his Majesty  King Hassan II for his personal contribution to the success of  this ministerial meeting, and to his government and the people  of Morocco for their warm hospitality and excellent organization  they have provided. The fact that this final ministerial  meeting of the Uruguay Round has been held at Marrakech is an  additional manifestation of Morocco's commitment to an open  world trading system and to its fullest integration to the  global economy.    8. With the adoption and signature of the final act and the  opening for acceptance of the WTO agreement, ministers declare  the work of the trade negotiations committee to be complete and  the Uruguay Round formally concluded.</p>

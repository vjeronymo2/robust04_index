			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Arts: Pirouettes and plies around the world - Clement Crisp recalls the splendours and miseries of dance during the last 12 months It was not, in retrospect, too bad a year for dance. As the months passed, with their toll of the damned, the doomed and the desperate - the dire Bill T Jones Company, the Washington Ballet, the Anjelin Preljocaj troupe, Les ballets Jazz de Montreal; the unveiling of the Royal Ballet's eyesore Sleeping Beauty; Symphonic Variations mauled by inept casting; Rambert's despicable Garden of Earthly Delights; the killing off of London Contemporary Dance Theatre - I felt 1994 was annus horribilissimus. But there were also splendid things in creation and performance, and too many not to put the year's accounts into the black. The Edinburgh Festival did dance-lovers proud with the return of Mark Morris bringing his breath-taking L'Allegro; with the Miami Ballet's vivid accounts of a Balanchine repertory; with a Merce Cunningham visit. Equally bracing the appearance of Twyla Tharp's dancers at Riverside Studios - purposeful, stylish. Home-grown talents made exhilarating work. Jonathan Burrows' Our was a span of fascinating activity, with Lynne Bristow (a fine classicist turned fine modernist) magnificent in it. Michael Clark's O was luminous, revelatory, Apollo rethought. Richard Alston's dances for his new group brought allusive, poetic versions of Petrushka and Les Illumimations. Siobhan Davies' The Glass blew in was like gazing at refractions of a mysterious image. Kim Brandstrup's Othello was a bold commentary upon the play, with Irek Mukhamedov its tremendous heart. Mark Baldwin made witty, emotionally sly dances. We have much to celebrate with such creators, and Channel 4's season of mauvais quarts d'heure from international dance-bores - Tights, Camera, Action - was all the more unworthy. Veils can be drawn over the appearance of Momix, over Lucinda Childs' frigidities, Adventures in Motion Pictures' addled Highland Fling (La Sylphide as a haggis), and examples of Eurotorment, not least Wim Vanderkeybus' Mountains made of barking about a trip to North Africa. There were unlikely callers. The Spanish National Ballet looked both un-Spanish and un-balletic. The feeble Cape Ballet's visit was premature. Takarazuka offered cohorts of Japanese ladies and gentlemen (who were also ladies), a stuffed sea-gull, and inscrutable performance. There were unspeakable others. I derived great pleasure from the Opera Ballet in Paris. The company is crammed with tremendous dancers, young talents nipping at the heels of the etoiles, as I noted in programmes devoted to Jeunes danseurs and bravura accounts of Etudes and Le Palais de cristal. The repertory was imaginative - three assured creations by Roland Petit; a Nijinsky evening which brought an odd guess at his Tyl Eulenspiegel - and interpretation was superb, with glorious dancing by Elisabeth Platel (a sublime Nikiya), Monique Loudieres, Manuel Legris and the newest etoile, Nicholas le Riche, among many others. I reported on the San Francisco Ballet's Paris appearance with Mark Morris's daring Maelstrom; on the Royal Swedish Ballet's excellent Don Quixote with the gifted young Jan-Erik Wikstrom; on the celebrations which marked Frank Andersen's jubilee with the Royal Danish Ballet; on the Royal Ballet of Flanders' engaging Coppelia. I reported on an awful Coppelia staged by Oleg Vinogradov for the Kirov Ballet, and on that company's frigid account of Fountain of Bakhchisaray, an important old Soviet ballet made bearable only by Sylvie Guillem's physical passion. For an Honours List of performances, I must nominate Stephen Jefferies' commanding Drosselmeyer in the Royal Ballet's Nutcracker, a poetic heart for the staging. In a year when Sleeping Beauty was put on the rack at Covent Garden, Scottish Ballet's modest version was illuminated by Ludmila Semenyaka, whose exquisite Aurora told of the grandest Russian classicism, and I saluted Yurie Shinohara's sweetly danced Princess Florine in the same staging. The Kirov ballerina Lubov Kunakova was a Giselle in the great tradition, on tour with the small but serious Moscow Festival Ballet. Cumbre Flamenca came back to London, feet and souls a-fire, and Mariquilla and Juana Amaya tore like things divinely possessed into the dance. In its unfussed Giselle, gallant London City Ballet showed us the touching artistry of Kim Miller. English National Ballet's Thomas Edur is an impeccable classical artist, noble in means and expression. His Prince in Sleeping Beauty was an interpretation of first importance. Irek Mukhamedov, a dancer of unique power, found meaning and truth in every role. From Sylvie Guillem, a vivid Natalya in A Month in the Country - Jonathan Cope and Sarah Wildor excellent as Belyayev and Vera in this same ballet - while Guillem's blazing Kitri cast welcome light amid the dankness of Covent Garden's Don Quixote. The Bolshoi Ballet, riven by problems about artistic policies and structural survival, cancelled a regional tour. Rambert Dance was re-launched with a repertory that did less than justice to a fine roster of dancers. Birmingham Royal Ballet staged three important revivals: Ninette de Valois' Job, Ashton's Enigma Variations, and Massine's Le Tricorne. The company also acquired Agnes de Mille's Fall River Legend, hokum justified by the presence of Marion Tait, a dramatic artist of wonderful intelligence. English National Ballet continued to show strong dancing, and its medium-scale tour of the regions brought a clever XNTricities from Mauro Bigonzetti, which was given a ripsnorting performance, while a welcome staging of Balanchine's Square Dance had the dashing young Giuseppe Picone in it. ENB's new Giselle was wrong-headed in its 1920s Austrian setting, but Derek Deane respected the text and made the second act properly haunted. The most haunted staging of the year was the Royal Ballet's misbegotten Sleeping Beauty. Anthony Dowell's production sank beneath Maria Bjornson's capricious ideas of baroque architecture and costuming. I thought it an unmitigated disaster, unworthily danced. An Ashton celebration was a good idea let down by weak casting and unidiomatic style, not to be excused by injury. What used to be subtle, musically and physically deft, looked coarse, numb. The company put on works by Ashley Page, Matthew Hart, William Tuckett - its Dance Bites tour with new short choreographies an excellent scheme - but it is disquieting to see a national ballet so uncomfortable with both its classical and Ashtonian birthright. The treasures of its repertory need to be re-furbished, and polished. Another Forsythe ballet and a revival of the flaccid La Ronde later this season are no answer to anything, save an unwise quest for the modish and the mediocre. New Year resolutions need to be made in Floral Street.</p>

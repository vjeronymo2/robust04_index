			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> USE OF STEEL PIPES SUGGESTED FOR PIER  </P> <P> A marine engineering consultant has recommended that plastic-coated steel pipes  be used instead of wood pilings to reconstruct the Redondo Beach Pier.  </P> <P> The steel pilings under a concrete deck would provide greater resistance  against the kind of storms and fires that destroyed most of the pier last year,  the consultant said.  </P> <P> Jim Crumpley, project engineer for Long Beach-based firm Moffatt &amp; Nichol,  told the Redondo Beach City Council that construction and maintenance costs for  a pier using the steel pipes would also be lower than costs for four other  options studied by the firm.  </P> <P> He said a Japanese company, Nippon Steel, has developed a plastic pipe coating  that effectively resists salt-water corrosion for up to 70 years. In the  recommended design, the pilings would connect through steel caps to a concrete  deck.  </P> <P> Up to half of the $6-million pier reconstruction project will be financed by  the state under the Natural Disaster Assistance Act, City Manager Tim Casey  told the council.  </P></p>

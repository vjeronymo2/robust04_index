			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Hitch in plan for US-Russian exercises: Nationalist sentiment may compel change of venue A joint peacekeeping exercise between US and Russian troops, planned for this month in Russia and meant to symbolise the closer co-operation between the two former antagonists, is now likely to take place in the US, in deference to Russian nationalist sentiment. Mr Sam Nunn, chairman of the US Senate Armed Services Committee, said in Moscow yesterday that he had proposed the change of venue after learning that the exercise had been 'indefinitely postponed' by President Boris Yeltsin. A senior Pentagon official said last night that 'Senator Nunn's proposal is one possibility. We are following on with conversations with the (Russian) defence ministry about a possible postponement'. Mr Nunn said the incident did not necessarily mean Russia would not take a full part in the Partnership for Peace - the Nato plan to draw former communist countries into association with it, which Russia has said it will sign this month. He said that the Rusian government 'must do a vigorous job in explaining things to its people'. The shift of venue, and the victory of the nationalists in having the exercise moved, was lambasted yesterday by Mr Yegor Gaidar, former deputy prime minister and leader of the liberal Russia's Choice party, as 'a syndrome of paranoid re-militarisation' - in contrast to the 'steadfastness and courage' of the US in proposing to host the exercise. 'Our military men would be happy to act like Enver Hoxja (former leader of Albania), to sprinkle pillboxes all over Russia and to protect us with sharp barbed wire and rows of tanks from the rest of the world'. Mr Nunn said that 'because it had become a political issue and there were local objections, we agreed to go back and recommend to President Clinton that the joint exercise be held on US soil. This should take away the most sensitive thing - because somehow the US is seen as victorious in the cold war. That's the feeling that was expressed to us.' The exercise, which would have included only 250 unarmed troops from both sides, was designed for training in peacekeeping techniques - now increasingly required by Russian military engaged in such missions in the former Soviet states on its borders. It had been agreed earlier this year in talks between Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, and General Pavel Grachev, Russian defence minister, but has been a controversial issue in parliament ever since. Mr Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the duma's foreign relations committee and a former Russian ambassador to the US, said yesterday that partnership with other countries, including the US, required 'delicacy and tact' because of a growing feeling that 'national pride was being humbled'.</p>

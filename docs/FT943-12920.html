			<p>940722 FT  22 JUL 94 / Black &amp; Decker creates 180 jobs Black &amp; Decker is to create 180 permanent jobs at its plant at Spennymoor, County Durham, as a result of a restructuring of its European power tools manufacturing and the launch of new products. It is also to offer 120 Spennymoor employees on nine-month-a-year contracts permanent, full-year jobs. Under the restructuring, announced early this year, the company is shutting its plant at Limburg, near Frankfurt, which employs 480 people, and consolidating production of virtually all its consumer power tools for the European market at Spennymoor.</p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> The director of the smash-hit film "Batman" criticized censors who have stopped  children in Europe from seeing their hero. Tim Burton, speaking Sunday to  reporters in France at the Deauville festival of American films, rejected  criticism that violent and sadistic scenes made his film unfit for children. "I  think it is for everyone," said Burton. "I think it's much more subversive to  tell (children) that something is bad. . . . They're going to want to see it  anyway." Britain and Belgium have barred children (under 12 and 16,  respectively) from seeing the film, rated PG-13 in the United States (parents  strongly cautioned about children under 13 seeing the film). French censors  will rule today whether to impose an age restriction. Much of Warner Bros.'  massive marketing campaign for its film has been aimed at children.

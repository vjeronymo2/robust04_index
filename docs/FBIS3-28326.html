			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 5 KYODO -- Japan's major dailies  Saturday [5 February] called on the ruling coalition to unify  opinions on a tax cut and formulate an economic stimulus package  as soon as possible.    The ASAHI SHIMBUN said, "the attitude to scrap everything  could not get support from the people nor understanding from the  international community."    The major daily was referring to Friday's decision by the  seven ruling coalition parties to scrap Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa plans to introduce a new indirect tax and implement a  tax cut.    Hosokawa's package calls for a 6 trillion yen reduction in  income tax and for replacing the current 3 percent consumption  tax with a 7 percent "national welfare tax."    The leading daily urged the coalition to make its  decision-making process transparent, noting that bureaucrats at  the Finance Ministry might have pulled some behind-the-scene  strings, hand-in-hand with a few influential coalition members  in drawing up the tax plan.    The ASAHI also asked the coalition parties to calm down and  immediately unify their views on economic policies. "Otherwise,  the centripetal influence of the coalition would decay," the  ASAHI said.    The MAINICHI SHIMBUN also slammed the government for its  blurred process that brought about the plan, labeling it as "a  decision without the people."    "If those who participated in making the decision were only  a  few people as reported, including Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party] leader Ichiro Ozawa and those from the Finance Ministry,  without holding sufficient discussions within the government and  the coalition, it is a reckless act that tramples the basic  principles of democracy," the MAINICHI said.    It is rational for the Social Democratic Party, which was  suddenly pressed to accept the tax plan, to have threatened to  quit the coalition, the national daily said.    The prime minister should adjust opinions on a tax cut and  its resources, and start drafting the fiscal 1994 budget after  gaining a happy compromise, the MAINICHI said.    The largest circulation YOMIURI SHIMBUN said, "the Unusual  situation revealed the structural limitation of the coalition  government which is a hodgepodge of political parties with  different political stance and basic policies."    "Under ordinary circumstances, a cabinet that committed such  a serious blunder would have to resign en masse. However, it is  not allowed to create a political vacuum in the face of such  urgent problems as pump-priming, the fiscal 1994 state budget  and relations with the United States," it said.    "Revocation of the prime minister's tax plan leaves deep  cracks in the coalition and seriously deteriorates the  leadership of the government," the daily said.    The YOMIURI urged the government to restructure itself to  deal with the political quagmire.    The leading economic daily NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN said, "The  government should recognize the severity of the economy bogged  down in the worst recession in the postwar era and rush to  fine-tune pump-priming measures by returning to its original  stance of first implementing tax reductions."    "The government and the coalition should recall that what is  needed for the Japanese economy in the serious recession is to  carry out a large-scale income tax first," it said.    The NIHON KEIZAI asked the opposition Liberal Democratic  Party to offer concrete proposals to the government if it  recognizes the Japanese economy is facing a crisis.</p>

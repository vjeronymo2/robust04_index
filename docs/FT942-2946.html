			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Moscow warned of 'turmoil' Senior Russian and western economists yesterday warned of economic and political turmoil in Russia later this year as the country's monetary and credit policies become 'unsustainable'. A conference at the Stockholm Institute of East European Economics produced a sobering agreement that fragile improvements in Russian finances, which have seen a monthly inflation rate of 6.8 per cent in May, are now in danger. Lack of real institutional reform and pressing demands from military, industrial and agricultural lobbies threaten to bring back high inflation and with it a nationalist resurgence. Figures produced for the conference on the budget, which is under discussion in the Russian parliament, show that tax income for the first quarter of the present year is below the target level by more than 10 per cent of gross national product, while expenditure has also been slashed by a similar figure. This has meant deep cuts in programmes and long delays in wage payments, contributing to increasing unrest in the military.</p>

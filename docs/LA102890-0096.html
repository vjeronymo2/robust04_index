			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KLINGLER ROLLS SEVEN AGAINST ARKANSAS, 62-28;  </P> <P> HOUSTON: QUARTERBACK HAS SEVEN TOUCHDOWN PASSES AND 457 YARDS FOR UNBEATEN  COUGARS. RAZORBACKS LOSE FOURTH IN A ROW.  </P> <P> Houston scaled new heights Saturday, and Arkansas plunged to one of its  all-time lows.  </P> <P> David Klingler passed for 457 yards and a career-high seven touchdowns and the  sixth-ranked Cougars scored 38 consecutive points to rout Arkansas, 62-28,  extending the Razorbacks' losing streak to four games.  </P> <P> Houston, 7-0 overall and 6-0 in the Southwest Conference, stretched its winning  streak to 11, best in school history and longest in the nation. The Cougars are  off to their hottest start since 1979, when they went 8-0.  </P> <P> "When Arkansas got a 14-7 lead, we showed great character to come back and  score," Houston Coach John Jenkins said. "After that, we sort of overpowered  them the rest of the way."  </P> <P> Arkansas (2-5, 0-4) hasn't started a season this poorly since 1958, when it  opened with six losses. During their losing streak, the Razorbacks have given  up an average of 53.5 points and been outscored, 214-115. The 62 points were  the most ever scored against Arkansas in an SWC game, topping the 60 by Baylor  in 1922.  </P> <P> "We're embarrassed," Arkansas Coach Jack Crowe said. "We've come to a low part  of our season. We have to see what we can do to bounce back from this."  </P> <P> Klingler tied the school and SWC record of seven touchdown passes set last year  against Temple by Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware. His passing yardage was  four short of his career high, established last week against Southern  Methodist.  </P> <P> "Klingler is the trigger man on our run and shoot. If he's not clicking, the  offense doesn't go," Jenkins said.  </P> <P> Klingler threw scoring passes to six receivers -- Verlond Brown, Tracy Good,  Patrick Cooper, Marcus Grant, Chuck Weatherspoon and Craig Alexander.  </P> <P> Good caught two touchdown tosses, covering 15 and four yards. Klingler also  threw scoring passes of 42 yards to Grant, 26 to Cooper, 25 to Brown, 24 to  Alexander and 14 to Weatherspoon.  </P> <P> Klingler, who set NCAA records for completions and attempts with a 48-of-76  performance against SMU, connected on 34 of 51 with three interceptions against  Arkansas. The junior has thrown for more than 400 yards in six of seven games  this season, making him a serious contender for the Heisman Trophy.  </P> <P> "He's headed in that direction," Jenkins said. "If we end the season 11-0,  there is no doubt we should win the national championship and David should win  the Heisman Trophy."  </P> <P> The Cougars, who lead the nation in passing, trailed, 14-7, after the first  quarter before scoring 38 consecutive points. After Roman Anderson kicked a  22-yard field goal, Klingler threw five touchdown passes -- including four in a  7:59 span -- to put the Cougars ahead, 45-14, in the third period.  </P> <P> Arkansas quarterback Quinn Grovey threw a pair of touchdown passes to Lyndy  Lindsey late in the third quarter to make the score 45-28. The Razorbacks drove  to the Houston 28 midway through the fourth quarter, but an interception by  Jamie Mouton ended the threat and helped Houston end an eight-game losing  streak against the Hogs.  </P> <P> Weatherspoon, bouncing back from injuries and flu, rushed 21 times for 140  yards and caught five passes for 45 yards. Five Houston receivers had at least  four receptions, with Manny Hazard and Good grabbing six each.  </P></p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Pemex hires outside inspector PEMEX, Mexico's national oil company, has hired Bechtel, a US engineering company, to conduct an independent review of its installations and procedures, in an attempt to avoid a repeat of the explosion that killed more than 200 people at Guadalajara last month, reports Damian Fraser in Mexico City. This is the first time Pemex has given another company unrestricted access to itself. This might be the clearest sign yet that the company is being forced to drop objections to foreign participation in its activities. Bechtel will examine Pemex's distribution centres (including oil terminals and tanks) and its oil, gas and petrol pipelines, as well as employee training.</p>

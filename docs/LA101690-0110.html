			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ATTORNEY SAYS AFFAIR, PLAN TO SELL FIRM LED TO SLAYING  </P> <P> A Tarzana woman shot and killed her millionaire husband in anger because he had  been having an affair for 12 years and because she feared his plans to sell his  import-export business would decrease the value of his estate, a prosecutor  alleged in Van Nuys Superior Court on Monday.  </P> <P> The attorney for defendant Carole Evelyn Mellinger, however, argued in his  opening statement that Mellinger was simply very drunk and thought she was  shooting a burglar when she fired four shots into her husband, Brainerd, last  Jan. 24 in the den of their posh hillside home.  </P> <P> The contrasting views emerged during the opening day of testimony in  Mellinger's trial on charges of first-degree murder. Mellinger, 48, has pleaded  not guilty and is free on $400,000 bail.  </P> <P> "Ladies and gentlemen, this case has all the makings of a finely written soap  opera but the tragedy is, it all happened," Deputy Dist. Atty. Ann Korban told  jurors who will decide Mellinger's fate.  </P> <P> The Mellingers had been married for 23 years but Brainerd Mellinger had a  mistress with whom he had been having a 12-year affair, Korban said in  detailing a motive for the shooting.  </P> <P> Mellinger also was upset with her husband's plan to sell his company, Korban  said. Although the couple had a premarital agreement specifying that Mellinger  would get no money if the couple divorced, she was the primary beneficiary of  her husband's will, Korban said.  </P> <P> The company's stock provided the bulk of the estate and Mellinger feared that  the sale of the company would decrease her share, Korban said.  </P> <P> Paul Caruso, one of Mellinger's two attorneys, did not dispute that his client  shot her husband. But he said it was an accident.  </P> <P> Mellinger came to work for her husband when she was 19 years old, and they were  "very much in love with each other." She knew about the mistress and about  other affairs her husband had had, Caruso said.  </P> <P> Mellinger had been the victim of a peeping Tom in the past and her husband had  said he would be out of town the night of the shooting, Caruso said. He said  Brainerd Mellinger had given his wife the handgun with which she shot him,  saying "if anybody breaks into the house, shoot to kill."  </P> <P> Mellinger had a blood-alcohol level of .19% and .18% in two tests taken by  police five to six hours after her arrest, the attorney added. Her  blood-alcohol content therefore could have been as high as .30%, nearly four  times the legal limit, Caruso said.  </P> <P> In other testimony, Los Angeles Police Officer Jerry Fritz testified that  Mellinger discussed the city's gang problems as he drove her to the police  station after the shooting, never inquiring about her husband's condition.  </P></p>

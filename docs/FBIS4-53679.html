			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 22 KYODO -- New party Sakigake leader  Masayoshi Takemura left Tokyo on Sunday [22 May] on a weeklong  visit to the United States for talks with government and  congressional leaders on economic and trade issues, and North  Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program.    Sakigake officials said Takemura, 59, will also talk with  U.S. officials about Japan's bid to become a permanent member of  the U.N. Security Council.    He will address the Asia-Pacific Center in San Francisco on  Thursday before returning home Saturday, they said.    Sakigake, set up by a splinter group of 15 Liberal  Democratic  Party (LDP) legislators, quit the ruling coalition in April  along with the Social Democratic Party (SDP), leaving the  cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata a minority government.</p>

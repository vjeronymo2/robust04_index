			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Leeds set to join network of Europe finance centres THE EUROPEAN network of regional financial centres, which includes Edinburgh and Manchester, is to expand, its chairman announced yesterday on a visit to Leeds. Mr Franco Cellino, who is also president of the Turin Stock Exchange, said Bordeaux, Hanover, Antwerp, Bari and Leeds were trying to join the Association of European Regional Financial Centres. The aim is to build better relationships between the cities and the European Commission - and possibly to set up new sources of growth capital for local companies. In addition to Edinburgh and Manchester, members include Barcelona, Bilbao, Lyons, Oporto, Stuttgart and Turin. Leeds is applying for membership through a financial services initiative which Mr Cellino helped launch yesterday. Wider representation is expected to strengthen the association's hand in Brussels. Regional financial centres are the principal sources of professional services - such as banking, corporate law, accountancy, and consultancy - for small- and medium-sized businesses in their areas. During the 1980s such centres saw a concentration of professional firms and services while national centres such as London, Paris, Frankfurt and Milan looked increasingly to international markets and large corporate clients. Mr Cellino said the association would encourage better professional services for small- and medium-sized enterprises, which comprise more than 90 per cent of businesses in the EC. He said this would help ensure the single market did not work against small businesses as national professional services became concentrated and geared to large and multinational companies. He also believed regional centres should increasingly promote an 'economy of networking', helping cross-border transfer of capital.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by R. Arsenic: "Revelation From Letter to Split's </F> FERAL TRIBUN: Genuine Camp for Non-Croats Near Zagreb"]    [Text] The "foreigner reception center" in Dugo Selo  is actually a classic camp where non-Croat citizens are taken to  await deportation under inhumane conditions, without any court  decision, in makeshift shacks, despite the fact that they have  had a regular residence and houses in Croatia for as long as  several decades.    Zagreb, 8 Mar--A letter that arrived recently at the  editorial office of FERAL TRIBUN in Split, one of the rare  independent newspapers in present-day Croatia, has raised quite  a stir among the local public, because it provided first-hand  confirmation that there exists a genuine concentration camp in  this republic.    The facility in question is the foreigner reception center  in  Dugo Selo, near Zagreb, which is on the level of the very worst  camps in terms of its organization and treatment of detainees.  <H5>  Letter From Camp Inmate </H5>   Those citizens of the Republic of Croatia [RH] who were not  issued certificates of citizenship and whose residence permits  were not extended are taken to this camp in handcuffs. They  include many people who have spent several decades in Croatia  and have property and permanent addresses there. Naturally, they  are all "non-Croats," because as we know--under the current  law--all Croats are regarded as citizens of the Republic of  Croatia, regardless of where they are and where they were born.    The letter from an inmate at the aforementioned "center"  states the following, among other things: "We are at the  foreigner reception center in Dugo Selo (across the road from  the `Gorica' tableware factory, middle shack). These dwellings  are that in name only, and I can tell you completely reliably  that this is a classic camp, that we did not even know that such  things existed in this state, and that we are shocked at the  very knowledge of their existence."    The letter goes on to say that the number of prisoners  varies  from 15 to 25 people, mostly citizens of the RH, many of whom  have lived in Croatia for 10, 20, or even 30 years, and  deportations are carried out over a period of 10 to 20 days:  Muslims rounded up in Zagreb are taken to Tomislavgrad for  exchange, Albanians from Kosovo and Macedonia are taken to  Rijeka to be placed on a ship for Durres, and so forth.    Many people spend up to several months under literally  inhumane conditions (there are no bed linens, the blankets are  never changed, the prisoners are not given soap or towels, and  they do not change their clothes the whole time they are at the  "center"), and there are some who are there--without changing  their bed sheets and clothes--for six to seven months. Hygiene  is nonexistent, nor is there any health care provided, so that  scabies, lice, and so on are ordinary occurrences. In a 24-hour  day, only one hour is spent outside--under guard--and all the  rest of the time is spent in a closed shack encircled by wire,  with makeshift windows.    The Croatian Helsinki Committee [HHO] (chaired by Ivan  Zvonimir Cicak) sent its team to take a look at what is going on  there, and they confirmed everything that the letter said.  Moreover, besides the "classic" camp lodgings, the prisoners  have undergone corresponding treatment, and have often been  mistreated; the atmosphere in which this has taken place is  illustrated by their testimony to the Helsinki Commission, when  they said that one night two members of the HV [Croatian Armed  Forces] were turned loose among them, who asked the familiar  question before they had even made it in the door: "Who here is  a Serb?"    It is interesting that none of the government officials  approached by the HHO knew about the existence of this camp in  Dugo Selo. The chairman of the Assembly Human Rights Committee,  Ljubomir Antic, the chief of staff of the minister of labor and  social welfare, Ivan Ujakovic, and the minister of health, Dr.  Andrija Hebrang, were amazed that such a thing exists.    Under the current Law on Movement and Residence by  Foreigners  (Article 68), shelters for foreigners are set up and looked  after by the Ministries of Health and Labor, but no one at the  ministries in question had any knowledge of this "center." It is  maintained by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  <H5>  Even Father of First Croatian Pilot Is in Camp </H5>   The type of people encountered by the HHO delegation headed  by I.Z. Cicak in the fenced-off shack is indicated by several  examples: Zoran Petrovic was born in Kraljevo, but has lived in  Zagreb for a number of years, with a regular residence and  apartment. He was among the first athletes to appear under the  Croatian flag at a competition in Germany, but that did not help  him to obtain a certificate of citizenship or an extension of  his residence permit. He has not been punished, but he has been  at the "center" for 103 days now. He was transported by plane to  Skopje in handcuffs, but the Macedonian authorities refused to  accept him. A member of the Croatian Armed Forces has already  moved into his apartment at Lj. Posavski Street 19, and  Zoran--who is neither guilty nor to blame for everything that he  is undergoing here--began a hunger strike on 31 December. No one  was interested.    Edib Sejfovic, born in Novi Pazar, was a major in the JNA  [Yugoslav People's Army], but was "dismissed" at his own  request. He has lived in Croatia since 1967, he lived in  Vinkovci for 26 years, and his wife is a Croat and the mother of  "the first Croatian pilot of Bukusic, who died in Vukovar." He  has been imprisoned in the camp for four months now.    Also here is Ramzi Mahmud from Iraq, who has lived in  Karlovac for the past 15 years. Since the beginning of the war,  he has spent 15 months in the Croatian Armed Forces.    All of these people are being held at this camp--as the HHO  delegation confirmed--without any decision by a competent court.</p>

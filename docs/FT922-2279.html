			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Survey of European Building &amp; Construction (8): Expertise could boost orders for specialists - Dutch housebuilders may be hit LIKE THE Dutch economy as a whole, the construction industry in the Netherlands is now facing a period of slower growth after enjoying a surge in business in the mid to late 1980s. The downturn for builders, however, is projected to be worse than for the economy's own fortunes. Housebuilders are expected to experience the greatest contraction in their segment of the market in the years ahead, while specialists in road, soil and marine construction appear to have more favourable prospects, provided that big infrastructure projects such as the expansion of the port of Rotterdam and the Dutch railway network proceed as planned. Abroad, the Dutch will remain important players in hydraulic engineering, bridge-building and dredging, all three areas in which the Netherlands has become expert through its own struggle against the sea. For example, the country's largest builder, Hollandsche Beton Groep (HBG), is tipped to benefit from orders flowing from Hong Kong's airport project. HBG has also recently become the first Dutch builder to acquire a major German construction company. Its new subsidiary, Raulf Bau, which has annual turnover of around DM250m, gives the Dutch company a foothold in the former east Germany through two construction companies acquired by Raulf shortly before its own takeover. Other internationally-active Dutch builders such as Wilma and Kondor Wessels are also stepping up their involvement in German construction projects to benefit from faster rates of growth in the Netherlands' eastern neighbour. At home, the overall volume of construction is expected to dip in 1992 and then resume a modest upwards trend in the years until 1996. According to the construction industry research institute EIB (Economisch Instituut voor de Bouwnijverheid), the industry as a whole will, on average, post annual growth of 0.3 per cent in the period 1989-1996. The EIB notes that although the expected growth rate for the early 1990s is relatively small, the Dutch construction industry entered the decade at an historically high level. In fact, even if average annual growth fails to exceed 0.3 per cent, the early 1990s are expected to produce the highest average volume of construction since 1970, as measured by 1987 prices. Housing, however, is an exception. According to the EIB, this sector could face an annual average decline of 3.9 per cent by 1996, reflecting the cuts in government money for the subsidised housing sector as well as a slowdown in the growth of new households. The research institute forecasts that the number of housing units built with the help of state subsidies will plummet to just 41,000 in 1996 from 61,000 in 1990. By contrast, the non-housing sector - the industry's largest - will see an 0.8 per cent annual rate of growth, well below the 3.9 per cent forecast for the soil, marine and road sector. Besides projects in the Rotterdam port and the expected construction of a high-speed 'TGV' train line from Brussels to Amsterdam, the Dutch construction industry also looks forward to the launch of Amsterdam's urban development project on the banks of the 'IJ' waterway later in the 1990s. Bureaucracy and outstanding financial problems make it difficult to predict a date for construction to begin. Dutch builders also face the prospects of fines from the European Commission because of the way the industry deals with tenders. In February, the EC imposed fines of Ecu22.5m on the industry for running what Brussels calls a cartel. The Dutch, who deny price-fixing, have appealed and await a court ruling. The EC's wrath is directed at the way 7,000 Dutch building companies (and, to a lesser extent, foreign builders who work in the Netherlands) decide among themselves which company should be chosen as the designated bidder for a specific building project. As part of the system, which accords with Dutch law, the various construction firms hold a meeting to reveal the level of the bids they have submitted. One of them is then selected to negotiate with the commissioning company. The ultimate price paid for the construction project will include the costs which the other companies incurred in drawing up their bids. These costs are reimbursed to the unsuccessful bidders. The EC says that the system adds 3 per cent to construction prices in the Netherlands. The industry disputes this, saying that building prices and profit margins are among the lowest in Europe. It also argues that the Netherlands open system is preferable to deals in 'smoky back rooms' which it says occur in other countries.</p>

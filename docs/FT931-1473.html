			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Blenheim optimistic after achieving Pounds 49.7m BLENHEIM GROUP, the exhibition organiser, yesterday forecast an 'excellent' year to come after announcing slightly higher than expected profits. Pre-tax profits totalled Pounds 49.7m in the 16 months to December 31. Profits for the 12 months to August 31 last year amounted to Pounds 37.3m. The company decided not to adopt accounting standard FRS 3 because of a change in the financial year end. Mr Neville Buch, chairman, said Blenheim continued to perform well. He said the company's large, established exhibitions had weathered recession in its main markets like the US and France. Turnover was Pounds 239.1m, compared with Pounds 122.2m, including a Pounds 13.5m contribution from Batimat, the biannual French building supply exhibition held in November 1991. Gross and operating profit margins fell slightly, partly because few large events were held in the last few months while overheads remained steady. The company was also affected by higher than expected inflation in Germany, Mr Buch said. There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 11.7m to cover losses on the disposal and closure of the Belgian and Swiss companies. The charge covered goodwill previously written off through reserves. About 90 per cent of profits come from outside the UK. Because the company uses year-end exchange rates, sterling's fall in value led to a Pounds 4m exchange gain. However, this was balanced by a large increase in debtors and Mr Buch said there was 'very little' currency gain in the figures. The company had decided to adopt average exchange rates from this year, he said. Earnings per share were 36.9p, against 24.1p, while a recommended final dividend of 3p makes a 12p (7.83p) total. COMMENT Not too much should be read into these figures, which are inconclusive because of the change in year end. But the company's optimistic statements, and the fact the shares are tightly held so can over-react, pushed the shares up 6p to 605p. The figures did contain some pointers. A Pounds 3.5m pre-tax profit from trade magazines and catalogues was promising. The episodes in Belgium and Switzerland were not, although shareholders will be relieved Blenheim realised its mistake quickly. For the coming year, comparisons will remain difficult because of the timing of biannual events. Analysts will want to see if Blenheim can maintain its margins and push through some price rises. With last year's currency gains salted away in case times get tougher, the company should meet forecasts of Pounds 47m this time. A rating of 18 times looks demanding for a company still to prove it can maintain momentum now it is maturing.</p>

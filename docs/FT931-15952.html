			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Markets: The principal uncertainty is big v small - London THE Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that it is impossible to measure accurately both where an object is and how fast it is moving. The very act of measuring subtly shifts the object being measured; you can either measure its position or its velocity, but not both at once. Watching the performance of the new FT-SE Mid 250 index over the past weeks, it has been easy to imagine that some similar principle has been at work. Last autumn's introduction of the index - which measures the 250 companies which rank just below the FT-SE 100 in terms of market capitalisation - coincided with the beginning of a sustained period of outperformance by second-tier stocks. Since it was introduced on October 12 1992, the Mid 250 has outperformed the FT-SE 100 by 11 1/2 per cent. This week, for example, the FT-SE 100 dropped 62.3 points, to close at 2799.2, but the Mid 250 rose 36.3 points, to close at 2932.7. Has the fact that it is now easy to see, minute by minute, what is happening to the broad middle of the London market helped to create a self-fulfilling upward spiral in second-tier stocks? The facts do not support the case. As the chart shows, the two indices have moved in opposite directions - relative to the market as a whole - on a noticeable cycle. The most spectacular feature of the chart is the big relative upswing of the second-tier stocks in the 1980s boom. That was followed by a two-year period during which the blue chips had the advantage. Since the end of 1990, big and mid-sized stocks have bumped up and down in regular patterns, with the Mid 250 tracing a substantial move upwards from the autumn of last year. Is the Mid 250's latest period of outperformance about to draw to a temporary close, as the Warburg analysts suggested this week? One way of answering this question is to look at the factors which influence the Mid 250's performance. Some sectors are much more heavily represented in the Mid 250 than in the FT-SE 100. Building Materials, for example, which outperformed the broad market by 11 per cent in the closing three months of 1992. makes up 6.4 per cent of the Mid 250, but only 0.7 per cent of the FT-SE 100. Other cyclical industries - such as motor retailing, contracting and construction, and electricals - are also much more heavily represented in the Mid 250. Many of these have been big gainers from the post-devaluation market, as investors have looked for companies that stand to benefit from the expected recovery in the UK economy. Perhaps the biggest difference in sectoral composition, however, lies in the health and household stocks. These companies - the big international drug companies, such as Glaxo, Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham - make up 12.1 per cent of the FT-SE 100 index, but only 2.6 per cent of the Mid 250. As a whole, the health and household sector has underperformed the market by 19 per cent since September's devaluation. This week, for example, Glaxo dropped 61p to 732p; SmithKline Beecham fell 28p to 468p; and Wellcome lost 23p to 944p. These stocks alone are enough to account for a sizeable chunk of the FT-SE's underperformance. A modest market capitalisation and membership of a favoured sector did not help one company this week: Lilley, the Glasgow-based contracting and construction group collapsed with debts of more than Pounds 80m. Its shares were trading at 60 1/2 p as recently as March 1991; by last Friday they had reached 7 1/4 p, and on Wednesday, lacking the support of two out of its six banks, the company went into receivership. Another unexpected event of the week was a sudden burst of excitement in the bid for Evode, the glue-maker. Wassall, the mini-conglomerate, had appeared to be grinding its way unexcitingly towards a takeover. But on Friday, minutes after Wassall had announced its final offer, a white knight entered the fray. Laporte, which trails ICI by several miles but still qualifies for the title of Britain's second largest chemical company, said it would shortly be making a friendly bid. Ken Minton, Laporte's chief executive had carefully prepared the ground by approaching Andrew Simon, Evode's chairman, as early as 1986. 'After the Wassall bid was announced, Andrew Simon's first call after talking to his bankers was to me,' said Minton. On Friday, Laporte offered more, and Wassall promptly threw in the towel. With the Evode battle seemingly wrapped up, there was nothing to distract the market from the fate of Owners Abroad, the UK's second-largest package-tour operator. On Wednesday, the company was the victim of a hostile takeover bid from Airtours, the next-largest operator. The bid, all in shares, is worth Pounds 215m. There are several tricky elements in the calculation. First, the bid is conditional on Owners Abroad shareholders turning down a proposal from Thomas Cook, the travel agent chain controlled by a German regional bank, to take a 10 per cent stake in the company. Second, it faces potential competition scrutiny, since Airtours, Owners Abroad and Thomson (the market leader) between them have 60 per cent of the package holiday market - though Airtours believes the deal will be nodded through. Third, Westdeutsche Landesbank (Thomas Cook's owner) might choose to become more directly involved, to try to block the deal. And fourth, all-paper offers have been out of favour since the end of the 1980s boom. It is not surprising that the market thinks Airtours will have to do more to achieve success. Its shares closed on Friday at 288p, down 12p on the week; Owners Abroad rose 22 1/2 p to 119p - that is, 11p higher than the value of the Airtours bid.</p>

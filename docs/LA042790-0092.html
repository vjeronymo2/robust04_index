			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOSCOW BUSES WILL SPORT ADS MADE IN U.S.A.  </P> <P> Madison Avenue jumped on the glasnost bus in more ways then one Thursday.  </P> <P> An American firm that sells advertising space on buses from Los Angeles to New  York signed a multimillion-dollar licensing agreement to sell ads on every  public bus in Moscow -- and a dozen other Soviet cities.  </P> <P> By July, Transportation Displays Inc., a New York-based firm that claims to  sell more bus ads than any company in America, expects to place ads on the  sides of more than 14,000 buses in Moscow alone, for such companies as  Pepsi-Cola and McDonald's.  </P> <P> Although there has been advertising on buses in the Soviet Union before, this  is the first organized effort to license the sale of the ad space. Weary Soviet  commuters may soon have to get used to seeing such omnipresent ad slogans as  "You deserve a break today."  </P> <P> "This kind of opportunity only comes around once," said Bill Apfelbaum,  president and chief executive of Transportation Displays. "Russia is one of the  few countries that, until now, has hardly allowed any kind of advertising."  </P> <P> Because the agreement was just reached with the Soviet government this week,  the firm has yet to sign on any advertisers. But it expects to reach agreements  with several major American packaged goods makers, soft-drink companies,  fast-food outlets and even some airlines. The company is also negotiating with  advertisers from Europe and the Far East.  </P> <P> The move is regarded by advertising executives as an early attempt to cash in  on the new marketing opportunities in the Soviet Union that go hand in hand  with perestroika. And many more advertising entrepreneurs are expected to  follow suit. Earlier this month, Izvestia, one of the Soviet Union's largest  newspapers, placed ads in Forbes and Business Week that invited American  companies to advertise in their paper.  </P> <P> Not all American advertisers are jumping on the bandwagon. Warner Bros., for  example, recently signed a joint agreement to build movie theaters in Moscow.  But a Warner Bros. executive gave little indication on Monday that the company  would be very interested in advertising on the sides of Moscow buses. "Who  knows?" said John Jacobs, vice president of media at Warner Bros. "When  American marketers look to Russia, some are already finding out there's not as  much discretionary income as they thought."  </P> <P> But at least one American advertising executive said Transportation Displays  will probably be successful. "Any form of commercial communication in Russia  will be new, therefore it will be news," said Gerrold R. Rubin, president of  the Los Angeles agency Rubin Postaer &amp; Associates. "Besides, this seems to  be one that will be very accessible."  </P> <P> Indeed, because there is little private transportation in the Soviet Union, the  majority travel by bus. Consider, while Los Angeles has about 2,000 public  buses and New York has about 4,000, Moscow has more than 14,000. The bus ads  are expected to be seen by up to 300 million people throughout the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> But they will not come cheaply. The bus ads, which will be about 12 feet long  and 2 feet high, will cost about $500 each, said Apfelbaum. It would cost about  $200,000 to appear on 400 buses -- which Apfelbaum suggests is a minimum for  much market penetration. Although cigarette advertising will be permitted, no  ads for alcoholic beverages are allowed, he said.  </P> <P> Will his company blight the landscape in Moscow? "It's not blight, it's a way  to brighten the dreary environment," said Apfelbaum. "Besides, Moscow will  never look like La Cienega Boulevard."  </P></p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Algeria sets out democracy plans ALGERIA is to change the laws which took a radical Islamic party to the brink of power, and will hold a constitutional referendum this year, as two key elements of a plan to return to democracy, according to Mr Ali Kafi, the head of state, Reuter reports from Algiers. Mr Kafi also pledged that a 'transition period' for a return to democracy would be kept as short as possible and that Algeria would move in 'an organised way towards a market economy'. More talks would be held with political parties and groups before the referendum. He said: 'The whole of the laws organising the pluralist political system we envisage putting in place will be corrected in the light of experience.' Under the present law, just 15 Algerian adults can form a political party. Parties, theoretically, already cannot be based on religion, language or region, but the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was allowed to register and made no effort to hide its aims - to make Algeria a fundamentalist state. The FIS was banned last year. But opponents of Islamists say two more moderate existing parties are also based on religion, while others are seen as essentially regional. The mandate of the collective presidency, which took over from President Chadli Benjedid, is due to expire at the end of this year</p>

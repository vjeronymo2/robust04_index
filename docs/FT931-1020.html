			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Ford says strike had little impact SOME 8,000 white-collar staff at Ford held a 24-hour strike yesterday but the company said the stoppage had not interrupted production on the launch-day of the new Mondeo model. Mr Jim Thomas, chief staff negotiator at Ford, said the strike had been 'a total success' and had showed 'the depth of feeling' among the workforce over the issue of compulsory redundancies. The company is 80 jobs short of the 2,200 cuts it has been seeking by voluntary means. It has said it will impose compulsory redundancies if it does not reach its target by the end of this month.</p>

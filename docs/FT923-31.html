			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (3): Allies needed in fight for survival - Paul Taylor examines the European industry's response to intense competition THE European personal computer industry remains in a state of turmoil with new products such as lightweight notebook portables stealing the limelight, old distribution channels under threat from direct sales and hardware prices continuing to tumble. Figures from Dataquest, the market research group, underline the dynamics of the European PC marketplace. Spurred by growing sales of portables, overall PC unit shipments rose by 5 per cent in the 1992 first half but, because of fierce price competition and falling margins, the value of shipments fell by 8 per cent across Europe. Hounded by the PC clone-makers who assemble commodity-priced components from Far Eastern suppliers and savaged by the successful direct sellers from both sides of the Atlantic - such as Dell and AST of the US and smaller UK-based companies such as Elonex and Opus Technology - the established PC manufacturers have had to respond. Even International Business Machines (IBM) and Compaq, which still head the European PC sales league table, were forced to slash prices and launch cut-price clones of their own earlier this year in an effort to preserve market shares. Meanwhile, those established in the European computer industry - such as Olivetti, Bull and Siemens Nixdorf - have also been under intense price and product pressure, but know that PC's represent a critical source of revenues they cannot afford to lose. In their battle to survive they have been forming new alliances aimed at securing access to the Risc (reduced instruction set computing) micro-processors expected to power future generations of desktop PCs as well as engineering and scientific workstations. In the process, Europe has become a battleground for the US computer giants trying to tie up markets for their new chip technologies. Few, if any, of the European players can afford the heavy research and development costs needed to stay ahead in the chip development race, while US groups have the technology but need European partners to provide access to Europe's fragmented markets. In July, one of the final pieces of puzzle fell into place when Digital Equipment (DEC) of the US reached an agreement to acquire up to a 10 per cent stake in Olivetti of Italy at a cost of Dollars 370m, well over twice the market value. Groupe Bull of France began the process in 1989 by paying Dollars 500m to acquire Zenith Data Systems (ZDS) of the US. Zenith has since become central to Bull's recovery plan and its aggressive push into the desktop PC and fast-growing portable notebook market. Bull is hoping ZDS will provide up to 40 per cent of overall revenues by 1994, compared with about 20 per cent of its Dollars 6bn revenues now. According to Dataquest, ZDS lifted Bull into sixth position in the European PC market in terms of value last year, behind IBM, Compaq, Apple, Olivetti and Commodore. IBM, which already takes portables from Zenith, spent Dollars 100m earlier this year to take a small stake in Bull, a deal which will give the French group access to IBM's PowerRISC chip technology and give IBM another foothold in the European market. Meanwhile Fujitsu of Japan acquired ICL of the UK two years ago and ICL in turn acquired Finland's Nokia Data. Among Europe's big computer groups, only Siemens of Germany now lacks a big overseas IT partner. But the German group has more than enough problems stemming from the losses at Siemens-Nixdorf Informationssysteme (SNI), the computer systems company formed after it acquired the ailing Nixdorf last year. Siemens admits it underestimated the difficulties of the merger and the perilous state of the European PC market. It recently announced plans to shed a further 6,500 jobs at SNI by September 1995, in addition to the 4,000 already lost as part of a rationalisation programe aimed at saving Dm600m annually and halving SNI's DM781m 1991 loss. Although Olivetti remains Europe's biggest indiginous PC maker, it too has problems. Its share of the market has fallen from more than 11 per cent in 1987 to little more than 6 per cent last year. Last year Olivetti lost Dollars 387m and although it has shed a quarter of its workforce in the past two years, further cuts may be neccesary if it is to return to profitability. Although the Italian group has already launched the M700 work station built around the Mips Risc chip it makes no secret of the fact that the driving force behind the deal with DEC from its point of view was that it will provide it with access to DEC's Risc chip, the Alpha microprocessor for use in future products. DEC's Alpha chip, launched earlier this year, is the most advanced of its kind and the US group has set its sights on capturing a large slice of the European market for Risc-based machines. However, until the deal with Olivetti, DEC had no share of the fast-growing European Risc market, which is dominated by Sun Microsystems with almost a 60 per cent share. But staying in business as a PC manufacturer in Europe these days is about more than having the right technology. As low-cost, high-volume clone makers monopolise the bottom end of the market, established manufacturers are having to differentiate their products, for example ICL with its emphasis on ergonomics and integrated networking software. They are also selectively expanding the variety of the distribution channels they use, sometimes to include direct sales and PC superstores as well as the established dealer networks. And they are taking a broader view of the marketplace. Even young companies such as Elonex, which has grown into the biggest direct sales computer supplier in the UK in just six years, is now focusing on wider horizons. The North London-based company has followed Dell, Opus and other direct sellers and set up sales offices in Paris and Brussels and production facilities in France. Ms Sue Davis, general manager of the Paris Elonex office, says it is 'essential' for any company that wants to be taken seriously as a European PC supplier 'to set up continental operations'.</p>

He said that Libya responded to UN Security Council  Resolution 731 and made "numerous initiatives" to end the  Lockerbie issue, "but the United States and France continue to  adopt the policy of escalation against Libya."    In a statement to AL-HAYAH in Cairo, Abu-al-Duwayrat  expected  sanctions against his country to be toughened in April so as to  include the freezing of Libyan assets abroad and a ban on oil  imports. He said that toughening the sanctions would not cause  Libya to change its position "or abandon its sovereignty." He  pointed out that his country has expressed willingness to secure  a "fair trial" for the two suspects in the case of the U.S.  plane blown up over Lockerbie (Scotland in 1988). He urged the  Western states to "return the problem to its legal character,  instead of politicizing it." [passage omitted]</p>

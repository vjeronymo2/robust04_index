			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GRANADA HILLS HAS ALL THE HEROES  </P> <P> Down through the years, it seemed that there was always someone to carry the  Canoga Park High football team.  </P> <P> In the '60s, it was running back Bob Adams who led the Hunters to their last  City Section championship in 1968.  </P> <P> In the '70s, Canoga Park had All-City tailback Mark Terranova.  </P> <P> In the '80s, it was all-league running back Mike Conover.  </P> <P> But as they approach the '90s, the Hunters have become the hunted.  </P> <P> Granada Hills, the Valley-area's top-ranked team, showed Canoga Park no mercy  Friday night, stalking the Hunters and dropping them, 44-6, in a Northwest  Valley Conference game at Granada Hills.  </P> <P> About the only thing the woeful Hunters (0-6, 0-3 in conference play) had in  common with the Highlanders was their green-and-white school colors.  </P> <P> Granada Hills running back Brett Washington led the way, rushing for 165 yards  and two touchdowns -- his seventh and eighth of the year.  </P> <P> Granada Hills scored on its first three possessions and was driving again when  the half mercifully ended for Canoga Park.  </P> <P> The Highlanders went 54 yards on their first scoring march, Washington running  seven yards for the touchdown with 7:01 remaining in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Leon Glasgow capped a 56-yard drive with a 13-yard touchdown burst late in the  second period. Andy Petroski added the kick, putting Granada Hills ahead, 14-0.  </P> <P> It was Washington again in the second quarter, rambling untouched 17 yards on a  draw play to score his second touchdown. Petroski's kick made it 21-0  Highlanders with 8:51 left in the first half.  </P> <P> Granada Hills held Canoga Park to three yards rushing in the first half and 123  yards overall.  </P> <P> The Highlanders, led by Washington's 123 yards, had 221 yards in offense in the  first half.  </P> <P> Granada Hills (6-0, 3-0) led, 21-0, at intermission, then tacked on 16  third-quarter points to turn the game into a runaway.  </P> <P> Even backup quarterback Chris Gadomski got into the act, tossing a 75-yard  touchdown pass to Glasgow in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Hunter quarterback David Erhardt was about all Canoga Park had going for it.  </P> <P> Erhardt completed 15 of 31 passes for 200 yards and one touchdown. He threw one  interception.  </P> <P> Erhardt's 39-yard touchdown pass to David Payne with 2:07 left broke a two-game  streak during which the Highlander defense had not given up an offensive  touchdown.  </P> <P> Granada Hills has allowed only 40 points in six games.  </P></p>

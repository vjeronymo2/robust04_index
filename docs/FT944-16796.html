			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / US launches probe into car pricing policies The US Department of Justice has launched an inquiry into pricing practices in the car industry. Government anti-trust lawyers have asked the National Automobile Dealers' Association and several of its officers for information on the practice of no-haggle pricing. Following the successful example of GM's Saturn subsidiary, many dealers have started to publish firm prices instead of following the traditional practice of publishing an unrealistically high label price, and negotiating discounts. Some have also adopted the practice of 'value-pricing', in which they sell some popular models with a package of normally optional extras at a single low recommended price. But the Justice Department request for information spreads beyond pricing, and could herald a broad investigation of dealership arrangements in the industry. None of the big carmakers has yet been contacted by the Justice Department, but all were asked to provide information earlier this summer for an investigation into their relationships with car hire companies. That investigation appeared to focus on whether carmakers had cut back sales of heavily discounted vehicles to independent hire companies. Ford owns Hertz and an interest in Budget, while Chrysler owns the Dollar and Thrifty companies. GM is in the process of selling its stake in National Car Rental. The US industry experienced years of relatively lax anti-trust enforcement in the Reagan and Bush administrations, which limited their challenges, for the most part, to cartel behaviour and horizontal mergers between competitors. However, the Clinton administration has shown more interest in vertical arrangements - either mergers between supplier and customer or contractual arrangements such as minimum resale price agreements which could raise prices for the consumers. Both Ms Anne Bingaman, the Justice Department's assistant attorney general in charge of anti-trust, and Mr Robert Pitofsky, recently nominated to head the Federal Trade Commission, have expressed interest in reviving the enforcement of anti-trust laws against vertical arrangements.</p>

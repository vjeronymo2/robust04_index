			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADVISER TO RABIN REPORTEDLY MEETS WITH PLO OFFICIAL  </P> <P> An Israeli newspaper reported Friday that an aide to Defense Minister Yitzhak  Rabin met with a Palestinian leader on how to end the uprising in the occupied  lands.  </P> <P> The Hebrew daily Maariv said Rabin adviser Shmuel Goren visited Faisal  Husseini, who is imprisoned at the Kfar Yonah prison in central Israel, and  that the two held a series of secret meetings on political initiatives for  restoring calm to the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> Reports on the talks were passed to top PLO officials abroad, the newspaper  said.  </P> <P> Defense Ministry spokesman Eitan Haber refused comment on the reported  meetings, which would mark a shift in the government's policy of not talking  with the Palestine Liberation Organization. Israel considers the PLO a  terrorist organization.  </P> <P> Husseini is scheduled to be released from prison Sunday. He has been held  without trial most of the past 21 months, accused of anti-government activity.  </P> <P> Fuad Aref, an associate of Husseini, said that he visited Husseini on Monday  and that Husseini denied rumors of exploratory talks with Israeli leaders.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Ezer Weizman, the science minister in Israel's Cabinet, told the  Jerusalem Post that it is time for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to "remove the  taboo" on speaking with the PLO.  </P></p>

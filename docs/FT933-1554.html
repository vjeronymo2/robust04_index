			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Currencies The political crisis in Moscow is causing much less worry in currency markets than the attempted coup of 1991. It would be gratifying if this were because the money movers have seen the limited relevance of an economy which accounts for barely 3 per cent of global output. The stock arguments for marking down the D-Mark in response to Russian uncertainty - the risk to German exports and of loan losses at banks - sound hollow. The banks are well provided against loss on any loans which are not already covered by export credit guarantees; trade with Russia dwindled long ago. The brief downward lurch of the D-Mark may thus turn out to have been a buying opportunity. Certainly it offered France and other ERM countries a chance to rebuild their foreign exchange reserves on the cheap. Such purchases may continue to underpin the D-Mark for a while yet. So should the wide differential between German and US interest rates. This is not to deny the psychological impact of the leadership battle in Moscow. Doubtless any violence which raised the spectre of mass westward emigration would send the dollar soaring again against the D-Mark. Arguably, too, German equities are vulnerable to correction with the DAX index at nearly 1,900. Their relative slowness to recover yesterday morning's losses suggests the market is still sensitive to the possibility of bad news. The dollar's longer-term recovery still depends, though, on robust economic growth in the US - and that is still far from being an established fact.</p>

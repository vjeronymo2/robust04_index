			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / UK Company News: Pearson in talks to buy US library Pearson, the media group, is in talks with ITC, a US television company, to buy a library with more than 10,000 hours of programmes and films. The library contains many of the programmes made by Lord Lew Grade such as The Prisoner and films such as On Golden Pond. ITC is owned by Morgan Private Equity, which in turn is a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings. According to Variety, the US magazine, negotiations have begun which could lead to Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, acquiring ITC in a deal worth Dollars 175m (Pounds 120m). Pearson yesterday declined to comment on the report. The signs are, however, that no agreement has yet been reached between the two sides after several months of negotiations. Such a deal would fit in well with the recent Pearson strategy of expanding in the media and entertainment sectors and concentrating on the acquisition of intellectual property rights. By acquiring Thames Television, Pearson bought the largest independent producer in the UK with one of the largest programme libraries. Previous expansion by UK broadcasters into the US production market has proved to be both dangerous and expensive. The purchase of MTM by TVS in 1988 for Dollars 320m led to serious financial problems and was at least a background factor in the company losing its south of England franchise to Meridian Broadcasting. Thames's move into the US production market, although on a smaller scale, was also fraught. Before last year's acquisition by Pearson, Thames sold Reeves Entertainment, the lossmaking US production company. The possible deal with ITC may involve only the library rather than new US production.</p>

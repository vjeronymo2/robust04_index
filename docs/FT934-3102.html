			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Small traders warn of death by de-regulation Owners of small shops warned yesterday that thousands could be put out of business by partial de-regulation of Sunday trading. Mr Morton Middleditch, chairman of Open, a group which represents 10,000 small shops, said Wednesday night's vote was a 'bleak evening for the independent sector'. He said competition from multiples had put more than 10,000 small shops out of business in the 1980s and the closure rate was likely to increase if de-regulation became law. Mr Ronnie Dunbar said he intended to continue Sunday closing at R. Dunbar's grocery, greengrocery and hardware shop, in Sandyford, one of Newcastle upon Tyne's inner areas. He refuses to be awed by the combined power of Tyneside's concentration of multiple retailers. His window display evokes the days before big supermarkets, with its white paper doilies, pyramids of tins and baskets of shiny red apples. 'I don't think the little shops are going to fade away as fast as the big supermarkets would like,' said Mr Dunbar. R. Dunbar has been in the family for 50 years and has outlived every other shop in the area. Once this corner of Newcastle had six butchers, a wetfish shop and cobblers; all have gone. Successors include sandwich bars, a video shop and a poodle parlour. Mr Dunbar's main competitor is not the supermarkets, but the VG shop on the next street corner, which opens on Sundays. 'I work six days a week, long hours,' he said. 'That's enough for me.' A few doors along Starbeck Avenue Ms Karen Southall and her partner Mr Gerry Noonan of Feasts Delicatessen also close on Wednesday afternoons - 'in line with Ronnie' - and all day Sunday. The couple see no benefit in opening on Sundays. Ms Southall would have preferred total deregulation, for personal reasons, so she could have more choice of shopping on Sundays, her only free day. On Merseyside, Mr Ian Gentles has opened Ian's Foodstore in Oxford Road, Crosby, from 9am to 6pm on Sundays since the local Sainsbury's started Sunday opening a year ago. He takes only as much in the full day as he once did in three hours, but he and his wife Betty are now on a seven-day week. They have not had a holiday since their honeymoon 32 years ago. Mr Gentles fears that Kwik Save's new supermarket in Waterloo, half a mile away, will feel obliged to enter the Sunday fray against Sainsbury's. If Iceland Frozen Foods, a few hundred yards from Kwik Save, joins in, life could become very tough indeed. When Mr Gentles started in Oxford Road in 1960 at the age of 20, there were six other small grocers within a mile and a half. They have all succumbed since Sainsbury's opened in 1981.</p>

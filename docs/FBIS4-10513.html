			<p>BFN     [Text] Comitan, 11 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- A human rights  association reported on 11 April the alleged kidnapping of their  president by ranchers, and requested the intervention of Chiapas  Governor Javier Lopez Moreno.    Candelaria Alfaro Garcia, the organization's spokeswoman,  said that Enrique Perez Lopez, president of the  South-Southeastern Human Rights Association, was reportedly  kidnapped by 80 cattlemen at La Piedad Farm, Chicomucelo  Municipality. The source added that Perez Lopez was forced  aboard a truck on Sunday and taken to La Florecita Farm,  Chicomucelo. His whereabouts are unknown.    The local human rights ombudsman [words indistinct] was  kidnapped after he accepted an invitation to visit La Piedad  Farm, where ranchers are accused of violating peasants' rights.    The charge was filed in the Chiapas town of Comitan, about  1,400 km southeast [words indistinct] of Mexico City and about  200 km from the region of Los Altos, where an armed group  emerged on 1 January.    Peasants and Indians have trespassed on land belonging to  large landowners since the appearance of the Zapatist National  Liberation Front and during the peace talks between this group  and Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis.    The human rights organization on Monday sent a letter to  Governor Lopez Moreno to plead for the release of Perez Lopez  and to urge the state Attorney General's Office to punish the  alleged kidnappers.    Spokeswoman Alfaro Garcia added that the presumed kidnappers  are Guillermo Ruiz, Manuel and Arturo Velazco, Amin Garcia, and  Corazon Lopez, among others. Meanwhile, the state Attorney  General's Office pointed out that it is about to Perez Lopez.  [sentence as received]</p>

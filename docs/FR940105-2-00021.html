			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Selection Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All applications will be reviewed and judged individually, independent from all other applications, by each of four qualified evaluators acting without consultation among themselves. Each evaluator will score each application by awarding points for each of the three (3) evaluation criteria set forth in IV, below. Scores awarded for each evaluation criterion will be multiplied by the weight assigned to that criterion. A maximum score of 100 points may be awarded to an application. Once scores have been determined individually by each evaluator, a final score for each application will be determined by averaging the scores provided by each of the four evaluators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II.

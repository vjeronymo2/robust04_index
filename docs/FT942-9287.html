			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Fast growth in premium phone lines forecast Rapid growth in the market for premium-rate telephone services was predicted yesterday by the telephone information services watchdog. The Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services said it expected cable companies to join the market soon, offering premium-rate services over their telephone and television networks in urban areas. Baroness Dean, who chairs the committee, said: 'There will need to be a level playing field for all companies operating across all net-works.' The committee wants the cable industry to sign up to its code of practice for premium-rate services, to which British Telecommunications and Mercury already subscribe. Mr Richard Woollam, director of the Cable Television Association, said he was 'confident' it would do so. The premium-rate industry had a turnover of Pounds 250m last year. There are more than 350 service providers; nearly 20,000 services are in operation with an estimated 6m calls made each week. The entry of the cable companies into the business is likely to boost the number of services, and increase price competition between operators. At present calls cost a standard 39p a minute cheap rate and 49p a minute at other times, with only one premium-rate number - Mercury's 0881 - charging a lower rate. However, higher tariff bands are also in prospect for 'quality' business and information servicers, subject to approval by the committee. The committee said it was 'unlikely' to agree to higher tariffs for services with appeal to children and a mass audience. The committee's annual report shows high usage of premium-rate services by children. A survey of 1,000 youngsters aged between seven and 19 found that 21 per cent had used a service in the previous three months, with usage highest among 11 and 13-year-olds (34 per cent). The main cause of complaints to it is misleading advertising for premium-rate services and inadequate pricing information.</p>

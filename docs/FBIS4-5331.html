			<p>BFN     [Text] The government hopes that Japanese Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa's resignation today will not affect Indonesia-  Japan bilateral relations, especially in trade and economic  fields. Speaking in Jakarta today, Irawan Abidin, director of  foreign information service of the Foreign Affairs Department,  said the Indonesian Government is closely monitoring political  developments in Japan and hopes that the Japanese prime  minister's resignation will not affect existing cordial  relations between the two countries.    Speaking on a separate occasion, Sabam Sirait, a member of  parliament, said Hosokawa's resignation will provide an  opportunity for Japan's Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] to stage  a comeback and assume the country's premiership which the party  lost in the last general elections. Sabam Sirait noted that  factional power struggle within the LDP may still continue if  the party regains the premiership. However, he believes  Indonesia is not expected to suffer the consequences of such a  scenario.</p>

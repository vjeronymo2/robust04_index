			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Volvo Volvo looks in much less of a bind than when the doomed merger with Renault was proposed last year. Yesterday's half-year figures show the impressive impact of higher car and truck sales on profits. Since Volvo's main markets  -the US, UK and Sweden - are recovering early, that could be a taste of things to come from other European manufacturers. The weakness of the krona has also sharpened Volvo's competitive edge. Shareholders who argued that the merger seriously undervalued Volvo must be feeling a warm glow of satisfaction, not least because the shares have outperformed the Swedish market by 30 per cent this year. More importantly, the balance sheet has been restored to good health without the rights issue that was threatened if shareholders rejected the merger option. With its stakes in Renault and Pharmacia - and the BCP consumer product business - still to go, Volvo should have more than enough cash to develop its next generation of cars and trucks without a partner. The lingering doubt is whether Volvo has sufficient market clout on its own to earn a decent rate of return on this investment. Although it has been gaining market share, the suspicion remains that Volvo sells too few cars to be sure of making an attractive return. The disposals programme merely buys time in which the question of alliances can be revisited. Until Volvo comes up with a convincing answer, though, it looks like a riskier investment than its stronger competitors. On a multiple of around seven times next year's forecast earnings, higher than the best of the US car giants, it is now difficult to argue that Volvo is cheap.</p>

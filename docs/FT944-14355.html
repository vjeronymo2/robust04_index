			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Mahathir hits out at Japan Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, has attacked Japan for failing to offer sufficient help to its fellow countries in east Asia. Dr Mahathir, on a visit to Japan, said Japan could make amends for its 'past dark deeds' by playing a pivotal role in the region. 'We do not need apologies,' said Dr Mahathir. 'What we need it your co-operation and help to develop us.' Dr Mahathir said he was dissappointed that Japan still did not want to support the East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC), the Malaysian inspired idea for a regional trade forum. Malaysia has been pushing for the establishment of the EAEC but has encountered opposition from the US which sees it as a potential trade bloc. Japan is thought to be unwilling to support the EAEC for fear of upsetting its trade relationship with the US. Dr Mahathir has shown increasing frustration with Japan on a number of issues, including what he feels is a Japanese reluctance to transfer technology to Malaysia's fast expanding economy. During his visit to Japan Dr Mahathir called for action to tackle Japan's large trade surplus with Malaysia. He said the rise in the yen had caused Malaysia considerable problems and Malaysia would not be seeking any more yen loans. Malaysia had tried to renegotiate its Japanese loans in the hope of reducing its debt burden. Kieran Cooke, Kuala Lumpur</p>

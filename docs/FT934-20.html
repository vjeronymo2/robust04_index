			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses aim for strong end to 1993 Senior bourses seemed determined to see a strong conclusion to 1993, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT ended 1993 with a new high, the DAX index jumping 51.98, or 2.3 per cent to 2,266.68 for a gain on the year of 47.6 per cent. Turnover soared from DM7.9bn to DM11.2bn. Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf said that the late rally, like most of the business over the holiday period, reflected futures and OTC-related buying. The big winners of 1993 tended to be cyclicals, or story-related. Mannesmann, with its cellular telephone network prospects, led the DAX constituents with a 1993 gain of 85.5 per cent, and other story-led stocks in the top 10 included Volkswagen - up 81.7 per cent on restructuring prospects, in spite of a temporary fall from grace - Lufthansa, with enhanced prospects in international airways, and Schering on its BetaSeron multiple sclerosis drug potential. The clear loser was Metallgesellschaft, down 17.8 per cent after a further DM2.50 fall to DM273 yesterday on reports that the company is planning to raise its capital and that foreign creditor banks are preparing to recall loans. PARIS ended close to, but just below Wednesday's 1993 high, the CAC-40 index finishing 0.67 lower at 2,281.22. Turnover stayed surprisingly strong at FFr4.85m. Eurotunnel rose FFr2.15, or 4.5 per cent to FFr51.60 after Wednesday's late news of a 10-year extension to its concession to operate the Channel tunnel. Euro Disney recovered another FFr1.10, or 3.4 per cent to FFr33 on short covering. MADRID regained a slice of the ground it lost after the Bank of Spain's decision to intervene in Banesto and replace its board of directors, the general index rising 4.63 to 319.19 as turnover stayed high at Pta38.5bn. BCH was the best performer in a resurgent banking sector, rising Pta295, or 9.5 per cent to Pta3,400. However, BBV was relatively subdued, rising only Pta40 to Pta 3,115 although the bank said, in contradiction of analysts and of press reports, that it was not planning to take over Banesto. MILAN was stirred to life after a subdued start by confirmation of the long awaited accord between Montedison and Shell on merging part of their chemicals businesses. However, a 0.34 dip in the Comit index to 613.49 was attributed to continuing reaction to news late on Wednesday that the government was planning to re-introduce a revised system of capital gains tax. Montedison rose L34 or 3.9 per cent to L912.90 in heavy volume of 22.8m shares on expectations that the agreement would enable the troubled Italian group to wipe out some L3,000bn of debt. Olivetti put on L54 or 2.6 per cent to L2,133 following newspaper reports that talks with a German investor group over the sale of its Triumph-Adler subsidiary in Nuremberg were at an advanced stage. The Italian group was also helped by a L63 or 5.0 per cent rise to L1,331 in the Cofide holding company amid rumours of a reorganisation and possible asset sales. AMSTERDAM was broadly higher on a strong dollar and firmer Dutch bonds. The CBS Tendency index finished 0.90 higher at 149.20. Philips stayed active, adding 30 cents to Fl 40.00. ABN-Amro, weak in recent days, put on Fl 1.20 to Fl 71.50. ING added Fl 1.30 to Fl 92.90 after it acquired 49.9 per cent of the shares in the construction group, Ballast Nedam from British Aerospace. Akzo, the chemical group, gained Fl 2.00 at Fl 188.00 after it outlined benefits from the takeover of Sweden's Nobel. ZURICH bounced higher after a two-session consolidation,the SMI index adding 23.4 to 2,957.6 on the last trading day of the year. Interest centred on industrials which profit from the firmer dollar and hopes of an economic recovery in 1994. Ciba registered, the most actively traded, ended SFr15 firmer at SFr900. The troubled telecoms group, Ascom, added SFr85 or 6.3 per cent to SFr1,425 while Oerlikon Buhrle, the arms to fashion combine, rose SFr9 or 6.9 per cent to SFr140: both shares were tipped in some quarters as an alternative to blue chips in 1994. DUBLIN, closed on Wednesday when London surged, added 1.9 per cent as the market sought to catch up. The Iseq index rose 35.69 to 1,883.44 with firm demand evident, but few investors willing to sell holdings.

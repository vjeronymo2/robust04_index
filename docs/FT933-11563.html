			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Lock-out threat by Hyundai TWO Hyundai companies threatened to lock out workers unless their unions reduced their pay demands as South Korea's biggest conglomerate enters its 55th day of industrial action today, writes John Burton in Seoul. The government also dispatched more riot police to Ulsan, the south-eastern city that is the main manufacturing base of Hyundai, in possible preparation to end the strikes affecting six Hyundai companies. Meanwhile, workers at Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry, the first Hyundai company to stage industrial action in early June, voted to approve a wage settlement by a wide margin. The two companies threatened with lock-outs are Hyundai Heavy Industries, the shipbuilding unit and the biggest group subsidiary on strike, and Hyundai Construction Equipment. Hyundai Wood Industries became the first Hyundai company to face a lock-out on Tuesday. Workers at the Hyundai companies are seeking pay raises higher than that offered by management and the reinstatement of fired union leaders at several plants. Other companies on strike are Hyundai Mipo Dockyard and Korea Flange, which rejected proposed pay pacts on Tuesday, and Hyundai Electrical Engineering.</p>

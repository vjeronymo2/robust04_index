			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel gets a sinking feeling - The rapidly falling share price is causing concern While an investigation continues into the alleged downward manipulation of Eurotunnel's share price prior to the pricing of its Pounds 858m rights issue, market forces have now left the shares at the same depressed level. With four trading days to go before the issue closes, underwriters remained optimistic of a strong take-up, but the rapidly sliding share price is causing concern. Eurotunnel shares closed yesterday at 303p, only  3/4 p above their low point for the year, and the take-up of rights shares is likely to fall with any further drop in the share price. The manipulation investigation by the French stock exchange authorities was sparked by suspicions that underwriters may have forced the share price down before the price was fixed, through short selling, in order to limit their underwriting risk. 'We have no evidence that links the short selling to any of the underwriters,' said one of the leading underwriters. But the underlying assumption behind the manipulation scenario that the share price would reach a higher equilibrium is proving unfounded, and the genuine level of market demand remains in doubt. The small French shareholders will be a core factor in the take-up, accounting for about 43 per cent of the existing shares. French bankers were yesterday suggesting that those shareholders who had struggled thus far, would take up the tunnel's second rights issue since the tunnel is now opening and the revenues will soon start to flow in. 'In France there will be no problem', says Mr Christian Cambier, the French head of the association for Eurotunnel shareholders. 'Investors would have sold out already if they were not going to subscribe, and the price they have to pay to take up their shares is low.' This view was, unsurprisingly, echoed by Mr Jean-Michel Plou, first vice president of Banque Indosuez, which led the underwriting in France. Nevertheless, brokers said there had been strong selling of both nil paid and ordinary shares in France, and the risk for the underwriters remains. Given the amount of small shareholders, who traditionally are more likely not to take up rights, underwriters expected between 5 and 10 per cent of shareholders not to take up rights. This would leave a rump of up to 32m new shares. But once again, news on the progress of the tunnel has not been favourable in winning over investors concerned about the risks of its profit projections. Stock markets have not significantly improved since the May 26 announcement of the rights issue, and shareholders are being asked to pay up to substantially increase their exposure. For those original shareholders, who took up the 1990 rights issue, the latest cash call represents 73 per cent of their original investment. This time round, there are no free travel incentives to encourage take-up. At the current share price, it seems unlikely that underwriters will be left with more than the expected 10 per cent, and this rump will be placed out to institutions. In the circumstances of a fully sub-underwritten offer, pitched at a reasonable discount to the current share price, this process would be a formality. Institutions who sub-underwrote the issue, would be expected to take up their share of the placement, rather than be forced to take up under-writing commitments. In the case of Eurotunnel, this will not be done with any enthusiasm, and if the share price falls further, so will the demand. A leading UK fund manager added: 'It all gets back to who wants to buy the shares, and my sense is that there is just no institutional support.' Mr Richard Hannah, analyst at UBS Securities, said: 'I would remain cautious about the genuine appetite for shares in the market. At the moment trading is in the hundreds of thousands of shares. It will be different if underwriters are offering many millions of shares.' One underwriter pointed out that in the 1990 rights issue, the share price had sunk closer to the rights issue at the same stage of the offer, but had thence rebounded to gain a 98 per cent take-up. He was optimistic the same would follow this time. In 1990, however, confidence was restored by the historic, and very timely, meeting of the French and English ends of the tunnel just two days before the issue closed. This time round, there are no engineering miracles left to rescue underwriters if the share price sinks further before the close.</p>

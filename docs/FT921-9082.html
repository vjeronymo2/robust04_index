			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Selling bout in P &amp; O SHARES in P &amp; O fell sharply, losing 22 early in the session on market talk of developments at Chelsfield, the private company with which P &amp; O jointly owns the Pall Mall Properties venture. P &amp; O, now in its closed reporting season ahead of the next profits statement, would say only that it did not 'comment on market rumours'. However, a leading agency service appeared to quote a P &amp; O source as saying: 'There is no truth in the rumours.' This helped to steady nerves in the stock market, and the shares came off the bottom to finish 12 down at 398p on turnover of 5.6m. After the market closed, Mr Elliot Bernard, chairman of Chelsfield, said: 'All we are doing is raising funds to complete the demerger of Pall Mall Properties, as already publicly stated.' Reuters busy The announcement of full-year results by Reuters Holdings, the international news and information organisation, prompted a highly volatile trading session for the stock. The shares were 34 down at one stage but closed a penny firmer at 1104p with more than 3m traded. The stock had risen strongly in recent days ahead of the figures and most observers said the company would need to pull something out of the hat if the rise were to be sustained. The shares were lower at the market opening yesterday and fell sharply when it transpired that the figures were directly in line with analysts' forecasts and that sales growth was predicted to be slower this year than last. Many houses, particularly Morgan Stanley, were offering stock, but US investment bank Goldman Sachs bought aggressively. Then, at the company's presentation, analysts took a more considered view of the figures, particularly the higher than expected cash reserves of Pounds 500m. Also, managing director Mr Peter Job said he was confident that Reuters' Dealing 2000-2 automatic dealing system would be launched soon following successful site tests. The shares recovered and Warburg was able to offer shares at 1110p after bidding at 1080p. The market buzzed with stories that a stakebuilder had been at work in Lonrho, the troubled conglomerate, and that a shareholding in excess of 3 per cent and possibly as high as 5 per cent was about to be announced. The suggestions inevitably triggered rumours of an imminent bid and the shares responded by moving up 5 to 127p with a hefty 4.9m traded. Dealers also noted good buying in the traded options market. There has been very heavy turnover in Lonrho since it revealed sharply reduced profits and a cut in the dividend on January 23. A stakebuilder could have taken advantage of this weakness and the ready availability of stock. Lonrho plummeted before and after the dividend cut, slumping from the 200p mark in December last year to a low of 108p at one point. Earlier in the session, there were rumours that Charter Consolidated, the industrial materials group, was about to launch a bid for Lonrho and would help to finance such a move by selling its near 39 per cent holding in Johnson Matthey, the precious metals refining group, to Rustenburg, one of the world's biggest platinum producers. Charter held at 527p, while Johnson Matthey was a shade easier at 368p. Leading property shares were badly hit by the nervousness surrounding P &amp; O and Chelsfield. One trader said: 'The sector is very nervous and it just takes a story like this to put it into reverse.' The weakest stocks included MEPC, down 10 at 367p, Land Securities, off 10 at 457p, and Hammerson Ordinary, 12 cheaper at 485p. Poor sentiment over British Aerospace saw the shares fall 12 to 270p, a five-year low, on turnover of 4.5m. There are worries that the current weak oil price may delay the placing of firm orders, particularly the Al Yamamah 2 contract from Saudi Arabia. Fears for the 1992 dividend have also surfaced. British Airways continued to bask in the glow of Tuesday's better than expected results, adding 6 at 254p on 10m traded. Lloyds Bank underperformed the sector, in spite of a broker buy recommendation, and closed 8 down at 389p on good turnover of 2.8m as the market responded to stories that Lloyds is sole banker to Chelsfield, the privately owned property development group. Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance, badly hit by recent profits downgrades, staged a minor rally, the latter boosted by a recent heavyweight research document from Smith New Court. Royal put on 9 to 229p and Sun 2 to 271p. A Kleinwort Benson review of forthcoming preliminary results from the life assurance sector prompted keen interest in Legal &amp; General and Lloyds Abbey Life. The latter improved 3 to 388p as Kleinwort increased its final dividend estimate to 6.3p, up 5 per cent on last year, following Lloyds Abbey's unexpectedly good new business figures. Kleinwort is more cautious on L &amp; G, which lost 8 to 350p. Racal Electronics dipped 1 1/2 to 52p with turnover remaining high at 6.3m. Electronic Data, one of the market's high-flyers recently, attracted profit-taking and slid 73 to 440p. Talk that a large block of Taylor Woodrow stock was overhanging the market left the shares 6 down at 106p, the lowest for more than five years. The shares have tumbled recently as analysts chopped profits estimates for the group to take in expected land provisions. Morgan Stanley has shifted its 1991 profits estimate from Pounds 25m to zero, while Panmure Gordon recently cut its 1991 figure from Pounds 32m to Pounds 20m. Wellcome fell 15 to 1103p ahead of a television programme expected to be critical of its Aids treatment Retrovir, or AZT. Two weeks ago Wellcome shares jumped 24 after the company announced that a study had shown Retrovir could be used at an earlier stage of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Selling of Glaxo American Depositary Receipts in New York by the US house Bear Sterns was said to be behind a fall, for the shares in London, of 12 1/2 to 804 1/2 p. Tobacco groups BAT Industries and Rothmans International continued to suffer on fears that the European Parliament would back an EC plan to ban all tobacco advertising, except at the point of sale. BAT, also depressed by the expected effect of US floods on its insurance subsidiary Eagle Star, weakened 14 to 637p. Rothmans fell 14 to 1074p. Buy notes on Compass Group pushed it 3 higher to 440p. Paribas, the French-owned broking house, pointed to Compass's increased hospital occupancy levels, while Nomura drew attention to the potential for catering contracts. Leisure group Ladbroke continued to attract attention ahead of its results, due next month, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew confirming 'moderate' business in one of their recommended stocks. The shares added 4 at 219p on a turnover of 2.8m. Guinness rose 2 to 574p, supported by a strong buy recommendation from Shearson Lehman Brothers, which emphasised growth in profits from the beer division. Shearson believes beer, representing 27 per cent of profits, will outperform spirits in the near future. Nomura also recommended Guinness recently, expecting the company to outperform the market over the next five years. Food retailer Kwik Save receded 7 to 573p as County NatWest, continuing the recent trend among brokers, cut its profits forecast for the second time in a week, this time by Pounds 5m to Pounds 113m. Specialist chemical and industrial company BTP lost 8 to 244p after announcing a one-for-six rights issue at 205p to raise Pounds 28.3m to pay debt and cover the cost of new acquisitions. Hoare Govett's chemicals analyst Mr Martin Evans changed his recommendation on the stock from 'undervalued' to 'buy' and said that after the dilution of the new shares was taken into account the price had only declined by a penny.

Mobutu  dissolved the mainstream National Assembly as well and announced  the formation of a new transitional High Council of the Republic  cum National Assembly. He said it would hold its first session  on January 17 and would select a premier from two candidates  presented by Mobutu loyalists and the opposition led by Prime  Minister Etienne Tshisekedi.    The president, in power since 1965, said he hoped the new  High Council "would not get bogged down in the byzantine  quarrels" that have left Zaire with two rival governments,  parliaments and prime ministers.    Joseph Ileo, the vice president of the now-dissolved HCR,  immediately attacked the move, calling it a "constitutional coup  d'etat" by the Zairean president.    The Political Forces of the Conclave (FPC) gathered around  Mobutu and the Holy Alliance of Radical Opposition (USOR), which  backs the presidents's arch-rival Tshisekedi, had earlier in the  day reached agreement on reshaping the interim legislature, a  spokesman for the Holy Alliance, Gerard Kamanda, said. "The  president does not have the powers to dissolve the High Council  even if an agreement has been signed," Ileo told AFP, adding  that the documents should have been submitted to the council for  approval.    The aim of the latest round of negotiations -- which had  been  going on for more than 10 days -- had been to draw up an  agreement on Zaire's transition to genuine parliamentary  democracy and to form a new government, ending the co-existence  of rival teams.    Tshisekedi, whom the president was compelled to appoint as  prime minister last year but tried to sack in February as part  of a power struggle, had refused to step down. Tshisekedi  claimed to have the support of the national conference on  democracy which set up the original HCR and whose sovereignty  Mobutu always refused to recognise. Mobutu subsequently  appointed another prime minister, Faustin Birindwa.    Violent clashes in October 1991 led to increasing pressure  at  home and from major aid donors for Mobutu to reform his  autocratic system of government.    Tshisekedi was relected as de facto head of government in  August 1992 by the democracy conference.</p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA FINALS NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> DALY SAYS RILEY HAD SUBSTANCE AS WELL AS STYLE  </P> <P> They were rivals for years in the NBA scene and the GQ look, and may turn out  to be co-workers, so Chuck Daly did not let Pat Riley's departure from the  Lakers pass without notice Monday.  </P> <P> Theirs was a bond elevated by consecutive championship-round meetings between  the Lakers and Detroit Pistons. That a platoon of tailors could be kept in  business by either's vast wardrobe of Italian garb made the connection more of  a natural.  </P> <P> "It was a challenge -- particularly the dressing part of it," Daly joked before  the Pistons' practice in preparation for Game 4 of the NBA finals. "He was such  a superb dresser that the challenge was always there. Plus, he looks like a  movie star. He's got that mysterious look. Much younger, so it was an uphill  climb.  </P> <P> "Basketball-wise, he did a superb job. Yes, he had great personnel. But I think  (reporters) recognized by making him coach of the year what kind of job he had  done over the years. It's not always easy to coach great personnel."  </P> <P> Riley's announcement, of course, only increased speculation surrounding Daly's  future after seven seasons and three consecutive finals appearances with the  Pistons. Both have met with NBC executives regarding a move to television next  season when the NBA switches networks, and it would not be a surprise for both  to end up there.  </P> <P> "I think people should wait a while and let Pat Riley make his next move and  then fit the pieces together," said former Atlanta Coach Mike Fratello, here as  a commentator for Sports News Network. "Pat is not spur of the moment. He is  very calculated and acts things out in his mind. I think we'll see what he  does, and then it'll make sense."  </P> <P> Monday, Daly side-stepped the issue of a Piston-Laker alumni reunion, but at  the same time leaned.  </P> <P> "I'm coaching the Detroit Pistons," he said.  </P> <P> And next year?  </P> <P> "One never knows."  </P> <P> Hardly a definitive statement about a return for 1990-91.  </P> <P> Add fashion: The latest in footwear from Piston forward Dennis Rodman, who  previously modeled ice bags and wires connected to an electrical machine around  his injured left ankle, was an inflated blue sleeve that circulated cold water  around the joint. An air cast, it was called.  </P> <P> All this to help him get back to the lineup after skipping Game 3 because of  the continuing ankle problem. Ben Paolucci, the Piston team physician, listed  Rodman as questionable for tonight, but quickly added that he could go.  </P> <P> "He could have played (Sunday), but the plan was to hold him out unless we  absolutely need him," Paolucci said.  </P> <P> Rodman said he doesn't expect to play.  </P> <P> Clyde Drexler, Portland's primary scorer, dropped to 42.5% in the 19 playoff  games after making only nine of 23 shots in Game 3. He missed 14 times in the  second half, when he appeared to be trying to shoot the Trail Blazers back into  the game with jumpers, a tactic the Pistons would gladly take instead of  penetration.  </P> <P> "I think Clyde was trying to get something done," Coach Rick Adelman said.  "There were not a lot of guys giving us any offense, so maybe he was trying a  little too hard to take over the game."  </P> <P> But Adelman hasn't talked to Drexler about not pressing.  </P> <P> "I don't believe in that," he said. "I might talk to him about slowing down or  taking his time, but nothing about shot selection or when he shoots. Clyde is  such a creative player and I don't want to take away any of that creativity."  </P> <P> Drexler made one of his six three-point shots but he bristled at the notion  that the intent was to lift the Blazers single-handedly.  </P> <P> "Nope," he said. "It's a team game. I always want to get everyone involved. I'm  not Michael Jordan."  </P> <P> Take that any way you want.  </P> <P> Detroit's Mark Aguirre on teammate Bill Laimbeer and his not-so-subtle  strongman tactics:  </P> <P> "Bill gets everyone irritated. I don't know a game when he hasn't irritated the  other team. I love to play with him, but I'd sure try to punch him out if I  played against him."  </P></p>

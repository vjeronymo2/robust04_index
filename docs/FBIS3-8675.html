[Correspondent] Mr. President, what is your view of the  current political situation in Slovakia following the vote of  no-confidence in Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar?    [Kovac] According to the information I have so far received  from the president of our police corps, no gatherings of  citizens expressing disapproval of the parliament's decision,  with the exception of a gathering here in front of the  Primacialny Palace, have been reported. However, we are  speaking in late morning, and I do not know what will develop  later in the day.    I think that the parliament's decision was free and  democratic and that there was no pressure on the deputies. It  was possible to say everything in defense of the critic [of  Meciar, presumably speaking about himself], and the prime  minister also had an opportunity to say what he considered  necessary to say. Because we are in a democratic state, the  decision made by the majority is the valid one.    I have to take the view that the parliament consists of  deputies representing our citizens and thus, that the decision  was made by the representatives of our citizens. This is a  democratic decision that certainly does not mean any black mark  against our parliament in the eyes of our public or the world.    I think that the parliament was facing a difficult decision  also because, in substance, the matter was not just whether they  express support for the government or no-confidence in the  government because various speeches [in parliament] made it  clear that the issue was also to decide in favor of a gradual  implementation of an authoritarian system of power, or in favor  of strengthening a parliamentarian system of power. I think  that the parliament unequivocally decided to strengthen the  parliamentary system of power, thus sending a very positive  signal abroad where sometimes they have doubted whether we are  really striving to strengthen democracy and the constitutional  state of affairs in the Slovak Republic.    I also think that suitable conditions were created for us to  take gradual steps to implement the idea of political, civic,  and national reconciliation. Conditions are being created for  us to prepare ourselves for elections in a peaceful and  matter-of-fact atmosphere, to make it possible for our citizens  to decide our future in an election as far as the composition of  the parliament is concerned.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, can you say what steps you  are  undertaking or want to undertake to resolve the situation that  has arisen?    [Kovac] I have to proceed in accordance with the  Constitution, which means, first of all, that I must recall the  government and, at the same time, I want to ask the Movement for  a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] to try to form a coalition  government headed by somebody else and not by Vladimir Meciar  because a vote of no-confidence in him was passed. It may be  possible to form only a government of a broader or a broad  coalition. If the HZDS rejects this offer or does not succeed  in forming such a coalition, I would turn to those political  bodies that expressed in parliament no confidence in the present  prime minister and ask them to nominate a person who could form  a government. Of course, I will try to get the proposal for  such a government as soon as possible. I personally think that  it could all happen within 10 days, at the latest. Within this  timetable, I will ask all of the ministers to continue  exercising their present ministerial duties, and ask one of the  deputy prime ministers to head the government temporarily until  a new government is formed.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, are you then convinced that  the further political development in Slovakia will be peaceful  and above all democratic?    [Kovac] I am convinced about it and everybody, including  representatives of the HZDS and the SNS [Slovak National Party],  of the present opposition parties, and also the president and  citizens, all of them want it. If we declare certain rules and  steps leading to political, civic, and national reconciliation,  it will then become apparent who does not want to play according  to the rules, who says one thing and does another. We  desperately need civic, political, and national reconciliation,  and I am therefore, convinced that we will all contribute to  making it all possible.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said he did  not consider possible the presence of UN "blue helmets" in a  peace- keeping operation in Abkhazia.    He told INTERFAX at a news-conference in Moscow that he had  received this impression after a conversation with the UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    Grachev stressed that Russia would welcome an international  peace force in the region "on any terms" and "even under any  command." However, he said the UN is only ready to post more  observers in the area rather than to carry out a large scale  operation to disengage the Georgian and Abkhaz forces.    He did not rule out the involvement of CIS troops in the  operation, however only after a CIS summit in September.    He doubted that any former Soviet republic could dispatch to  the region of Georgian-Abkhaz confrontation a contingent as big  as the Russian force. Commonwealth states, in his opinion,  could send only small units, and the countries without armed  forces of their own could support the peace-keeping operation  with money.    Grachev said the mission in Abkhazia has so far been going  smoothly and strictly to schedule. All troops and military  hardware intended for the operation have been brought into the  region. Grachev estimated the Russian force at 2300 men.</p>

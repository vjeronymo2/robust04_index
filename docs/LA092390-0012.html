			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOT A CROSS WORD  </P> <P> Over the past five years, I've looked forward to the Puzzler.  </P> <P> My husband and I have fought over who gets to start first. We've fed our  children late dinners; paid Pacific Bell a fortune in exchanging clues, and  used our dictionaries, encyclopedias and atlases to the point of knowing now  why we forked over all that dough. I won't go into all the other details of  what we go through to complete your puzzles each week. We just wanted you to  know how much enjoyment the Puzzler gives us.  </P> <P> DENNIS AND PAULA SIMILA  </P> <P> Arroyo Grande  </P></p>

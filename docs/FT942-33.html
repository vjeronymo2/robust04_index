			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (3): Disclosure is the best policy - How greater candour can win public trust Four years ago, Bryan Sanderson, BP Chemicals chief executive, told his executives to earn the public's trust so that the company could keep its licence to operate. Similar messages have gone out in other parts of the chemical industry, with companies telling employees, neighbours, customers and other influential groups about the safety aspects of their operations. International chemical companies now routinely reveal their progress in improving environmental performances. Most publish annual environmental performance reports although no common format for the industry exists. Indeed, the glossy brochures and reports that have emerged so far have been of varying scope and detail. BP Chemicals publishes an annual report which details all its emissions from its leading sites in the US and Europe. ICI sens every shareholder and employee an annual corporate environment report, which contains total ICI emissions, although specific emissions are available on request, while each site is encouraged to local report for its neighbours. 'The site reports are very important indeed. They are  .. a fundamental part of the environmental communications programme,' says Dr Richard Robson. It can also help win support from some unexpected quarters. Friends of the Earth campaigner Guy Linley-Adams, commenting on ICI's Teesside report which revealed a 57 per cent cut in the site's emissions, told a local newspaper: 'All companies should produce reports like this. ICI is ahead of the game in that respect.' Others prefer to use indices developed by the French multinational Rhone-Poulenc and adopted by the UK Chemical Industries Association to demonstrate an aggregate UK industry performance. They are used to identify trends rather than detail actual volumes of waste emissions. Critics of this system claim that it can mask serious problems. Rhone-Poulenc, however, believes that they can give managers an efficient measure of how well environmental management is being carried out. In the base year, all emissions are considered by the nature of the hazard and method of disposal, then each year the environmental impact of waste in that year can be compared as a percentage of the base year. Ironically, despite the large sums spent by some companies on producing attractive reports, it is surprising how few bother to find out whether they are providing what the public wants. Last year, ICI asked readers what they thought of its corporate environmental report and then tailored the subsequent report according to their replies. 'The messages were clear: keep it simple, keep it short, make it easy to understand, put detailed data into appendices at the back, and don't make it too glossy,' Robson says. Listening to the audience is a key part of the communication process, says Claude Fussler, vice president for environment, health and safety at Dow Europe, adding that Responsible Care 'is first and foremost a performance-driven programme. it is not a public relations exercise. Our efforts to engage the public in dialogue are an attempt to gain an outside-in perspective of our company and its performance.' Dow has imported into Europe the Community Advisory Panel (CAP) concept from the US. These are volunteer advisory groups comprising citizens from communities neighbouring a facility. They tend to meet regularly to discuss plant operations, community involvement, emergency preparedness, environmental issues and other subjects related to the site. Dow Europe's first advisory panel was set up at its German site in Rheinmunster. Stade, also in Germany , has also followed suit forming a CAP last year, while its sites in Barry, South Wales, and Tessenderlo, Belgium, are members of joint public panels in their respective communities. CAPs can be useful allies, notes John Bishop, BP Chemicals general manager communications. 'A CAP at our Lima site in the US called on the US environmental protection agency to grant the company a licence to operate one particular process that was under investigation.' But even without CAPs, the company has been able to win support from the communities surrounding its sites. A survey commissioned by BP Chemicals and conducted by independent pollsters found that 74 per cent of the company's neighbours in Grangemouth regarded the company as trustworthy. This compares very well with surveys of the industry's public acceptability in the US and the UK. Despite these efforts chemical companies still have an image problem, although it seems to be improving, according to surveys canvassed recently by the US Chemical Manufacturers Association and Britain's Chemical Industries Association. A survey conducted by US pollster Roper Starch Worldwide late last year suggested that US public concern for the environment may have peaked and that enthusiasm for regulating business may be waning. The pollsters found that 44 per cent of those surveyed had a favourable view of the chemical industry - up 7 points from an all time low rating in 1992. A similar trend may be occurring in the UK. According to a survey by pollsters Mori on behalf of the Chemical Industries Association, more British people say they have a favourable impression of the chemical industry rather than an unfavourable one. Mori reports that the 29 per cent of those polled gave a favourable view of the chemical industry, eight points more than in 1992, while 28 per cent harboured an unfavourable attitude, 2 per cent increase on the previous year. In 1991, only 18 per cent viewed the British chemical industry favourably, while 27 per cent said they had an unfavourable impression. Although the industry might be pleased at the companies may be able (it was the first time since 1988 that favourable replies were in the majority) has its standing is well below 1979 when approvals reached received almost 50 per cent. The European chemical industry spends more than Pounds 2bn, or 12 per cent of its total capital expenditure , on the environment. British companies spend 16 per cent. However, many UK executives wonder what else they must do to win public approval. The leaders believe the answer lies in better communications, although, as the CIA advises its members, 'good communications can never compensate for a poor environmental or health and safety performance'. Industry executives believe that the better ratings are due to the industry's candour. However, some companies believe the industry's story would be more credible if it could be verified by independent third parties. But while the industry agrees on the need for Responsible Care, there are differences about eco-audits and verification. Dow Europe's Fussler and Norsk Hydro's public affairs director Stein Iver Aarsaether support third party verification of the environmental reports, but not at any cost. 'It is important to have credibility and consider how best to achieve that cost effectively,' says Aarsaether. Fussler says: 'Despite all the built-in controls, including supervision by the authorities, validation by a competent outside firm may provide an additional layer of confidence for the reader.' Louis Jourdan, senior director, technical affairs at Cefic, the European Chemical Industry Council, says that the European Commission is keen to go beyond the voluntary efforts of the industry. 'In the EU we will have third party verification either through voluntary acceptance of the Commission's eco-management and audit scheme or by certification of an environment management system standard.' Cefic is trying to encourage all its members to establish systems that will allow them to join the EU's environmental management and auditing scheme (EMAS). Many companies appear more amenable to have certification of the methods they use to conduct their own environmental audits than to having third parties repeating the process through an audit. Says one industry executive: 'Anyone who is responsible and providing the information would not knowingly provide data that are wrong.'</p>

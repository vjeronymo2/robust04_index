			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Further loss at Trustco ahead of takeover ROYAL Trustco, the Canadian financial services group controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, has recorded another large loss as it limps towards a takeover by Royal Bank of Canada. The first-quarter loss was CDollars 75m (USDollars 58.8m), or 57 cents a share, against earnings of CDollars 24m, or 6 cents, a year earlier. RT posted losses of CDollars 852m in 1992. Investment income dropped 30 per cent, to CDollars 474m. RT said falling deposits and the repayment of borrowings curtailed lending and investment activity. Margins were squeezed by higher non-performing loans, a smaller equity base and a lower yield on its securities portfolio. Loan loss provisions jumped to CDollars 61m from CDollars 21m. RT is negotiating the details of the CDollars 1.6bn sale of its operations to Royal Bank. Under the deal, RT will be left with a portfolio of mostly real-estate loans with a book value of CDollars 4.3bn and is likely to change its name. Its assets stood at CDollars 22.5bn on March 31. Royal Bank, Canada's biggest financial institution, will gain 146 branches in Canada, as well as 15 overseas units. Mr Allan Taylor, RBC's chairman, said recently the acquisition would enable the bank to 'expand quickly in four profitable high-growth markets where our own presence is relatively small'. The acquisition will raise the proportion of consumer deposits in RBC's total funding from 61 per cent to 68 per cent, against an average of 48 per cent for other Canadian banks. Brascan, a key Bronfman holding company, lifted first-quarter income to CDollars 136.7m, or CDollars 1.49, from CDollars 7.3m, or 2 cents, due to a CDollars 210m gain from the sale of its 47 per cent interest in John Labatt, the brewing and entertainment group. Improved operating results from London Life, an insurance group, were offset by RT's loss. Natural resource earnings were down due to the loss incurred by Noranda on the sale of its stake in MacMillan Bloedel, the forestry company.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Revolt unsettles Mexico market Mexico's stock market fell sharply yesterday morning as traders saw no sign of a rapid end to conflict in the southern state of Chiapas. The market was down nearly 6 per cent at noon, one of the largest morning falls on record. The Defence Ministry reported late on Sunday that the military base outside San Cristobal de las Casa had come under renewed attack, and that on Friday rebels belonging to the Zapatista Army of National Liberation had launched another offensive against the city of Ococingo. Notimex, the state-owned news agency, reported two explosions near a communications tower in Chiapas state on Sunday night, and three that damaged electricity towers in the state of Mexico. The explosions followed four bombs in Mexico City at the weekend. 'The market is worried that the conflict in Chiapas may drag on and that it may not be confined to that state,' said Mr Timothy Heyman, head of Baring Securities in Mexico City. 'The beginning of a dialogue (between government and rebels) would be construed as a very positive signal.' A senior government official said yesterday the administration was open to all possibilities of dialogue, and would probably make further conciliatory proposals soon. But he said the army would continue to seal off the area. 'We have to close the circle around them - we cannot permit the rebels to leave,' he said. Bishop Samuel Ruiz, the controversial bishop of San Cristobal, accepted a rebel offer to mediate in talks aimed at ending the uprising. But Ms Rigoberta Menchu, the Guatemalan Nobel peace prize winner, said she had rejected a rebel offer to mediate. The bishop, long critical of government policy in Chiapas, said the rebellion was an 'historic opportunity' to end centuries of oppression of indigenous peoples. The Interior Ministry has linked 'religious peoples' with the uprising, a charge that has infuriated many in the Catholic Church. The International Commission of Jurists yesterday condemned methods used in the Chiapas revolt, saying they were 'contrary to national and international law', Reuter reports from Geneva. The commission, which groups 45 international jurists, urged an end to the 'fratricidal strife' between the Mexican army and indigenous people in the state. It also condemned violence by the rebels.</p>

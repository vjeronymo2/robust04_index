			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Sirti chief arrested in Italian investigations THE impact of Italy's political corruption scandal widened sharply at the weekend with the arrest of Mr Luigi Montella, managing director of the state-controlled Sirti telecommunications group. The arrest followed allegations by Mr Davide Giacalone, a former civil servant in the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, whose testimony triggered a wave of arrests of senior private-sector telecommunications executives last week. The latest allegations focus on the small Republican party, which has managed to remain relatively untainted by the corruption scandals so far. The new testimony, widely leaked, alleges the Republicans used their limited ministerial representation in the former Andreotti government as an important source of funds Mr Giacalone's testimony alleges L9bn (Pounds 3.8m) in kickbacks was paid between 1987 and 1990 by various telecommunications companies to Mr Oscar Mammi, a senior Republican politician and former post minister. Mr Giacalone, arrested this month, was an adviser to Mr Mammi. Mr Montella's arrest marks the first involvement of the huge public-sector Stet telecommunications group in the corruption inquiries. Sirti is the network engineering subsidiary of Stet, the holding company for all Italy's state-owned telecoms activities. Mr Montella is accused of corruption relating to a contract from ASST, the former telecommunications agency controlled directly by the Post Ministry. The new allegations have led to both Mr Mammi and Mr Giorgio La Malfa, the former Republican leader, being told by magistrates they could face prosecution for accepting illicit funds and for illegal party financing. Mr La Malfa has already been told he is under investigation over separate, less serious, allegations of receiving illegal political contributions. According to Mr La Malfa,the sums received from Mr Giacalone were far smaller, and always presented as voluntary contributions to the party, which are not outlawed. In separate inquiries, Mr Franco Castiglione, a Socialist senator, was told by magistrates he could face prosecution over alleged kickbacks on contracts for Olivetti computers for the Justice Ministry. Mr Castiglione was a junior minister in charge of improving the use of information technology for magistrates in 1990-1991. Naples magistrates investigating links between local magistrates, lawyers and organised crime have also extended their inquiries to include Mr Alfredo Bargi, a Christian Democrat senator and well-known local lawyer. The Naples inquiries have so far resulted in 11 magistrates being placed under investigation. Socialist party leaders are due to meet tomorrow to elect a successor to Mr Giorgio Benvenuto, the party leader who resigned last week after complaining of insufficient support from many MPs. The committee may elect Mr Ottaviano Del Turco, the former deputy head of the CGIL trade union federation, as a compromise leader. The party, which has been severely implicated in the corruption scandal, risks breaking apart because of divisions between those, such as Mr Benvenuto, who want to distance it from Mr Bettino Craxi, its former leaders, and less reformist MPs loyal to Mr Craxi.</p>

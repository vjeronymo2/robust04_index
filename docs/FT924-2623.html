			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Lonrho - Rowland's Exit: African relationship turns rocky 'TINY'S in town]' For three decades the cry has gone up in towns and cities across Africa, from Cape to Cairo, from the lips of politicians, businessmen or journalists. If the pantheon of Africa's post-independence leaders allowed honorary membership, Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's 75-year-old chief executive, could take his place for granted. Ready to nominate him would be Dr Hastings Banda of Malawi, Kenneth Kaunda, Zambia's president until his election defeat last year, the late Samora Machel of Mozambique and his successor, Joaquim Chissano, Uganda's Milton Obote and Sudan's Jaafar Nimeiri, both in exile, Joshua Nkomo, Zimbabwe's deputy president, and Daniel arap Moi, the Kenyan president. Yet all the leaders are dead, or dying; exiled or exiting. Age has taken its toll; but so has democracy, with autocratic leaders buckling under domestic and international pressure and succumbing to demands for multi-party elections. It was with these men that Mr Rowland has worked closely; many observers claim he does not have the same links with the new generation of African leaders. And Africa is changing in another respect. Structural adjustment under the scrutiny of the IMF and World Bank is creating fewer opportunities to exercise presidential power. High hopes that marked the emergence of independent African states in the 1960s were dashed in the 1970s. Today those hopes are at their nadir. All these changes have taken a toll of Lonrho's assets, however efficiently managed. Post-Rowland, Lonrho as a company and Mr Dieter Bock, as its new driving force, will find business in Africa harder and potentially less profitable. Lonrho has become increasingly dependent on profits from Africa. They accounted for Pounds 150m out of group pre-tax profits of Pounds 207m for the year ended September 1991. Activities include, in South Africa, platinum, gold, coal and asbestos mining; motor dealerships, and sugar investments. Further north Lonrho has a wide spread of mining, agricultural and commercial assets spread across at least 16 countries. Prominent is the Ashanti gold mine in Ghana, but the list extends to tea, beer, pharmaceuticals, sugar, farming, textiles, soft drinks, timber, paint and hotels. Yet questions hang over many of Lonrho's businesses: Kenya's economic difficulties and political uncertainties put question marks against Lonrho's hotel and motor vehicle interests. Plantations in Mozambique depend on successful implementation of the UN supervised peace plan. In Zambia, Lonrho companies are dependent on the success of a fragile economic adjustment programme, as in Zimbabwe, where Lonrho has substantial interests. The future of investments in Malawi is heavily dependent on what happens after Dr Banda, now in his mid-90s, passes on. Lonrho's companies in Nigeria are hit by the economic crisis and uncertainty about the handover to civilian rule. Weak currencies, political risk, and hold-ups in remittance of profits and dividends make many holdings worth less than their book value. In event of sale, it would be difficult to repatriate the proceeds.</p>

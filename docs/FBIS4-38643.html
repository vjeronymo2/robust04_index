			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 31 May -- The fact that, in accordance with  a decree issued on Monday [30 May] by the Russian president, a  number of populated areas in Malgobekskiy and Sunzhenskiy Rayons  of Ingushetia have been included in the state of emergency is  not regarded by official Groznyy as a direct threat to the  national security of Chechnya. Movladi Udugov, head of the  Chechen Department of Information and Press, told this to an  ITAR-TASS correspondent today in a telephone interview.    He noted that the preliminary analysis of the new decree "on  the introduction of a state of emergency in parts of the  territory of the Republic of North Ossetia and the Republic of  Ingushetia" has not led to any undue concern on the part of the  Chechen leadership. Movladi Udugov said that the villages in  Sunzhenskiy and Malgobekskiy Rayons, which have been included in  the state of emergency zone, are not under dispute. They were  Ingush before the administrative and territorial division of  1934, when the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was set up.    At the same time, Movladi Udugov said, official Groznyy  considers it unjustified to extend the state of emergency zone  on the territory of Ingushetia. In his view, "Boris Yeltsin is  artificially pushing the expansion of the emergency zone in  order to create tension with Chechnya."    Movladi Udugov believes that because Ingushetia is a part of  Russia, whereas Chechnya regards itself to be outside Russia, in  principle the Chechen-Ingush border should be defined. Ruslan  Aushev and Dzhokhar Dudayev have therefore signed an appropriate  treaty on the principles of defining borders. The borders  established before 1934 were taken as the basis for this.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: UniChem pharmacists put Pounds 12.5m into rights THE 4,000 pharmacists who hold shares in UniChem, the pharmaceuticals wholesaler that supplies them, put about Pounds 12.5m - an average of more than Pounds 3,000 each - into the group's Pounds 35.1m rights issue. Overall, the 1-for-4 issue was 86.3 per cent taken up, with the pharmacists participating to a greater degree than expected. UniChem said their combined interest would come down from 60 per cent, but remain at more than 50 per cent. The outstanding shares have been subscribed for at a premium to the 148p issue price. The share price gained 10p to close at 182p yesterday. UniChem said it had about Pounds 25m cash in the bank after the issue and after the Pounds 27m acquisition, for shares and cash, of E Moss, which has 92 retail outlets mainly in the south-east of England. The group's intention to expand its retail activities had already been flagged by its bid for Macarthy, which was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission - a decision is expected within the next few weeks. UniChem also has plans to expand its wholesaling business in continental Europe. The rights issue was accompanied by a pre-tax profits forecast of Pounds 21m for 1991, compared with Pounds 16.4m.</p>

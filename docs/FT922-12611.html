			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading STRONG demand continued in the derivatives market, sending stock index futures sharply forward and turnover in the traded options market higher, writes Joel Kibazo. Trading in the June contract on the FT-SE followed the recent pattern of low demand at the open and June had retreated by 10 points to 2657 by 9.30am, which proved to be the low of the day. A spate of large buying orders from leading institutions reversed June's falls sending it forward as a squeeze developed after dealers rushed to fill the orders. Independent traders dominated dealing during the afternoon session though demand remained high. June closed at 2684, 41 ahead on the previous session and around 25 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 22. Turnover in traded options remained high at 41,545 matching Tuesday's total, ahead of next week's expiry date. The FT-SE option was again busy, trading 13,365 contracts, while the Euro FT-SE recorded a day's turnover of 6,789 lots. Thames Water remained the busiest stock option. It traded 2,545 lots. This was followed by Hanson in which 2,511 lots were and then by Boots with 1,352 contracts.</p>

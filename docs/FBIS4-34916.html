			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 26 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Jorge Carpizo  decided to stay on as interior secretary after resigning on 24  June. Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari did not accept  the resignation.    Carpizo, in a letter addressed to the president, said after  receiving the support of broad segments of the community "and to  prevent anyone from saying I acted irresponsibly and  unpatriotically, I will remain in the post of interior  secretary."    Carpizo's announcement averts a government crisis that many  political analysts believe would have had serious consequences,  if the resignation had occurred, on the political process Mexico  is experiencing as it heads toward the 21 August presidential  election,</p>

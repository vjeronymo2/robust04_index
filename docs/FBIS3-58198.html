It was the  Duke of Wellington, the victor at Waterloo, who said this after  the coalition's triumph over Napoleon.    For four years the North Atlantic alliance has been in such  a  misery of triumph. In 1990, after 40 years of Cold War, it won  a victory when Soviet Communism and the imperialist system based  on it collapsed. Since then NATO has had an embarrassing  problem. Suddenly, it lost the enemy, the frontline, and the  military assignment. It has almost reached the goal that its  first secretary general, Lord Ismay, set for it: making itself  superfluous. Since then it has been looking for a new  self-understanding, a new reason for existence.    First NATO wanted to organize the transition of the East  European national economies from plan to market -- a stupid  idea, because it lacked everything for that: technical  knowledge, the apparatus, and money. Then it tried to act as  some sort of constantly ready subcontractor of the United  Nations or the CSCE, which carries out peacekeeping or  peacemaking missions upon order and provides the infrastructure  for them -- however, after the depressing experience in the  former Yugoslavia, the NATO governments are restrained. Since  spring 1993 the Western alliance has wanted to "project security  to East Europe" -- however, how this is supposed to be done is  heatedly disputed in the circle of the 16 members.    Full membership of at least the so-called Visegrad states,  which are impetuously urging for it: Poland, the Czech  Republic, the Slovak Republic, Hungary? Possibly also accession  by Slovenia, Albania, Romania, and the Baltic Republics, which  would also like to find support in NATO? In addition, the  inclusion of Belarus, Ukraine -- even Russia, as is suggested by  former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker? Or a vague  associated membership? Or not even that but just an even  vaguer, noncommittal "Partnership for Peace"?    This spring FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe strongly  supported speedy accession by the four Visegrad states. He  wanted to see himself in the role of the "door opener." His  justification: "If we do not export stability, we will import  instability." The allies, however, have meanwhile strongly  braked the defense minister's zeal.    They have done well. There are five reasons that indeed  speak for prudence and caution.    First: The success of NATO had little to do with the text of  the treaty. The decisive Article 5, according to which any  attack on one alliance partner is to be considered as an attack  on all partners, does not entail any specific commitments. The  alliance members can decide freely which measures they consider  "necessary." The range of possibilities reaches from a letter of  condolences to a nuclear strike. Only the military organization  of NATO guaranteed an immediate, automatic reaction: the common  supreme command, a logistical system that was able to bring  supplies from the Atlantic to the battlefield; common strategic  planning; common planning and financing of the infrastructure  (sea ports, airports, telecommunications links, reconnaissance  systems); above all, however, the deployment of troops from many  member states at the eastern border of the alliance -- which  meant at some time 7,000 mostly American nuclear weapons on West  German soil. France has kept away from this military  organization since 1966, Spain has never joined it -- but both  could afford this since their protective front -- the FRG -- was  defended. Does the West really want to shift the old military  border by 600 km to the east?    Second: Which NATO do the East Europeans actually want to  join -- the paper NATO, like France or Spain? Or the military  organization of NATO -- with all common points of command,  planning, and, above all, multinational troops on Polish, Czech,  Slovak, and Hungarian territory -- including U.S. nuclear  weapons? If they really feel threatened, they would have to  desire all that. At the International Bertelsmann Forum at  Petersberg recently, the Polish prime minister, the Czech prime  minister, the Hungarian foreign minister, and the Slovak deputy  foreign minister evaded the answer to this question. Are they  satisfied with a noncommittal status, like France and Spain, to  dispel their fears? Then perhaps one need not take these fears  all too seriously.    Third: NATO made a mistake -- which can be explained only  geopolitically -- when it took in the hostile neighbors Greece  and Turkey in 1952. More than once the two have been close to  war; they have often sabotaged the higher purpose of the  alliance when they tackled each other. Should the alliance now  acquire a new belt of members, which are either hostile to each  other (Hungary/Romania) or quarrel about their territory  (Poland/Lithuania, Poland/Ukraine) or are threatened by internal  ethnic conflicts (almost all states between the Baltic Sea and  the Carpatian Mountains)? No: Before a discussion about  accession is meaningful at all, minority rights should be  guaranteed everywhere and borders should be declared inviolable.    Fourth: The West should beware of creating problems for  the Russian reformers (and possibly destroying them), by  shifting the NATO border close to the Russian border without any  visible necessity. Russia must not be isolated, as long as it  does not isolate itself through reemerging aggressiveness. It  must not be isolated as long as it relies on cooperation with  the West. The West must not pretend that Russia's relapse into  profound hostility is unavoidable. However, we may say out  loud: If Zhirinovskiy came to power or if Yeltsin and Kozyrev  used the need of the 25 million Russians in the "near abroad"  for protection as an excuse for an aggressive policy toward the  Baltic states and the former Warsaw Pact states -- then NATO  would not hesitate to expand toward the east. For this reason,  the alliance must also preserve what military experts call the  "regrowth capability": the capability to once again, if need  be, tailor the shrinking armed forces of the Western alliance to  a rising threat. Only then, if this threat has been abolished,  will NATO really be superfluous.    Fifth: Currently, the Western alliance is in a deep identity  crisis. Its foundations -- those of the old relations between  the United States and Europe -- are swaying, a new relationship  between the partners on both sides of the Atlantic must still be  developed. Its overall strategy requires an overall revision.  Fewer men, less material -- this characterizes the current  situation. Forty percent of the soldiers and 50 percent of the  arms arsenal of 1990 will have been abolished next year. So far  there is no consensus on the future role of the alliance. Who  would want to add to the structure before the foundations have  been newly cast?    Certainly, NATO is more than a military alliance. However,  the military alliance is its core: the protective community  based on mutuality. NATO is not a cultural association and,  therefore, it should not be used metaphorically to declare  cultural ties. It must be able to fulfill the guarantees that  it gives -- and those that benefit from them must, in return, be  ready and willing to support the others in the protective and  offensive alliance. Anything else would be not serious,  unworthy, not credible.    Partnership for peace? The concept has a lot that speaks for  it. Cooperation between NATO and East Europe common staff  planning, multinational preparation for peacekeeping and  peacemaking; help in democratizing the Eastern armies;  incentives to disclose the defense budgets; in addition, the  future prospect of full membership in NATO, as soon as  conditions are right -- if such considerations do not pass into  the realm of limbo anyway. The concept of the partnership for  peace gives everyone time to think, time to adapt, time to gain  experience.    However, nowadays security no longer means just military  security. In particular in East Europe security depends less on  military precautions but rather on functioning market economies  and intact democratic institutions. Membership in NATO is less  important than access to the Western markets and organizations,  such as the European Union. If this access is denied, the  expansion of the Western alliance to the east could do little to  let those things grow together in Europe that belong together.    Let us take heed of the Duke of Wellington's insight about  the suffering caused by won battles. But let us not be  frightened by the manic fear that he revealed in a letter to THE  TIMES 32 years after Waterloo: It is necessary to strengthen  defense measures against a French invasion of England. Politics  must never be guided by chimeras, the nightmares of aging  generals or excited politicians.</p>

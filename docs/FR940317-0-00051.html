The underwriter has a duty to review the issuer's disclosure documents before offering, selling or bidding for the securities and to have a reasonable basis for its belief as to the accuracy and completeness of the representations in the documents. Municipal dealers must have a reasonable basis for recommending the purchase of securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a companion release, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  the Commission is proposing for comment two related rule amendments, the first proposing to prohibit a broker, dealer or municipal securities dealer from underwriting a municipal issue unless the issuer makes a commitment to provide annual and event-related secondary market information to a designated repository; and the second proposing to prohibit a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer from recommending purchases of such issues in the secondary market if it does not review such information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Exchange Act Release No. 33742 (March 9, 1994) (``Companion Release'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Markets: Tokyo market rebounds - At a glance The Tokyo stock market rebounded at the beginning of this week on news that the parliament had passed the coalition government's political reform package. This opens the way for further economic stimulus measures. However, the Nikkei index is still at about half its peak level. Fidelity is launching its second UK investment trust, Fidelity Japanese Values, to specialise in Japanese smaller companies. Simon Fraser, manager of the trust, says smaller companies should benefit from the economic recovery, and deregulation and other structural changes in the Japanese economy could also provide them with new opportunities. The public offer period runs from February 22 to March 8. There will be one free warrant attached to every five shares.</p>

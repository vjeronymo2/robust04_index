			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Ethiopian central bank raises rates ETHIOPIA'S central bank yesterday raised interest rates as part of a bold package of economic reforms, Reuter reports from Addis Ababa. Ethiopia hopes the reforms will encourage foreign donors to fund a rehabilitation programme. The official Ethiopian news agency announced that rates for personal and business loans had been raised from 9 per cent to between 11 and 15 per cent. Interest rates on savings were increased from 6 per cent to 12 per cent. The move caused jitters amongst businessmen and appears to have immediately undermined foreign currency rates on the black market, economic analysts said. The government also raised wages of government workers by up to 110 per cent, for the first time since Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown in the 1974 Marxist revolution.</p>

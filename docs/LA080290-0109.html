			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRINGLE CHALLENGER URGES DEBATES  </P> <P> Democratic Assembly candidate Tom Umberg on Wednesday challenged his Republican  opponent, Curt Pringle, to a series of seven one-on-one debates, declaring, "We  owe it to the voters."  </P> <P> Pringle (R-Garden Grove) said he expected to debate Umberg, but only in forums  sponsored by independent organizations such as the League of Women Voters.  </P> <P> "The time has come for Curtis and me to meet face-to-face in a series of  debates throughout Orange County and the 72nd Assembly District," Umberg said  in a statement.  </P> <P> Umberg suggested that the candidates be free to question each other. Umberg  campaign manager George Urch said seven debates were proposed, one every two  weeks until the Nov. 6 election.  </P> <P> Pringle said that he debated his Democratic opponent in 1988 about three times  and that he expected a similar schedule in this race.  </P> <P> "Usually, challengers like to grandstand on debates and therefore I expected  this type of letter," Pringle said. "What he needs to know is that in this  community they have always had debate formats and he will soon get an  invitation from some of the established organizations.  </P> <P> "I have never turned down one of those debates and I don't intend to this  time," he said.  </P></p>

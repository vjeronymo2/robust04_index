			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From 18 May PAEVALEHT, EESTI SENUMID, POSTIMEES, RAHVA </F> HAAL, pp 1-3: "News Bulletin" No. 95/94]    [Text] The predicted vote of no confidence to Prime  Minister Mart Laar was canceled as the National Independence  Party (ERSP) demanded that its ministers did not require the  linking of the vote on state guarantees to a foreign loan to a  vote of no confidence.    Laar told the news conference that he had asked the cabinet  members about the vote, but nobody had wanted to raise the  issue. Laar did admit that "some politicians" have a desire to  reorganise the government, but he described it as a demolition,  rather than rearrangement of the cabinet. "I would not dare to  term it a press speculation, since the matter was too serious,"  Laar told the conference. He called for the dissatisfied  "Fatherland"-appointed ministers to discuss their objections  with the ruling coalition factions.    The "Fatherland" faction made a statement yesterday  declaring  that any attempts to force the premier to resign would cause  great political harm to Estonia in the present situation.    A cabinet session will be held today, according to Social  Minister Marju Lauristin. She declined from elaborating on the  agenda of the session.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Armando Calderon Sol in San </F> Salvador via satellite by announcer Jacobo Zabludovsky at the  XEW Television studios in Mexico City; from the "24 Hours"  newscast -- live]    [Text] [Zabludovsky] Thank you, Mr. President, for agreeing  to this interview. As you complete your third week in office,  what do you think the main challenge for your government will be?    [Calderon Sol] The main challenge I face is national  reconstruction -- the reconstruction of the country. After  overcoming the violence and destruction of the war, we must now  move into the phase of rebuilding the nation.    This does not only include the material reconstruction  effort, but also the moral and spiritual reconstruction. We  must affirm the state of law, guarantee justice, and ensure the  authority of the law. We must seek mutual respect among all  people. We have just been through 12 long years of  institutionalized violence in this country, and therefore our  efforts must be directed at changing the people's ideas,  conceptions, and attitudes toward effective law enforcement.  This is an enormous task, but we are sure we will be successful  in rebuilding El Salvador, both physically and morally.    [Zabludovsky] You promised to fulfill the peace agreements  to  the letter. Now that there is a new timetable, how do you  expect to deal with the situation?    [Calderon Sol] President Cristiani wanted to clear his desk,  as he put it, before he left office, and therefore he  rescheduled the agreements in order to have specific dates for  what was still pending. The new timetable is very specific, and  I will comply with it to the letter.    It is my political determination to complete the peace  process. The peace agreements are truly a national commitment,  and I am willing to meet that commitment faithfully. The  rescheduling will make it easier to comply within the new  deadlines. We have said time and time again that we will  fulfill the peace agreements, because they ensure the social  peace and political stability that we long for in El Salvador.    [Zabludovsky] The civil war caused thousands of deaths and  brought destruction and bitterness. What do you think needs to  be done in El Salvador to prevent another civil war?    [Calderon Sol] Our civil war had so very much to do with the  international situation. Our war became an international  affair. Please remember that El Salvador, as was true for the  rest of Central America, lived the end of the Cold War and the  East-West struggle. Remember that El Salvador became a bastion  of Cuban aggression in Central America. This is a tangible,  clear, and undeniable fact demonstrated by the shipments of  weapons -- thousands of tons of them -- that flowed into Central  America during the bipolar Cold War. Thank goodness all this is  over now.    This, of course, does not mean there were no other problems.  There are problems even now, and there will always be problems,  such as poverty, for example. Poverty is worse now than in the  past, because the war brought more poverty with it. Today's  challenge is to rebuild, produce, and develop the nation while  promoting human advancement. That is what lies ahead. Now that  the war is behind us and the pain is gone, let us make El  Salvador that country we all dream and hope for.    [Zabludovsky] Would you like to add anything more, Mr.  President?    [Calderon Sol] Mr. Zabludovsky, it is a real pleasure to  chat  with you, especially knowing that thousands of Salvadorans are  watching your program, and not only in Mexico -- that wonderful  country of yours -- but also in the United States, Canada, and  so many other countries in which this prestigious program is  broadcast. It is truly a pleasure to address the thousands of  Salvadorans who live abroad and work day and night to provide  for their families and send a little something home to build a  better future for El Salvador. Soon all of these families will  be reunited.    Let me say this to the thousands Salvadorans living away  from  the fatherland: We are working to allow you to come home to a  new El Salvador. Let me also say that you have a government and  a president who think about you all of the time, hoping for the  reunification of the Salvadoran family.</p>

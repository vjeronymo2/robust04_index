			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Shares slide as Fine Art sees 'difficult' trading Shares in Fine Art Developments tumbled 44p to 376p yesterday as the mail order and greetings card group reported disappointing profits for its first half and warned that trading conditions remained 'extremely difficult'. In the six months to September 30, profits rose 5 per cent to Pounds 5.78m (Pounds 5.51m) pre-tax on turnover ahead 6 per cent at Pounds 122.3m (Pounds 115.4m). Mr Keith Chapman, chairman, singled out the charities and wholesale businesses as the weakest performers. However, he stressed that in the past strong parts of the group had more than counterbalanced 'the odd problem here and there'. This time, trading conditions and the downturn in consumer spending meant there had been no 'good performers' to offset the laggards. On the charities side, turnover fell 23 per cent. Rwandan appeals, the public's move towards local rather than national charities, and the cataloguing, products and pricing policies of Fine Art's charities had all had an impact. The wholesale side of the card and paper products division had been hit by the change in Sunday trading laws, which were squeezing independent shops. Mr Chapman expected it would be 'some time before we get back to where we were'. However, last year's management and systems problems which had affected deliveries in the direct-to-retail side - supplying supermarkets and large chains - had been sorted out. On the plus side, in Express Gifts the group has reduced the cost/sale ratio, cut the agency base, improved the conversion to customers rate, and introduced structured credit. The mail-order educational business performed well, lifting turnover 10 per cent. Mr Chapman stressed that this rise was achieved at a time when many schools were not fully using their budgets. The interim dividend is raised to 3.5p (3.3p) payable from earnings of 4.97p (4.87p) per share. COMMENT Is Fine Art accident-prone or simply buffeted by forces beyond its control? Some say a raft of influences - Sunday trading laws, changes in the pattern of the public's charity giving, the National Lottery - have compounded an already depressed trading environment. Problems lurking round the corner include raw material price rises and consumer resistance to more expensive cards and paper products. However, from a lower base things are expected to improve, or at least not get worse. Forecast pre-tax profits for the current year have been scaled back from Pounds 42m to Pounds 39m, or earnings of about 32p, for a multiple of about 11.7. At the current price that is a decent discount to the market, but the shares will not be going anywhere for a while.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brcko, May 22 (TANJUG) -- Positions of Bosnian Serbs  in northern Bosnia were attacked on Sunday [22 May] by Bosnian  Croats and Moslems, the Bosnian Serb army (VRS) sources  reported. The forces of Bosnian Croats from the area of the  Croat enclave of Orasje in the Sava valley northwest of Brcko  opened fire from mortars and infantry weaponry. The Croat  attack caused no effects on the Serb side and the Serb units did  not respond.    The forces of Bosnian Serbs also did not respond to fire  opened towards them on Sunday by Moslem troops in a location 8  km southwest of the Serb town of Brcko in the Sava valley. A  narrow strip of Serb territory in northern Bosnia which links  the eastern and western parts of the Bosnian Serb republic  (R.S.) is only a few kilometers wide near Brcko.    The Moslems have been for weeks amassing their troops to the  south, and the Bosnian Croats to the north of the corridor in an  attempt to cut it. The Republic of Croatia has also been  concentrating its troops on the northern side of the corridor,  on the Croatian bank of the Sava. Both Moslems and Croats have  for days continued with offensive actions against the Serb  positions and settlements in spite of the presence of U.N.  observers. Brcko was shelled in such an action on Saturday  evening, when 5 civilians were wounded, including a one-year-old  girl.    While Sunday was completely calm in Sarajevo, at the far  west  of Bosnia, in the Cazin Krajina region, inter-Moslem clashes  between the followers of the radical Moslem authorities in  Sarajevo and those of Fikret Abdic do not stop. Abdic advocates  peace with the Serb and Croats. The Moslem Radio Sarajevo said  that Abdic's followers, who proclaimed the autonomous province  of western Bosnia, from early morning were opening fire from  infantry and artillery weapons along all lines on the positions  of the forces loyal to Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic.</p>

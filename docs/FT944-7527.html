			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Arts: St Cecilia's Day celebrated Three centuries ago the Stationers' Hall, around the corner from St. Paul's in Ave Maria Lane, used to promote celebrations of St. Cecilia's Day - November 22 - with music and banqueting. A stained glass window in their fine 17th-century hall depicts that patron saint of music. A few years back some stationer, or anyhow some member of The Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers, must have remembered the old custom. Since 1992 there have been St. Cecilia-Tide concerts again, with banquets; next year there will be a five-day mini-festival (sponsored by the FT, as it happens). These days, the obvious thing to put into a 17th-century hall is a period-instrument band. The Stationers' Hall has the Fiori Musicali, a baroque ensemble (with chorus) founded by their conductor Penelope Rapson. On Tuesday they gave thoroughly attractive performances of Purcell's Funeral Music for Queen Mary, and Bach's Magnificat in D and his A minor concerto for violin. The soloist in the latter was their leader Peter Fender: properly a primus inter pares, not a commanding voice (baroque violin-technique hardly permits of domineering brilliance), but notably subtle in his florid Andante excursions. In the great Funeral Music the preludial and concluding marches and canzonas went to sackbuts and 'flatt trumpets', with processing mourning-drums, to imposing effect, and the chorus enunciated the 'Funeral Sentences' - early Purcell anthems, in fact: nobody knows whether they were part of the original package - with lucid eloquence. Later, we admired Dr Rapson's unhesitating dispatch in the Bach Magnificat. It emphasised the continuity of the Marian text through the dozen different numbers, while giving full value to their differences in weight, colour and address (public v. private). Her tempi were generally quick, vital and nicely braced; her solo singers rose confidently to all their occasions. Kate Eckersley was a poised, intelligent soprano, but the stand-out number was the 'Et misericordia' duet for counter-tenor and tenor (Nicholas Clapton and Nicholas Hurndall Smith). Together, their contrasted timbres - the one reedy, cultured and elevated, the other warm and slightly baritonal - made a magical amalgam, strange but quite beautiful.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Third, we have found that some hospitals that employ  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physicians are not appropriately eliminating Part B  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physician salaries from the total salaries reported for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wage index as required in the cost reporting instructions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, we are proposing that hospitals exclude all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physicians' salaries (both Part A and Part B related) from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wage data reported on the Medicare cost report. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, we are proposing that the salaries for teaching  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physicians also be excluded, since payment for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services does not fall under the prospective payment system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Regarding Part A CRNA (certified registered nurse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anesthetist) costs, we propose to require hospitals to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclude these salaries from the wage data reported on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost report. These Part A services are currently paid on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``pass-through'' basis, outside the prospective payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system. Therefore, we believe it is appropriate to exclude  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these costs from the wage index. Moreover, this Part A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pass-through provision is applicable to a limited number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals (small rural hospitals). All other hospitals are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paid for CRNA services under Part B of the Medicare program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in order to ensure consistency across areas, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that no CRNA costs should be reflected in the wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> index computation. CRNA services are generally excluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the wage index as Part B services. Since the Part A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion was granted as a pass through for certain rural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals, it is currently included in wage index.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We note that these changes are effective for cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1994 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not affect the current reporting of physicians and CRNA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 2. Management Contracts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The second major proposed change concerns the inclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of certain management contracts in the hospital wage index  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data. Before FY 1994, the wage index did not include any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs associated with contract services. However, many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals indicated that they were inappropriately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disadvantaged because they were forced to contract out for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nurses and technicians due to shortages of these services in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their areas. To alleviate this problem, we revised the cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report to collect the data associated with any direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient care service contract (that is, nursing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therapeutic, etc.). We specifically excluded any Part B  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services, Part A physician services, management contracts,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or any contract for services not directly involved with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The hospital industry has expressed concern that we do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not currently recognize the cost of certain contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management services. In particular, many rural hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are either unable to recruit or cannot afford top  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> managers such as hospital administrators must contract for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the services of these individuals. Therefore, we believe it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is appropriate to include the costs of certain management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts in the wage index. We propose to expand the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of contract services reported on the Worksheet <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> S&hyph;3 to include the personnel cost associated with contracts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for any personnel hired in the top four positions within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital. Allowable contract management services would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to the personnel costs for those individuals who are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> working at the hospital facility in the capacity of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chief Executive Officer (CEO)/Hospital Administrator, Chief  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operating Officer (COO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nursing Administrator. The exact titles assigned to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals may vary but the individuals should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performing essentially the same duties as customarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assigned these management positions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The hospitals (via HCFA&hyph;339 form) would be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide the fiscal intermediary with complete details on all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct patient care related contracts and the description  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and aggregate totals for all management contracts. Because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the difficulty in accurately determining hours and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> isolating wage related costs for the other types of contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services, the wage data would continue to exclude all other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-patient care contract services except those limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management contracts discussed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the current cost report does not provide for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection of management contract data, this revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition would not be effective until cost reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periods beginning on or after October 1, 1994. To provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent reporting of data, hospitals must continue to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclude all management contracts until the FY 1995 data is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 3. Reporting of Wage-Related Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Since we began including fringe benefits in the wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> index, we have been concerned with the inconsistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting of fringe benefits, whether because of a lack of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider proficiency in identifying fringe benefit costs or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> varying interpretations across fiscal intermediaries of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition for fringe benefits in PRM&hyph;I, &sect;2144.1. Although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we have attempted to promote consistent reporting of fringe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits by providing fiscal intermediaries with general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidelines to be used in determining allowable fringe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefit costs, the intermediaries must necessarily make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> judgments as to whether certain costs qualify as a fringe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefit, and inconsistencies persist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Last summer, HCFA conducted a survey to determine what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs the health care industry thought should be recognized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as fringe benefit costs. The survey consisted of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> questionnaire with a yes/no response column and a column for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments. We received 238 responses from hospitals, fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediaries, state hospital associations, national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital associations, state agencies, and bureaus and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offices within HCFA. The results of those surveys were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examined closely by the MTAG task force.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the recommendations of the task force, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing several changes that we believe will promote more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equitable and consistent reporting of wage-related costs for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all hospitals. Where the term ``fringe benefit'' has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in the past, we will now refer to these costs as ``wage-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related costs'' for wage index purposes. We believe that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this change in terminology will eliminate the confusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding those wage-related costs that we will allow to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated in the wage index versus the definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fringe benefits required by Medicare principles for cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimbursement purposes. Accordingly, we are proposing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revise the Worksheet S&hyph;3, Part II to capture wage-related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs in three parts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

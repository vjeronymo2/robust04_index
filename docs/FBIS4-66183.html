			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Xiao Ye Da Wa (1420 6851 6671 1216): "Servicemen </F> Who Ended Up in Court -- Servicemen Crimes Committed During the  Economic Upsurge"]    [Text] The armed forces are an armed group that carries out  special political missions. The General Political Department  requires that every PLA officer and enlisted man be politically  qualified, militarily superb, have a fine work style, provide  vigorous support, and be strong in battle. From the first day  that a serviceman puts on a military uniform, he is subject to  strict military training and receives proper instruction in  political ideology, the law, and discipline. For many years,  servicemen have been the pride of the age and models in  upholding the law.    Faced with the onslaught of the upsurge in the commodity  economy, and faced with the technicolor world in the wake of  deregulation, servicemen have been put to all sorts of tests.  Military camps are like small boats beset from all sides in  resisting the various enticements of this deregulated world.  Since the income of those in military camps is rather meager,  since the environment is pretty much closed, and since some  servicemen exceed their means, pursue a life of luxury, have a  poor sense of marriage ethics, and conceal firearms and  ammunition, serviceman crimes sometimes occur.    According to expert study, serviceman crimes have certain  inherent characteristics that merit deep thought on the part of  servicemen and troop unit grassroots cadres. How is it that  servicemen who have received military unit indoctrination and  training for many years take a road of crime? What enlightenment  can we gain from their actions? The writer visited one  military camp and one family after another in a quest for the  answer. Because of security considerations and the request of  military units themselves, the writer has concealed servicemen's  true names and units.    A. Upon entering the military camp everybody performs his  duty and contribute his youth. Poverty becomes a demon that  lands servicemen in court.    Seeing the wonderful opportunities that deregulation  presented, he forgot the uniform he was wearing and his not so  superb swimming ability. Throwing caution to the winds, he dived  in. He drowned, of course.    Back then when he hoodwinked everybody and served as plant  manager with pride and elation, I interviewed "A." Today, when  he is in jail, I have made him the living subject of an article.    "A" was a 26-year old career noncommissioned officer. Like  other charming entrepreneurs, "A" exploited his youth and his  vigor. When he saw that a regiment-operated enterprise -- a beer  bottle factory -- was verging on bankruptcy, he volunteered to  sit with dignity in the armchair of the plant manager. "A"  signed a contract with the regiment requiring that he turn over  20,000 yuan to the regiment each year.    From then on, "A" pulled out all stops, working feverishly  with the workers in the plant from morning till night. To his  surprise, the beer bottle plant did not work out as he had  expected. Despite their sweat, because of competition from local  concerns, lack of managerial personnel, inept administration,  high product costs, and poor sales, not only did the plant not  make money, but losses continued year after year. The plant was  on the verge of paralysis once again.    "A" was an intelligent man. When he saw that all his efforts  were to no avail, he began to ponder new approaches. With the  plant's official seal and bank account number in hand, "A"  traveled about in the name of sales promotion, sometimes being  gone for one or two months on end. Although they felt the  situation was a little strange, the regimental leaders felt that  inasmuch as the plant had been contracted to "A," too many  inquiries would be wrong. Furthermore, "A" always handled  matters rather well. The contract he signed was in the regiment,  so if he did not make money, they need not worry that he would  renege on his obligations. So they did not pay close attention.    Before long, it was the end of the year, but when the  regiment joyfully sought out "A" to have him honor the contract,  they received a subpoena that a civilian court has issued  because the beer bottle factory violated national law by  engaging in speculation.    In order to earn some money, and eager for a quick return  and  instant benefit, "A" had used the beer bottle factory's official  seal and bank account number to sign contracts everywhere. He  ran a speculation scam. His own wallet was full, but the other  parties to the contracts appealed to the court one after  another. "A" was taken into custody by the local public  security organization and punished according to law.    Since childhood, he had had a special feeling about  money. When he left an out-of-the-way mountain village and came  to a large metropolis with a thicket of towering buildings, his  hands itched....    Wei Xiaoling was a brash young cadre who might have been a  comer but for this case. Wei Xiaoling had been born on a barren  tract of land in the Taihang Mountains of Shanxi. After coming  to the capital with a military unit, he was very happy, and  worked very hard. He wanted to accomplish something in order to  escape from the poverty of a peasant's life. His personnel file  was filled with "excellents." He was one of the outstanding  squad leaders in the entire army, and he was to be sent to a  college to study. His illustrious record, and his striking  appearance won him women's affection. In the fourth year after  becoming a soldier, Wei Xiaoliang found favor with the daughter  of a county magistrate to whom he became engaged. With such a  gorgeously attired young woman on his hands, Wei Xiaoliang  became preoccupied with his own lack of money. Naturally, his  family did not have a cent they could give him to spend, so he  looked longingly at all the fine things in the city.    The unit in which Wei Xiaoliang served was a luxury military  hostel where fine cigarettes and good liquor were in plentiful  supply and not strictly controlled. On the first occasion, he  stole half a case of Maotai whiskey and a carton of Red Pagoda  cigarettes with no trouble at all. He sold them to a privately  owned shop. Unscathed, several days later Wei Xiaoliang took two  cartons of Shilin cigarettes. His appetite was becoming bigger  and bigger. By taking the opportunity that being on duty every  night afforded, within a month he managed to steal 5,600 yuan  worth of cigarettes and liquor.    But people who frequent mountains are bound to encounter a  tiger sooner or later. When the shiny handcuffs snapped shut,  clasping together hands that reeked of money, tears streamed  down Wei Xiaoliang's face, and he was filled with agony. He said  to the correspondent who interviewed him: "Nowadays it takes  money to do anything. It is expensive to go out with friends,  and I did not want to be too shabby. I come from a poor family.  If I did not entertain and buy clothes for my girl friends, they  would look down on me. But the little I got in allowances was  not enough to buy a pair of socks. Vanity did me in!"    When thievery occurs in a military unit, it is mostly  because  of problems in the indoctrination that the unit gives. Quite a  few cadres at the grassroots level are not very capable, and are  not honest themselves. They take advantages of enlisted men.  They do not dare take charge of their unit boldly. Consequently,  petty theft constantly occurs in some units at the grassroots  level.    The holder of a lot of authority over motor vehicles,  he felt he should use it well today when a commodity economy was  enveloping China. His philosophy was that one should exploit  whatever resources one has, whether motor vehicles or something  else, never thinking that he himself might be exploited by motor  vehicles.    "W" and I were from the same village. He was not a high  ranking officer, just a first lieutenant commanding a car  company. But "W" had very great authority. He controlled more  than 40 large trucks and 23 other motor vehicles. For the  previous two years, W had done everything by the book. He was  not prone to act rashly. But one day a second rate peddler  sought him out to ask that he make a vehicle available to go to  a place to bring back cigarettes. "W" refused at first. He said,  " I am a member of the Communist Party and I am also a military  cadre. I cannot do such an illegal thing." Then, the peddlar,  who watched his every word and expression, took out a stack of  "e pluribus unum" and stuffed it into the company  commander's depleted pocket. "We'll divide up the money we make  30 to 70. Don't worry. I will certainly not treat you unfairly.  You don't have to do anything. Just depend on the insurance that  a military license plate provides. Stay at home and take a cut."  At the sight of the money, "W" finally wavered. He selected a  good vehicle and, under cover of darkness, he personally drove  it to the city's outskirts. Inevitably, military units have  strict disciple, and for "W" inevitably was the first time he  did this. "W" was very apprehensive. No sooner had the vehicle  left the point where the cigarettes had been sold than public  security enforcement personnel searched it. As soon as "W" saw  that matters had taken a bad turn, he fled in the vehicle, the  ear-splitting sound of police whistles rending the night air  behind him. "W" drove the vehicle faster and faster, finally  taking into a one-way street. Just then, a Huang He automobile  came racing like lighting from the opposite direction. "Bang,"  the two vehicles collided head on and quickly exploded into a  roaring fire.    The correspondent went to the hospital to see W who had  escaped death only by the skin of his teeth. Tears streaming  down his cheeks, he told me repeatedly not to let his family  know, and not to use his real name if I wrote a report. I  understood his feelings, and I respected his request.    B. A relatively insulated environment, a monotonous cultural  life, and strict military camp discipline cause a substantial  number of servicemen to commit crimes for women.    He was a young military doctor who had been assigned to  a unit hospital in a remote area. When a pretty patient  appeared, his desires were aroused, and he exchanged the  penicillin in the syringe for a powerful narcotic.    Medical Doctor Ding's hospital was tiny, and it was also  located in a god-forsaken place. He had always attended male  military patients from his own outfit and family members who  came to the unit (most of whom were also middle aged), but he  had never taken care of any young female patients.    One day, the fiancee of a soldier in Third Company came to  the hospital with a severe case of influenza. Doctor Ding was  very much taken with this young and beautiful young woman, so he  diagnosed her illness and arranged for her stay in the hospital.  The young woman's illness was not serious, but the military  doctor insisted on freeing a bed for her use. The soldier was  very relieved and said to his fiancee, "Since Dr. Ding says so,  a hospital stay is certainly necessary. Stay for a while."    Once the young woman was in the hospital, Dr. Ding busied  himself even more in looking after her, thinking to win the  young woman's love through his actions. Dr. Ding was nearly 30,  and still a bachelor, so naturally this weighed on his mind. For  several days in a row, the principle the young woman followed  was "you may be hot, but I am not." Dr. Ding was very  discomfited.    One day, Dr. Ding came to give the young woman a shot. When  the young woman's tender white behind was exposed to Dr. Ding's  eyes, his hands could not be restrained from stroking it. When  the young woman angrily rebuked him, instead of repenting his  error, Dr. Ding replaced the penicillin in the syringe with a  highly sedative narcotic. Very quickly the young woman lapsed  into a lethargic sleep, and Dr. Ding threw himself on her  anxiously....    When Dr. Ding was sent before the court, he murmured: "When  I  was studying to be a doctor, I learned better, but life in the  armed forces is too confining. I indulged in fantasies all day  long, and made a mistake without thinking."    C. Military personnel frequently have rifles and cartridges  in their possession, and they also often know military secrets.  Officers and men who are unable to resist blandishments  frequently shed tears on this sacred land.    Military regulations explicitly provide that military  personnel may not keep ammunition in their possession. However,  young and happy-go-lucky soldiers do not pay sufficient  attention to this regulation.    On an incomparably soft and gentle morning, with a  single crisp rifle shot, a young and blameless trainee platoon  leader crumpled in a pool of blood. The freshly flowing blood  was as bright as the shoulder patch on the shoulder that the  shot just went through calling people's attention to his youth.  He was only 21.    Little Beans, a soldier in his platoon, was responsible. The  very first time, he did live firing, Little Beans, who had liked  to play with guns ever since he was a child, held back two  cartridges and hid them in his pocket when no one was looking.  Three months passed, but aside from taking them out secretly and  feeling them from time to time, Little Beans never did anything  with them. Every day, he watched the chirping little birds  circling above the guard post. He felt utterly bored. Finally  one early morning when he was on guard duty, he put the two  rounds into his rifle magazine.    Little Beans drew a bead on a little bird hopping on top of  the guard post. As the little bird hopped around, Young Beans'  rifle tracked it left and right, up and down. Just then, the  trainee platoon leader came along quietly to check on the  sentry. When Little Beans saw that familiar stern face in the  sight of his rifle, in a moment of panic, he involuntarily  pulled the trigger.    Instantly, the bullet struck the young trainee platoon  leader. Thus, the trainee platoon leader, who was just doing his  job, fell beneath the muzzle of his own comrade in arms. Little  Beans was also disciplined and punished according to law for  this.    Many officers and soldiers keep ammunition without thinking  that it might fall into the hands of criminal elements, endanger  the safety of the country and society, or even cause some  irrecoverable loss. It was for this reason that the three  general staff departments specially issued "Regulations  Prohibiting Individuals From Concealing Firearms and  Ammunition." Article 163 of the criminal code also contains  explicit provisions. Nevertheless, there are always individual  military personnel, particularly young soldiers, who pay no  attention to the law of the land. They use various means to  conceal ammunition. They may use it to make jewelry, or to show  off, or to commit some act in violation of the law whose purpose  they can tell no one. In the end, everyone of them ends up  either hurting others or hurting himself.    What began simply in order to show off erudition  unexpectedly ended up with the disclosure of military secrets to  an enemy agent.    The writer met Yang Qun at a reform-through-labor farm in  the  capital. A pair of gold wire-rimmed glasses propped on his nose,  his face thin and pallid, his body reedy, he looked as though  the wind could blow him away. Yang Qun had been the secretary in  charge of news at a certain combined arms army. He began talking  about the crime he committed, which it was too late to repent.    He was a person who liked to promote himself, particularly  to  strangers. He was fond of showing his erudition. Since he worked  in a military organization, Yang Qun naturally new numerous  military secrets. In addition, Yang Qun was a news secretary,  who had extensive contact with all sorts of people in civilian  life.    Yang Qun said, "On a summer's day, I went into the city to  give an article to the daily newspaper. When the editor saw me  in uniform, he had me sit down to chat. When I saw how friendly  this big editor was, I started to chat with him. In the course  of the conversation, he casually inquired how many men were in  our unit, and he asked about the tanks, guns, and even new model  weapons. At first I did not think much about it. I just babbled  on. We became good friends. Later on, he frequently came to the  unit to spend time with me, and he had me show him the base and  the unit's equipment. As a good friend, I went through the units  concerned to satisfy his wishes. He observed very closely, and  he was anxious to have me take his picture in front of some new  model weapons as a souvenir. For comrades in civilian life to  have some feeling of mystery about a military camp is  understandable, so I did not realize at all that he had a  criminal motivation."    Yang Qun looked very resentful talking about this. He went  on  to tell the writer, "At that time, I too became somewhat aware.  I felt that he was sly. He particularly wanted me to write  articles about the army, and every time he also wanted materials  to read. Many materials that had nothing to do with the articles  I wrote, he also insisted on having, returning them to me after  several days. I never imagined that he was stealing military  secrets through me and giving them to a foreign spy  organization."    When this spy was arrested by our public security personnel,  Yang Qun was also taken away in a police car. At that time, Yang  Qun still did not know all the details of the matter.    In talking about it, Yang Qun had a sorrowful expression.    D. Servicemen come from all over the country. Fellow  villagers are particularly close to each other in a strange  place. Who could every imagine that so many stories that should  not occur do occur between two fellow villagers?    When the one villager met the other, both shed tears.  What better way to express themselves than to drink together.  While drinking, they became bombastic, and when they finished  drinking, they committed a monstrous crime.    In the military court, he lowered his noble head. In  recalling this bloody lesson, the 28 year old first lieutenant  named Chen said from his innermost being, "It was my fellow  villager who did me in; it was drink that did me in!"    Chen and Zhao had grown up together on the same street, and  they had gone to the same kindergarten, primary school, and  middle school. Still later, they entered military service  together and came to the same city to serve in the same unit.  Even later, they happened to go to the same academy. Friendship  between the two became stronger and stronger. But good things  never last long. After graduating from military school, the two  went their separate ways, one being posted to Wuhan and the  other to Jiangsu. Even though they kept in touch by telephone,  the former feelings of closeness were hard to sustain. Finally,  Zhao had a sudden opportunity to go on a temporary duty  assignment to the small city where Chen was located. The two  met, tears streamed down their cheeks, and they poured out the  events in their lives to each other. Finally, Chen invited Zhao  to drink in a hotel. They drank from noon until sunset, and when  the two left the hotel, they were staggering and casting surly  looks at everyone. Then a woman comrade riding a bicycle bumped  Zhao. Ordinarily, both would have said they were sorry and that  would have been that. But on this occasion, how could Chen "see  a fellow villager be put upon!" He hit the young woman in the  nose with his fist, blood splattering in all directions. Feeling  he still had not slaked his hatred, Chen drunkenly beat the  young woman with his fists and feet till she was almost dead.  Passersby sent the young woman to a hospital where she died from  injuries to her internal organs.    Once he was sober, Chen realized how great a crime he had  committed, but it was too late to repent.    E. As indoctrination in the "two-five" common law  intensifies, servicemen come to understand the weapon of law,  but a substantial number of officers and men are still law  illiterates. When sent to military court, they are still  unknowing.    After opening one letter, he felt exhilarated. After  opening 300 letters, he became a prisoner.    Because of his outstanding work record, Young Fan was  selected battalion mail clerk. Every day several hundred letters  passed through his hands with never a mistake. Two years passed,  but Young Fang's desire to go to school remained unfulfilled. He  was still doing the same old job. Young Fang felt life was  stultifying, so he sought a little stimulation.    One day, he received a thick letter addressed to another  soldier. Looking at the graceful handwriting on the envelope and  the hospital return address, Young Fang felt that the letter had  certainly been written by a young woman. Then the idea of seeing  what was inside the envelope occurred to him. He locked the door  and closed the windows, and secretly opened the envelope. Sure  enough, it was a love letter from a young woman, and a pretty  color photograph was enclosed. The emotion that the young woman  expressed between the lines filled Young Fang's empty heart with  a feeling he had never known. He quietly concealed the  photograph and, after reading the letter several times, he  burned it. When other letters came later on, Young Fang read  them in the same way without inhibition, and if they contained  photographs or money, he took them. After he had read more than  300 letters, the families of many cadres and the fiancees of  many soldiers who had been the victims demanded "an explanation"  from the military unit.    After receiving one after another such "law suits," the unit  CPC committee began to watch Young Fang's behavior. The next  time that Young Fang opened a young woman's love letter, he was  seized on the spot by the regimental security section. Young  Fang was sentenced to one year in prison.    Servicemen carry out special missions. Serviceman crime is  bound to weaken their fighting strength. Therefore, serviceman  crime is a matter than cannot be ignored. As a result of  investigation and research, the writer believes that greater  education in the legal system, improving serviceman morale,  providing servicemen with greater information, increasing cadre  and soldier ability to follow a correct social orientation,  fostering lofty ideals in them, intensifying moral concepts and  disciplinary regulations are matters of far-reaching importance.    I believe that servicemen who have gone through great  tribulations will once again become models in upholding  discipline and abiding by the law.</p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SCHRAMM OPEN TO NFL'S PROPOSALS;  </P> <P> EX-COWBOYS CHIEF WOULD CONSIDER INTERIM COMMISSIONER POST  </P> <P> Former Dallas Cowboys President Tex Schramm said today that although he would  be reluctant to act as interim NFL commissioner, he would listen to whatever  proposal the league owners might offer him while they search for a permanent  successor to Pete Rozelle.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, it was announced this morning that three members of the dissident  owners' faction will be included in the process of finding Rozelle's  replacement.  </P> <P> Both Schramm and former Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach will be nominated  for the commissioner's job Tuesday, when NFL owners gather in Chicago. (See  Sports, Part III).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hedged on Response  </P> <P> Staubach, in a statement released from his real estate office, said he has no  desire to become commissioner. Schramm, however, hedged when asked if he might  consider the job on an interim basis.  </P> <P> "I've had 39 years of association with the National Football League," Schramm  said. "It is by far the better part of my life. I have a tremendous emotional  feeling as far as the league is concerned. I would do anything I could to help  the NFL."  </P> <P> Earlier this month, a search committee made up of veteran NFL owners  recommended New Orleans President Jim Finks as the new commissioner. Eleven  dissident owners abstained when Finks' name was put up for a vote, preventing  him from obtaining the needed 19 votes.  </P> <P> The dissidents were to meet tonight to ratify a plan that would allow them to  get together with selection committee members Tuesday at the owners' meeting,  originally called to announce plans for a new international spring league.  </P> <P> Mike Lynn, president of the Minnesota Vikings and one of the leaders of the  dissident faction, said today that Finks continues to be an alternative.  </P> <P> Under the new plan, Lynn, Edward DeBartolo Jr. of San Francisco and Patrick  Bowlen of Denver will meet with three members of the selection committee,  headed by Wellington Mara of the New York Giants and Lamar Hunt of Kansas City.  That meeting could take place Tuesday.  </P> <P> Also included will be representatives of Heidrich and Struggles, the talent  search firm that cut the list of candidates from 101 names at the start to six  finalists and finally to Finks. The expanded group will look at the material  that Heidrich and Struggles and the search committee used to arrive at the New  Orleans president as its choice.  </P> <P> Schramm, who left the Cowboys to become chief executive officer of the newly  created World League of American Football, will attend Tuesday's owners'  meeting in behalf of the new league.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Flattered at Prospect  </P> <P> Staubach, meanwhile, said although he is flattered at the prospect of having  his name considered for commissioner, he would not accept the job.  </P> <P> "I have a great deal of gratitude and respect for the NFL, and it is an  attractive thought to be considered for the commissioner," Staubach said.  "However, at this time my life is consumed with building my real estate company  on a national basis, and I am committed to this goal.  </P> <P> "I like the challenge of the real estate business, and I am enjoying it. I will  have to say, 'no.' "  </P></p>

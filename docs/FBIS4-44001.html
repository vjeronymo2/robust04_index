			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin, June 23 (AFP) -- One of the main leaders of  the South Korean student opposition is to meet North Korean  leader Kim Il-song in Pyongyang and put proposals to him for  detente and reunification, he said here Thursday [23 June].    Choi Jong-nam, 26, who is also one of the main instigators  of  dialogue between North and South Korean students, told AFP he  would meet with Kim within one week.    Civilian activists like Choi, who lives in exile here, have  often served as intermediaries between the two Koreas in the  past.    He said in an interview that the meeting, arranged two  months  ago, would go ahead despite recent progress in dialogue between  the Koreas and prospects of a summit between the ideologically  opposed states.    "We felt it was vital to pursue a civilian initiative," Choi  said, "If discussions only take place at the level of  governmentals, they will again be used by both sides to keep  themselves in power."    He said he would propose that a federal structure be created  so that both systems, (communist in the north and free-market in  the south), could coexist after eventual reunification.    Choi said he believed "the negative experiences of Germany,  Vietnam and Yemen show that reunification can only work in a  federation."    He also called for an international conference grouping  China, Japan, Russia, the United States and the Koreas to be  convened to resolve the nuclear crisis in the peninsula.    An agriculture student, Choi was expelled from Seoul  University for political activism. The South Korean student  organization Hanchongnyon [South Korean Feceration of General  Student Councils] sent him to Berlin last July to coordinate  dialogue with North Korean students within the Pan-Korean  Student Alliance for Peace and Reunification.    Students from both sides of the Korean divide have  maintained  contact in Berlin for years. During the communist era, North  Korea was particularly well represented in former East Berlin  within the framework of agreements with like-minded nations.    Choi said he was to travel to Pyongyang via Moscow and spend  two weeks in North Korea.    Three South Korean students have visited the North in the  past, despite a ban on such travel by Seoul and the threat of  stiff prison sentences.</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FRENCH VINTNERS ECSTATIC AT EARLY CROP IN SCORCHING DROUGHT YEAR  </P> <P> The worst drought since 1976 is wiping out crops and pastures in southern and  western France but wine producers said today the scorching summer is the best  news they have had in years.  </P> <P> While angry farmers are turning violent to squeeze more compensation out of the  government, the vineyards are predicting a vintage year.  </P> <P> Helped by the longest dry spell in 13 years, growers in the Muscadet area of  western France began picking their grapes today -- three weeks earlier than  usual.  </P> <P> "The seasonal temperatures and the amount of sunshine have been very favorable  for the vines. (The year) 1989 will definitely be a great year, like '47, '59  and '76," said Marcel Martin, chairman of the winegrowers' guild of the Pays de  Loire.  </P> <P> "The grape is perfectly golden. The wine will be supple, clear and fruity," he  added.  </P> <P> Farther down the coast, growers in the Bordeaux region say they will start  picking grapes for white Graves wine at the end of the month. Producers of red  St. Emilion will start from Sept. 4, about 10 days early.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency President Alija </F> Izetbegovic to rally in Sarajevo on 18 April -- recorded]    [Text] Dear citizens of Sarajevo [crowd chants: Bosnia,  interrupting him] Dear citizens of Sarajevo, we have gathered  here to express our solidarity with the citizens of Gorazde, and  to tell them that they are not alone. We have been following  their struggle, and living through every hour and minute of  theirs.    We are also here for another reason, to express our defiance  and to say that the violence and deceit will not pass [crowd  cheers], to utter a large No to violence and deceit, and of  course to tell them that we are not afraid of them. Those of  you who came here have shown that you are not afraid of them.  Those who stayed at home are obviously afraid. [crowd chants:  Let us go on Gorazde, Bosnia]    This is not the time for long speeches. Even if we had come  here in total silence, even if this gathering had come in  silence, that would have still been an eternal expression and a  message.    They have obviously decided to go for all or nothing. We  will also go for all or nothing. [crowd cheers] This is a  battle between good and evil, and for that reason in this battle  for all or nothing we will get all. They will be left with  nothing. [crowd chants]    Dear citizens, it must now be clear to everyone that Gorazde  is the victim of a conspiracy. Here are the Chetniks with their  steel, and there is the deceitful world, or better said, that  part of the deceitful world that is hypocritical and has  hypocritical justice. Gorazde is the victim of that. [crowd  chants]    And let me tell you something: It is not the fault of the UN  Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], it is not the fault of their  soldiers, it is not the fault of their officers. It is the  fault of the leadership of the United Nations. They too are  being killed here, imprisoned, abused. They are following their  orders. It is not their fault, you have to know that. It is  the leadership that is to be blamed, the head is guilty, and you  know what the name of that head is over there. [crowd chants:  Ghali, murderer!] Instead of mobilizing the world against evil,  against this ominous evil that has come down on Bosnia, they are  paralyzing the UN mechanism. They are paralyzing and  demobilizing, and instead of action they think up excuses. They  are constantly coming up with excuses for not acting. Gorazde  is the victim of this, our people in the entire eastern Bosnia  are the victim of this, Bosnia is the victim of this. [crowd  chants]    I will tell you one other thing: It is not the fault of the  Serbs, it is the fault of the Chetniks. The Chetniks are  guilty. Make that distinction! Make that distinction for the  good of Bosnia-Herzegovina! You have to separate the wheat from  the chaff! Make the distinction between the wheat and the chaff!  Those who are among us today, those who have been with us for  two years, the Serbs who have been with us for two years on the  free territory, in the state, and Sarajevo, they are our  fellow-fighters against that evil. It is unfortunate that there  is more chaff than wheat, but we will not be blind. We will  always separate the chaff from the wheat. Those in the hills are  the chaff! [crowd chants]    And finally, we have learned the lesson, they have rammed  the  lesson home. The lesson is very brief: We must be strong. We  must be strong! Pass this knowledge to our children. Tell them  that they have to be good and honorable, but that they must be  strong. This world respects nothing but strength. The world  respects many things, but strength, it seems, the most. We will  be strong. Teach your children that. And we will save Gorazde!  [crowd chants]</p>

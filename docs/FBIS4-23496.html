			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with RPF Chairman Alex Kanyerengwe by Colette </F> Braeckman in Byumba; date not given]    [Text] [Braeckman] When the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF)  launched its offensive in October 1990, could you foresee that  your struggle would lead to today's massacres?    [Kanyerengwe] Yes and no. We knew that there were already  plans in each MRND [National Republican Movement for Democracy  and Development] cell, but we could not predict the scope or the  wickedness of the current events, with massacres that have  decapitated all the active classes in the country, both Tutsis  and Hutus. We feel that civilian society has practically been  swept aside and that an entire generation of active, dynamic  people, intellectuals, professionals, and merchants has been  wiped off the face of the earth. These were the people who  jeopardized the Habyarimana regime, so they were liquidated.    [Braeckman] According to you, where are the brains behind  what has happened?    [Kanyerengwe] Apparently all the MRND's structures are  involved, from the highest level to the local authorities who  often led the groups of killers. As time went by, the group  which formed around President Habyarimana solidified, with  ramifications for the entire country. This group is responsible  for the current situation.    [Braeckman] If you win a military victory, with whom will  you  govern this decimated country and how will you deal with the  MRND?    [Kanyerengwe] We consider that the MRND as a party and  institution, is no longer part of the political scene and  completely disqualified. However, it is still possible to hold  talks with individuals. We desperately hope that an  international investigation will help us to shed light on that  party's responsibility at all levels. Moreover, we must revive  the dialogue with the survivors from the other parties and the  survivors of civil society.    [Braeckman] You signed the Arusha agreements which enshrine  the principle of power sharing. Are these agreements still  valid?    [Kanyerengwe] Their spirit is valid, in any case, even if  adjustments will have to be made as far as the MRND is  concerned. We want to form a provisional government of national  union with all the survivors of the other parties that signed  the agreements.    Halting the Massacres Is a Precondition for any Cease-fire  [subhead]    [Braeckman] Do you wish to move rapidly toward elections?    [Kanyerengwe] Elections? How can we talk about that today in  view of the situation in the country, and the thousands of  refugees, displaced persons, and people who have disappeared?  The very first thing we have to do is reestablish a minimum  level of security for the population. After that, of course, we  will see. The war must stop; that is the first thing.    [Braeckman] So why has a cease-fire not yet been concluded?    [Kanyerengwe] We feel that the precondition for any  cease-fire is that the massacres be stopped. All the people  being held hostage must be evacuated so that they can go where  they like. A cease-fire means that each side stops its troops  where they are and that hostilities cease.    [Braeckman] So you are not seeking to win total military  victory?    [Kanyerengwe] Of course not. We do not want either military  victory or the surrender of the Army. We want a political  solution. However, if a political solution is not forthcoming,  then the RPF will continue its struggle.    [Braeckman] With whom will you agree to talk?    [Kanyerengwe] With the government Army, in the first place.  Of course the Army has its share of responsibility for  unleashing and continuing the massacres, but it is still a  national and legal institution. On the other hand, there is no  question at all of initiating talks with the current interim  government, which has no legitimacy at all. This government was  put together by resurrecting legislation which had already been  abolished by the Arusha agreements. The text of these  agreements is valid as basic law. Furthermore, we hold the  members of this government directly responsible for the  massacres. In Butare, in particular, they called for murder.  In both Butare and Kibongo, the prefects who had managed to  prevent the massacres were kicked out and then killed. The  massacres started afterward. The only way we will meet with  this government is with an arrest warrant.    [Braeckman] Many refugees fear RPF reprisals.    [Kanyerengwe] The current drama is that all or almost all  Rwandan citizens have been implicated in the massacres. The  massacres were planned at the highest level but they had to be  implemented by organized corps of the MRND and the Coalition for  the Defense of the Republic (CDR) (an extremist Tutu party) and  groups of delinquent youths recruited for this purpose. Then,  all Rwandan citizens were forced to kill or they too would be  exterminated. Everyone who did not participate in the massacre  was endangered, as was everyone who helped and hid the victims.  Today, those who have killed are afraid and wonder what will  happen to them, whether or not they will be forgiven. In  reality, we have to distinguish between the leaders who herded  the people before them, and the poor manipulated peasants who  acted to save their own skins.    [Braeckman] Is there any chance of an amnesty?    [Kanyerengwe] Certainly not. It is because all past crimes  and successive massacres have gone unpunished that we have the  current drama. We want to end the cycle of violence. We want  the leaders to be arrested and we want the international  community to help us do this.  <H5>  The Main Problem Is Abandoned Children and Orphans </H5>   [Braeckman] Why do you insist that the people remain grouped  together, even in those areas controlled by the RPF?    [Kanyerengwe] For safety reasons: We are trying to organize  people in the areas we hold, and we know that the Interhamwe  [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic militia] are hiding  in the hills. That is why we are controlling movements people,  at least for the time being. It is also true that the fighting  is continuing at such a rate that the administration cannot keep  up, and there are gray areas. We must first chase out the  Interhamwe. Then, of course, we plan to let the people return to  their homes.    [Braeckman] The refugees in Tanzania accuse the RPF of  having  carried out massacres, too.    [Kanyerengwe] I know. We have made inquiries about where  these massacres we are supposed to have committed took place.  The state of decomposition of the bodies found there shows  clearly that these people were killed a long time before the RPF  arrived in these areas. We also know that this is what is being  said by people who themselves participated in the killings and  are now hiding abroad.    [Braeckman] What will be Rwanda's main problem in the  future?    [Kanyerengwe] The problem of abandoned children and orphans.  There are thousands, tens of thousands of such children  wandering around the country, wounded, mutilated, and  traumatized. We appeal to all nongovernmental organizations, to  all the friends of Rwanda, to come to the aid of the children of  our country.</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Greek government's stability in doubt GREECE'S former foreign minister, Mr Antonis Samaras, yesterday launched a new political party, throwing the stability of the government of the prime minister, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, into doubt. Announcing the foundation of 'Political Spring', Mr Samaras called for a fresh approach, but avoided outlining specific policies. He has stressed that he does not want to bring down the government. However, the resignation earlier this week of Mr Yannis Averoff, a prominent backbencher in the ruling New Democracy party, could presage the departure of other personalities, making it increasingly difficult for Mr Mitsotakis to govern effectively. His authority has been eroded recently by accusations that he was involved in an illegal phone-tapping operation now being investigated by judicial authorities.</p>

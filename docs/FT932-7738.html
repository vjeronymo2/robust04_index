			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts shrug off decline in jobless figures THE UK government bond market was not too perturbed about the possible implications for inflation of the continued fall in unemployment. Losses across the yield curve were small yesterday. The surprise of a third month's decline in the jobless figures did raise fears of impending pay pressure. Signs of anxiety about inflation showed through in gains in the longer-dated index-linked stock. However, a decline from 4.5 per cent to 4 per cent in the annual rate of wage increases assuaged some of the concern, as did continued hopes of a historically-low advance in the retail prices index, to be announced today. Another cushion against inflation fears was provided by sterling, which strengthened to more than DM2.51. The background remained cautious before next week's auction. A HALF-POINT cut in interest rates by the Bank of Italy, reducing the discount rate to 10.5 per cent, sparked a late rally in government bonds, with the BTP futures contract gaining about  1/4 point. The cut came a day earlier than expected and confirmed the easing made possible by increased confidence in the lira. Among the high yielders, Spain was hit by profit-taking. Worst affected was the five-year area, where a spate of buying had exaggerated the 'U' in the yield curve, leading to the correction. JAPANESE government bonds opened on a stronger note, helped by the yen's buoyancy against the dollar and by a recovery in US Treasuries. Nerves also steadied after the Bank of Japan squashed residual speculation about a rise in interest rates. However, there was little to give real impetus to the bond market, which has started to look to next week's auction. The No 145 5.5 per cent bond due 2002 opened in Tokyo on a yield of 4.625 per cent, compared with the previous evening's 4.665 per cent. It closed at 4.63 per cent. The September futures contract opened 20 basis points higher at 106.28, and closed at the same level. AUSTRALIAN government bonds firmed as currency regained some ground against the US dollar. The decline in the Australian dollar to less than 70 cents had been bad news for the market because it wiped out hopes of an imminent cut in interest rates. A half-point cut had been built into the short end of the market and the resultant sell-off in that area had flattened the yield curve by as much as 25 basis points. US TREASURY prices were little changed in light trading yesterday as the bond market caught its breath after Wednesday's wild fluctuations. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/32 at 101 7/8 , yielding 6.971 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was also down  1/32 , at 99 3/4 -to yield 3.992 per cent. After Wednesday's remarkable late rally, when the long bond bounced back from early losses to end sharply higher, dealers and investors stayed mostly quiet. If anything, the market's mood remained on the bullish side, buoyed by two sets of data. First, the news that state unemployment claims rose 7,000 in the second week of May reinforced the view that labour market conditions remain weak. Second, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's index of local business activity showed a sharp decline in May, further evidence that economic conditions throughout the US remain patchy, spotty, with the economic recovery evident in some regions, but not others.</p>

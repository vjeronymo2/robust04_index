			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] ROC [Republic of China] President Li Teng-hui has  reached agreement with Indonesian Minister of Research and  Technology Jusuf Habibie on issues of investing in the natural  gas, (?physics) and (?coal) industries between the two  countries, while President Li Teng-hui was spending the Chinese  New Year holidays in Indonesia.    Adviser to the ROC's Ministry of Economic Affairs Liu  Tai-ying, who is accompanying the President on his trip along  with 30 other government officials, also verified that there  will a big businessmen tour group who will be investigating into  the possibility of investing in the Indonesian industries in  March.    Meanwhile, international news agency REUTER reported the  President's trip to Indonesia as one that is shrouded in  secrecy. President Li, making his second overseas trip since  assuming office in 1988, arrived on the resort island of Bali on  Wednesday [9 February] for a five-day visit after a brief  stopover in the Philippines.    Beijing on Thursday protested Li's trip to the Philippines  and his meeting with Filipino President Fidel Ramos and other  Philippine officials.    Indonesia was President Li's second stop on the  three-country  tour which prompted Mainland China to warn the Philippines,  Indonesia, and Thailand that their relations with Beijing would  be harmed if the visits went ahead.    An official in Bali said Li, who is likely to have dinner  with President Suharto on Friday, flew to Bantam on Thursday  with his host Research and Technology Minister Jusuf Habibie.  At the state-run IPTN aircraft factories in Bantam, southeast  of Jakarta, visitors were denied entry, and security appeared to  have been stepped up, REUTER reported.    Taipei said last month it was studying possible aviation  tie-up with Indonesia and Mainland China [as received] after  failing to form joint ventures with Western aerospace companies.  The Indonesian aircraft factory IPTN's centerpiece is its  70-seat N-250 medium-haul turboprop communter plane due to enter  service in 1996.    The Indonesian aircraft company also produces under license  French-designed Puma and U.S. Bell helicopters as well as parts  for U.S.-designed F-16 fighters and British-developed Rapier  missiles.    Indonesia has formal diplomatic ties with Beijing and  Foreign  Minister Ali Alatas has said a private visit by Li will not  change Jakarta's one-China policy. Indonesian officials have  stressed that senior officials meeting President Li would do so  in their private capacity.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Warm reception to pricing on Y125bn Spanish deal SPAIN yesterday launched its anticipated Y125bn issue in the international bond market, but priced the deal more generously than expected to attract investors. The 5 3/4 per cent 10-year bonds were priced to yield 5.858 per cent, at the higher end of market expectations. At this level, the bonds yield 7 basis points more than Belgium's outstanding Y50bn deal and 27 basis points more than Japan Development Bank's outstanding Y120bn deal, two benchmarks in the Euroyen sector. Nomura International, lead manager, said the deal was priced by consensus among top underwriting firms. The realistic pricing was reflected in a warm reception from investors. Participants in the deal reported brisk sales, with UK and continental European institutional investors the most active buyers. From a fixed re-offer price of 99.20, the deal traded up to stand at 99.25 bid by the close. The European Community launched a Ecu490m five-year deal, lead managed by Morgan Stanley International, to finance balance of payments loans to a number of eastern European states. The issue added to a Ecu250m deal lead-managed by Credit Lyonnais in November. The bonds were priced to give a yield of 8.47 per cent, a small 2 basis point pick up over the outstanding bonds in the secondary market. The issue is now likely to become a benchmark at the five-year maturity. As with the Spain transaction, the pricing was considered to be fair by market participants. The lead manager won the mandate for the deal following a bidding process, but the EC did not pick the firm which offered to underwrite the bonds at the lowest yield. In the past, the EC has been criticised for awarding new issue mandates on the basis of bids which were far more aggressive than the market consensus, resulting in poorly-received deals. The proceeds of the issue were swapped into floating-rate Ecu and on-lent to a number of states, including Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Morgan Stanley offered the EC the lowest cost of funds by engineering an attractive swap. While most firms were satisfied with the pricing, many said investors were not keen to buy Ecu bonds at this maturity and saw only limited buying. However, other participants in the deal, including the lead manager, reported steady sales to a range of European retail and institutional investors. The deal was held at the fixed re-offer price of 100.65 throughout the day.</p>

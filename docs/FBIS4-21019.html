			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Drug Dealer Gang Busted"] </F>   [Text] Officers of the Lower Austrian Department of  Criminal Investigation and the Task Force for the Combating of  Drug Crime (EBS) of the Interior Ministry have laid an  international gang of drug dealers by the heels. A Belgian, a  Pakistani, an Afghan, and an Iranian citizen are under arrest.  Information has been laid against a Serb.    On Sunday, through the mediation of the other two men, the  Belgian and the Pakistani tried to sell 1,040 grams of heroin.  However, the customer was an undercover agent of the Interior  Ministry, the Lower Austrian Security Directorate stated.    According to the investigations, Zahid Mushtag M. (33), who  is resident in Gent, had taken the 1,040 grams of heroin in a  rented car from Belgium via Germany to Austria last week on  Saturday. On the next day, the man wanted to sell the drug for  650,000 schillings together with Pakistani Hussain Tahir M.  (38), who is, among others, registered in Vienna-Favoriten.  Afghan citizen Ahmad Zia R. (29), who is resident in  Vienna-Leopoldstadt, and Iranian Mehrdad S. (24), who is  registered in Traunkirchen in the Gmunden District, mediated the  deal. The customer turned out to be an undercover agent.    According to the officers, Serb Bozidarka T. (40), who is  resident in Vienna-Favoriten, is presumably an accomplice. When  the apartment of the Serb was searched, 42,000 schillings were  seized. The money probably comes from Hussain M.'s drug deals,  the investigators stated.</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Books: A Taj Mahal of a novel A SUITABLE BOY by Vikram Seth Phoenix House Pounds 20, 1,349 pages BOOK-reviewers tend to be paid at a rate appropriate to the length of their reviews rather than that of the book they are reviewing. A few more novels like this one and we shall need some clause compensating us in the case of books that make demands 'deemed to be beyond the normal course of duty'. Never can a variant of that old Hollywood formula 'Boy meets girl. Boy gets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy gets girl' have been stretched to such inordinate lengths. Here the storyline is: boy (charmer, fellow-student, Moslem) meets girl (beautiful, English literature student, Hindu); gets girl in spite of maternal opposition; loses girl; nearly regains girl but loses girl finally to Suitable Boy (solid, reliable, all set for successful career in the shoe-manufacturing business, Hindu, right caste, but lacking charm or glamour). Seth is the latest instance of an Indian writer, steeped in his own indigenous tradition, who has been through the mill of a British and American education, (Doon in India, then Tonbridge, Oxford, Stanford and Nanjing University, China). Such a writer tends at the outset to look to English and other European literatures for models and to say to himself: 'Anything you can do, I can do . . . if not better then at least longer.' Salman Rushdie, you may recall, took for his model Sterne's Tristram Shandy with far-reaching results. The early model for Seth was The Tales of Pushkin. They provided the inspiration for The Golden Gate - a novel he wrote in verse about the inhabitants of California's silicon valley. It was published here in 1986 by Faber. Seth's witty stanzas wove a neatly plotted tale of a broken marriage, a homosexual affair and a ferociously possessive cat. The notion of writing such a story in a rigid metrical form must have seemed to be the greatest commercial folly. Only a publisher with its own Cats to fall back upon would have been prepared to under-write it. But Seth put himself on the literary map with this tour de force and it has by now sold a cool 150,000 copies. The immediate models for A Suitable Boy are 19th century novels like Madame Bovary and Anna Karenina. Although everything is rooted in the growth of a love-affair, with the heroine occupying the centre of the stage, her forbidden passion is viewed in the context of the moral, cultural and political attitudes of a whole society. The city where she lives is the centre from which the reader beholds a social structure whose boundaries are those of the aristocracy at the top, the bourgeoisie in the middle and the peasantry at the bottom. Seth's heroine, Lata, comes from a well-to-do Hindu family many of whose members hold important positions in newly independent India. She is a student at the university of Brahmpur - an imaginary place somewhat reminiscent of Patna and Brinkipore. It is few hours railway journey to Calcutta. The contrast between the life-style of the smart 'permissive' Bengali society of her brother's wife's family with whom she stays and the restricted provincial life of her home near the campus where she meets the handsome unsuitable boy she falls in love with, is done with a precision of detail that would earn Seth full marks from his French and Russian masters. It is one of many such contrasts of ambience in the depiction of the four families whose members are singled out for close scrutiny. They are surrounded by this novel's hundred or more subsidiary characters, mainly Indian but also one or two British who have stayed on . Tolstoy contrasted adulterous Anna with virtuous Kitty, and arrogant Vronsky with likeable Levin. Seth has several alternative heroines to Lata up his sleeve and he produces them one after the other as he develops the narrative along pairs of parallel lines. There is the music-loving courtesan whose scented drawing-room is so sensuously described; there is Sava, Lata's sister, a young, happily married woman about to give birth to her first child; there is cynical, delectable Meenakshi, her sister-in-law, nonchalantly deceiving her husband, a member of the Shady Ladies' Club; there is the Moslem wife of the idealistic Urdu teacher whom we hardly see since her creed prevents it, but whose fate is nonetheless every bit as poignant as Lata's. A similar multiplication of themes occurs. Apart from its fictional virtues, the book may be read as a gloss on the violence in India today; much of it stems from the period the novel illuminates, the early 1950s when the problems inherited by the first all-Indian governments from the British were at their most acute. Then in the same depth there is the world of the campus, with its own ruthless political manoeuvering and an eccentrically distrait mathematical genius (lover-boy's papa) thrown in for good measure. But away from academe and government, Seth seems just as at home in the world of agriculture and sweated farm labour, the abuses practised by the zemindars (revenue collectors) on behalf of the great landlords. Yet another dimension comes in the descriptions of religious fundamentalism in action, the ceremonies lasting several days and drawing vast, unruly crowds on the banks of the Ganges. And depicted in most detail of all is the world of shoe-manufacturing (Seth's father's occupation), with its domination at the top by emigre foreigners. It is used brilliantly as a metaphor for India's industrial problems as well as the Suitable Boy's. The SB also has a Hindu rival - a young poet, beginning to make a big name for himself, clearly a portrait of the author, but he drops out of the hunt (for no very satisfactory reason that I could see). But I could easily fill the whole of this page merely describing the amazingly rich content of the novel. Yet it remains so readable because the prose is always direct and incisive. Does it all hold together? Yes, it does, amazingly enough - rather like a Taj Mahal made out of Lego. Some parts are detachable. One section has already been published as a self-contained long short story. The controlled energy of the writing carries one over the melodramatic cliches of plotting to which Seth resorts to sustain his narrative. All in all, it is an outstanding achievement for which he deserves the warmest congratulation.</p>

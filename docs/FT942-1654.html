			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Arts: Sanderling's Brahms - Concert The gigantic themed festivals that towered over London's musical life in the late 1980s have disappeared. In the present economic conditions the nearest one comes to anything similar is the short series, which is never so adventurous: the Philharmonia has scheduled a Beethoven symphony cycle next season and a Brahms cycle to end this one. These would not be of any import, were it not for the conductors - Harnoncourt for the Beethoven, Kurt Sanderling for the Brahms. Keen record collectors may have come across a cycle of the Brahms symphonies with Sanderling and the Dresden Staatskapelle. Although the sound quality from the original East German tapes was poor, there was no mistaking that here was one of the two great Brahms conductors of the day. Those performances were characterised by a strict, almost fierce, adherence to the ideal of Brahms as a classicist. Over the years Sanderling's outlook seems to have mellowed a little (can he really be 81 when he is only just starting to go grey?) but the classical discipline is still in place. His Brahms now is very much the product of maturity - wise and noble, absolutely unforced. What a splendid move on the part of the Philharmonia to bring him to London for these four concerts, featuring the symphonies and the concertos. In Tuesday's opening programme he held the First Symphony to a steady pace, though without digging into the rhythms as trenchantly as he used to. He also kept the Philharmonia's enthusiastic timpanist firmly under wraps. There was to be no over-emphasis, no hammering home of climaxes too early. Only a conductor who had years of experience would dare restrain the symphony for so long, holding off the resolution right until the triumphal brass chorale of the finale. In these last years Sanderling's mastery becomes ever more subtle and unpredictable, but it is there nonetheless. The Philharmonia, significantly Klemperer's old orchestra, played well for him. The First Piano Concerto was more problematical. Sanderling set out at a magisterial pace, sinking down foundations of granite. Unfortunately, the pianist, Mitsuko Uchida, needed speed above all to compensate for her lack of weight. The result oscillated uneasily between one type of Brahms and another, hers headlong and shallow-toned, his patient and massive. Despite some exquisite moments in Uchida's slow movement, I know whose side I was on. Sponsored by AFG, Automotive &amp; Financial Group. The other three concerts are on June 26, 28 and 30</p>

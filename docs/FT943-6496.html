			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Estate agents Financial institutions still toiling to make a profit in estate agency must be taking a long hard look at their reasons for persevering. While building societies hide the operating performance of their agencies within group figures, evidence from the quoted insurers suggests the going is still tough. Royal Insurance's 480 offices lost as much in the first half of this year as in the same period last year; General Accident's chain lost slightly more. Neither is the outlook encouraging. The number of house purchases per month has fallen back steadily since the spring. Total transactions this year now look likely to be around 1.3m - only a shade higher than in 1993. While that would be far below the 2.1m peak reached in 1988, it is only around 20 per cent below the average of the 1980s and there is little reason why turnover should increase. So long as house prices remain stable, first-time buyers will not feel under pressure to scramble on to the bottom of the housing ladder. The prospect of rising interest rates is another reason for caution. Since house prices have fallen and commissions are under pressure, estate agents' income has been squeezed harder than the transaction figures suggest. Unless transactions increase significantly, it is difficult to see why customers should stop haggling over commissions. Despite the shake-out through recession - with the number of estate agency offices falling by perhaps a quarter - overcapacity is at the root of the problem. Banks and building societies which distribute mortgages through their estate agencies have a more obvious reason for persevering than insurers. But that did not dissuade Abbey National from selling out last year or Bristol &amp; West from shrinking its chain last week. Selling financial products through estate agencies has been far more difficult than hoped. Widening the range of financial products on offer might help at the margin. But estate agents which have not been covering their costs this year should not count on the housing market for relief.</p>

			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> MRS. BUSH ON HEALTH OF FIRST DOG  </P> <P> Barbara Bush said the listlessness of her dog Millie is due more to jealousy  than illness.  </P> <P> "George is convinced she's sick, but it really is because she's jealous of her  son," a big, bounding dog who belongs to one of Bush's sons and frequently  visits the White House, Mrs. Bush said Monday during a visit to the village  center 1 1/2 miles from the Bush family compound.  </P> <P> "It's more in the mind than the body," she said as local children petted the  dog.  </P> <P> Later, Mrs. Bush chatted with reporters aboard Air Force One on the trip back  to Washington.  </P> <P> Regarding the President's suggestion the day before that he might invite Soviet  leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to their Maine home, Mrs. Bush said her husband had  not told her about it.  </P> <P> But, she added, "You know me. Anybody he asks -- I'll be nice to."  </P></p>

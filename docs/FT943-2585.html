			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Investors relieved at Dollars 5bn Exxon award Exxon's share price is expected to rise when trading begins today following a federal jury's award of Dollars 5bn in punitive damages against the oil company for the 1989 oil spill from its tanker Exxon Valdez. Financial analysts expected the news to cheer investors, who have been concerned that damages for the Exxon Valdez spill, which devastated Alaska's Prince William Sound, could run as high as Dollars 15bn. The damages award is one of the last phases in a drawn-out legal battle over Exxon's liability for the Exxon Valdez wreck, which destroyed fish stocks and wildlife with an oil slick of more than 250,000 barrels. When the jury verdict was announced late on Friday in a federal court in Anchorage, Exxon shares rose by Dollars 1.50 to a New York close of Dollars 60.25, and further gains were recorded in trading after hours. Lawyers for the plaintiffs said they were 'ecstatic' about the award. The 80 law firms involved are expected to reap more than 20 per cent of the money. Mr Lee Raymond, Exxon's chairman, denounced the award as 'excessive by any legal or practical measure.' 'We will use every legal means available to overturn this unjust verdict, which is not a final judgment,' Mr Raymond said. 'It will be reviewed and we trust it will be modified by the trial court or by appellate courts.' Legal experts said Exxon could either seek to have the award reduced by the courts, or use it as a ceiling for a negotiated settlement with the thousands of fishermen, native Alaskans and landowners who brought the claim. Exxon has spent Dollars 2.1bn on cleaning up the spill and paid Dollars 1.3bn to settle a range of civil and criminal charges brought by federal and local governments, residents and businesses. In this suit, the jury last month awarded Dollars 287m in compensation for the damage caused by the oil slick to fish stocks. But the jury found that Exxon and Mr Joseph Hazelwood, captain of the Exxon Valdez, had acted recklessly, paving the way for additional punitive damages. Plaintiffs had claimed up to Dollars 15bn. Other cases involving crab fishermen and native Alaskan corporations are still pending, with some of the claims being heard in state court. The jury also ordered Mr Hazelwood to pay Dollars 5,000 in punitive damages, even though the plaintiffs had only asked for a symbolic Dollars 1 award against the tanker captain.</p>

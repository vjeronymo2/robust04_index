This straightforward official told this reporter immediately  after we met: There is a Chinese saying that "on festive  occasions we think of our dear ones far away more than ever."  We and our compatriots in Taiwan have the same blood ties. As  a person specially engaging in Taiwan affairs, I would like to  extend, through ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE, Spring Festival greetings  from fellow- townsfolk in the northeast to our compatriots in  Taiwan, wishing them a still brighter New Year.    The northeast is China's heavy industry base and Liaoning is  a big industrial province. In recent years, Liaoning has become  a popular province in which Taiwanese businessmen and  industrialists invest and the province attracts the greatest  amount of funds from Taiwan. Director Wang Weifu was all smiles  when talking about this matter.    He told this reporter: In 1993, there were more than 400 new  projects started by Taiwanese investors in Liaoning Province.  The contracted amount of Taiwanese investment exceeded $320  million, which was greater than the total in the previous  decade. At present, there are a total of over 800  Taiwanese-invested projects in the province and the contracted  amount of Taiwanese investment exceeds $600 million, including  over 10 projects with more than $10 million of investment and  three projects with more than $200 million of investment. We  can say that economic cooperation between Liaoning and Taiwan is  showing a tendency to make giant strides.    The development of economic cooperation and trade will  definitely bring about frequent exchanges of personnel.  Director Wang Weifu gave this reporter the following figures:  Last year, more than 33,000 people from all circles in Taiwan  visited Liaoning, an increase of 16 percent over the previous  year, nearly half of whom were businessmen and industrialists.  Last year, Liaoning also received more than 170 delegations and  exchange groups from Taiwan. Meanwhile, more than 240 people  from Liaoning went to Taiwan for private reasons last year, the  highest figure ever. In addition, a total of 55 people from 16  delegations and exchange groups from Liaoning went to Taiwan,  including athletes, college lecturers, poets, painters, juvenile  actors, doctors, and artists.    Director Wang Weifu once worked in the Liaoning Province  Department of Engineering Industry, so he has a good  understanding of Liaoning's basic industrial strength. He said:  Liaoning has its own superiority. It has a coastline, a  foreign border, and it has a vast hinterland, rich industrial  strength, a large amount of scientific and technological talent,  and a developed communications network. At present, Liaoning is  "starting its business for the second time" and is vigorously  trying to reinvigorate this old industrial base through opening  up wider to the outside world. This will definitely give  Taiwanese businessmen and industrialists a very rare opportunity  for development.    The 56-year-old director ambitiously predicted that economic  cooperation and trade between Liaoning and Taiwan will remain  very promising, proved by the fact that a large amount of  Taiwanese funds are pouring into Liaoning. A large number of  men of insight from Taiwan's industrial and business circles  have taken the lead and a large number of Taiwanese investors  are itching to have a try. In 1994, greater cooperation and  exchanges between Liaoning and Taiwan are expected, there will  be more than 1,000 Taiwanese-invested projects, and the  prospects are very good.</p>

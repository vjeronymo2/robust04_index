"I don't see any reason why the sale  won't go through," Erwin Okun, a Disney spokesman, said Monday.  </P> <P> "It will be temporarily delayed to allow for an appropriate mourning period."  Okun did not disclose when the deal is scheduled to be completed. Henson, who  died at age 53 last Wednesday of bacterial pneumonia, was buried Monday in New  York. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

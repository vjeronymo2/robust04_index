			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Mackay plans libel reform Legislation to simplify court procedures in cases of libel and slander was promised last night by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern. The reforms would include provision to avoid the need for a trial if a defendant was prepared to offer amends and pay damages assessed by a judge, Lord Mackay said in a Lords written reply. There would be a new summary procedure under which every defamation claim would come before a judge 'at an early stage'. The judge would then assess whether the claim was suitable for summary disposal or whether it should go for a full trial, with or without a jury. The judge would have the power, on summary disposal, to award damages up to a fixed ceiling. Opponents say that the present system is slow and unwieldy and can lead to disproportionate awards, especially when celebrities are appellants. Lord Mackay, who first outlined his intentions in 1992, said: 'I believe that the new procedure will help the parties to clarify the real issues much earlier and encourage sensible settlements, as well as providing a fast track for the disposal of straightforward claims.' Lord Mackay said he now intended to introduce legislation 'as soon as I have a suitable opportunity'.</p>

South Korean Ambassador to Beijing Hwang Pyong-tae, a former  lawmaker, apparently made two big mistakes -- he disclosed the  contents of the Korea-China [summit] talks, and what he chose to  reveal ran counter to what the president said.    President Kim Yong-sam refused to answer questions on the  specifics of his talks with Chinese Premier Li Peng at a press  conference Tuesday, saying only that his visits to Tokyo and  Beijing had helped form a trilateral cooperation channel among  the United States, Japan and China.    He said he hoped to include Russia in this chain to bring  aboard all four regional powers in solving the North Korean  nuclear problem.    Then came Ambassador Hwang, who arranged an evening press  conference at the request of South Korean TV journalists. He  suggested that while South Korean-U.S. coordination supplied the  impetus for dealing with the nuclear question, it would be South  Korean-Chinese coordination from now on.    "The discussion on the North Korean nuclear issue between  South Korea and China has outgrown the past practice, where  South Korea and the United States would only notify the results  of their consultations (to others), changing to where South  Korea and China would hold deep discussions from the beginning  and take joint steps," the ambassador told the press.    Asked about Japan and Russia's role, he said Seoul would  simply brief Moscow on the results of the negotiations, and  "it's realistically difficult to expect Japan to play a role."    He went on to disclose the details of the Kim-Li meeting.  "Premier Li Peng told President Kim that China would continue to  try to solve the nuclear problem through dialogue if North Korea  has no nuclear weapons. But if North Korea does have nuclear  weapons, China would counter it ever strongly," he said.    The envoy then predicted that North Korea would soon resume  negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  on additional inspections.    The news later reached Senior Secretary for Diplomacy Chong  Chong-uk and Spokesman Chu Ton-sik, who belatedly tried to cork  the story.    Chung, Chu, and Hwang came by the press center twice around  midnight, saying the facts had been misrepresented and pleading  that sensitive parts of the story not be published.    A close presidential aide insisted that Hwang's remarks do  not reflect the Seoul government's official position: Nor is it  true that the South Korea-China channel has reached the same  level as negotiations between Seoul and Washington.    "All it means is that the channel with China was strengthend  through the Beijing visit," the aide said. "It's also not true  that North Korea will resume talks with the IAEA soon."    President Kim personally refuted Hwang's remarks in a  breakfast meeting with the press Wednesday, emphasizing South  Korea's affinity to the United States, its close cooperation  with allies and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's "hasty" trip to  Washington.    One official at the presidential office [Chongwadae] openly  criticized the envoy, saying, "I don't know whether Ambassador  Hwang is a diplomat or still a politician."</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Letter: Questions Occupational Pensions Board should address on AGB funds Sir, It is difficult to question the decision ('Four Maxwell pension funds to close', January 28) of the trustee to wind up the four AGB pension funds, without knowing far more of the figures. What is of concern, however, is the complete lack of any reference to the employer's obligations, and the apparent silence of the Occupational Pensions Board. In most defined benefit plans, as it appears these were, the employees pay a fixed percentage of salary, with the employer meeting the balance of the cost. In recent years companies have benefited from the surpluses in their funds by enjoying reduced, and in some cases nil, contributions. No doubt the AGB group did so too. The converse of this arrangement is that employers have to be the first to stump up when the fund is in deficit. In the AGB case, the employer seems to have a double obligation, because it was one of its appointed trustees who was responsible for the disappearance of much of the assets. Whatever the size of the hole left by the Maxwell depredations, what arrangements were considered by the company to fund the deficit over a period? Could reduced benefits and increased employee contributions have played a part in saving at least a more modest scheme? Were the members even consulted by their employer? Surely these are questions the OPB should have been asking before the decision to wind up was made, if its protective role means anything at all.

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Survey of New Zealand (1): Disillusion opens the door to minor parties - Impatience with some aspects of the social overhaul of recent years was a factor in the people's vote to change the electoral system It is hard not to notice the tensions that pervade modern New Zealand. On the one hand, the country wears all the trappings of a successful, market-oriented society. Wellington, Auckland and other main cities are well-supplied with stylish restaurants and smart boutiques. Warehouses are being converted to 'Manhattan-style' apartments. Cellular phones are everywhere. As Mr Roderick Deane, chief executive at NZ Telecom, the country's largest quoted company, puts it: 'New Zealand, in a sense, has rejoined the rest of the world over the past decade.' On the other hand, memories of a very different social structure, which offered New Zealanders 'cradle-to-grave' protection under a universal welfare system, linger on. It is 10 years since the nation embarked on radical economic reform, first under a Labour government, which deregulated financial markets and began to dismantle the extensive state sector, and then under the National party, which extended the 'free market' philosophy to the industrial relations arena and the welfare system. But the implications of this social overhaul are still permeating the lives of ordinary New Zealanders. As a result, discontent with some of the less palatable aspects of the new order - especially in the welfare and employment areas - is highly visible. In recent months, for example, attempts to alter work practices have brought a rash of strikes, notably among recent privatisation candidates, such as NZ Rail and NZ Telecom. Pensioners have marched in protest against asset-testing for long-stay hospital patients. Student rebellion has simmered over a threatened increase in tertiary education fees. On the political front, there has already been a backlash. In a referendum last November, a disillusioned electorate, unable to spot much difference between the policies of the two biggest parties, voted to change the nation's electoral system. Out went the British-style 'first past the post' (FPP) method of electing constituency-based MPs to the single-chamber parliament. In, for all future elections, came a 'mixed member proportional' (MPP) system, a form of proportional representation modelled loosely on the German system. (En route, in the accompanying general election held under the existing FPP rules, voters also returned a hung parliament. However, this situation was resolved fairly speedily when a recount in marginal seats gave the ruling National Party a slender majority). The implications of a vote for MPP were clear. The new system is likely to give minor parties a much greater voice in parliament, and thus encourage coalition government. In addition, because only half the MPs sitting in the enlarged 120-member parliament will represent specific constituencies, with the remainder being drafted in from party lists, MMP will probably mean that politicians' loyalty to the two major parties diminishes. While the practical adjustments necessary to conduct an MMP election will not be complete until next spring, there are already signs that the number of 'serious' minor parties is about proliferate. Going into the November general election, voters had two main choices outside Labour and National: Mr Jim Anderton's Alliance, which is a coalition of five left-leaning minor parties, and New Zealand First, headed by Mr Winston Peters, a former National Party cabinet minister. Now there is talk of a breakaway centre-left party, possibly headed by Mike Moore, the former Labour party leader. On the right of the political spectrum, some observers suggest that the National party could splinter into about three groupings. The Association of Consumers and Taxpayers, a free-market ginger group formed by Sir Roger Douglas, the former Labour finance minister, could also emerge as a political force. The big question is whether this fascinating but fluid political situation is likely to have an important bearing on New Zealand's economic policies in the months and years ahead. At macroeconomic level, there is no decrying New Zealand's recent progress. Growth in gross domestic product reached 4.6 per cent in calender 1993, and many forecasts suggest that the year-on-year figure could top 5 per cent this year. Unemployment, while still high, has eased. The government is widely tipped to produce a small financial surplus for 1993-4 when it unveils its annual budget in the next few weeks. On the inflation front, New Zealand now has the advantage of its much-vaunted Reserve Bank Act, which formally insulates the central monetary authority from political influence. It is merely required to ensure that inflation says within a publicly-stated band, currently zero to 2 per cent. The international financial community's approval for New Zealand's recent performance has been clear from the foreign investment data. Direct net investment inflow in the year to end-March reached NZDollars 4.7bn, more than twice the level of the previous 12 months. Anecdotally, there are indications that the country has been winning corporate dollars at the expense of Australia, its larger neighbour, whose own reform process has been much more measured. It is true that a few question-marks persist. Some commentators would like to see quicker progress in reducing the heavy external debt burden and the current account deficit. The recent collapse of the large Fortex meat-processing business - which had been hailed as a prize example of a revitalised, efficient company - also cast an ominous shadow. It can be argued that this was efficient rationalisation in an industry with surplus capacity; but some observers saw Fortex as a symptom of inherent instability in a key sector, and of serious under-capitalisation. Many commentators also think the Reserve Bank, whose independence was guaranteed just as worldwide recession began, has yet to face the challenge of maintaining a low price-increase regime when international inflationary conditions are less clement. But the bigger, and more speculative, clouds that threaten this sunny economic outlook are political. Advocates of the economic reforms scent two specific dangers: a change in Reserve Bank targets, and a big change/repeal of the Employment Contracts Act (ECA), the legislation which deregulated labour markets but was criticised subsequently by the International Labour Organisation in Geneva. Amendments to the latter, it is argued, could dent business confidence immediately and, in the longer-term, affect labour costs and productivity. On both scores, changes are already being mooted. All three parties, apart from the National, are talking of revisions to the ECA, while Labour has suggested a widening of the Reserve Bank's inflation target range. If changes come, the test may be whether the variations are largely cosmetic, or whether they represent a fundamental shift. Finally, it is worth noting that Mr Bolger's National government seems to have adopted a less rigid approach since the last election. Much of the reform process had, admittedly, been completed. Nevertheless, in recent months, the government has introduced a minimum youth wage, held off on further state housing rent increases and set up a 'taskforce' to look at unemployment issues. Whether this softer approach, coupled with the general economic recovery, will allay the electorate's concerns remains to be seen. As Anne Knowles, deputy chief executive of the New Zealand Employers Federation, says: 'MMP has great potential to be disruptive, or it has great potential to be stabilising - because no one can agree to do anything.' New Zealanders can only wait to find out.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["S. Korea Must Rid Itself of Colonial Fetters of United </F> States" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- If the Korean issue is  to be settled smoothly, South Korea must rid itself of the  fetters of U.S. colonial rule, stresses NODONG SINMUN today.    The paper in a by-lined article says:    The U.S. imperialists' occupation of South Korea and  colonial  rule over it are the root cause of all the misfortunes of the  Korean nation, the chief obstacle to the reunification of Korea  and a permanent factor of war on the Korean peninsula. The  U.S. colonial rule over South Korea is, first of all, the source  of the disturbance of peace, the acute confrontation and  tensions and the growing danger of nuclear war on the Korean  peninsula.    It is the invariable ambition of the U.S. imperialists to  keep South Korea under their military occupation, execute their  aggressive strategy toward Korea, Asia and the Pacific with it  as the bridgehead and, further, dominate the world.    The United States, regarding the Korean peninsula as a "test  field of a new military strategy," is frequently staging  provocative nuclear attack exercises against the North together  with the South Korean puppets, posing a constant nuclear threat  to the DPRK. This has created a very dangerous situation which  may lead to the outbreak of nuclear war any moment on the Korean  peninsula.    Yet the United States shamelessly describes South Korea as  an  "independent state" and "friendly nation," not its colony, and  depicts itself as the "protector," "helper" and "apostle of  peace" for the South Korean people. This is a ridiculous  sophism to conceal the colonial dependence of South Korea and  its own nature as an aggressor, a plunderer and the chieftain of  war.    The U.S. colonial rule over South Korea is also the chief  obstacle to the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea.    It is entirely due to the United States that the Korean  nation's cause of reunification has not yet been accomplished.    It is the United States that has manipulated the puppets to  bind to the chains of fascism the South Korean students and  people who desire reunification through the alliance with  communism and the North. It is also the United States that has  worked out a divisive scenario for the puppets and manipulated  them to blindly oppose the reasonable proposals of the North for  national reunification.    The United States must show its will to solve the Korean  issue by putting an end to its anachronistic military occupation  of South Korea and colonial rule over it.</p>

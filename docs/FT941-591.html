			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Indonesian noodle maker launches rare exchangeable issue An unusual exchangeable bond offering by Indofood, Indonesia's largest food company, dominated interest in an otherwise subdued market yesterday. Dealers described the Dollars 500m offering as 'a difficult transaction', due to its size and complicated structure. 'The most common comment I heard was good company, but bad pricing and bad timing,' said one underwriter. 'It's a very unforgiving market at the moment.' After powering ahead last year, Asia's emerging markets have run into trouble this year. The Dollars 500m offering, arranged by UBS, is part of an initial public offering for the company, which dominates the Indonesian instant noodle market. Dealers said it is very rare for an exchangeable bond structure to be used as part of an IPO. The deal is being brought to the market ahead of a domestic IPO of 20m shares, due to be launched in April. However, the domestic offering is very small compared with the 154m shares underlying the international bond offering. The interest payments on the exchangeable bonds also have a complicated structure, with a step-up coupon of 3.5 per cent in the first year, 5 per cent in the second year and 6 per cent in the third year. The pricing for the domestic offering is to be set at 15 times earnings  - the maximum allowed in the domestic market - compared with 23 times projected 1994 earnings for the bond offering. According to other syndicate members, the original pricing was between 25 and 29 times earnings, but had to be lowered. The final pricing of the international bonds was described as 'not unreasonable but not cheap', said one underwriter, given the fact that the gloss has gone off the emerging markets this year. However, the company 'has a very good story to tell'. Elsewhere, Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone launched a SFr200m deal via Credit Suisse, and Rabobank Nederland launched a Fl 150m five-year deal via Rabobank. Salomon Brothers has signed a Dollars 1bn revolving credit facility with a syndicate of 16 banks in Europe and North America to provide back-up financing for its principal operating subsidiaries, Reuter reports from New York. The borrower for the secured, committed facility is Salomon Brothers International and the arranger and collateral agent is Barclays Bank, Salomon said. The facility was initially launched at Dollars 600m late last year, then increased to Dollars 1bn, Salomon said.</p>

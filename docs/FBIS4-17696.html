			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Martinovich Morkovskiy, deputy </F> chairman of the "state committee for the elimination of the  consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe in Belarus," by  Dietmar Ostermann: "Therefore, This Must Never Be Forgotten"]    [Text] [Ostermann] Eight years after the reactor accident  at Chernobyl, many have done with the maximum credible accident  or take it as a proof that the world also overcomes such  catastrophes. Belarus was among those who suffered most from the  consequences. Is all that already forgotten and over?    [Morkovskiy] Twenty-two percent of our territory is still  radioactively contaminated. One-fifth of the Belarusian  population lives there. An area of the size of your Saarland  cannot be used; 130,000 people were resettled. We had to build  new apartments, outpatients' departments, schools, and whole  cities. The program is being continued. Belarus is spending 12  percent of its state budget on the elimination of the  consequences of Chernobyl. And that is after eight years!    I do not think that one can say that we have forgotten  Chernobyl.    [Ostermann] Nevertheless, many affected persons are  complaining about a lack of support; 45,000 Belarusians are  still living in highly contaminated areas.    [Morkovskiy] Not all of them want to leave. In May 1986,  one week after the catastrophe, I myself organized the first  evacuations in the rural district of Narovlya. At that time, we  were not properly briefed ourselves, and the people did not  believe in the danger and wanted to stay. Then they nailed up  their doors and windows with boards and said: We will come back  in three weeks.    Out of the 320,000 inhabitants of the district, 12,000 still  live there, although half of the district is still part of the  "prohibited zone" with a radiation of more than 15 curie per  square km and everyone has the right to free resettlement. This  also applies to the city of Narovlya itself, where 12,000 people  lived before. Out of the 7,000 inhabitants who stayed there,  only 1,000 applied for resettlement. The others wanted to stay.    [Ostermann] Former helpers after the catastrophe and  radiation victims are threatening a hunger strike, in order to  draw attention to their disastrous situation, among them there  are also Belarusians. Are all of them to blame themselves?    [Morkovskiy] I have not heard anything of that. Perhaps you  are right that the situation is deteriorating. I also belong to  the categories of liquidators. The diseases from which I am  suffering need not come from radiation. They may also be due to  the nervous strain that was so great in all those years. One  looks at oneself and asks oneself: How come? In a poor country  there are many problems, also without Chernobyl.    [Ostermann] Nor can you say that to a mother whose child has  increased levels of radioactive iodine in its thyroid nor to a  person suffering from cancer who has to wait for treatment for  months.    [Morkovskiy] Many things were planned, but the money is  lacking. In 1989, the Soviet Parliament adopted a program for  the elimination of the consequences, but the Soviet Union does  not exist any longer. Today, the means that are available to us  suffice just for a quarter of the planned measures. If we were  to implement everything, we would have to spend half of our  state budget. This would ruin us.    [Ostermann] Does this mean that the other republics  abandoned the program?    [Morkovskiy] Ukraine refrains from helping us in any way,  although an agreement provided for it. Last year, Russia  supported us with 8.5 billion rubles. We bought medicine and  medical equipment with the money.    [Ostermann] Russia and Ukraine have again taken a fancy to  nuclear power. Moscow is planning new nuclear reactors, Kiev  does not switch off Chernobyl despite numerous incidents. What  does Belarus think of it?    [Morkovskiy] If some have the advantages and some the  damage, one comes to different opinions. Two-thirds of the  areas that were contaminated in the Soviet Union at that time  are in Belarus. Chernobyl is in Ukraine and supplies the  Ukrainians with electricity. Our parliament called for the  shutdown of the power plant in a resolution. From our point of  view, this is probably justified.    [Ostermann] Kiev argues that it cannot afford to switch it  off.    [Morkovskiy] Perhaps it is better to be a little afraid than  to die of cold and hunger. This cannot be definitely said,  there are pros and cons. In Belarus the situation is clear: We  do not have nuclear power plants, but we have the consequences  of the Chernobyl catastrophe. And nuclear power plants are  everywhere at our borders -- in Smolensk, Chernobyl, near Rivne  and Ignalina.    [Ostermann] Western experts remembered Chernobyl punctually  on the anniversary of the catastrophe and they are warning  against a new catastrophe. Are you alarmed?    [Morkovskiy] I think that there would not have been an  explosion if rules had not been violated at that time.  Irresponsibility and the violation of norms led to it. However,  I am an agronomist, not a nuclear physicist. There should be  projects that are completely safe. In this way, however, the  danger to the people remains. Therefore, one must never forget  what happened here.</p>

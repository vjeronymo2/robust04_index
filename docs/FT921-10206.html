			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report New York platinum futures were strongly ahead at midday after news that South Africa's Impala Platinum appears to have recently bought metal on world markets to help meet supply needs. In London, platinum prices advanced, but met stiff resistance around Dollars 365 a troy ounce. On the LME the zinc market lost its recent backwardation, cash metal closing Dollars 2.50 a tonne below three-month metal. Dealers said the firmer tone might be due to the apparent easing of tightness on February and the possible return of consumer interest to the market. London cocoa prices again touched fresh five-month lows. 'We have seen persistent selling from a number of trade quarters,' said one dealer. The threat of Ivory Coast sales still hangs over the market, which was under further pressure from a weaker dollar against sterling. New York March arabica moved above 70 cents a lb on short covering by midday after hitting a low of 68.70 in late trade on Wednesday, the cheapest level for a nearby contract since October 1989. Chartists said 68.30 remains a critical support level; a move below there would put the market at 17-year lows. London's freight futures were again in retreat following a 21 point fall in the Baltic Freight Index to 1,372. Compiled from Reuters</p>

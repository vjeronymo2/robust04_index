			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 471] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, April 5, ELTA -- Lithuanian trade unions  attempt to introduce to Lithuania tripartite social agreement  system based on the western patterns. The problems related to  the establishment of the system were discussed at a news  conference on Tuesday [5 April]. Members of the association of  trade unions participated in the news conference.    One of the participants, Roma Dovydeniene, said that social  partnership existed in Lithuania only on the theoretical basis.  According to her, none of 42 international working union  conventions were ratified by Lithuania with the exception of a  few ones which had been ratified before the war.    Trade unions have been seeking that a tripartite agreement  on  the cooperation in the job market should be signed among  employers, Government and trade unions since November, 1993.  According to the participants of the news conference, the  employers -- businessmen and industrialists -- were not ready to  sign such agreement. Thus trade unions consider possibilities  of signing the agreement with Government.    Leaders of the trade unions regretted that Seimas  [parliament] had not approved amendments of the draft law on  trade unions and labour. Trade unions demanded that a certain  procedure should be legalized according to which the employee  could not be dismissed from the job without the approval of  trade unions.    Seimas also rejected the demand that members of trade unions  could not be dismissed from their jobs without the approval of  trade unions. No approval was given to the demand to supplement  the law on trade unions with a provision which would oblige the  employer to allot money for the education and further  qualification of members of trade unions.    So trade unions appealed to the president with the request  not to approve the amendments of the laws on job contract and  trade union.    Dainius Paukste said that estimations showed that trade  unions united 25-30 percent of working people in Lithuania.    The association of the Lithuanian trade unions unites nine  trade unions with 81 thousand members.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Mircea Dascaliuc from Chisinau] </F>   [Text] In accordance with a decree issued by Igor Smirnov,  president of the self-proclaimed Dniester republic, a state of  emergency has been declared in the eastern rayons of the  Republic of Moldova, starting today and to last until 1 March  1994, the Tiraspol correspondent of the Chisinau National Radio  Network reports.    Under the pretext that the Republic of Moldova, after the  introduction of its national currency, has instituted an  economic blockade against Dniester and also invoking the need to  regulate the circulation of their own currency and to balance  the economy, this decree, among other things, prohibits the mass  media from publishing material calling for the forcible  overthrow of the current state and social structures or for  their change, and bans mass demonstrations, which would bring  about tension in the situation in the area.    Similarly, the decree calls on all local executives  unconditionally to observe the legal norms regarding the state  of emergency. Local observers believe that the goal of issuing  this decree is to preserve by all means the current order  created through force of arms and, at the same time, to stop the  population from participating in the future early elections for  the parliament of the Republic of Moldova. As a matter of fact,  during its session yesterday, the Supreme Soviet of the  self-proclaimed Dniester republic issued a special declaration  that the organization of elections and election campaign  propaganda are prohibited throughout the Dniester region.</p>

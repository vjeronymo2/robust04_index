Claims requiring such action will be forwarded to the Commander, USARCS, with an appropriate recommendation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The decision of a settlement or approval authority on a Non-NAFI RIMP claim is final and conclusive and is not subject to reconsideration or appeal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart M_Affirmative Claims <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.213 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Federal statutory authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The Federal Claims Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 3711), as amended by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and Pub. L. 101&hyph;552 (15 November 1990). The Federal Claims Collection Act states that Federal agencies will try to collect all claims of the United States for money or property. Among other things, it provides a basis for agencies to recover for damage to Government property. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Federal Medical Care Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 2651&hyph;53) (hereinafter ``FMCRA''). The FMCRA provides for the recovery of the reasonable value of medical care furnished by the United States on account of injury or disease incurred under circumstances creating tort liability upon some third person. The FMCRA is implemented by EO 11060 and 28 CFR 43; the Federal Claims Collection Standards (DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix M) also apply, as appropriate. However, some procedures appropriate for liquidated debts may not be appropriate for unliquidated claims. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) 10 U.S.C. 1095. 10 U.S.C. 1095 provides authority for military health care facilities to collect the reasonable cost of health care from health insurance and medicare supplemental policies. As amended by Pub. L. 101&hyph;510 (5 November 1990), this statute provides claims offices with additional authority to assert claims against automobile insurers for care provided in an MTF on or after that date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Other authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) State Workers' Compensation laws. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) State hospital lien laws. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Contract rights under terms of insurance policies include medical payment coverage, uninsured and underinsured coverages, and no-fault. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) State automobile no-fault laws. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.214 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Recovery judge advocate/attorney. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) General. A JA or claims attorney (designated per &sect;536.6) assigned responsibility for asserting affirmative claims may be designated as a recovery judge advocate (RJA) or recovery attorney, as appropriate. This designation may be in addition to or in lieu of designation as a claims JA or claims attorney, depending on the local command needs and available personnel. When assertion of affirmative claims is a full-time responsibility of an attorney or JA, the table of distribution and allowances (TDA) position title can also reflect the recovery function. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Designation. (1) The chief of a command claims service, an area claims office, or a claims processing office with approval authority may designate an RJA or recovery attorney for all or part of the area of responsibility assigned to the service or office. All designations will be in writing. A command claims service may withhold designation authority within its area of operations or place reasonable restrictions on such designation by subordinate offices through appropriate command directives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Commander, USARCS will designate RJAs and recovery attorneys for areas not within the responsibility of a command claims service or area claims office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.215 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose and policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) This subpart prescribes procedures for the administrative determination, assertion, collection, settlement, and waiver of claims in favor of the United States for damage to, loss, or destruction of Army property, and for the recovery of the reasonable value of medical care furnished or to be furnished by the United States, under the statutes cited in &sect;536.213. Sound governmental policy in the collection of claims of the United States for money or property requires aggressive agency collection action. Responsible officials within DA will ensure that personnel asserting claims are properly trained and supported to take timely and effective action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The subpart does not apply to the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Claims between Federal agencies. If such a claim cannot be resolved by negotiation, it should be referred to GAO. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Maritime claims under subpart H. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Affirmative actions for nonmonetary relief (for example, evictions, specific performance, and injunctive relief). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Claims arising out of tax aspects of a contract, or other transaction or activity involving either nonappropriated or appropriated funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The senior Judge Advocate of a command having a command claims service, or the commander, USACSEUR, will prescribe procedures for implementing single service claims responsibility under DODD 5155.8 and for implementing any provision in a treaty or international agreement that limits or provides special methods for asserting claims in favor of the U.S. With the concurrence of the Commander, USARCS, the senior JA of a command having a command claims service, or the commander, USACSEUR, is authorized to modify the procedures in this subpart to accommodate special circumstances.

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Shareholder threat to Volvo-Renault deal SWEDEN'S small shareholders' association yesterday stepped up its campaign to block a proposed merger between Volvo's car and truck business and France's Renault, claiming it had won the support of an institutional shareholder. The group, called Aktiespararna, also wrote to Volvo insisting the merger would require a change in the company's articles of association at the November 9 shareholders' meeting on last month's deal, a move that would require two-thirds support instead of the simple majority needed to approve the merger. Mr Lars-Erik Forsgardh, chief executive of Aktiespararna, refused to identify the institution he said was ready to support the association, or how big a share of votes it held. But he said he had received verbal assurances it would give Aktiespararna its proxy votes and added that he was optimistic of winning over more institutional shareholders. However, the association still appears to have the odds against it. Volvo is already assured of support from more than 20 per cent of the voting stock. Aktiespararna said yesterday its members probably held a little less than the 7.7 per cent of votes they controlled when a survey was last conducted three years ago. The largest institutional shareholder, a Swedish state pension fund, holds around 7 per cent. Volvo will today have a chance to press its case further at an annual meeting at its headquarters in Gothenberg of a dozen of its largest shareholders. Apart from Renault, the biggest single shareholder with 8.2 per cent, they include state pension funds, investment companies, bank pension funds and insurance groups. The company said it did not accept that the Renault merger required a change in its articles, saying the terms of the deal were covered under its existing articles.</p>

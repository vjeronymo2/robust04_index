			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Private anxieties On first reading, the omens for France's privatisation programme are encouraging. The Paris equity market stands a shade below the new high reached last month. Money markets are anticipating steady interest rate cuts, albeit at a pace dictated by the Bundesbank. French companies appear enthusiastic participants in alliances engineered by government, such as Saint-Gobain and UAP in the case of BNP, the first on the block. Such cross-holdings will ease the burden on the stock market. But without a system of big funded pension schemes to support privatisation, France must persuade its retail investors to switch savings out of money market instruments into equities. Recently traffic has been in the opposite direction. An appeal to patriotic sentiment helped make a success of the Balladur bond, but that instrument was blessed with a healthy yield. It is difficult to envisage large scale transfers into equities while money market rates remain high. International investors might equally lose faith in French equities if lower interest rates are not seen to be the main ingredient of the policy mix. True, the government has good reasons for not cutting rates while its reserves are depleted, for fear of leaving the franc exposed. The natural assumption is that recession and rising unemployment leave no alternative but to cut rates as fast as the currency allows. The danger is that such an assumption reflects a peculiarly Anglo-Saxon reading of the available options. Yesterday's edict against public sector job cuts, like the revolt against Blair House, underlines that there is more than one way to skin un chat.</p>

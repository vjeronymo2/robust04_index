			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / US Marines in crackdown on Somali gun bazaar US MARINES closed down a big gun bazaar in Mogadishu yesterday, continuing an unofficial policy of arms reduction in the chaotic country. About 900 Marines in armoured vehicles sealed off the sprawling Bakara market, which sprang up after the overthrow of President Mohamed Siad Barre two years ago. 'We have seized a large number of weapons,' said Major Ken Roberts. 'We feel we have taken a significant number of weapons off the streets and out of the market.' The Marines' action came as Somali warlords agreed in Addis Ababa to declare a ceasefire and start stripping their militias of heavy weapons, a move which further strengthened the tentative peace agreement taking shape in the Ethiopian capital. Although the ceasefire is unlikely to end fighting in Somalia - rival gunmen in Mogadishu clashed for about half an hour last night - the agreement could mark a significant step down the long road to peace. At the UN-sponsored talks in Addis Ababa 15 clan-based factions committed themselves to handing over all heavy weapons to a monitoring group, to be composed of UN troops, until a legitimate Somali government is formed. The warlords and faction leaders also agreed to move militias into camps outside the main towns by March 1 in preparation for complete disarmament; to establish a register for all civilian weapons; to free all political prisoners; and return confiscated property to rightful owners. Delegates have already agreed to convene a national reconciliation conference on March 15 which will write a national charter and create an interim assembly and government. Talks were still deadlocked yesterday, however, on who should attend the conference, which will have extraordinary power to chart Somalia's political future, including the thorny issue of choosing an interim president. Diplomats and observers in Addis Ababa say they have sensed a new mood of realism among the warlords in the past five days. They say the warlords are increasingly aware their power, based on monopoly of heavy weapons and food aid, is disintegrating. Intensified efforts by foreign troops at what US officials describe as 'arms reduction,' rather than disarmament which has been publicly ruled out by Washington, have clipped the wings of the militia bosses. Many Somalis, however, have criticised the way the United Nations has allowed the warlords to tie up a deal aimed at preserving their illegitimate power rather than opening up the peace process to clan elders, intellectuals and exiled politicians. They question whether any deal struck by increasingly desperate faction leaders will be able to deliver a lasting solution to the country's woes.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Izetbegovic expects no quick deal BOSNIA'S President Alija Izetbegovic yesterday dismissed hopes of a quick settlement to the 17-month war after the presidents of Serbia and Croatia joined talks on the republic's ethnic partition. 'I do not expect the successful conclusion of negotiations very soon,' he said after almost five hours of meetings with his Serb and Croat adversaries. His remarks came as the Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, and his Croat counterpart, Mr Franjo Tudjman, returned to Geneva to join all-party talks, in a move which was hoped would give fresh impetus to the peace process. Earlier Lord Owen, the international mediator, indicated he was making a final push to broker an accord 'in the next few days' - although he conceded that problems remained over the boundaries of the future partitions. Mr Milosevic left a private meeting with Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, last night calling today 'a very critical day'. Serb sources said Mr Karadzic had offered, with the Croats, to give the Moslems 32 per cent of Bosnian territory, 2 per cent up on the original offer but far short of the 40 per cent Mr Izetbegovic is demanding. The sources also said that Serbs and Croats had ironed out their territorial disputes. Mr Izetbegovic, a Moslem, yesterday repeated that he would refuse to endorse any peace agreement that had not been previously approved by the Bosnian parliament, and demanded that the Serb forces lift their siege round Sarajevo. With the threat of air strikes now receding, a UN spokesman in New York last night emphasised that although the UN now had the capability to use air power, that did not mean such action was imminent. But as a sign of the diplomatic pressure against air strikes, President Boris Yeltsin yesterday took credit for the fact that neither the UN nor Nato had employed force against Serbia and suggested that it might soon be possible to lift sanctions against Serbia. If negotiations were proceeding 'it will be necessary to reconsider the sanctions against Yugoslavia', he said.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE UN EFFORT IN BOSNIA: SOME SUCCESS IN SARAJEVO BUT THE SIEGES SPREAD  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The Bosnian government yesterday called on the UN to open the road to   Mostar, where 35,000 Moslems have been trapped for 100 days by   fighting between Croats and Moslems. For their part, UN officials   reiterated that, without rapid widespread aid, Bosnia could soon face   an even more severe humanitarian crisis. Though the siege of Sarajevo   had been the main focus of attention, UN officials said the biggest   problem now was fighting in central Bosnia. It was little-known   regions such as Maglaj, Jablanica and Mostar that were the new trouble   spots. An official said: 'All over Bosnia there are tiny pockets that the   outside world just doesn't know about. There the humanitarian   conditions are terrible.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SARAJEVO                 This city is now better supplied than many: 16                          air-lifts a day are providing almost all of the                          nearly 5,000 tonnes of food the UN estimates is                          needed each month. Fuel, medical supplies and                          water remain low, but six fuel convoys reached                          the city last week, enabling water pumps to                          start working.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SREBRENICA, GORAZDE      Food convoys are reaching the 60,000 people in   AND ZEPA               the Moslem enclaves of Srebrenica and Zepa,                          surrounded by Serbs. Civilian protesters have                          been blocking some convoys to Gorazde, but air                          drops are providing basic supplies to the                          70,000 there. Srebrenica still faces severe                          water problems, and there is serious                          over-crowding in all three towns.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BANJA LUKA REGION        Conditions in this Serb-held area seem                          relatively stable, although reports suggest                          'ethnic cleansing' continues, with large                          refugee movement. Convoys reach the city                          easily, and a key UN warehouse has been                          established in the city.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TUZLA                    Despite concerns about the largely Moslem                          population, which is partly surrounded by Serb                          forces, food convoys are reaching the area.                          There is a large UN warehouse.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MAGLAJ                   This isolated Moslem enclave has been cut off                          for several weeks by Serbs and Croats. There is                          deep concern about the estimated 40,000 Moslems                          here.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TARCIN AND JABLANICA     Fighting between Croats and Moslems has left                          these Moslem-dominated towns severely short of                          food and water. Despite one food convoy getting                          through recently and some air drops, the                          situation is reported as serious.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MOSTAR                   A Croat offensive has prevented aid from                          reaching the city for 100 days. Its 35,000                          Moslem inhabitants are reportedly becoming                          critically short of food and water. There is                          Red Cross concern about detention camps near                          the city.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- VARES                    The Croat enclave faces severe problems of                          overcrowding: originally supporting some 7,000                          people, it is reported to have more than 20,000                          refugees living in precarious conditions. The                          UN is attempting air drops.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GORNJI VAKUF REGION      Renewed fighting between Moslems and Croats has                          isolated many communities. After UN officials                          were recently attacked, aid groups say the area                          is becoming too dangerous to operate in.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / HK raises investment in airport project TheHong Kong government yesterday decided to invest an extra HKDollars 15bn (Pounds 1.3bn) in the colony's planned new airport and connecting railway in an attempt to defuse the row with China over financing the project. China is worried about thelevel of debt the project has to carry. The extra capital injection takes to HKDollars 60bn the amount of cash the government is prepared to invest in the HKDollars 85bn combined project. It means the debt needed to fund the project will fall to about HKDollars 25bn from the HKDollars 73bn first envisaged at the beginning of 1992. It was unclear if China would accept the government's fourth and latest offer, which will be made formally later this week. Relations between Britain and China are at a low point because of their row over Hong Kong's political development. Having seen the Hong Kong government's preparedness to put more money in the project, Beijing may hold out for more. It claimed only last week there had been a secret deal to restrict the project's debt to HKDollars 5bn. Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, confirmed the new offer after a meeting of his executive council, his top advisory body. But he would not reveal any details except to say it would be put to the Chinese later this week. The governor said he believed the new offer would 'address all the expressed Chinese concerns'. More money had become available for the project because of Hong Kong's healthy financialposition, he added. The airport and its railway are the centrepiece of aHKDollars 160bn integrated transport and urban development project agreed with China in September 1991. Since that date the Hong Kong government and China have been in dispute about how to finance the project. After the government gave itsfirst financial plan to the Chinese in March 1992, Beijing accused it of breaking a 1991 agreement which said the Hong Kong government's debts could not exceedHKDollars 5bn in 1997, the year of the Chinese takeover. The Hong Kong government says that aspect of the agreement was never intended to apply to the borrowings of the corporations building the railway and airport.</p>

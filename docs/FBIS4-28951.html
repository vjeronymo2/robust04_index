			<p>BFN     [Text] According to Japan's NHK broadcast, Ozawa,  representative secretary of Japan Renewal Party, seized upon the  fictitious issue of our nuclear development and made provocative  remarks on a Fuji television broadcast, that the international  community should deal with the issue resolutely, and that Japan  should cooperate naturally if the United Nations adopts a  resolution calling for sanctions. Ozawa went so far as to  openly rave that the Japanese Government should take a series of  steps for sanctions even before the United Nations adopts a  resolution.    This shows how desperately and frantically the Japanese  reactionaries are committed to sanctions against us at the front  of the international alliance led by the United States.    The remarks by Ozawa, which is a grave infringement on our  republic, an independent sovereign state, are an intolerable  criminal act that drives the extremely strained military  situation on the Korean peninsula onto the threshold of war.    The Japanese reactionaries raved about taking the lead in  taking sanctions against us at a time when the International  Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors adopted an absurd  resolution on the suspension of the agency's cooperation with  our country and when the United States and its followers are  persistently attempting sanctions through the United Nations.  This is a very grave development in the situation and proves  that Japan's hostile policy against our republic has reached an  extreme.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Observer: On a limbo in Poland Why is Poland having so much more difficulty than countries like Czechoslovakia and Hungary in keeping its financial institutions of state fully crewed? Karol Lutkowski, Poland's finance minister, is the latest to jump ship following a difference of opinion with the rest of the government on financial policy. But if he hadn't walked the plank, it sounds as if several of his deputies would have. Lutkowski was not an easy man to work with, they say. A permanent replacement for Janusz Sawicki, Poland's official debt supremo who resigned under a cloud last autumn, has still to be found. Across the street at the National Bank of Poland, Grzegorz Wojtowicz - sacked for not preventing the Art B scandal - has still not been replaced. If that were not enough the British government is now pressing the NBP to appoint a Pole as head of the banking supervision department. The present head, Stanislaw Bereza - seconded from Barclays - was only supposed to be a temporary fixture. Little effort seems to have been made to find a replacement and as ever more problems loom in banking, Britain wants its man to adopt a lower profile. The implication is that the plug will be drawn on Bereza's Know-how Fund funding, if the Poles do not start trying to put their house in order.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 27 KYODO -- Japanese Finance Minister  Hirohisa Fujii claimed Sunday that Tokyo has won support from  other Group of Seven (G-7) nations on its measures to boost  domestic demand and open markets.    The largest-ever 15.25 trillion yen pump-primer unveiled  earlier this month and a market-opening package scheduled to be  announced in March have drawn much attention from other members  of the G-7 club, Fujii told a news conference. Financial  officials from these countries placed high expectations that the  measures will help reduce Japan's swollen current account  surplus, Fujii added.    He also said Tokyo has been able to secure G-7 cooperation  in  preventing excessive fluctuations in currency rates.    Fujii flew back from Frankfurt, Germany, where he attended a  meeting Saturday of top finance officials from the seven leading  economic powers.    Referring to talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd  Bentsen  held prior to the G-7 gathering, Fujii said Bentsen listened "in  real earnest" to his explanation on the latest Japanese tax cut  plan designed to boost personal consumption.    Fujii said the media coverage so far made on the six other  G-7 nations' assessment of the Japanese stimulus package does  not accurately reflect "the real atmosphere" of the meeting.    The remark apparently shows his frustration over a barrage  of  newspaper reports that Japan was criticized by its G-7 partners  in the Frankfurt suburb meeting for failing to make sufficient  efforts to boost domestic demand and cut its huge current  account surplus.    Reports also said Japan, despite Fujii's claim first made in  his news conference immediately after the G-7 meeting, was not  able to obtain firm G-7 commitment for taking  currency-stabilizing measures following the yen's renewed surge  against major currencies.    Finance ministers and central bank governors from Britain,  Canada, France, Germany, Italy and the United States appeared to  have "a positive impression" of the latest pump-priming package,  Fujii said.    He also said the G-7 club's shared stance against  "speculative currency moves that may lead to the yen's rapid  appreciation against the dollar" was well echoed in press  remarks made by German Finance Minister Theo Waigel. Summing up  the latest G-7 meeting as its Chairman, Waigel stressed the  continuation among the seven countries of a process in which  they have taken "appropriate" steps to arrest rapid currency  rate movements, Fujii said. But Fujii withheld comment on  whether or not the G-7 has agreed to refrain from currency rate  manipulation.    The yen surged more than 6 yen against the dollar on  speculation over U.S. comments tolerating a stronger yen, which  were widely viewed as manipulation designed to guide the  Japanese currency higher following the February 11 collapse in  Japan-U.S. trade talks.    Fujii dismissed as groundless reports that Japan had been  isolated from other G-7 partners in their latest meeting. News  conferences held by each G-7 country clearly showed "what was  the reality," he said.    Fujii said during his meeting with Bentsen he tried to wipe  out "U.S. misunderstanding" that the 5.85 trillion yen tax cut  envisioned in the stimulus package is a single-year scheme. The  finance minister said he told Bentsen the tax cut is "a first  step toward a more full-fledged tax reform expected to be worked  out by the end of this year."    Fujii also said he briefed Bentsen on the recently  inaugurated coalition council which he said is working toward a  full-scale tax reform in line with the fiscal 1994 tax reform  guideline. But Fujii refrained from saying whether or not  Bentsen was convinced by his explanation.    Fujii said Japan is not considering formulating another  economic package for now. He voiced hope the February 8 package  will become a final one by pulling the Japanese economy out of  its long slump.</p>

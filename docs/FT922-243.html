			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Observer: Turning over Imro As pressure to resign seemingly mounts on George Nissen, chairman of the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation, because of Imro's failure to spot the antics of Robert Maxwell, the whole future of the investment watchdog could be affected. The embattled self-regulating organisation is currently fighting a plan for Imro to lose a chunk of its membership list to the new Personal Investment Authority which is to be formed out of two other SROs, Lautro and Fimbra. This could make it a tricky time to lose Nissen. There is something of a lame duck air too about Imro's chief executive John Morgan, who has already announced his intention to retire in 1993. Nissen, a former senior partner of stockbrokers Pember &amp; Boyle, one-time big wheels in the gilts market, is said to have been 'a superb committee man' in the old Stock Exchange. But both Nissen and Morgan are over 60 and made their reputations in a less dangerous environment. The new chief executive, according to the recent recruitment ad for the post, should be 'a leader with diplomatic skills'. It would have taken much more than diplomacy to stop Maxwell, however valuable such skills might be in the boardrooms of the blueblooded accepting houses which dreamed up Imro in the first place.</p>

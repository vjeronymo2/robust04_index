			<p>930723 FT  23 JUL 93 / AT&amp;T shakes up its top management AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US communications giant, yesterday shook up its top management structure to position itself better for global expansion and the convergence of the telecommunications, computer and media industries. The restructuring centres on the creation of a seven-member global operations team, responsible for running AT&amp;T's businesses worldwide. It will be chaired by Mr Victor Pelson, 56, who was the head of telecommunications services. He will also become a member of the AT&amp;T board. The team, which may be enlarged later, replaces a five-person operations committee, chairmanship of which rotated among the heads of AT&amp;T's business lines. Mr Robert Allen, chairman, wants 50 per cent of AT&amp;T's revenues to come from abroad by the end of the decade, compared with 25 per cent now. He said the aim of the moves was to 'globalise the business more quickly and take advantage of new market opportunities' from industrial convergence. Mr William Marx, 54, who heads AT&amp;T Network Systems business, will take on additional responsibilities for AT&amp;T's worldwide purchasing and global manufacturing planning. The restructuring gives new responsibilities to three executives regarded as possibilities to succeed Mr Allen. They are Mr Alex Mandl, 49, chief financial officer who moves to head communications services; Mr Robert Kavner, 50, who will lead the multi-media products and services group; and Mr Jerre Stead, 50, head of the group's NCR computer business.

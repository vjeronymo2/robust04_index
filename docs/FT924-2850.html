			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / International Bonds: Eurodollar market continues to attract investors THE Eurodollar bond market remained the focus of attention yesterday as several new issues met strong demand from investors bullish on the currency. The two tranches of Citicorp's Dollars 2bn global offering of credit card-backed securities, launched on Tuesday, were priced in line with expectations. The margin on the Dollars 1bn two-year portion, demand for which was described by Citibank as overwhelming, was set at 15 basis points over three-month Libor, and the notes were priced to give an effective yield of 18.75 basis points. The Dollars 1bn of five-year notes, with a margin of 30 basis points, were priced to yield 32 basis points. To meet rating agency requirements, the credit is further backed by issues of junior notes and cash collateral amounting to Dollars 78.2m and Dollars 72.8m respectively for the two-year paper, and Dollars 102m and Dollars 77.14m for the five-year paper. This is Citicorp's second issue of floating rate notes backed by credit card receivables this year, and completes its Dollars 5bn securitisation programme for 1992. Strong demand was reported for Ciba-Geigy's Dollars 200m, five-year Eurobond issue through Credit Suisse First Boston. Dealers said there is European demand for three to five-year paper and this, from a quality retail name, fitted the bill perfectly. The 45 basis point spread tightened to 35 basis points by the close. Lehman Brothers International said Abbey National's Dollars 100m one-year floating rate issue under its medium-term note programme was priced generously compared with commercial paper, at  1/8 point below three-month Libor, as it was important that the borrower's first appearance in the international capital markets since Moody's Investors Service downgraded its debt to Aa2 be seen as a success. IKB Deutsche Industriebank reopened an existing Fl 200m 10-year issue to meet existing demand, said lead manager Rabobank Nederland. The second tranche of Fl 75m, which brings the total raised to Fl 275m, was priced at a spread of 50 basis points over comparable Dutch government bonds. This compares with 55 basis points on the original issue which, said Rabobank, marked the issuer's first borrowing in the sector.</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / EC backs phone charges reform EC telecommunications ministers yesterday laid the foundations for opening ordinary telephone calls to competition by January 1 1998. Ministers voiced their general support for the 1998 deadline for liberalisation of domestic and international telephone calls, as laid out in European Commission proposals published last month. But there was less enthusiasm for the possibility of allowing rival networks to compete by exploiting existing infrastructure or building new networks. The ministers also reached agreement on a technical directive which will harmonise conditions for companies which want to use telecoms networks to provide voice services and lay out users' rights of access. The directive on so-called 'open network provision' (ONP) for voice telephony is a prerequisite for further liberalisation of telephone calls. On the wider liberalisation proposals, a number of member states - Greece, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Ireland - said they would need more than five years to improve their own networks. The Commission has suggested that countries with particular difficulties could be granted a two-year extension of the deadline. The speed of liberalisation will be the main battleground when ministers begin in-depth discussions on the timetable at their next scheduled meeting on June 16. Britain, which wants swift liberalisation, said slow progress would hamper European industry. 'The date of 1998 is already too long and certainly anything beyond that is out of the question,' said one UK official yesterday. However, Britain welcomed the more flexible attitude of the new French coalition government. Paris has now given broad backing to the Commission's proposals, while calling for the Community to create favourable conditions for private innovation in the sector.</p>

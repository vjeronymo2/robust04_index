			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICERS START SHOPPING EARLY FOR DRUNK DRIVERS  </P> <P> The Santa Ana Police Department and the California Highway Patrol began the  Christmas season this weekend with the first in a series of sobriety  checkpoints designed to make holiday revelers think twice about drinking and  driving.  </P> <P> Santa Ana police opened their first checkpoint of the season Friday night at  McFadden and Standard avenues, Police Sgt. Bob Clark said.  </P> <P> That checkpoint resulted in 28 arrests and confiscation of 46 vehicles, Clark  said. He could not explain the discrepancy between the number of cars  confiscated and the number of suspected drunk drivers arrested.  </P> <P> Clark said the city's first sobriety checkpoint of the holiday season was  welcomed by local businesses and residents, who watched the checkpoints from  nearby stores and sidewalks.  </P> <P> "The crowds at the scene were very supportive of the checkpoint," Clark said.  </P> <P> Another Santa Ana checkpoint was set up in Santa Ana at 7 p.m. Saturday in the  1600 block of West 1st Street.  </P> <P> In South County, the California Highway Patrol set up a checkpoint Saturday  night at El Toro and Jeronimo roads in El Toro.  </P> <P> CHP officer Ken Daily said he hopes that knowledge of the checkpoints will  prompt a decrease in drinking and driving. "The message is, if they're going to  a party, they should make alternative travel plans," he said.  </P> <P> No information was available late Saturday on the number of cars stopped or the  number of drivers arrested at the El Toro and 1st Street checkpoints.  </P></p>

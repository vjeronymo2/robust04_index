			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] UN envoy to Yemen Lakhdar Brahimi arrived in  Amman early this morning after holding intensive contacts on the  Yemeni crisis with the involved parties and with a number of  regional leaders over the past two days. Meanwhile, the Yemeni  Government announced its categorical rejection of the  secessionist leadership's proposal to dispatch international  observers to monitor a cease-fire in Yemen. More details in the  following report:    In an arrival statement in Amman, Brahimi said that talks  now  focus on a proposed working mechanism for the Yemenis to agree  on to entrench a cease-fire, in addition to many proposed ideas.  He noted that there is another proposal to activate the work of  the joint military committee, adding that both parties agreed to  it. However, he said, no agreement has been reached so far on  the nature of the committee's work or its formation, expressing  his belief that there are no differences over the participation  of Jordan and Oman in this committee. Brahimi said: Both  parties to the conflict agreed on the Security Council  resolution, a cease-fire, and the principle of dialogue. He  added that the United Nations supports any agreement between the  two parties. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 18 TASS -- "The signing of an agreement  on civic peace and accord will take place on April 28 in the St.  George hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace," Russian presidential  chief of staff Sergey Filatov said on Monday. In an interview  with ITAR-TASS, Filatov said that the agreement will be signed  by President Boris Yeltsin, the government, leaders of the State  Duma and the Federation Council, and representatives of trade  unions, the presidential public chamber, religious organisations  and political movements.    "The agreement will remain open to all who may wish to sign  it," Filatov added. A special conciliatory commission which  will comprise "representatives of the president, the government,  political parties and public movements" will oversee the  implementation of the agreement. Filatov believes that the  commission should use the experience of the mass media court.    He said there is no need to adopt the agreement on civic  peace and accord as a federal law, but added that the parties to  it may face possible consequences if they violate the agreement.</p>

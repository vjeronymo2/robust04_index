			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Reuters lifts sales 25% in quarter Shares in Reuters Holdings rose by 30p to 477p after the financial information and news group said its third quarter revenues rose 25 per cent to Pounds 590m. For the first nine months, sales grew by 23 per cent to Pounds 1.68bn, with no material impact from exchange rate movements. Reuters, which started giving quarterly statements this year, does not give profit figures. Mr Peter Job, chief executive, said: 'Revenue continued to forge ahead reflecting good business conditions as well as recent acquisitions. New order rates for information products, though below the recent peaks we have seen, were brisk. 'Electronic transaction products for the financial markets continued to be the fastest growing part of the business.' Acquisitions added Pounds 42m to revenue in the third quarter and Pounds 97m in the nine months. Excluding acquisitions made since the beginning of 1993, revenue growth was 17 per cent for the quarter and 16 per cent for the nine months. Sales growth by Instinet, the US-based equity brokerage service, and Thamesway - the institutional broker acquired last November - contributed to a 37 per cent rise to Pounds 138m in the quarter's overall transaction product revenue. Information management systems for dealing rooms increased sales 87 per cent in the quarter, and over the nine months this product line's sales more than doubled to Pounds 82m. This contributed to a rise of 20 per cent, to Pounds 1.19bn, in information products' revenue so far this year.</p>

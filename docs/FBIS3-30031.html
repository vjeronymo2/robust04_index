			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The finance minister, Dr. Richard Hu, today  announced the budget, which includes one of tax rebates on  personal income tax and the higher interest rates for CPF  [Central Provident Fund] retirement and special accounts. Also  additional rebates for service and conservancy and rental  charges. For businesses, it is a mixed budget. The property  tax will be reduced, but there will be an increase in employers'  CPF rates and in the salary ceilings for the skill development  fund levy.    Presenting his budget statement in Parliament, Dr. Hu said  the better-than-expected growth last year yielded a healthy  budget surplus. This strong fiscal position gives the  government scope to pass part of the surplus back to the economy  and to enhance the assets of citizens.    For individuals, [words indistinct] one of rebates of 5  percent on income tax for year of assessment 1994 and on top of  the GST [Goods and Services Tax] rebates announced last year,  there will be additional rebates on HDB [Housing and Development  Board] service and conservancy charges and rentals. This will  raise from [Singapore dollars] $40.50 to $76.50. The rebates  will take effect from 1 April.    The government will also be paying a higher interest rate  for  savings in the CPF retirement and the special accounts. From 1  July next year, the rates will be one and one-quarter point  above the normal CPF interest rates. Details will be announced  by the labor minister later.    There also will be another share ownership corporate scheme  to help Singaporeans build up CPF savings to buy shares in the  next major privatization exercise two years from now. Every CPF  member above 21 years will get $300 from the government. But  the employer must contribute at least $750 during an 18-month  qualifying period starting from the first of next month. There  will be a prorated contribution for those who put in less than  $750 and to help some taxpayers to enjoy (?proration) incentives  and extension of the claim period. The claim period for the  special and further tax rebates will be extended by two years to  nine years. This will take effect from year of assessment 1994.    For companies, the property tax rates for industrial and  commercial properties will be cut by 1 percent each point to 15  percent from 1 July. The intention is to allow the rates in  stages to 12 percent over the next 45 years. The cut also  applies to residential property rented out. The concessionary  tax rates for owned and occupied residential property will  remain unchanged, and also there will be tax incentives to  promote the growth of international derivative trading and  arbitrage activities and trading of regional securities.    From assessment year 1995, the Asian Currency Unit -- the  ACU  -- and approved securities companies -- ASC scheme -- will be  expanded to include foreign securities lending and borrowing.  They will enjoy concessionary tax rates of 10 percent on income  derived from lending and borrowing foreign securities with  another ACU, ASC, or non-resident persons. The concession will  also apply to income derived by approved fund managers who are  arranging such transactions on behalf of foreign investors.    There will be no tax on securities lending fees,  (?manifested) dividend, and interest paid by the ACU or ASC to a  nonresident person who doesn't have a permanent establishment  here. Also, no stamp duties on documents executed under sale  and agreement in respect to such securities lending and the  borrowing activities.    Dr. Hu also announced the 10-percent concessionary tax rates  on income derived from stock and physical trading in silver and  platinum with approved parties. And to promote Singapore as a  regional securities trading and fund management center,  transactions of ACU and ASC and non-Singapore dollar securities  with approved fund managers will also get a 10-percent tax  concession. But only transactions involving funds managed for  foreign investors by such fund managers will qualify. These  transactions will also be exempted from contract note stamp  duties.    Also to be exempted from tax, income derived by ASC from  approved syndicated offshore credit and underwriting facilities.  The aim is to further enhance Singapore's position as a leading  syndication center in Asia.    Dr. Hu also announced enhancement to foreign centers  introduced to promote the development of the manufacturing and  services sectors. It is to make it more attractive for  companies to expand after the initial incentive period. The  initial tax relief period for the expansion of established  enterprises, expanding service companies and centers, export of  services and warehousing, and servicing incentives is now five  years or shorter. This will be extended to not more than 10  years. But, further extension would be allowed [words  indistinct] not more than five years. This will be subject to a  maximum relief of 20 years for incentives.    The minister also disclosed that to nullify the effects of  GST, import duty on cars will be 41 percent from 1 April; duty  on taxis 17 percent and on motorcycles 12 percent. Also to  offset GST, excise duties on leaded and unleaded petrol will be  cut. (?And) duties on kerosene, lubricating oil, liquified  petroleum gas, and aviation (?fuel) will be suspended. To meet  GATT requirements, import duties on cigarettes, tobacco, liquor,  and motor vehicles will be converted to excise duties from 1  July, but the tax burden remains unchanged.    Dr. Hu also announced changes to the CPF contribution rates  for employers and employees as well as on the salary ceilings  for skill development levy. From 1 July, employers' CPF  contribution will go up by 1.5 percentage point to 20 percent.  That for employees will be reduced by the same amount to 20  percent. Dr. Hu said the government is making a final 1.5  percent point adjustment to the CPF contribution rates in view  of the continued growth of the economy. He said employers and  employees should take this adjustment into account in the wage  negotiations.    On worker training, Dr. Hu told Parliament that skill  development fund [SDF] in financial year 92 disbursed more than  $50 million for training programs. This is much more than the  $50 million collected through the skill development levy that  year. Dr. Hu said at the present SDF disbursement level, the  fund will eventually be depleted. The government has,  therefore, decided to revise the salary ceilings for skill  development levy collection from $750 to $1,000 from financial  year 95. But the levy rate will remain at 1 percent.    He also announced more for edusave [education savings] and  medifund [medical fund]. Dr. Hu said in good years it is  essential we accumulate surpluses to save in time of crises and  to secure investor confidence in our future. (?This) will also  allow us to build up the assets of Singaporeans. In this  regard, he said the financial year 93 edusave contribution will  be increased to $1 billion. For financial year 94, another $500  million will be put into edusave and $100 million into medifund.    Dr. Hu also announced the setting up of the pension fund for  public officers. He said it is a good health-keeping practice  for the government to recognize pensions as a future liability  and to provide for it. He said civil servants should not spend  their retirement in fear that the government can't pay their  pensions when times are bad.    The government's total expenditure in financial year 94 is  expected to reach $16.7 billion, up 19 percent from financial  year 93. As in previous years, social and community services  will take the largest share at nearly 40 percent with more than  half of it for education. The second largest share at 32  percent will be taken by national security, including defense  and home affairs.    Dr. Hu said Singapore today is at a turning point. We have  become a newly industrialized economy and are on the threshold  of the first league of nations. But Singaporeans must not relax  and take progress and prosperity for granted. The challenge is  how to collectively manage to leap into the ranks of the first  league.    The finance minister notes Singaporeans have achieved much  in  the last 20 years due to sound economic management by the  government and the hard work of the people. These things must  continue as we strive to gain promotion into the first league.    Concluding, Dr. Hu said the world economy is expected to  perform better in 1994. The signs are optimistic. The U.S.  economic expansion will remain strong. After last year's dismal  performance, this year's outlook in Western Europe is  comparatively brighter and Japan's is also expected to improve  this year.    Dr. Hu noted that the expanding economies of Asia will lead  the pack. Singapore can prosper and grow together with our  neighbors anf trading partners if we remain competitive and  productive. He is confident we can achieve if we continue to  price diligence, assets, and enterprise above luck and quick  gains.</p>

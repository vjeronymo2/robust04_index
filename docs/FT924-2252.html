			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / The Week Ahead RESULTS DUE ASDA, the grocery chain, announces its interim results on Friday and is forecast to increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.1m to between Pounds 30m and Pounds 40m, with most estimates around the Pounds 35m mark. Analysts expect the improvement to be due to the reduction in debt and increase in interest receivable thanks to Asda's Pounds 350m rights issue last year, rather than an improvement in trading. The operating profit is expected to be little changed. The considerable efforts of the new management team led by Mr Archie Norman will take a while longer to pay off. H P Bulmer Holdings, the premium cider and drinks group, is set on Wednesday for a 20 per cent jump in pre-tax profits in the six months to October 31. Analysts put interim profits at about Pounds 10.7m compared with Pounds 9.07m last year, with the dividend likely to be increased 10 per cent to 3.8p (3.45p). Devenish, the west country pub retailer, is expected to report a 16 per cent rise in full year pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.3m on Thursday. Pubs suffered from poor tourist trade in the first half but the second half has been helped by acquisitions. Tiphook, the trailer and container rental group, is expected to report today a decline in interim pre-tax profits to around Pounds 35m from Pounds 39.2m. Slower economies across Europe have taken their toll. However, the group is likely to lift its dividend by about 10 per cent from 4.4p a share a year earlier. Southern Electric is reporting its delayed interim figures tomorrow. It had postponed them until after its chairman had testified to the House of Commons on coal. Its pre-tax profits are likely to rise by about 30 per cent to around Pounds 18m. Daily Mail and General Trust should unveil on Wednesday a modest increase in full year profits to around Pounds 50m from Pounds 47.7m. Advertising markets have been weak, particularly for the Evening Standard's classified jobs. Electronic Data Processing, the computer services supplier, is expected to report today full year profits of about Pounds 4.8m, up only modestly from Pounds 4.1m a year earlier. Ferranti International, the electronics group brought to its knees by its disastrous acquisition of ISC in the US, reports interim results tomorrow.

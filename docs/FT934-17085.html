			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Lufthansa to form link with United Airlines LUFTHANSA of Germany and United Airlines of the US are to form a partnership that will link two of the world's biggest airline networks. The far-reaching co-operation agreement the two companies will announce in Frankfurt on Monday is expected to increase the growing consolidation of the international airline industry. The Lufthansa-United deal will follow a series of other transatlantic partnerships, including British Airways' acquisition of a 24 per cent stake in USAir; a recent co-operation agreement between Air France and Continental; cross-shareholdings between Swissair and Delta Air Lines; and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines' partnership with Northwest Airlines. Although the Lufthansa-United partnership is not expected to involve an equity swap, it will include ticket code-sharing, allowing the two carriers access to each other's extensive route networks. The deal is expected to include collaboration on frequent-flyer programmes and the sharing of airport facilities. Lufthansa and United had been scouting for a big transatlantic partnership to strengthen the global reach of their respective airlines. United and BA unsuccessfully attempted an alliance four years ago, while Lufthansa had negotiated with USAir before the American carrier decided to link up with BA. Lufthansa had during the past six months been negotiating an alliance with either United or American Airlines. The US and German governments signed a bilateral aviation agreement last week after lengthy negotiations, clearing the way for a partnership between Lufthansa and a US carrier. Lufthansa, with a total fleet of 226 aircraft, will now have access to the 200 US domestic cities served by United, the second-largest US carrier after American Airlines. With a fleet of 550 aircraft, United is also the biggest international US carrier, with a network serving 33 countries in five continents. It has recently negotiated co-operation agreements with Emirates, the Dubai airline, and British Midland, the UK carrier, and has been actively expanding in Europe. It is the biggest US carrier serving London Heathrow airport after taking over the former Pan Am routes. The Lufthansa-United deal is expected further to step up competition on North Atlantic services, as well as to accelerate efforts by Swissair, Scandinavian Airlines System, KLM and Austrian Airlines to merge their operations to form a 'fourth force' in the European airline industry to compete against the big three - Lufthansa, BA and Air France. Swissair said in a statement yesterday that the four airlines might sign an agreement in the next few weeks, although there were still difficulties on some issues, including a partnership with one or more US airlines. Austrian also confirmed that it had not decided whether to opt for the four-airline partnership or to co-operate with Lufthansa, which has been actively courting the Austrian carrier.

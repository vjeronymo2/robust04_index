"I hope that results are achieved at the forthcoming  negotiations. It would be unfortunate if this were to delay the  negotiations and the parliamentary scrutiny within the EU."    He is, however, counting on Finland being able to become a  member at the beginning of next year, despite the tight  timetable.    At this his first news conference as president of the  Republic, the president made it clear that he is satisfied with  the result achieved in the negotiations with the EU.    He is not surprised, however, that Finland's national  support  for agriculture has become a domestic bone of contention. He  thinks that first the government must reach agreement on this  support, perhaps at some time in May, and then hold negotiations  with the opposition.    "I really hope that we can reach national agreement on this  support," he said and did not rule out some sort of package  solution, in line with what the Social Democrats have proposed,  such as tax cuts.    "I am very sure that there will be some other elements too.  It remains to be seen what a solution will contain. I do not  want to interfere in the debate, but I hope that there will be a  reasonable agreement."    The president promised to follow developments patiently as  the government forms a view about this national domestic support  and then negotiates with the opposition. He has not envisaged  any involvement in the negotiations.    President Ahtisaari thinks it neither appropriate nor  necessary that the referendums in Finland, Sweden, and Norway  should be arranged and held simultaneously.    "The only condition that I think must be met is that we have  sufficient time for a debate."    In the talks the president has held with the prime minister,  September has so far been the date under consideration.    He argued that Sweden and Norway did not enquire in advance  whether Finland was intending to seek membership.    "But it is always possible to speculate about what effect it  would have if we voted first."    Martti Ahtisaari said that national unity must be taken into  consideration when the date of the consultative referendum is  fixed.    It is the president's unambiguous view that the consultative  referendum binds the Eduskunta morally, but he knows that in  practice things do not have to happen like this.    "Each Eduskunta deputy will of course reach his own  individual decision."    Something else that has still not been decided is whether  the  president or the prime minister will represent Finland at the  EU's summit meetings. That is why it is also unclear whether  Ahtisaari will take part in the EU summit on Corfu in June.  [passage omitted]</p>

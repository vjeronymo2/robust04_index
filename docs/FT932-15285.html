			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: CGIP slips to FFr542m and plans FFr1bn disposal CGIP, the French holding company which recently raised its stake in the CarnaudMetalBox packaging group, yesterday announced a fall in net profits to FFr542m (Dollars 100.3m) last year from FFr672m in 1991 and disclosed plans to sell peripheral interests to finance the CarnaudMetalBox deal. Mr Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, chairman, said the group hoped to raise just over FFr1bn, the money it had spent on its new CarnaudMetalBox shares. He said the proposed disposals would include CGIP's remaining 2 per cent stake in the Valeo industrial group together with property in the Netherlands. CGIP, which owns 25.3 per cent of CarnaudMetalBox, announced earlier this month that it was buying an additional 7 per cent holding, the maximum allowed by the French stock market authorities. It bought the shares from MB-Caradon, the UK building products group which was selling its entire 25.3 per cent stake. The other shares have been bought by a consortium of investors allied to CGIP. CGIP funded the CarnaudMetalBox transaction with its FFr650m cash balance and FFr450m provided by Orange-Nassau, its Dutch subsidiary. Mr Seilliere said it was not essential that the group should recover the whole cost of the deal, but that it did hope to rebuild finances. CarnaudMetalBox was one of the best performers within the CGIP group last year. Mr Seilliere said it made a healthy increase in its contribution to the group. Cedest, the cement company, was stable and Bio Participations, its medical business, suffered a slight fall in profits. However, CGIP was hit by a sharp reduction of FFr140m in the contribution from Sogeti, the French computer services company, which fell into the red last year, thereby triggering the overall fall in group net profits. Mr Seilliere said the outlook for 1993 was very uncertain. CGIP budgeted for a modest increase in profits this year but, he said, the first few months had been very difficult. He said the group's chances of returning to profits growth would be determined by the prospects for the second half of the year.</p>

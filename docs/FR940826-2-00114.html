The affirmative notice regarding application was published in the Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 15, 1994 (59 FR 41795). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The workers produced coal which was used to make coke for steelmaking operations. Worker separations occurred in 1993 and 1994. The mine closed in March 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On reconsideration the Department contacted Sunnyside's major customer of coal. The customer reported using Sunnyside's coal to make coke. This process involves baking the coal, not burning or consuming it as fuel. The baking process releases all the volatiles, leaving a residue called coke which is used in steelmaking operations. New findings on reconsideration show that Sunnyside's major customer increased its imports of coke in the period relative to the petition while ceasing its purchases of coal from Sunnyside. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Departmental regulations at 29 CFR 90.2 state that an imported article is like or directly competitive with a domestic article at an earlier or later stage of production and a domestic article is like or directly competitive with an imported article at an earlier or later stage of production, if the importation of the article has an economic effect on the producers of the domestic article comparable to the effect of importing the article in the same stage of production as the domestic article. Accordingly, imported coke is directly competitive with domestically-produced coal in that coking is a later stage in the processing of coal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that the former workers of the Sunnyside Coal Company in Sunnyside, Utah were adversely affected by increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with coal produced at the Sunnyside Coal Company in Sunnyside, Utah. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> All workers of Sunnyside Coal Company, Sunnyside, Utah who became totally or partially from employment on or after March 24, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Signed at Washington, DC, this 18th day of August 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Richard Gilliland, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Director, Office of Program Management, Unemployment Insurance Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21111 Filed 8&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JUDGE MAY CUT AWARD TO HUDSON'S LOVER  </P> <P> The judge in the landmark AIDS lawsuit of Rock Hudson's lover said today there  is significant evidence supporting a jury's decision that Hudson was guilty of  outrageous conduct for hiding his AIDS diagnosis, but he said he will consider  lowering the award.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Bruce Geernaert, launching a critical hearing to review  the jury's decision, said he is inclined to deny a motion from the Hudson  estate to throw out the verdict.  </P> <P> But he said he will give lengthy consideration to motions asking that the  jury's $21.75-million award to Marc Christian be reduced.  </P> <P> "There is significant evidence supporting the jury's verdict," the judge said.  But he added there were also significant points raised on the question of  whether the financial award is excessive and whether jurors were guilty of  misconduct in deciding the monetary figure.  </P> <P> "The motions are lengthy, and they raise significant points," Geernaert said.  "We will take whatever time is necessary."  </P> <P> He also said he will consider a claim that new evidence has arisen involving  sexual accusations against Christian by a man who came forward after the  verdict was announced.  </P> <P> Christian's lawyer, Harold Rhoden, had indicated before the hearing began that  he might be willing to accept less than the full jury award. Rhoden said he  would not be surprised if Geernaert reduced the award, which was considered  excessive in some legal circles.  </P></p>

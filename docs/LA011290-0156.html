John Buchholz.  </P> <P> A man brandishing a handgun entered the Security Pacific Bank branch in the 200  block of South Beach Boulevard around 10:20 a.m., announced the robbery, and  ordered a teller to stuff an envelope with cash, Buchholz said.  </P> <P> The man then dashed out of the bank and jumped into a black 1976 Volkswagen  beetle driven by a young woman, Buchholz said.  </P> <P> Buchholz said officers recovered $1,300 in cash that the suspect dropped as he  fled.  </P> <P> West Covina police saw a car matching the getaway vehicle's description parked  in front of a residence and arrested the two suspects without incident,  Buchholz said. They were turned over to La Habra police.  </P> <P> Buchholz said that when police made the arrests they found an additional $700  that they believe came from the bank.  </P> <P> Alvarado was arrested on suspicion of armed robbery and was being held at  Orange County Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail. Buchholz added that there was also  a no-bail hold on the West Covina man for a parole violation.  </P> <P> The 17-year-old was arrested on suspicion of robbery and was being detained at  Juvenile Hall.  </P></p>

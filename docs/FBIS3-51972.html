[Begin recording] [Pachano] Gustavo Roosen also said  President-elect Rafael Caldera's team of advisers has advised  him of Petroven's budget for next year and its guidelines.  Roosen pointed out that he fully approves of the plans our main  oil company will execute.    [Roosen] In fact, Caldera's adviser Julio Cesar Rodriguez  attended the 30 December meeting, and we have met several times  since that meeting. He fully approves of the budget guidelines.  He also told me he approves of the 10-year plan, which  encompasses all the objectives to significantly increase the  supply of oil products.    In fact, as a multifaceted company, about 75 percent of our  total sales, including cyclical sales, consist of oil products,  and only 25 percent consist of crude oil sales. Since 1982,  Petroven has been replacing crude oil exports for oil product  exports in international markets. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian and U.S. military exercises of the  peace-making forces at Totskiy in Orenburg Oblast will be held  this summer. The presidents of the two countries made this  decision, and it will probably not be changed. Colonel General  Eduard Vorobyev, first deputy commander in chief of ground  forces, told this to an ITAR-TASS correspondent. According to  Vorobyev, preparation for the exercise is under way in  conformity with the schedule. About 250 men will participate,  one company from each side. Use of military technology and  shooting are not included in the plans for the exercise. Gen.  Vorobyev stressed: We do not intend to use a single fragment of  force. Each side in the exercise will do its service in the  relevant zone.</p>

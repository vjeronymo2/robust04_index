			<p>BFN     [Text] The plunge of the U.S. dollar to a post-war low  against the yen yesterday will not adversely affect Thailand's  exports, a key factor driving the country's economy, Finance  Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin said yesterday.    However, as the greenback dominates the basket of currencies  used by the Exchange Equalization Fund in fixing the daily  exchange rate, the baht has depreciated in value in line with  the dollar, Mr. Tharin said.    "That will benefit the country in its trade with Japan and  Europe although Thai trade in terms of U.S. dollars will be  affected," he said.    The dollar's dive to 99.50 yen in yesterday morning's trade  in Asian markets, coupled with political disarray in Japan,  shook the stock market with the key Nikkei index plunging more  than 460 points. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell more than 230  points.    Although it was estimated that the Bank of Japan had spent  more than U.S.$1 billion in frantically buying dollars to stop  the slide, it was able to shore up the dollar only slightly to  close at 99.93 yen.    In Thailand, despite a positive mood caused by the acquittal  of major market player Song Watcharasirot on share manipulation  charges, the SET failed to escape, the index falling more than  37 points.    Mr. Tharin forecast that the baht would be stable in a short  period.    The dollar's dive began last Tuesday and it dipped below 100  yen for the first time since the end of World War Two.    The depreciation of the dollar against the yen stemmed from  a  failure by the U.S. and Japan to resolve trade deficits in  February and the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata on Saturday.    The U.S. Federal Reserve and other leading central banks of  19 countries, such as Japan, Germany and Switzerland, failed to  take proper action to prop up the dollar until Friday, which was  too late.    Investors no longer see the need to hold dollars as the U.S.  has lost some appeal. The economies of Japan and Germany are  recovering and interest rates in both countries are moving  upward. For example, the Japanese economy recorded 3.9 percent  growth in the first quarter of this year.    Mr. Tharin said the Exchange Equalization Fund would keep  close watch on the foreign exchange situation and the central  bank was maintaining sound liquidity.    Arun Chirachawala, Bangkok Bank's senior vice president for  finance and marketing, said the U.S. Federal Reserve was  expected to increase its rates to stabilize the dollar and that  could force local rates to increase too.    But such a move could hamper the recovery of the U.S.  economy  in the long run.    Another option for the Fed was to do nothing and let the  dollar fall until a balance was reached, he said.    The volatility of both currencies and the German mark has  prompted investors to sell shares, driving down markets in  several countries including the U.S., Japan, Hong Kong and  Thailand, Mr. Arun said.    He insisted the declining dollar and other external factors,  not the acquittal of Sia [tycoon] Song, were responsible for the  marked drop in the Thai market.    "The exchange rate of the dollar, yen, and mark may tend to  fluctuate further. The dollar has reached an alarming level of  1.57 marks and 99.5 yen and is likely to run downhill steadily  as long as no intervention is applied," Mr. Arun said.    "If the Fed raises its rates, Thai rates might rise  unavoidably. Deposits are expanding at a much slower pace than  credit and tend to cluster in certain banks instead of averaging  throughout the financial system.    "During the latter half of this year, interest rates might  rise but at a slower and less dramatic rate than experienced in  the first half," he said.</p>

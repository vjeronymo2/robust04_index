"It is a waste and totally  unnecessary. No trading company here is going to present their  accounts like this," it quoted a businessman as saying.    The Finance Ministry has recently announced that the French  system would be the official accounting system to be used by  local and foreign companies. Under the former government, there  was no centralised tax collection system. [passage omitted]    The main difference between the French and  Anglo-international system is the way assets and liabilities are  classified and how depreciation is treated, an investment  consultant said.    The decision has brought about protest from local companies  who claim that their accounts will have to be double-booked in  two systems, new software and the retraining of current  accounting staff. At the most, eight to 10 companies, which are  all French, will benefit from this system while the others will  suffer. A businessman has predicted widespread chaos in the  local business community as Singapore, Taiwanese and Hong  Kong-based companies, the biggest investors here, are only  familiar with the Anglo international accounting system.  [passage omitted]    The decision to adopt a French accounting system follows a  dispute last year over the decision to retain French as the  country's second language. Students had protested against this  move at the University of Technology as they claimed that  English was being widely accepted here, especially amongst the  business community and that English, not French, would benefit  them better.</p>

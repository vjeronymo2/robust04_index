			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev 29 June TASS -- "The progress of elections  forces me to make the conclusion that the Central Election  Committee, the state-run broadcasting and other mass media,  especially the parliamentary newspaper GOLOS UKRAINY, blatantly  disregard the law on presidential elections, as well as  parliament's resolution guaranteeing equal opportunities for  electioneering and campaigning", presidential nominee Leonid  Kuchma said on Wednesday [29 June] in an address to Ukraine's  parliament.    According to former Prime Minister Kuchma, "for the past  month, Ukraine's national television has been virtually  transformed into daily air time of one presidential nominee --  Leonid Kravchuk." The ex-premier is particularly concerned over  the fact that "the Central Election Committee pretends not to  notice these irregularities and ignores gross violations of the  election procedure reported by some foreign observers."    With this in view, Kuchma urged the parliament presidium "to  consider the issue of disregarding the election law by the State  TV and Radio Company and other central mass media, as well as  the political stand taken by the Central Election Committee."    The former prime minister also lodged a protest with the  Central Election Committee, demanding that resolute measures be  immediately taken to implement the law on presidential  elections, which provides for equal opportunities for candidates  to carry out election campaign.</p>

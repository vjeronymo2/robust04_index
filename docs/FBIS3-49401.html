			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] A few minutes ago, in a short telephone  conversation with our Croatian Television correspondent, we  learned that an urgent cease-fire in central Bosnia has been  agreed. [passage omitted]    [Unidentified correspondent] In response to a Croatian  request that the Muslim offensive in central Bosnia be halted,  an urgent cease-fire in central Bosnia was agreed. Generals  Roso [Croat commander], Delic [Bosnian Muslim commander], and  Briquemont are due to meet shortly. The Croatian side says this  is a test for the overall solution of Croat-Muslim relations.    President Izetbegovic said after the two-hour latest round  of  the talks that he will order General Delic to implement an  urgent cease-fire on all fronts in central Bosnia.    The two presidents may still continue their talks this  evening in Petersberg castle in Bonn. The departure of the two  delegations is scheduled for tomorrow.    The Muslim side undertook the obligation to reply to  President Tudjman as to whether it accepts the draft agreement,  which would have the binding character of a contract. The  proposal, consisting of two parts, was made by Croatia. The  signatories would be obligated to secure an urgent cease-fire,  without any conditions, and the cessation of all hostilities.    President Tudjman proposed in the agreement that by 2400 on  15 January all hostilities must end between the Croat and Muslim  people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The signatories would also take  the obligation that all units observe humanitarian rules and the  laws of war. Disbanding of disobedient units is also envisaged.  War criminals would be handed over to courts.    The agreement envisages closing detention centers and  releasing prisoners by 31 January. Muslim acceptance of the  agreement would guarantee free passage of humanitarian convoys  and humanitarian aid.    The equality of Bosnian Muslim and Croat people in all areas  is envisaged, as are respect for all human rights and civil  freedoms without any discrimination and under international  control.    The agreement, which the Muslim side has to accept or refuse  by 15 January, and which President Izetbegovic -- as he said --  will personally support at the Sarajevo Presidency, also  envisages how mutual relations within the Union of Republics of  Bosnia-Herzegovina will be organized, with Croat and Muslim  people exercising respect for each other.    The agreement demands 17.5 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina for  the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and 33.33 percent for the  Bosnian Muslim republic.    All contentious issues are to be resolved only in a  peaceful,  political way, without resorting to the use of force.    The town of Mostar will be administered by the European  Union  for up to two years, the agreement envisages. Mostar will be  the capital of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. A separate  agreement will secure the return of its citizens to the town.    An agreement on which the Muslims are to voice their opinion  by 15 January envisages that if the Union of Bosnia-Herzegovina  disintegrates, there will be no changes to the borders between  the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and the Bosnian Muslim  republic. These two republics could have special relations with  Croatia if the Serbs break up the union of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The Bosnian Muslim republic would in that case have the right  to join the Croatian state. I will read out several articles:    Article 8 says: Signatories to this document are agreed that  they will secure for the Bosnian Muslim republic access to the  sea in a way not threatening the sovereignty and integrity of  the Republic of Croatia and interests of the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna, taking into consideration the needs and the  justified interests of the Bosnian Muslim republic in a way that  will ensure permanent cooperation.    The Republic of Croatia and the Union of the Republics of  Bosnia- Herzegovina are to conclude -- after an agreement on the  set-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina within the international conference  on former Yugoslavia has come into effect -- agreements on the  use of free port zones in the ports of Ploce and Rijeka, in  accordance with principles and provisions of the UN convention  on transit trade of land-locked countries, i.e. on the  principles agreed upon in a draft agreement on  Bosnia-Herzegovina on board the Invincible.    In case the Union of the Republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina  ceases to exist, the Republic of Croatia pledges that it will  consider the Bosnian Muslim republic a successor to all rights  and obligations stemming from the agreement on the use of free  port zones.    Article 10 says: Signatories to this agreement guarantee  that  on the territory of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and the  Bosnian Muslim republic voluntary and safe return of all  refugees to the place of their previous residence will be  secured. They accept control and supervision by international  bodies in the implementation of this obligation.    Article 15 says: The Republic of Croatia believes that in  case the Serbs break up the Bosnia-Herzegovina union, it is  possible and necessary in the view of protecting and realizing  the interests of the Croat and the Bosnian Muslim nations to set  up an alliance between the Republic of Croatia and the Bosnian  Muslim republic that will be of an economic and defensive  nature. In that case, the Republic of Croatia is ready to set  up an alliance of states that will have the following goals:    -- securing permanent friendship and cooperation;    -- securing economic and social development in the common  economic area with the gradual creation of a common market,  customs union, and coordination of monetary and financial policy  with the final goal of creating a monetary union; and    -- securing cooperation in the areas of jurisdiction and  internal affairs, coordination of their common foreign policy,  creation of a joint defense policy, and conclusion of an  agreement on cooperation in the spheres of defense and security.    I have read out only a few important articles of the  agreement. This would not be just an ordinary agreement. Alija  Izetbegovic did not accept it straight away, because he linked  it with the realization of some issues relating to the  territorial settlement in central Bosnia, Mostar, and access to  the sea.    We shall see 15 January whether the Muslims will accept  President Tudjman's proposal. Let us just repeat at the end of  this dispatch that the Croatian demand for the Muslim offensive  to stop was replied to by an agreement on an immediate  cease-fire in central Bosnia, while Generals Roso, Delic, and  Briquemont are to meet immediately and issue adequate orders.</p>

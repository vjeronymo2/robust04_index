The official reminded that, during Russian President  Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October, the two states expressed  the wish to hold the meeting soon after the elections to the new  Russian parliament. The mass media believed it meant that the  date for the meeting was officially fixed for late in January.  But in point of fact it was only an approximate date.    Japan's viewpoint remains unchanged. It seeks to hold this  year's first round of the talks as soon as possible. However it  takes into account the difficulty of Russia's domestic  situation, the workload the Russian Government is faced with  because of the beginning of the parliament's work, the Japanese  Foreign Ministry's official said. The official refused to  express some supposition when the Russian-Japanese working  group's meeting may be held.</p>

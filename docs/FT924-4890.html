			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / KIO in Spain made large profits for outside accounts THE KUWAIT Investment Office, which claims to have lost billions of dollars on industrial investments in Spain over the past few years, was at the same time making large profits in Spain for institutional and private Kuwaiti clients. The profits were transferred to a number of hitherto unrevealed external accounts the KIO was managing alongside the Kuwaiti oil revenue reserve it traditionally handles. A Financial Times investigation has uncovered evidence that the external accounts were the main beneficiaries of the KIO's controversial investment drive into Spain in the late 1980s. They may, in part, have made profits at the expense of Kuwait's Reserve for Future Generations, which the KIO, one of the world's most powerful and secretive investors, was created to manage. Between 1986 and May this year the KIO spent Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds 2.2bn) building one of Spain's largest industrial conglomerates. New managers who took control of the organisation last spring have been investigating what they claim are 'irregularities' in the handling of the Spanish assets bought with the money. The KIO holding company in Spain, Grupo Torras, now has debts of about Dollars 3bn and a number of its affiliates have now either collapsed or are close to failing. The new KIO management claims that no profits were made in Spain and is threatening to take legal action against the former leadership of the KIO and its Spanish partners. But internal KIO documents show that by May 1990 the KIO's future generations account had made Dollars 24m in Spain while some of its 'managed' accounts had made a profit of Dollars 231m. A report produced last year by the KIO's auditor, KPMG Peat Marwick, details transfers of profits made on share transactions from Spain to a series of offshore companies - GSM Securities Management, Montrex and BPS - through which the external accounts traded. It has not been possible to identify the owners of the external accounts. The KIO's constitution authorises it to manage any funds it is directed to by the Kuwaiti government. The KIO's relationship with the banking community in Spain and abroad is already being tested by difficulties at Torras and some of its companies. Last week Torras defaulted on loans worth a total of Dollars 400m from Credit Suisse and Bank of America. The KIO itself had guaranteed these loans and must repay them.

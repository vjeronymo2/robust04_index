			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of a decree issued by President Geydar Aliyev on 5 </F> April -- read by announcer]    [Text] Reaching a turning point in improving the Republic's  economy through the broad application of market mechanisms and  broadening mutually beneficial trade and economic relations with  foreign countries and companies are the main directions of the  State's economic policy.    Considering the need to deepen economic reforms, increase  productivity in foreign trade and economic relations, promote  and improve exports, and liberalize the activity of exporting  establishments, encouraging them to contribute toward improving  the Republic's foreign currency reserves and export potential, I  have decided:    1. All legally authorized persons be allowed to export  strategically important products. Considering the income from  the sale of products abroad and the legal amount to be used from  that income to improve the Republic's integrated foreign  currency fund, the sale of the minimum volume of strategically  important products in return for convertible foreign monetary  units in 1994 be established and approved.    2. Regarding the effort to be made to liberalize the export  of strategically important products, the volume of domestic need  for those products in 1994 be established and approved so that  the demand of the establishments and organizations can be met.  The producers will be directly responsible for the sale of the  established amount of strategically important products in return  for convertible foreign monetary units and for the supply of the  established amount of products for domestic needs.    3. The financial resources to be created through the sale of  strategic or nonstrategic products be transferred to the  Republic's integrated foreign currency fund without delay. The  sale of the Republic's products in return for convertible  foreign monetary units be effected either on the basis of  advance payments or in accordance with irrevocable letters of  credit so that the financial resources to be created through the  sale of the Republic's products can be used to realize the most  important social and economic projects and to meet the most  urgent needs of the people.    4. The committee responsible for Azerbaijan's customhouse  offices be instructed to allow those who will be legally  authorized to export Azerbaijan's products to export their  commodities in return for convertible foreign monetary units  only if they possess documents from pertinent banks confirming  that the commodities to be exported have either been paid for in  advance or are covered by letters of credit.    5. The state establishments and organizations be instructed  to sell their products either by putting out contracts for  bidding or through the Republic's stock markets to guarantee the  market value of their products.    6. The Azerbaijani Council of Ministers draw up and approve  the new norms and levels of the allocations to be made from the  funds created through exports and other trade activities to the  Republic's integrated foreign currency fund within 10 days,  ensure that, as a rule, the state establishments and  organizations sell their products either on the basis of  contracts that will be put out for bidding or through the  Republic's stock markets so that the prices of products can be  established in accordance with the demand in the markets, and  prepare and approve the rules for the reorganization of foreign  trade within seven days. The Council of Ministers draw up and  approve a new tariff system for energy consumption to increase  the Republic's export potential and seriously reduce fuel and  other forms of energy consumption. Considering the increasing  rate of inflation, the Council of Ministers rearrange the sale  prices of fuel and other forms of energy in the Republic once  every three months so that the productivity of the fuel and  energy supply complex can be improved. To simplify customhouse  procedures, obstruct the violation of laws, and establish  discipline in that field, the Council of Ministers approve the  listed documents required for exports and imports within seven  days. It must be noted that those who are legally authorized to  export or import commodities will not be asked to submit any  document other than those listed for customhouse procedures.    7. The Azerbaijan National Bank be recommended to draw up  and implement the measures that are required to establish the  manat's domestic value to allow the money market among the banks  to function properly. Regarding the need to stimulate exports,  the Azerbaijan National Bank be recommended to give priority to  producer establishments, which sell products to foreign  countries, when exchanging manats for other currencies,  systematically supervise the foreign currency operations by the  commercial banks in accordance with the existing laws, and see  to it that the allocations to be made from the funds, which are  acquired by the authorized exporters and importers, to the  Republic's integrated foreign currency fund in accordance with  the established norms are transferred on time.    8. A state committee be established to supervise foreign  economic relations so that the foreign economic work in the  Republic can be organized and the productivity of trade  activities can be increased. That committee be empowered to  authorize barter agreements for products that are of strategic  importance to the Republic. Appointments to the state committee  be as follows:    a. First deputy prime minister be chairman.    b. Deputy prime minister and minister of economy.    c. Minister of finance.    d. Minister of foreign economic relations.    e. Chairman of the State Committee for Customhouses.    f. Director of the State Main Inspectorate for Taxes.    g. Chairman of the Azerbaijan National Bank Executive  Committee.    h. Chairman of the Azerbaijan International Shares and  Commerce Bank [Azerbaijan Sehimdar Komnisya Beynelhak Banki].    The state committee be instructed to study the agreements  concluded by individual establishments and organizations for  imports and exports and inform Azerbaijan's president and prime  minister about the Republic's foreign trade situation at least  once a month.    9. The chairman of the state committee be instructed to draw  up the rules and regulations of the State Committee for  Supervision on Foreign Economic Relations and submit them for  the president's approval within two weeks.    10. A provision in paragraph 2 of the decree the president  issued on 10 January 1994 to improve Azerbaijan's foreign trade  says that the export of strategically important products be  subject to the president's approval. That provision be regarded  as null and void.    11. The Azerbaijan Council of Ministers adopt decisions for  the implementation of this decree.    [Signed] Geydar Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan.

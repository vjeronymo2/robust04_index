Tariff Agreement for This  Year Signed"]    [Text] The State Committee for Defense Industries, the  Trade Union Association, and the Labor Ministry have signed a  tariff agreement for 1994. The Defense Industries Committee  expects that industrial policy regarding defense industries will  be propped up by due government support and budget financing.  The committee is presently trying to identify all the key areas  so as to ensure the most efficient workload for scientific and  research institutes and design bureaus, and also to utilize the  defense industries' scientific-technical potential in a rational  fashion.    In 1993 the sector experienced a 19.6-percent slump in  production against 36.7 percent in 1990; the production of  weapons and military hardware fell 34.3 percent against 1992 and  72.4 percent against 1990. The share of weapons and military  hardware slipped from 50 percent in 1990 to 21 percent in 1993.  The main reasons for the downturn are: a break in economic  relations, the unrestrained growth in raw material prices,  oppressive taxation policy, and, as a consequence, a huge amount  of enterprises' mutual debts. The negative processes under way  in the defense sector have been caused by conversion (nearly 70  percent in 1992) and the extremely inadequate financing by the  state. Conversion that affects over 5-7 percent of military  production is considered destructive in international practice.  Corporate profits have been the main source of financing  defense industries, accounting for nearly one-half of the cost  financing. The Finance Ministry has released only 67 percent of  the money appropriated for conversion programs and 23.7 percent  of funds to maintain mobilization capacities, but even that was  done after long delays. The enterprises have been forced to  take bank credits at high interest rates. As a result of this  policy of defense sector financing virtually all budget  appropriations for government defense orders (99.9 percent) have  been transferred to commercial banks and the Russian Federation  Central Bank toward repaying the credits. It turned out that  the government budget financed commercial banks and the Central  Bank, not the military-industrial sector. In fact, the money  was simply pumped from the government budget right into the  banking system, and the defense sector enterprises worked to  boost the banks' profits, not to satisfy the country's defense  needs. In the end, defense enterprises ended 1993 with the  accounts payable of 3 trillion rubles and the accounts  receivable of around 2 trillion rubles. At the same time, while  the Russian Federation Defense Ministry technically remains  their main customer, it has effectively been replaced as such by  the Finance Ministry.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] For its strong effort to stave off the holding of  the Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor in Manila, the Ramos  administration is asking Indonesia to return the gesture.  President Ramos is asking for the immediate release of some 90  Filipino fishermen detained since last month in North Sulawesi.  President Ramos expressed hope that Jakarta would accede to  Manila's request. He evoked the phrase ASEAN cooperation and  brotherhood, the same words he used to ban foreign delegates on  the East Timor conference.</p>

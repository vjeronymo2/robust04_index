Meanwhile, questions are being posed regarding the position of  the military whose chief, General Cedras, must go into  retirement according to the fifth point of the plan elaborated  in Washington by the legislators. Edner Jean tried to question  deputies who met with the members of the Army General Staff on  the eve of the vote on the plan to resolve the crisis:    [Begin Jean recording] The parliamentary delegation  sponsoring the settlement plan for the crisis met on 1 March  with the Army General Staff for a three-hour meeting. The  objective was to submit the plan to the approval of the military  through the commander in chief, a signatory to the Governors  Island accord.    According to a generally reliable source, the discussions  were very keen. The Army General Staff allegedly reproached the  parliamentary delegation for having involved the military  institution in a plan without its previous agreement. The  members of the General Staff, still according to the same  source, allegedly told the deputies clearly that they could not  foresee the consequences of this plan.    To ascertain the truth of those reports, we questioned the  members of the parliamentary delegation. Duly Brutus, one of the  co-signers of the plan, thinks that it is too early to make  public the nature of the contacts they had with the Army General  Staff. Neither did he deny the reports. Duly Brutus prefers to  speak of reservations on the part of the military. [passage  omitted]    Deputy Antoine Joseph, the godfather of the plan, expresses  reserved optimism following his meeting with the Army high  command. The MIDH [Movement For the Establishment of Democracy  in Haiti] legislator believes that the Army has no interest in  blocking the solution to the crisis, as proposed by the deputies  -- a plan that Joseph called efficient, realistic, and peaceful.  The former president of the lower chamber, however, expressed  the hope that Haiti's Armed Forces will not again miss the  chance to emerge honorably from the crisis, while protecting the  institution from a new political adventure. [passage omitted]    Talendier Desjardins, author of a draft resolution for the  indictment of President Aristide, a month ago, was also part of  the delegation that traveled to Washington, then to Army  Headquarters. For the deputy from Tiburon, it is still early to  say that the Army has rejected this plan. [passage omitted]    Since 2 March, this plan has become a resolution. Today, we  await whatever comes next. [end recording]</p>

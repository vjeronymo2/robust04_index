			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 32. Proposed &sect;314.53(d) instructed applicants when and where to submit patent information in an original application and in a supplement and would require an applicant to provide patent information within 30 days if a patent issues for a drug, drug product, or method of use after the application had been approved. Three comments asked FDA to extend the 30-day period in proposed &sect;314.53(d) to 60 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA declines to accept the comment. The 30-day period is consistent with section 505(c)(2) of the act and permits the agency to include the latest patent information in supplements to the Orange Book. If FDA provided for a longer time period, the Orange Book and its supplements might be less likely to contain current patent information for each product, and potential applicants might be misled by outdated patent information. FDA has, on its own initiative, clarified &sect;314.53(d)(1) and (d)(3) to mention the 30-day deadline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 33. Proposed &sect;314.53(d)(2)(ii) (now renumbered as &sect;314.53(d)(2)) would require an applicant to submit patent information for a patent that claims the drug, drug product, or a method of using the product if the applicant sought approval of certain, listed changes through a supplemental application. One comment would revise proposed &sect;314.53(d)(2)(ii) to require an applicant to provide a patent declaration for each supplement. The comment explained that this would ``eliminate the risk that the four types of supplements described in the proposal do not comprise the entire universe of supplements that may affect the patent information filed with the FDA.'' The comment would also require an NDA applicant to submit information on patents that claim the formulation or composition each time the NDA applicant submits a supplement to revise the formulation or composition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA disagrees with the comment. Section 505(b)(1) of the act requires an applicant to submit information on each patent that claims the drug or a method of using a drug product for which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner engaged in the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug. The supplements listed in new &sect;314.53(d)(2)(i)_supplements to change a formulation, to add a new indication or other condition of use, to change the strength, or to make any other patented change regarding the drug, drug product, or any method of use_are those that concern the drug product or a method of using the drug product. Additionally, new &sect;314.53(d)(2)(i)(D) provides for the submission of patent information for any other type of patented change. Requiring an applicant to provide patent information for all supplements, even if the supplement did not involve a change to the drug product or a method of using the product (i.e., a change in the site of manufacturing), would increase the workload on applicants and the agency without a significant benefit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The suggestion that FDA require an applicant to submit information on patents that claim the formulation or composition each time the NDA applicant submits a supplement to revise the formulation or composition is apparently based on a misreading of proposed &sect;314.53(d)(2)(ii)(A) (now renumbered as &sect;314.53(d)(2)(i)(A)). This section already requires an applicant to provide such information. Thus, the comment's suggestion is unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 34. One comment would revise proposed &sect;314.53(d)(2)(ii)(D) (now renumbered as &sect;314.53(d)(2)(i)(D)) to require the submission of patent information if the applicant submits a supplement to make any other patented change ``except patented manufacturing processes.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The suggested revision is unnecessary because &sect;314.53(b) clearly states that, ``Process patents are not covered by [&sect;314.53] and information on process patents may not be submitted to FDA.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 35. One comment would delete proposed &sect;314.53(d)(2)(v) (now renumbered as &sect;314.53(d)(2)(iv)), which would require an applicant to comply with the requirements for amending formulation, composition, or method of use patent information. The comment said applicants are already required to comply with such requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA disagrees with the comment. Section 314.53(d)(2)(iv) requires applicants to amend the patent information to account for changes proposed in supplemental applications whereas &sect;314.53(c)(2)(ii) and (d)(2)(ii) require an applicant to amend patent information when there have been changes in status, or there is other new information regarding the relevant patents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 36. Proposed &sect;314.53(d)(3) (now renumbered as &sect;314.53(d)(4)) would require an applicant to submit two copies of each submission of patent information. One copy would go to the archival copy of the application and the other copy would go to the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls section of the review copy. One comment would delete the phrase ``of the review copy'' from proposed &sect;314.53(d)(3) on the grounds that the phrase appeared to be a typographical error.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA believes that the comment misreads proposed &sect;314.53(d)(3). An applicant is required to submit an archival copy and a review copy of an application consisting of several separately bound technical sections. New &sect;314.53(d)(4) requires an applicant to provide two copies of each submission of patent information. One copy will go to the archival copy of the NDA; the other will go to the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls technical section of the review copy of the NDA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 37. FDA, on its own initiative, has amended &sect;314.53(e) regarding public disclosure of patent information. As originally proposed, &sect;314.53(e) stated that, for each use patent, FDA would publish the ``approved indications or other conditions of use covered by a patent and any unapproved indications or condition of use to which the applicant certified.'' The agency is deleting the reference to ``any unapproved indications or condition of use'' to be consistent with the patent information requirements in &sect;314.53(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

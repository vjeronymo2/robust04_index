			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Books: SF's lost king still defends his throne - Fiction FORWARD THE FOUNDATION by Isaac Asimov Doubleday Pounds 14.99, 414 pages ELVISSEY by Jack Womack HarperCollins Pounds 15.99, 319 pages MORTAL ENGINES by Stanislaw Lem Andre Deutsch Pounds 12.99, 239 pages A WAR of succession has broken out. Isaac Asimov, king of speculative fiction, is dead. Publishers have anointed two rivals to the crown: Jack Womack and Stanislaw Lem. As if to escalate the struggle, Forward The Foundation, Asimov's final novel, completed only weeks before the 72-year-old grandmaster of SF died last April, has just been published posthumously. The Foundation series is Asimov's most sustained work of invention and his best loved. Inspired by Gibbon, it is the epic future history of a decadent imperial system incorporating 25m inhabited worlds. As Foundation fans know, one man sees the collapse coming long before anyone else. He is Hari Seldon, father of psycho-history, a nascent statistical science of human behaviour which forecasts that, left to itself, the Galaxy will endure 30,000 years of anarchy. Seldon reckons that this mother-of-all-recessions may be contracted to 1,000 years if a small enlightened community can be preserved. So he establishes his Foundation, a benevolent secret society, and the seven books of Asimov's series follow its fate. Forward The Foundation is the biography of psycho-history's founder; a kind of cosmic John Maynard Keynes and the self-confessed alter ego of Isaac Asimov. This last book is the keystone in the archway of the series, and Asimov deserves this monument. Be warned though that the pace of invention and surprise is slower than in the early Foundation novels. The stylistic cliche count is also higher. But the subtle, sustained parallel with the last days of Roman imperial sway and the discreet pervasive influence of the earliest Christian communities still ignites the imagination. Jack Womack, the first challenger for Asimov's crown, has written a strange novel about Elvis, the rock n' roll legend whose transformation into cultural icon was strange enough in the first place. There has emerged in America in the 16 years since Elvis's death a well-documented psychological syndrome to describe the addicted collector of objects sanctified by the touch of the King. His fans regard him as divine; his Graceland mansion is their Mecca. That much is plain fact. Now for the fiction. Elvissey pictures a future in which the C of E is triumphant. We are, however, light years removed from tea and cucumber sandwiches with the vicar. The C of E is the Church of Elvis, with its schismatic groups including the Prearmyites, the Hosts of Memphis, and the Shaken, Rattled and Rolled. These sects comprise a large proportion of the developed world's population and they are dangerously unstable. To control them, the globally-ambitious Dryco corporation sanctions an audacious time travel kidnap. The plan is that the dislocated Elvis, plucked from Memphis 1954, will keep his charismatic followers docile in New York 2033. Don't laugh. This is a grim and powerful novel. Womack's world is discerned as if through a glass darkly, and demands considerable initial attention from the reader. Has the cyberpunk generation the required attention span? I hope so, for this odd and oddly rewarding novel transcends cyberpunk - the streetwise, cynical SF fashion of the '80s  -in important ways. Womack's book is different in tone and content from anything you may have read. Then there is Stanislaw Lem. Mortal Engines (translated by Michael Kandel) is a collection of stories which demonstrates what the genre may boast at its finest. The 'mortal engines' in the title are not the lethal cannons described by Shakespeare's Othello but living automatons. Virtually every character in these pages is a machine. Even the robot dogs have robot fleas. A sure sign of Lem's literary stature is that his work demands classical comparisons. Take the novella-length tale entitled The Mask. If Kafka and Henry James were writing today in Polish and collaborating on SF, The Mask is what you might expect. It is a fairy tale told from the dragon's perspective. Love, death, free will are its themes. Lem juggles elegantly with the deterministic world of fairy tales in which physics is controlled by morality (good princes always prevail, wicked ones always come to grief). The denouement will make your palms sweat. The war of Asimov's succession can have only one just outcome. Womack is a prince in waiting. Lem deserves the crown.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 21 (XINHUA) -- Several million local  people and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) are  fighting the floods that have been hitting the provinces of  Guangdong, Hunan and Jiangxi, and the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous  region in southern China since mid-June.    On the evening of June 19, a flood peak of the Beijiang  River, the highest water level in the past 50 years, struck the  Shijiao- Xialingzhou section of the dyke, causing seepage along  a three to four-km section.    At the critical moment, several thousand local people and  PLA  soldiers rushed to the site with sand-bags and other material to  reinforce the dyke. By 4:00 in the early morning of June 20,  the flood peak passed the Sanshui hydrometric station safely and  Guangzhou city and the Pearl River Delta survived.    In Duan, Luocheng and two other cities of Guangxi, which  were  most seriously hit by the floods, the regional governor, Cheng  Kejie, went to the flood-stricken counties to make arrangements  for air-dropping relief supplies to over 6,000 people besieged  by the waters.    Hunan provincial leaders also went to the flood-hit area and  led about two million local people to fight the flood together  with 3,000 PLA soldiers. The flood peak of the Xiangjiang River  has now passed Changsha city, capital of Hunan Province.    But some of Changsha's urban and suburban areas are still  immersed in water.    In Jiangxi Province, more than three million local people  and  120,000 PLA soldiers have spared no efforts to fight the floods.  So far, over two million straw bags, 137,000 cubic meters of  sand and aggregate, 292 lifeboats and 1,461 automobiles have  been used in the battle against the floods.    According to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief  Headquarters, the water levels of the four major flood rivers --  the Xijiang, Beijiang, Xiangjiang and Ganjiang -- have all  started to drop slowly, but are still above their warning levels.    Since the flood peaks of the Xijiang and Beijiang will  affect  the Pearl River Delta simultaneously, the delta, one of China's  most economically developed areas, is still facing heavy  pressure from the floods.    Some PLA soldiers have been transferred from Guangxi to  Guangdong to help the people there to fight the floods.</p>

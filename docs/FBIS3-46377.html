She said that to strike a rough balance between exports and  imports is China's basic principle in foreign trade and economic  co- operation, and it intends to realize the balance through  expanding exports rather than reducing imports.    Wu told a press conference sponsored by the Press Office  under the State Council that China's foreign trade and economic  cooperation continued to maintain a strong growth momentum last  year on the basis of its rapid development over the past few  years.    The foreign trade volume last year reached 195.72 billion  U.S. dollars-worth, an increase of 18.2 million U.S. dollars  over 1992.    Exports were worth 91.77 billion U.S. dollars and imports  were worth 103.95 billion U.S. dollars. Thus the increase of  imports was 21 percent higher than that of exports, leaving a  deficit of 12.18 billion U.S. dollars.    Wu attributed the slow growth of exports to the high-speed  growth of the domestic economy, large scaled investment, robust  demand, price increases and lack of supply of some commodities,  especially primary products.    Meanwhile, she said, imports of raw materials, energy and  equipment needed for economic development increased rapidly.    Statistics show that last year imported commodities, whose  import volume exceeding one billion U.S. dollars include  aircraft, automobiles, rolled steel, crude oil, finished oil,  fertilizers, industrial chemicals and complete sets of equipment.    Wu said that this indicates once again that China is a large  market with great potential.</p>

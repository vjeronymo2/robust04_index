			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / International Company News: Globex rival faces further delay The launch of the Chicago Board of Trade's answer to Globex, an after-hours computer trading system known as Project A, has been delayed again. The system is now expected to make its debut the third week in September. The CBoT, which is home to the actively traded US Treasury bond futures and options markets, pulled the plug on Globex, the electronic futures trading network owned by Reuters and operated jointly by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Matif, last May. Since then, it has announced ambitious plans to link its own Project A system with other after-hours computers in London and Australia. However, the exchange has had difficulty getting the product launched on its own turf. Originally scheduled to open trading on August 1, Project A was delayed at the request of some CBoT members, who wanted a complete system audit. Deloitte &amp; Touche, the international accountancy firm, gave the system a clear report in late August. Now, the CBoT is waiting for its regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to review the auditor's report and give its approval for the Project A launch. The exchange already meets much of the demand for its products outside the US time zone with its evening open-outcry trading session, which last month had turnover of 229,510 contracts. When Project A is launched it will initially open for only two hours in the afternoon, bridging the gap between the close of the CBoT's afternoon session and the opening of its evening session.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (1): A new nation starts to take shape - Nearly four years after Nelson Mandela's release, South Africa begins a fresh era YESTERDAY South Africa broke the twisted mould of apartheid, and cast away the bits. After decades spent fighting the tide of history, which submerged other racist regimes long ago, South Africa yesterday opted to join the modern world. It can now play a full role at the United Nations, rejoin the Commonwealth, become a member of the Organisation of African Unity, and play a much-needed, constructive role in the development of southern Africa and beyond. Yesterday's agreement on a post-apartheid constitution is the first irrevocable step on the path to full democracy; but it is only a first step. The next few months and years will show whether South Africa's tenure as a democratic nation will be nasty, brutish and short, or stable, happy and prosperous; whether it will substitute black domination for white repression; whether it will defy the logic of divided societies worldwide, and nurture true multi-ethnic democracy. Though the mould of apartheid has been broken, Africa provides other unfortunate models for the new state: tyrannical regimes which abused power, crushed dissent and lay waste whole economies through maladministration, corruption and theft. South African politicians, black and white, bridle at the comparison: Finance Minister Derek Keys offers the consensus view when he insists that South Africa 'will be totally different from the rest of Africa. It always has been and it always will be'. Economically, that is obviously so. Mr Keys points to South Africa's clear superiority in terms of 'indigenous capital', both human and financial. The new leaders will manage the continent's most powerful economy, with gross domestic product equal to 75 per cent of sub-Saharan Africa's gdp, with an economic hinterland which stretches as far north as Zaire, generating half of Africa's electricity. Even in broader international terms, it compares well: with a well developed stock market, banking sector, and body of company law, South Africa offers more to the investor than, for example, eastern Europe; and with foreign debt at USDollars 17.3bn, or 15 per cent of gdp, it is underborrowed by any standard. In political terms, too, South Africa is different. In 1957, when Ghana became the first African nation to gain independence from Britain, Kwame Nkrumah inherited a position of largely unfettered power. But South Africa's first black president - likely to be the African National Congress leader, Nelson Mandela - will find his room for manoeuvre far more circumscribed, in law, and more importantly, in fact. 'South Africa is too big for the ANC,' says one ANC member who bemoans the complexity of a society which imposes manifold constraints on the party of government: he believes they will inhibit the ANC's ability to transform South Africa virtuously; others welcome these constraints as curbs to abuse of power. But all would agree that South Africa does not fit the classic African mould of a society which easily falls prey to bad government. Strong interest groups counterbalance the power of government: chief among them is a strong, diversified and battle-hardened corporate sector; the 1.2m-strong labour federation Cosatu, historically allied to the ANC, has recently begun flexing its independent muscle, and is well organised and powerful enough to play the role of democracy's watchdog. The highly politicised and motivated township 'civics', or community associations, could also prove an important check on government power: for South Africa's 'masses' are not the fawning crowd which greeted Kwame Nkrumah, African liberator; they are demanding, well organised, and used to fighting their political corner. The list of powerful interest groups outside the ANC's sphere goes on and on: the 1.2m strong civil service is dominated by Afrikaners, who are scarcely natural allies of the ANC. The defence force, though professional and committed to supporting the government of the day, is also Afrikaans-dominated, as is the police. Last, and arguably least of the factors constraining an ANC government, is the constitution agreed yesterday by the main political parties. That constitution was meant to prevent majority domination through power sharing: it was supposed to guarantee democracy by ensuring that the minority losers in any majority-rule election would still enjoy a powerful say in government. It falls some way short of so doing: minorities will be represented in government, with every party earning 5 per cent of the national vote entitled to a seat in cabinet; but the power of minority parties in cabinet is precarious. The ANC, which will have both a president and a deputy president, will have its own way on any disputed decision. And though it has promised regular consultation with the second deputy president, drawn from the second largest party (probably Mr FW de Klerk, current president), he will have no statutory powers to frustrate Mr Mandela's will. The constitution fails to deliver other checks and balances which the ruling National Party had insisted were essential. The party's 1991 constitutional proposals called for political power to be divided between three tiers of government - central, regional and local - with each tier to have 'original and entrenched authority with which other tiers of government may not interfere'. In fact, central government retains wide powers to 'interfere' with regional governments: the constitution authorises central government to intervene in terms so vague (to impose uniform national norms and standards, to ensure proper regulation, and where there are implications for national security or economic policy) as seriously to undermine regional autonomy. And with regions barred from imposing taxes without central government approval, it is hard to accept Mr de Klerk's claim that the new state will be 'federal'. National Party negotiators believe that they will not need entrenched constitutional provisions to play a powerful role in restraining the ANC: they believe the ANC's assurances that it does not wish to govern alone (and does not believe it could do so effectively); and they judge their electoral strength will give them an important say in cabinet, though only if they are able to better their poll showing of 11 to 13 per cent. But clearly, the National Party has settled well below its bottom line on crucial issues; probably, it had no choice. As a minority government whose power diminishes by the day, negotiators calculated that a deal done now would be preferable to that available next month or next year. And whatever the shortcomings of the constitution, agreement is better than continuing deadlock. Though it is not strong enough, it is far from illiberal, and should help to reinforce democratic forces. But if South Africa does escape some of the more grotesque abuses of power for which Africa is famous, it is scarcely likely to become a prosperous liberal democracy overnight. The new bill of rights enshrines tough emergency powers which can be used to restore stability after the April 27 elections. Agreement seems to exist between the ANC and NP that restoring stability, through temporary repression, is the highest post-election priority. According to this scenario, democracy will be a temporary casualty while the new government pursues stability and economic development; and if it succeeds in restoring law and order without repeating the oppression of the past, it will be widely popular with an electorate (white and black) fed up with crime and violence. Much will depend on whether the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi can be persuaded to participate in next year's elections: though he has made clear that he rejects yesterday's constitution, he could decide he has more to gain by fighting rather than boycotting an election. If he actively opposes the poll, the security situation could become untenable, especially if the white right wing, now in tactical alliance with Inkatha, also opposes the election. The ANC and NP must guarantee that there is critical mass at the political centre, and that the crackdown need only suppress the lunatic fringe. If Inkatha and the right wing, with their numbers and their firepower, are to be suppressed in unison, stability may be unattainable. But in the end, it is economics - and not politics - which will seal South Africa's fate. For yesterday's constitution marks a decisive shift in electoral power from the 'haves' to the 'have-nots' of South African society.' Popular expectations will soon strain the intentions of even the most benevolent government; at that point, it must either give in to populism, or suppress it. The latter now seems most likely: the new South Africa will start with a hefty dollop of the old. That will be unfortunate, but bearable; what will destroy South Africa's democratic prospects forever is failure to deliver a better economic deal to the masses. It is a tall order.</p>

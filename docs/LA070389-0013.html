			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> POISON GAS CARGO BARRED  </P> <P> Dubai officials turned back part of a chemical cargo ordered by Iran through a  Duesseldorf firm, West German sources said in Bonn. About 257 tons of thionyl  chloride, which can be used to make mustard gas, was ordered by Iran through  Rheineisen Chemical Products, which is under investigation in West Germany's  second chemical arms export scandal in the last six months. The Bonn sources  said Dubai officials who inspected the ship over the weekend found six  containers of the Indian-made chemical on board, a fraction of the amount  ordered. They ordered the ship to return its cargo to Bombay.  </P></p>

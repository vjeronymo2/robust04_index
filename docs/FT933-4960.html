			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Monday Interview: Into extra time in Japan - Gary Lineker, the former England footballer, talks to Charles Leadbeater The man widely regarded as The Greatest Living Englishman hobbled around the corner. He delivered a melting smile and offered to buy me an orange juice in the canteen. 'Oranju jusu, futatsu,' he asked in impeccable beginner's Japanese. When the canteen manager refused to take his yen in payment, he remarked quietly: 'That's nice - free orange juice.' An international sports superstar, earning thousands of pounds a week as the best-paid foreign player in the Japanese soccer league's first season, he is still pleasantly surprised at getting a free orange juice. The answer to my main question was already becoming clear before I had asked it: Gary Lineker really is a charming person. And even limping with a broken toe, and dressed in drab blue jeans and T-shirt, he manages to look good, horribly good. Tanned and muscular, with deep brown eyes, slightly greying temples and almost always smiling broadly, he has become a household name in Japan, even though his bad toe has kept him out of the game for most of the season. The 32-year-old striker's first serious injury has been a big frustration. He has sat on the sidelines as the J-League has taken off, and watching football has become Japan's most fashionable pastime with crowds of up to 60,000 a game, while his team Nagoya Grampus Eight has fallen towards the bottom of the league and a clutch of unknown Brazilians has taken their team to the top of the table. Yet, for all that, and in spite of Japan's often torrential summer rain, the move from London's Tottenham Hotspur has reinvigorated the man who came within one goal of Bobby Charlton's record of 48 goals in an England shirt. 'To be honest, I have been surprised that the standard has been so high. There are no negative aspects to the game. Everything is so positive,' he explained. Lineker's excitement is due not just to the J-League's early popularity. It is more than that. Japan, a land where formal good manners are the norm, and Lineker, known as the politest man in British sport, were made for one another. The most striking thing about Lineker is how personable and modest he is. Yet beneath his apparently effortless politeness, he is extremely controlled. Words are carefully weighed, judgments are measured and rare criticisms are usually indirect. Lineker admits to loving football. Yet by the end of his career with Spurs his motivation for league games was flagging. The move to Japan, where stadiums are packed to capacity with noisy, flag-waving crowds of mainly young people, has revived him. 'The crowd are what make it,' he explained. 'Wherever we play the grounds are sold out and colourful. The greatest thing is that the crowd is not at all cynical. Because it is all new to them, they think the whole thing is exciting. Even if you are losing three-nil they still get behind you, and to be honest I have found that really refreshing. It is much easier to motivate yourself here.' The Linekers - wife Michelle, eldest son George (recovering from leukaemia) and recent arrival Harry - are settling well in industrial Nagoya, three hours south of Tokyo. 'Culture shock is lots of little things,' reflected Lineker, who also played in Spain for Barcelona in the mid-1980s. 'We do most of the same things we did in England: eat out, see friends. Living here has been great, a once in a lifetime opportunity.' His travails with Japanese (he speaks Spanish fluently) make his work more difficult, even though most of the terminology of Japanese soccer - 'shootoh', 'offu sidoh' - is borrowed from English. Language apart, Lineker said that working for a Japanese company - Grampus Eight is the Toyota works team - was not much different from working for a British one. 'You have to be very patient and explain things, and accept that sometimes they will not listen; they do things their way. We train a little longer than in England but not as intensely. There are far more people in the club office, but that is one of the ways they keep down unemployment.' The J-League's success has done more than renew Lineker's enthusiasm. It has also given him a wider perspective on the shortcomings of the English game. As England prepares for Wednesday's match against Poland, which could mark its exit from the World Cup, Lineker has some advice about how the English game should be restructured to make it more internationally competitive - although, as usual, the criticism was delivered by implication. 'Here they are prepared to listen to players and managers, which is certainly something they could learn from in England.' The explanations for England's demise moved Lineker to the boundaries of his world of carefully chosen, diplomatic phrases. There were hints of bitterness about the unhappy end to his own career (he was substituted in his final game for England) and even a touch of injured pride, if not self-interest: 'It is hard to see us qualifying (for the World Cup), and that would be a big blow to the game. Things look pretty bad. 'I just think that we have to bring back the best players who have been dropped. We have proved beyond doubt now that you cannot compete at international level unless you play your best 11 players. At that level it is not about hustling people and winning the ball all day long, you have to have a bit more than that.' He would not say that he should still be playing for England, but remarked: 'We showed in the 1990 World Cup that we could compete with the best in the world. That all seems to have been tossed aside too soon.' He does not lay all the blame at the door of Graham Taylor, the little-loved England manager. The root of the English game's troubles were in the way youngsters learnt to play, Lineker said. 'We will never be as technically gifted as other countries until we change the size of pitches our kids play on. They play on massive pitches, so they are taught to boot the ball as far as possible to get it to the other end. In other countries, Germany and Holland, they deliberately play on smaller pitches so that they learn how to pass. 'If we banned youth football on big pitches, then we might start competing internationally with consistency, rather than occasionally.' The professional game also needed reorganisation, he argued. 'We have to cut down the amount of football we play, because we just get lots of injuries. The quality of the game suffers, players are never fresh. In the Italian league they play fewer games, the players are fresher, quicker, better. We should get rid of one of the cup competitions and cut the league down to 18 teams.' Viewed from Japan, the weaknesses of English football are very much the traditional weaknesses of British industry: a reliance on high-volume, poorly marketed products of variable quality and limited innovation, which require players of great strength but only middling skills, exactly the qualities both the industrial and football training systems are designed to deliver. Lineker disavowed any ambitions to return to England as a football manager after his two-year stint with the Nagoya team. Yet, after his experience of the J-League success, he could emerge as an eloquent critic of the way the British game is ensnared by the mediocrity of much of its management. 'It would be nice to put something back into the game, some of these ideas. But that is very difficult in England because they do not tend to listen to players. Maybe it will change one day, but they are not receptive to new ideas.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1960 Born, Leicester. 1978 Joined Leicester City. 1986 Began three seasons in Barcelona. 1988 Won Golden Boot Award for highest goalscorer in Mexico World Cup      Finals. 1989 Joined Tottenham Hotspur. 1991 Baby son George contracted leukaemia. 1992 Ended England career with 60 caps as second highest scorer ever. 1992 Joined Nagoya Grampus Eight.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

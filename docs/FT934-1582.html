			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Volatile and active dealing in derivatives yesterday pointed to choppy trading at this morning's futures and options expiry, writes Peter John. Dealers said that the affect of so-called 'triple witching hour' in the US could also spill over to London. Open interest, the number of futures contracts awaiting expiry, was still high by the the close of dealing yesterday - around 15,000 December futures will have to be closed out in the contracts remaining two and a half hours according to some estimates. Under normal circumstances many of the positions would be rolled forward into the March contract. However, the spread between March and December was 30 points at the official close compared to a fair value estimate of around 14. Consequently, many dealers will prefer to roll out by selling their positions and buying the Footsie or vice versa depending on whether they are long or short. The battle between the longs and shorts will tug at the cash market. The December future was volatile yesterday, trading four points below cash and 10 above before closing at a premium of 3 points. It opened at 3,305, reached 3,318 and then closed officially at 3,313 on turnover of 17,530. A further 4,000 contracts were traded in late dealing. March opened at 3,334 and closed at 3,342 on turnover of 13,968. FT-SE options are also due to expire and their imminent end boosted total options turnover to 51,787 against 31,079 on Wednesday. Elsewhere, the US sees expiry of index options and futures as well as equity options and there is futures expiry in the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland.</p>

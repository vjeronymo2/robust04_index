			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Ulster's missing centre John Major's political skills probably do not extend to stage-managing the internal politics of the loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland. The timing of their ceasefire announcement last week, on the eve of his speech to the Conservative party conference, was therefore either a stroke of luck for the prime minister or, possibly, a deliberate present to him from the loyalist leadership. The loyalists, like the mainstream Ulster Unionists but so far unlike the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists, have apparently decided that 'the union is safe' in Mr Major's hands. They believe the IRA's cessation of violence since August 31 (except as a brutal method of policing its own urban strongholds) is an admission of defeat. They do not believe, as Mr Paisley does and as Sinn Fein claims to, that the IRA ceased fire only because Britain has lost interest in Northern Ireland and is looking for a way out. Mr Major's promise of a referendum on any new arrangement has reassured them, as it has unionist opinion generally. That pledge gives the majority in the province a veto which was not granted to it when Mr Major's predecessor negotiated the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. Opposite expectations So Northern Ireland begins this week free from the immediate fear of terrorism, for the first time in 25 years. That is a blessed relief, for which Mr Major certainly deserves his share of credit, along with his Irish opposite number, Albert Reynolds, and the leader of the main nationalist party in Northern Ireland, John Hume. But to call this ceasefire 'peace' would be premature because it is based on opposite expectations. Loyalists believe the United Kingdom is safe; republicans that they are on the way to a united Ireland. At least one of those expectations is going to be disappointed; the British and Irish governments may even, as they try to square the circle, convince both sides that they have been betrayed. That is the fear. The hope must be that peace will find its own momentum; that on neither side will paramilitary leaders wish to incur the odium of breaking it. That depends in part on those leaders themselves gaining psychological benefits from being seen as 'men of peace' rather than 'men of violence'. The effort to include them in negotiations is therefore justified. But no one should lose sight of the fact that in electoral terms these are fringe parties. They may have the ability to wreck a settlement. They do not have a mandate to negotiate one. Crucial breakthrough Much has been made of the parallels between the 'peace process' in Northern Ireland and those in South Africa and the Middle East. In so far as such parallels have any value, they suggest that the crucial breakthrough must be achieved by establishing a new relationship of trust and mutual understanding between the leaders of mainstream, representative parties in two hitherto bitterly polarised communities. That was achieved in South Africa between F W de Klerk and Nelson Mandela: the relationship reached a point where their respective communities' confidence in them depended on their ability to continue co-operating with each other and to demonstrate progress, and both understood that. Between Yassir Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin the same is objectively true, but the process is in difficulties because neither seems to be confident that the other has understood it. Between John Hume and James Molyneaux, who would be the analogous figures in Northern Ireland, the process has not really started. The job of creating such a relationship has been left to the British and Irish prime ministers. The latter certainly need to be involved, because nationalists in Northern Ireland would not have confidence in a purely internal settlement. But in the last resort trust has to be built between the two communities, and the leaders of the mainstream, representative political parties on both sides have a crucial part to play. Up to now Mr Hume has devoted his main energies to building an alliance of nationalist parties committed to constitutional methods; and Mr Molyneaux has been mainly concerned to keep the British government committed to maintaining the union. Both have succeeded, and deserve credit for their success. Now they need to concentrate on finding common ground with each other.</p>

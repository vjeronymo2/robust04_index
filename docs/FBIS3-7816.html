That permanent determination of ours can not be  threatened by various blockades, political and economic  pressures, like the recent decision of the Greek Government to  close its border and its Thessalonike port for our goods. Just  like before, we firmly stand up to all pressures and will not  allow any one to deny us the name we have had with centuries.  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  survives and will go on surviving. We have no territorial  aspirations towards any of our neighbors, and therefore not  towards our southern one, either. That is why we propose, with  a clear conscience, to sit down and discuss all the differences  between our two countries, on an equal basis."</p>

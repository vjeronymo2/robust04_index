			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Management: Workaholics and the capitalist pig 'YOU have how many weeks' holiday?' An American business school graduate in her late-30s, and working in middle management at a large telecommunications company, boggles at the thought of six weeks' annual leave. She gets two weeks - into which are crammed a passion for skiing, family responsibilities and a desire to travel. In the unlikely event that she ever becomes boss of this multi-billion dollar company, her vacation allowance might increase to four weeks. This is the typical US experience and to a European, it looks a lousy deal. Yet, here is a nation writhing in self-doubt because a Japanese prime minister recently called its workers lazy. Hasn't something, somewhere, gone awry? Juliet Schor, in 'The Overworked American', (published by Basic) certainly thinks so. This analysis by an associate professor at Harvard University seems timely, given the heated political debate. The balance struck between work and leisure is fundamental to millions of employees' lives. It also raises practical management issues. Does insisting on a little more leisure actually improve workforce efficiency? When unemployment is rife, should labour be distributed more evenly between those who want to work? An answer is going to have to tackle psychological and cultural questions, not just economic ones. Schor, however, has little time for this. Her aim is simple: to prove that capitalism is destroying leisure, a trend she views with sentimental regret. Very crudely, her argument is that profit-driven employers will always encourage long working hours. Workers get trapped by an addiction to consumer goods, and demand more money, not more leisure. Her contention is backed up by evidence of longer working hours in the US - although despite copious footnotes, finer details of the statistical analysis are opaque. The reader is treated to a romp through working practices in pre-capitalist 'Olde England' - where British peasants probably got a rotten deal compared with the French or Spanish. From there, it is a quick trip forward to the arrival of 'werkgloken' - or work clocks - in the textile factories and on to the Victorian mills. The argument does contain some obvious truths. Greed has always been a powerful motivating force, and 'keeping up with the Jones', an accepted social phenomenon. 'Big business', meanwhile, probably does encourage employees to contribute more than the required working week. If someone is prepared to do unpaid overtime in order to climb the promotional ladder, a profit-conscious employer is hardly going to complain. But, to lay blame for 'the decline of leisure' on capitalism is simplistic. There are thousands of professionals, from teachers to artists, whose willingness to work hard is not explained by the desire for another TV set. Nor have some 'non-capitalist' economic systems been noted for their sloth. Take the early kibbutz settlers, for example. In short, material reward may be an important incentive once enough has been earned to clothe the family and pay the mortgage. But it is not the end of the story. The pity is that Schor skimps on more interesting detail. She mentions in passing experiments by Kellogg in the 1930s and, more recently, Medtronic Corporation and Ideal Industries - where attempts to reduce working hours have actually brought productivity gains. Slog away for a few extra hours, save up the book's Dollars 21 cost, and squeeze a couple of hours reading into a tight working schedule, and you may be marginally enlightened. In the process your blood may boil and stress levels rise - but, by Schor's reckoning, you're probably a dead man anyway.</p>

			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM rules out protest in 'friendly fire' deaths THE GOVERNMENT signalled yesterday that it would take no action against the US pilots involved in the deaths of nine UK soldiers killed by 'friendly fire' in the Gulf war. Mr John Major indicated to MPs that he did not believe the incident justified a protest to Washington over its role in protecting of the pilots. While lessons had to be learnt, he said, 'I hope we won't lose sight of the fact that those were American pilots risking their lives alongside our troops in a battle against a common enemy and to liberate Kuwait.' Speaking after an Oxford inquest ruled on Monday that the nine were 'unlawfully killed', the prime minister faced pressure by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, to use his authority to ensure the victims' families had the full truth. Mr Major replied: 'I'm not in a position to provide any more information.' Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, later admitted that in the immediate aftermath of the Gulf war, 'there was some confusion and uncertainty about what exactly happened'. While the war had ended in February, the US Marine Corps had not answered points raised in the Ministry of Defence inquiry until July 10, he said. However, Ministry of Defence officials said that all available information was now in the hands of the victims' families. Mr Rifkind said the UK was working closely with its allies to ensure that in future, 'the risk of troops firing on their comrades is minimised'. Meanwhile, Mrs Barbara Mills QC, director of public prosecutions, has asked to see all the relevant documents held by the Oxford coroner and the MoD on the incident. The DPP's office said yesterday that Mrs Mills would consider the papers in detail to see whether there was sufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against the two US pilots allegedly responsible. Her office repeated though, that there was no power to prosecute a foreign national in England and Wales for any offence of murder or manslaughter allegedly committed abroad.</p>

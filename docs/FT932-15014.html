			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rand fall brings shine back to S African gold - A much-needed revenue windfall THE DAYS when South African mining houses served crayfish tails at their results presentations are remembered only by the senior generation of journalists and analysts. There should, however, at least be smiles on offer when the release of the March quarterly results of the gold mining industry commences today. Following five years in which the rand gold price averaged less than R1,000 a troy ounce, the past six months have finally seen it break through this barrier. Although the average price in 1992 fell by 2 per cent to R979.70 an ounce from R999.50 in 1991 the fourth quarter average rose sharply to R1,002 an ounce from R962 in the third quarter. During the first quarter of 1993 the average price advanced further to R1,029 an ounce. For an industry in which many producers are marginal - defined by the Chamber of Mines as having a profit/revenue ratio of less than 5 per cent - this revenue windfall can translate into an exponential increase in profits. Using the 1992 average price, the Chamber of Mines estimates that 11 mines, producing about 90 tonnes of gold - 15 per cent of the country's annual production of 608.5 tonnes - and employing about 80,000 workers, were marginal. At present prices, these figures will be slightly lower. Ironically, at an industry level, the recent price strength is unlikely to translate into significantly better profits. This is due to the increasing portion of South African production that is hedged - about 16.5 per cent in the December quarter according to estimates made by Ms Robinn Yale Kearney, gold analyst at brokers Silvis Barnard Jacobs and Mellet. She points out that the impact of the higher prices of the past quarter will be to crimp the premium derived from hedging from 2.7 per cent during the December quarter. If costs rise by 2 per the profit margin at the operating level, which 20 years ago was well above 50 per cent, will remain flat at 21 per cent, notwithstanding the 17 per cent increase in the spot rand gold price over the past six months. Although producers will gratefully accept improved revenue from wherever it comes, they would clearly have preferred an improvement in the gold price to a deterioration in the rand/dollar exchange rate. In fact, based on London fixings, the bullion price has weakened in recent quarters - from an average Dollars 347 an ounce in the third quarter of 1992 to Dollars 338 in the fourth quarter and Dollars 329.4 in the first quarter of 1993. Over the same period, however, this 5 per cent weakening in the price has been more than offset by a 13 per cent depreciation of the rand/dollar exchange rate from 2.77, to 3.12. The depreciation of the rand - which is expected to continue, albeit at a slower pace - should not, however, be allowed to disguise fundamental improvements in the health of the gold industry. A year ago Mr Gary Maude, managing director of the Gengold group, one of the main producers, was characterising the mood as one of 'grim determination' with survival the watchword for many marginal mines. Now Mr Maude argues that 'the industry is in much better shape. It is more efficient now than it was a year ago. Changes that needed to be made have been made and unions have supported these changes'. Mr Maude is referring to not only to wage restraint, which has been important, but to changes in working practices. He cites, for example, giving responsibility to smaller working groups at the stope-face. Another innovation, at the managerial level, being practised at Gengold's Buffelsfontein mine is giving responsibility for the management of different shafts to different personnel - including administrative and technical managers. The aim is to foster improved productivity. Such innovation is not specific to Gengold, although it has a strong claim to being the industry leader in this respect. As a general rule, innovation has been most forthcoming where the need has been greatest - that is, at the marginal mines. One of the features of the industry's performance has been the extent to which it has contained costs. Chamber of Mines figures reveal that industry unit costs rose by only 0.91 per cent in 1992. Consumer price inflation, by comparison, was 14 per cent in 1992. The nagging question is whether such improvements can be sustained without jeopardising production. One person not in doubt is Mr Maude who comments: 'The feeling amongst my general managers is that we haven't scratched the surface yet. We haven't really taken advantage yet of the fact that apartheid has gone. We're a very, very inefficient industry because we haven't used our people properly'. An important aspect of cost control has been the introduction of profit-sharing schemes as a quid pro quo for workers receiving low basic wage increases. Wages account for 50 to 55 per cent of mine working costs. Some observers, however, have reservations about the present shape of profit-sharing arrangements which are - with notable exceptions like Randfontein and Harmony - a function of profits, not productivity. Some argue that this is only proper given that workers had been forced to accept low increases because the weak gold price didn't allow for any more. Critics respond by asking what compensation shareholders are being offered for their sacrifices. Chamber of Mines figures show that dividend payments from the industry fell to R1.39bn in 1992 from R2.2bn in 1988 - a decline of about 70 per cent in real terms. Tough times are also reflected in capital expenditure which Ms Kearney estimates has fallen, as a percentage of working capital, to 14.4 per cent in December 1992 from 26 per cent five years previously. This level needs to rise to secure future production and the improved price should aid this.</p>

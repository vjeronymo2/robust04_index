			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FISK'S HOME RUN HELPS CHICAGO BEAT BALTIMORE  </P> <P> Carlton Fisk will probably always be remembered for his dramatic home run that  won a game for the Boston Red Sox in the 1975 World Series.  </P> <P> But, the 41-year-old catcher has played more games for the Chicago White Sox  than he did for the Red Sox, a team he played on for more than a decade.  </P> <P> As the White Sox have built into a pennant contender, Fisk has continued to be  a contributor.  </P> <P> Fisk hit his first home run of the season in dramatic fashion Tuesday night at  Chicago. The two-run homer came with two out in the eighth inning and gave the  surging White Sox a 3-2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles.  </P> <P> The White Sox, who lost 92 games in 1989 and finished 29 1/2 games behind  Oakland in the Western Division, are off to a solid start. With an 18-10  record, they are only two games behind the slumping Athletics. The teams are  tied in the loss column.  </P> <P> The Orioles were leading, 2-1, behind Pete Harnisch (3-1). With two out Dan  Pasqua batted for Ron Kittle and tripled. Fisk followed with his 337th home  run, his 316th as a catcher.  </P> <P> Fisk, who lashed out at younger players recently for their refusal to spend  more hours working on conditioning, didn't change his own routine after the  victory.  </P> <P> Long after his teammates were gone, Fisk was working on his weight program.  </P> <P> "I've learned you have to work," he said. "I've learned to focus on each  at-bat, each pitch. I try to waste nothing. The guys who are able to do that  are the guys who do the best."  </P> <P> Manager Jeff Torborg doesn't worry about Fisk's hitting. He knows just how  valuable the veteran is.  </P> <P> "He makes a big difference to the young pitchers," Torborg said. "He knows how  to handle them, nurse them along, and they have great faith in him.  </P> <P> "Earlier in the season when he was on the disabled list, we were getting bombed  out in nearly every game. Our staff was in shambles. He has straightened it  out."  </P> <P> Cleveland 5, Oakland 4 -- The Athletics are the best defensive team in  baseball. They are also in a slump.  </P> <P> They were guilty of three errors at Cleveland in a rain-delayed contest and  blew a 4-1 lead.  </P> <P> Two of the errors were in the seventh inning to help the Indians score four  runs and hand the A's their fourth defeat in a row.  </P> <P> Jose Canseco hit his 11th home run in the first inning, his third straight over  two games, and Scott Sanderson pitched another strong game until the defense  collapsed.  </P> <P> The big error was by left fielder Rickey Henderson. Henderson dropped a routine  fly ball by Candy Maldonado with two out that permitted the tying and winning  runs to score.  </P> <P> Detroit 3, Texas 2 -- The amazing Cecil Fielder hit his major league leading  14th home run to proved the Tigers with another victory at Arlington, Tex.  </P> <P> Lloyd Moseby opened the seventh with a single and Fielder followed with a  414-foot home run to win it. He has hit 12 home runs and driven in 29 runs in  the last 21 games.  </P> <P> He leads the majors with 34 runs batted in and 14 home runs.  </P> <P> Dan Petry (4-1) won his third in a row to end the Tigers' three-game losing  streak.  </P> <P> New York 7, Minnesota 3 -- Don Mattingly became the 11th player to hit 100 home  runs at Yankee Stadium. It was a three-run homer in the first inning and the  Yankees never looked back.  </P> <P> The fast start helped Chuck Cary win his first start of the season. Cary, out  since mid-April with an inflamed elbow, gave up four hits and a run and struck  out eight in seven innings.  </P> <P> Seattle 4, Toronto 3 -- Mike Brumley tripled and Harold Reynolds singled him  home with one out in the 10th inning at Toronto.

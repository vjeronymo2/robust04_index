			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Arts: Le Chevalier d'Almedo - Avignon Festival THIS year's Avignon Festival opened with the Papal Palace looking like a field of wheat ready to be harvested. Surely, I thought, they cannot be reviving Oklahoma in the Cour d'Honneur? No, not quite - massed ears of golden corn waving in the breeze are what Llouis Pasquale sees as an appropriate setting for a revival of Lope de Vega's play about two unfortunate well-born young lovers called Le Chevalier d'Almedo. Pasquale grew up in a small Spanish village in Catalonia where his father was the baker. Filial piety may therefore have influenced the choice of this background, sumptuously implemented by designer Ezio Frigerio. At first glance, it is an odd setting for a tale where all the intrigue takes place inside Don Pedro's house. But in the event, the Van Gogh-like field of corn gives the play a much needed earthiness, compensating for its total reliance on the artificial Spanish 16th century codes of honour that governed the behaviour of the principals. Although the villain is called Don Rodrigo, we are a long way here from the rhetoric of Corneille's Le Cid. Lopez's characters - Spanish nobility and their servants - do not indulge in those long outpourings beloved of their French counterparts. Although they speak their thoughts aloud in verse, they do so with simple-minded directness. The new French translation by the poet Zeno Bianu captures well this basic verse-dialogue. The characters act more than they talk, impulsively as the blood dictates, and the action moves rapidly forward. Four magnificent horses are the other great feature of the production. The hero Don Alonso appears at the start astride one of them, declares his infatuation with Dona Ines and canters off, only to return on foot to discuss with his servant how he may win her. By her father's design, she is already betrothed to Don Rodrigo. The hero then finds, wandering through the fields, one of those old women who for a small fee are prepared to pass messages between lovers, personages without whom Spanish drama of this period could surely hardly exist. By a quirk of casting, the lively Fabia of Evelyne Istria is in this production of the same generation as the Dona Ines of Isabelle Candelier, matching her wilful innocence with the corrupt wisdom of experience. Soon she has wormed her way inside the house, surreptitiously passing on a billet doux from Don Alonso, and the creaking mechanism begins to unwind. The old woman and her confederate, Tello, Alonsos's valet (Jean-Michel Dupuis) attack their roles with vigour. At one point they are disguised in clerical garb and spout Latin as the heroine purports to take the veil. Their solid vulgar presences tend to eclipse those of the ethereal lovers. Alonso is played by Jean-Marc Barr, the Franco-American actor who appeared with Vanessa Redgrave in Orpheus Descending. The star of the evening is undoubtedly the production. Pasqual weaves the stagey events of the piece - a multiple duel, a ghostly haunting, a conversation through a grille, a bullfight offstage, a royal visitation - into a visually satisfying rural tapestry. Luckily Pasqual believes in the fatality of the play and communicates that belief uninhibitedly. Le Chevalier d'Almedo opened at the Papal Palace in Avignon and will be performed at the Odeon-Theatre de l'Europe in Paris from November 5.</p>

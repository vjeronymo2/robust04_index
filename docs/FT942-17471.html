			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / France in talks on submarine sales to Pakistan Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, said yesterday that France was holding talks with Islamabad about selling French submarines to Pakistan, Reuter reports from New Delhi. 'Yes, we are having discussions on the proposed sale to Pakistan,' Mr Juppe said during a visit to the Indian capital. He declined to identify the submarines France could sell to Pakistan. India has fought three wars with Pakistan since both countries became independent from Britain in 1947 and officials said the proposed sale would strain relations with France. 'Any sale of submarines to Pakistan would raise the already high temperature very drastically,' an Indian diplomat said. 'We don't believe anyone supplying them to Pakistan is truly working for peace.' Mr Juppe denied reports that France was planning to sell Mirage 2000 warplanes to Pakistan. Pakistani officials say privately that Islamabad would want to buy the French aircraft if a stalled deal with Washington for 38 US-built F-16s does not materialise soon. Senior US officials recently offered to revive the deal with Pakistan by making a one-time exception to a US law that bars Washington from supplying arms to Islamabad because Pakistan is suspected of having a nuclear arms programme. Mr Juppe, the first French foreign minister to visit New Delhi in seven years, said he had failed to persuade Indian officials to change their views on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which India has refused to sign. 'France is for the renewal of NPT (next year) without any new conditions. India continues to thinks differently,' he said. Under the NPT treaty, all of India's nuclear facilities would have to be opened to international monitoring. But India says the treaty, which aims to control the spread of nuclear knowhow, favours countries which possess nuclear arms while discriminating against others.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / People: GRE picks Robins from Willis Guardian Royal Exchange, the composite insurer, is breaking new ground by appointing its new chief executive, John Robins, from outside the group. Robins, who is 54, is joining GRE from Willis Corroon, the insurance broker, where he has been group financial director since 1984. Before that he had spent most of his career in the food industry (at Fitch Lovell) and shoe businesses (at Bally Group). He replaces Sid Hopkins, 62, who will retire in August this year after completing 46 years with the group. 'The whole approach to the chief executive position has changed,' explains Keith Lugden, director of corporate communications, who says proven skills in management are now seen as more important qualifications for GRE's senior positions than expertise in insurance. GRE made its first senior appointment from outside the insurance industry when James Morley was made finance director in 1990. Robins leaves Willis at the end of March; he will be replaced by Richard Dalzell.</p>

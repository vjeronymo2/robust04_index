			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has condemned  yesterday's terrorist act that destroyed the bridge over the San  Juan River. De Leon Carpio said he did not want to think that  the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] staged the  attack, because if they did, no one could rely on their  political willingness to achieve peace in Guatemala.    The president confirmed that the damage has been estimated  at  1 million quetzals, including the demolition of the structure,  installation of a Bailey bridge today, and construction of a new  bridge.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Hamid Sa'id article: "The Last Word"] </F>   [Text] It seems to me that the subdistricts development  project, which we have rejoiced in and written about  enthusiastically, has not produced all the results we had hoped  for, nor has it been as successful as we have read in some of  our media.    It is clear to me, at least, that what has been achieved by  this project has not been even in all areas of development. In  some areas, the level of development and the standard of work  was higher than in others.    I had hoped to visit many of those subdistricts to get  directly acquainted with the work that has been achieved by the  development project, but it was not possible for many reasons.  And in the areas I did visit I noticed that the level and  volume of what we termed the development project was not as  described in the news media.    But I have also received letters from several subdistricts  included in the development, and all of them referred to the  many negative points and the artificiality of work on this  project. In several cases, the citizens's basic needs in the  subdistricts have remained unfulfilled.    It appeared to me from some of the letters that the writer  had exaggerated their criticism of the work that had been done  in their subdistricts. Some of the letters said that the funds  that had been spent on developing the subdistricts could have  been used to accomplish something more important, but that the  funds were not spent properly and some subcontractors had  benefited more than the subdistricts themselves.    I cannot confirm or deny what the letters said, but let me  put it this way: the citizens in the subdistricts know more  about their affairs than I do.    Since I have not seen most of the subdistricts, and I cannot  accept all that is contained in the letters either, I can only  say that it is not logical to ignore what has come out in these  letters. I believe that it is essential to establish honest  neutral committees in order to inspect the areas where the work  has taken place.    I hope that these committees will be able to hear what the  citizens have to say and to determine the needs and shortages of  their subdistricts.    We all know that work that is incomplete or ill-considered  often leads to results directly opposed to what was intended.    I asked a National Assembly member about his subdistrict and  what he told me did not please me. He confirmed what was  written in the letter I received from a citizen in his  subdistrict.</p>

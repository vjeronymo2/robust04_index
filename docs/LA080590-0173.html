			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: A CAREER-CONSCIOUS WAITRESS SHAKES A LEG, FINDS JOB SATISFACTION,  HONORS AS PARAMEDIC  </P> <P> More than 11 years ago, Sandra (Sam) Bradley was making good money as a  cocktail waitress, but she longed for a career change.  </P> <P> "I enjoyed my job, but I started wondering what would happen in several years  when my legs were gone," Bradley said. "I was concerned. I also needed  something where there was more advancement," said Bradley, whom everyone calls  Sam. (She got the nickname as a teen-age tomboy and it stuck.)  </P> <P> When a television series about paramedics piqued her interest, Bradley took a  course in basic emergency medical training at Santa Ana College. Soon she was  hired as an emergency medical technician by American Medical Enterprises Inc.  in Whittier.  </P> <P> After working for several years as a medical attendant and ambulance driver for  American Medical, Bradley graduated from Daniel Freeman Paramedic School in  Inglewood. She has worked since then as a paramedic, field supervisor and  instructor of emergency medical training for American Medical.  </P> <P> "When I started, females were rare. Men 18 and 19 were getting into the  business. I was 32," Bradley said. "I have not regretted the change in careers.  After more than 11 years, I'm still here."  </P> <P> Recently, the 43-year-old Whittier resident was named the 1990 Emergency  Medical Services Employee of the Year. The honor was given by the California  Ambulance Assn., a private association representing about 70 companies  throughout the state.  </P> <P> She was recommended for the award because of her dedication to the job, a  continuing quest to become more knowledgeable about her field and her volunteer  work, American Medical founder and owner Joan Woehrmann said.  </P> <P> Bradley currently is assigned to the Vernon Fire Department as a paramedic. The  city contracts with American Medical Enterprises for paramedic services.  </P> <P> "She is very good. She is one of the best out there. She is a dedicated  person," Vernon Fire Chief Larry Spadt said.  </P> <P> Four Long Beach City College employees have received the school's annual  Outstanding Colleague Award. They are Virginia L. Baxter, executive director of  the Long Beach City College Foundation; Margaret O. Brown, a counselor; Mary  Jean Kolasa, an instructor in the English as a Second Language Program; and  August I. Luuga, a programmer analyst.  </P> <P> The director of the Whittier College Center of Mexican-American Affairs, Martin  Ortiz, has been appointed to a three-year term on the National Assn. of  Independent Colleges and Universities Commission on Campus Concerns. Ortiz and  others on the 19-member commission will address issues affecting independent  colleges and universities.  </P> <P> Norwalk Mayor Luigi Vernola had a moving experience recently while vacationing  with his family in Rome. While attending a reception at the Vatican along with  5,000 others, Vernola was greeted by Pope John Paul II with a handshake.  </P> <P> Lacreta Scott has been appointed instructional dean of the liberal arts  division of Cerritos College. Scott has been a member of the college's English  Department since 1980.  </P> <P> Tenants of the Hermitage Village senior citizens apartment in Commerce spent  five months assembling a 7,500 piece jigsaw puzzle of New York. Then they  dismantled it, because the 8-foot-by-3-foot puzzle took up too much space in  the recreation room.  </P> <P> Former residents of Denison, Tex., will hold their annual reunion picnic from  10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Aug. 12 at Recreation Park in Long Beach. Former residents  of Sherman and other nearby towns are invited.  </P> <P> * Miss Long Beach Wendy Leigh Christensen, 20, will compete in the Queen of the  World Pageant, an international beauty competition, in 10 West German cities in  October. After the three-week tour of Germany, Christensen will visit Paris.  </P> <P> * Kamiran S. Badrkhan is the new dean of instruction at Long Beach City  College.  </P> <P> * Noriko Gamblin has been appointed curator for the Long Beach Museum of Art.  </P> <P> * Cal State Long Beach history professor David Cressy has been awarded a  visiting fellowship to Oxford University for 1990-91.  </P> <P> * The new Downey Community Hospital Auxiliary president is Nora Hauret .  </P> <P> * Harvey Hoyo is the new principal of Faye Ross Junior High School in Artesia,  part of the ABC Unified School District.

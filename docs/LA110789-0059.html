			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL BOARD FREEZES SPENDING IN 4 AREAS  </P> <P> Faced with deep budget cuts next year, the Los Angeles Board of Education  agreed Monday to immediately freeze spending in four areas.  </P> <P> Proposed by Board Member Roberta Weintraub, the freeze prohibits hiring of some  outside consultants and spending on new programs, unless cuts are made in other  areas to pay for them.  </P> <P> It also requires that regional and central office job vacancies be left vacant  unless approved by a special district freeze committee, and bars job  reclassifications that require salary increases.  </P> <P> The freezes could save less than $1 million this year, far short of the $115  million to $180 million in spending reductions that may be necessary in the  1990-91 budget, financial experts say.  </P></p>

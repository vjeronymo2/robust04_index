			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: NFC Yesterday's Pounds 82.5m convertible bond issue by NFC was a rare event indeed. Such issues have been scarce since the Accounting Standards Board decided that convertible liabilities should not be dressed up as equity. The problem is one of constrained supply rather than limited demand. Sterling's weakness may discourage overseas buyers. But with interest rates expected to fall and some uncertainty over the trend in corporate earnings, the combination of a 7 3/4 per cent fixed income and an option on equity looks, arguably, more tempting than ever. Without the accounting advantages, though, convertibles have less appeal to many issuing companies. To protect their pre-emption rights, UK institutions have set an effective limit of 5 per cent of equity capital for convertible issues. Only companies of the stature of Hanson can raise really large amounts. Share prices may also have to show a more sustained rally before many companies are tempted to consider rights issues or any other equity-linked finance. NFC is, perhaps, a special case. Its shares have outperformed throughout the recession. Yet the high proportion of employees on the share register rules out a rights issue. The cash will be used to repay bank debt, but looking ahead will doubtless fund a continuing steady expansion. The 6 per cent fall in the shares yesterday simply reflects switching from the cash stock to the convertible. It can thus be dismissed as simply technical.</p>

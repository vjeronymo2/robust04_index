			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Banda loses in Malawi's first free poll Malawi's autocratic president Hastings Kamuzu Banda conceded victory yesterday to opposition leader Bakili Muluzi after ruling the small central African nation for more than 30 years. In a halting voice, Dr Banda congratulated Mr Muluzi, a 51-year-old businessman and leader of the opposition United Democratic Front, over state radio for winning the country's first multi-party elections since independence from Britain in 1964. Tens of thousands of singing, chanting Malawians poured into the streets of the commercial capital Blantyre in festive celebration, many waving the yellow flag of the UDF. Mr Muluzi, will seek to form a coalition government with Chakufwa Chihana's Alliance for Democracy (Aford), if, as seems likely, he fails to secure an overall majority in the 177 seat assembly. Mr Maluzi said yesterday he was concerned about the north-south polarisation demonstrated by the poll where most of the electorate voted along regional lines. 'I don't want to be president of a divided country,' he said, adding that he would rather work with Aford than lead a minority government or approach President Banda's Malawi Congress Party. Publication of final results was delayed by logistical problems in the count and by allegations of rigging in three Shire Valley constituencies. In the parliamentary ballot, Aford has taken all 33 seats in the northern region, mostly by huge majorities. The MCP vote held up well in rural areas of the centre, but urban areas fell to the UDF, which swept most seats in its southern base. With counting nearing completion a spokesman for the Electoral Commission said that 'unofficial figures' give Mr Muluzi's party 85 seats against 57 for the MCP and 35 for Aford. The danger of the north becoming futher isolated may encourage Mr Muluzi to offer Mr Chihana the vice presidency. This is in Mr Muluzi's gift, since he did not name a running mate, apparently trying to avoid conflict between various contenders within his own camp. But Mr Chihana stated before the election he would not accept a UDF cabinet post because the party leadership was tainted by former association with the MCP.</p>

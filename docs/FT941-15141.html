			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Games duopoly Sonic the Hedgehog and Super Mario Brothers have captured the hearts and minds of children throughout the world. But, at a cost of anything up to Pounds 60 a time in the UK, video games are anything but cheap. Hence, last week's decision by Britain's Office of Fair Trading to refer the industry to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. There is a strong prima facie case that prices are artificially high because of insufficient competition. Sega and Nintendo, the two Japanese companies which dominate the Pounds 9bn-a-year global market, have a combined market share of over 90 per cent. They have used this duopoly power to earn fat profit margins. The duopoly's dominance is not confined to hardware. It embraces software too, as anybody wishing to produce games to use in Sega's and Nintendo's machines must first reach a licensing arrangement with the companies. A further concern in the UK has been that video games are roughly 30 per cent more expensive than in the US. This is partly because retailers' margins and indirect taxes are higher in Britain. But it is also possible that Sega and Nintendo are charging higher wholesale prices than in the US. Their use of different technical standards on either side of the Atlantic suggests that they may be segmenting the market in order to discriminate on prices. But even if the Monopolies Commission finds that the duopoly operates against the public interest, it will face a tricky task deciding what to do. One option would be to impose price controls. But such heavy-handed action would prevent competition developing. Another option would be to attack the licensing arrangements which enable Sega and Nintendo to extend their dominance in hardware to software. Such an approach would complement legal moves in the US and Britain by rival software producers which wish to sell their games direct to customers without paying royalties to the duopoly. The snag here is that licensing arrangements are often global in scope, so action by the UK alone could have only limited impact. Many software suppliers might not wish to compete aggressively with Sega and Nintendo in Britain if they were still tied to them in other markets. The final option is to do nothing and allow market forces and technological advances to undermine Sega's and Nintendo's dominance. That may seem a cop-out. But given that Sony and Matsushita, the Japanese consumer electronics giants, have been tempted into the market by its high margins, inaction may not be such a bad idea.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Press release" from the Estonian Ministry of Foreign </F> Affairs in Tallinn on 3 March]    [Text] March 3, 1994 -- At a press conference following  the 17th round of Estonian-Russian talks in Tallinn March 2,  Russian Ambassador Vasiliy Svirin again described Russian  military pensioners in Estonia as "mostly old age people," a  characterization greatly at odds with reality. Mr. Svirin  claimed that a lack of "social guarantees" for retired former  Soviet occupation (now Russian) soldiers in Estonia is one  reason why the remaining 2,600 active duty troops cannot be  withdrawn by Russia.    Although required to withdraw its troops from Estonia  "completely and unconditionally," Russia continues to delay and  unilaterally to attach conditions. Russia is demanding that, in  addition to providing "social guarantees," Estonia make a very  generous gift to its former occupiers by giving Russian military  personnel title to the apartments or houses in which they live  in Estonia. Russia also demands that Estonia pay $23,000,000 to  build housing for the troops being withdrawn from Estonia. This  works out to about $10,000 per Russian soldier still in Estonia.    Moscow pays military pensions to 10,570 persons in Estonia.  This includes pensioners of the armed forces, the border guard,  internal troops and KGB and persons who receive assistance due  to loss of income earner. Although under no obligation to do  so, Estonia has set up a procedure by which retired Russian  military personnel can apply for residence permits in Estonia.  Due to obvious national security concerns and the special  nature of this category of pensioner, each case must be  individually evaluated and decided by the Estonian authorities.    The retired Russian military are surprisingly young. Over  6,000 are under the age of sixty. Of these, over 1,000 are  under 50, with 360 of them between the ages of 35 and 45.    Typical Russian military pensioners in Estonia include:    Gennadiy A, age 41. Counterintelligence. Tallinn.    Yuriy R, age 39. Counterintelligence. Tallinn.    Gennadiy G, age 40. Counterintelligence. Tallinn.    Gennadiy S, age 36. Assault paratrooper. Viljandi.    Valeriy S, age 37. Assault paratrooper. Viljandi.    Pavel P, age 37. Counterintelligence. Klooga.    Ivan P, age 46. Counterintelligence. Tallinn.    Vadim K, age 43. Counterintelligence. Tallinn.    Aleksandr J, age 44. Counterintelligence. Tallinn.    Andrey P, age 37. Assault paratrooper. Viljandi.    Sergey S, age 41. Assault paratrooper. Viljandi.    Vladimir K, age 42. Assault paratrooper. Viljandi.    Russian military pensioners in Estonia have formed a War  Veteran's Union. The Russian military presence in all its forms  in Estonia represents a great threat to Estonia's security and  stability. Not only do they harass the local residents, but  they are also known to have close connections to criminal  elements. Their ready access to weapons and explosives compounds  the danger.</p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EUROPE TV QUOTA DOESN'T RATTLE HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> Hollywood video and film salesmen who are leaving for the French Riviera this  week to sell their wares at an annual international TV programming bazaar seem  to be of two minds on Europe's recent adoption of a non-binding quota on the  amount of foreign productions that may be shown on European television. Either  they're diplomatically dubious . . .  </P> <P> "I'm not sure at this point in time that it's going to have an immediate effect  on producers or programs that are being produced here in the U.S.," said Phil  Corvo, executive director of the National Assn. of Television Programming  Executives International.  </P> <P> . . . or they are openly scoffing.  </P> <P> "It's impossible," said Colin Davis, president of MCA TV International. "They  simply cannot fill their airwaves without us."  </P> <P> "To me, it's a form of censorship and it's not going to work," said Joe  Levinsohn, senior vice president for international sales for Republic Films.  "People in Europe want American programs. They're going to write letters  protesting it and the whole thing is going to backfire."  </P> <P> The non-binding quota, approved on a 10-2 vote of the European Community in  Luxembourg last week, restricts foreign programming on TV stations in each  member country to no more than half of its total entertainment programming.  Since the 12-nation economic and cultural alliance first discussed the  possibility nearly two years ago, the underlying idea of quotas has been to  encourage production in its own countries.  </P> <P> But the reality of the rush to the Marche International de Filmes et des  Programmes Pour La TV, La Video, Le Cable et Le Satellite, which opens Thursday  in Cannes, seems to fly in the face of the European Community's proclamation.  The annual fall flea market of old television series, specials and movies has  more than doubled in size since it began five years ago, said spokeswoman  Rebecca Segal.  </P> <P> As of the weekend, the gathering had 1,143 pre-registered buyers, and officials  expected even more to show up, currency in hand, when the five-day sales  conference officially opens. More than 600 companies will be selling thousands  of hours of TV shows and motion pictures.  </P> <P> The reasons are as simple as satellites, the explosion of commercial television  in Western Europe and 320 million potential European couch potatoes. As  recently as August, Spain joined France, Britain and Italy in granting licenses  to three new privately owned and operated television operations that will  compete for a share of the Spanish audience. Private TV operations that put  their signals up on satellite or link themselves to millions of French, Italian  and British homes through cable are scrambling for something to put on the air  between commercials.  </P> <P> "Quotas don't work," Davis said flatly.  </P> <P> "What're they going to do? Put on some el cheapo game show? That was the  Canadian solution."  </P> <P> Several years ago, Canada imposed content regulations on TV programming in an  effort to discourage a flood of American shows across the border. But Canadian  audiences proved too insatiable for the meager output that Canadian television  producers were capable of generating, said Davis, and the result was an  inevitable slide back to American sitcoms and dramas.  </P> <P> "Canada has content regulation and what do they have in prime time? American  programs, that's what they have," Levinsohn declared.  </P> <P> Since the Marche International de Filmes et des Programmes Pour La TV, La  Video, Le Cable et Le Satellite's first sales conference in 1984, each of the  major countries in the European Community has loosened restrictions on  privately operated TV operations. As a result, audiences -- first in Britain  and soon, thereafter, in France and Italy -- now have several commercial  stations to choose from in addition to the traditional state-run operations  such as the venerable British Broadcasting Corp. The number of channels in  Western Europe is expected to double over the next 10 years.  </P> <P> According to video salesmen such as Republic's Levinsohn and MCA's Davis,  Europe's new hard line on the import of American programming is too little too  late -- a feeble finger in the dike that cannot hold back an ocean of 40 years'  worth of American sitcoms, cop shows and family drama whether its quality by  current U.S. prime-time standards is good, bad or dismal.  </P> <P> Take "Captain Nice," for example.  </P> <P> "I've never seen it, but I sold 15 episodes to France and Italy," Republic's  Levinsohn said. "Don't ask me what its about."  </P> <P> The short-lived 1967 sitcom, created by Buck Henry, was a parody of superhero  shows that were in vogue 20 years ago as a partial result of the success of the  "Batman" TV series. It is one of several dozen old NBC shows that Republic  inherited from the network in a Republic purchase from the NBC library, said  Levinsohn.  </P> <P> "I have it and I sold it!" Levinsohn said. "It's not 'Beauty and the Beast,'  but it's American programming. It's 'Captain Nice' and it's going off in prime  time in France and Italy."  </P> <P> "Beauty and the Beast," the CBS romantic series, is one of the newer offerings  Republic is hawking in Europe. It's even more in demand, all around the globe.  </P> <P> "I've sold it in 95 countries so far," said Levinsohn. "The bottom line is that  American programming is in demand worldwide. They're paying a lot of money for  it and I'm not the only one selling it."  </P> <P> Indeed, Davis' small army of salesmen at MCA TV International may not be  selling everything from A to Z, but they have more than 150 half-hour, hour and  90-minute series running the gamut from A ("Adam-12," "Amen," "Airwolf") to W  ("Whiz Kids," "Wagon Train" "When the Whistle Blows").  </P> <P> With its recent acquisition of Lorimar and its legendary "Dallas" package so  reverently embraced by European audiences, Warner Bros. Television Distribution  would appear to be the biggest player in the high-stakes European TV  syndication game. But at the moment, any company with any kind of a library of  American films or video is running a candy store, and Western Europe is jammed  with hungry kids.  </P> <P> Though they don't feel threatened, several American companies are forming  co-production operations with European producers just in case the 50% quota  does go into effect in two years as the new European Community law dictates.  </P> <P> King World TV, producers of "Wheel of Fortune," currently franchises the game  show to co-producers in France, Scotland and other countries under an agreement  that allows a European version of the program to be produced and aired in each  licensed nation, thereby circumventing the quota.  </P> <P> Blair Entertainment has a similar co-production plan with Fremantle  International/Talbot Television, a British company. Under the Blair/Fremantle  plan, the syndicated U.S. show "Divorce Court" is re-produced in Europe, using  American scripts that have been tailored both to the language of the country  and to local divorce laws. Spain, France, West Germany and Italy have already  signed production agreements and Blair hopes to sell its proposal to the rest  of Europe next week.  </P></p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / New EBRD chief plans sweeping changes A SWEEPING reorganisation of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will be announced on Monday by Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the central banker who took over as its president just over a month ago. The restructuring of the aid bank, whose former president Mr Jacques Attali resigned this summer after the bank was criticised for its extravagance and poor internal management, aims to make it more 'user friendly' and responsive to the 'specific needs' of countries in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe, according to a board document. The bank's most distinctive division, merchant banking, which uniquely among international aid banks concentrates on privatisation, will disappear. The presidential cabinet and the political department, two departments highly valued by Mr Attali, are also being abolished. The cabinet was an inner circle of executives advising the president and the political department was a team of political specialists, who offended some east European governments with analyses of politicial stability. The press and public affairs department is also being cut back, with up to half of its 18 staff going. There will be up to 50 redundancies out of a total executive staff of 703. The bank's board, which represents the countries and agencies that own the bank, is expected to approve the reorganisation at a meeting on Monday. 'It will then be put into effect immediately,' said a bank executive. Mr de Larosiere's first working day at the bank was October 4. 'He has moved incredibly quickly to make his mark,' commented an executive. 'We had a big morale problem after all the criticism in the spring and summer. It was important for staff to know how we were going to move forward.' The merchant banking division will be combined with the development banking division, which concentrates on financing and advising on infrastructure projects, such as transport, banking and telecommunications systems. But they will not be combined into a single division. Instead, one new department will provide merchant banking and infrastructure services to northern countries and another will be created for the south. A board document explains that the 'need for enhanced country focus must be addressed within the context of one operational strategy'. It continues: 'The notion of limited resources forces the bank to focus on its real priorities and to streamline its organisation in order to work in the most cost-effective way.' There will, however, be a new central unit to provide functions spanning both the north and south departments, which will carry out marketing and procurement. Mr de Larosiere has also commissioned a team headed by the bank's new economist, Mr Nick Stern, to carry out a fundamental review of the bank's strategy and priorities. Observer, Page 19</p>

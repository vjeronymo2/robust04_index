			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Cossetting turns a journey into a voyage - How BR's cross country service is seeking more long-distance travellers British Rail's promotion of its high-speed InterCity links has been highly successful. It faces a harder task 'selling' the attractions of its slower, cross-country services. One initiative which seems to be working, though, is BR's new Voyager service for the long-distance traveller, which uses a marketing approach likely to be more widely adopted when parts of the state-controlled rail network are franchised out to the private sector. The problem on many of BR's longer routes is appealing to distinct types of customer - short journey commuters, 'long haul' businessmen, and holidaymakers. The daytime Cornishman, for example, which takes nearly 12 hours to cover the 689 miles from Dundee to Penzance, starts as a commuter train around Dundee and then carries business travellers between Edinburgh and York, and Birmingham and Bristol. From Bristol west to its final destination, commuters and leisure travellers again predominate. The challenge for BR has been to persuade more travellers to take the train for its entire journey or at least a substantial part of it. InterCity Cross Country not only has to overcome travellers' reluctance to use the train. It also faces stiff competition from express coaches, which now account for nearly 15 per cent of leisure travel between Scotland and the south-west of England, a similar percentage to that taken by rail. The airlines have a one per cent market share with the rest accounted for by the private car. InterCity talked to people who had not used a train for at least 10 years, asking their views on ticket prices, standards of buffet service and overcrowding. Many were quite nervous about making a long journey; they were unsettled by the comings and goings of the short-distance travellers and concerned about leaving their seat and their luggage to go for refreshments. 'People wanted more than a seat on a train,' says Alison Morris, marketing development manager for InterCity Cross Country services. 'We had to devise a service which matched the cossetting which the coaches and the airlines give their passengers.' Intercity Cross Country's response was to launch its Voyager service. Tickets must be bought by noon on the day before travelling and this automatically reserves a seat in a specially designated carriage from which other travellers are barred. A steward or stewardess is allocated to the Voyager carriage for the entire journey; two hot meals and regular tea and coffee are provided at the traveller's seat as part of the price. This additional level of service has proved popular with the elderly travellers who make up the bulk of the leisure market between Scotland and the south-west. Many are women travelling alone to visit relatives. Before the Voyager service was launched last May, 50 people per train in summer were making the entire journey and just under 40 in winter. A recent survey showed that 23 per cent of travellers said they would not have taken the train but for Voyager. From this it forecasts about 600 extra passengers in its first year. This is not a large addition to the numbers already travelling but Cross Country believes the service will attract more as it becomes better known. Ninety-six per cent of travellers said they were satisfied with the service. InterCity Cross Country recently extended the service to cover journeys starting from the north-east of England to the south-west and is thinking of introducing it on its routes from Scotland to south coast resorts such as Poole and Brighton. When Cross Country, like BR's other subsidiaries, is franchised out to the private sector, innovative marketing is one tool which many BR managers intent on buy-outs plan to employ.</p>

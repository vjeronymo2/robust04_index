			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Violence in the US: Politicians take common line across race and party divide - The leaders who have to pick up the pieces when the violence subsides IT is hard to think of two politicians on the surface more different than Mr Tom Bradley, mayor of Los Angeles, and Mr Pete Wilson, governor of California. The mayor is black, bulky, a Democrat, a cautious consensus builder and, at 75, near the end of a distinguished political career that has spanned 19 years running the state's biggest city, two attempts at the governorship and serious consideration, in 1984, as a vice presidential candidate. The governor is white, trim, a Republican, a born-again activist and, at 58, very much in his political prime, having served as mayor of San Diego, in the US Senate and since the start of last year running the nation's biggest state. He is on everybody's shortlist as a presidential candidate in 1996. Yet these are two men in whom surface appearances are deceptive. What has been striking in the 48 hours since Los Angeles erupted has been the identity of their opinions. Both have made no bones of their disbelief at the acquittal of the four police officers and both have warned that continued rioting will bring the full retribution of the law. Mr Tom Bradley is known locally as the 'Teflon mayor,' on whom, like Mr Ronald Reagan, no mud sticks. The son of a Texas sharecropper, a lawyer and former policeman, he is credited with keeping the lid on the volatile Los Angeles ethnic cocktail. But he is also given credit for ensuring that downtown Los Angeles at least did not suffer the physical decay of so many other American cities. He encouraged external investment in the urban centre, especially from the Japanese. He has been criticised for not reacting sharply enough when the King beating hit the television screens in March last year and for not instantly calling for the removal of Mr Daryl Gates, the controversial police chief. But he did convene a special commission that produced a damaging report on the police department's practices and, finally, he did this March call for Mr Gates's retirement. Mr Pete Wilson was considered cautious too, when he took over the governorship at the start of last year, but no longer. For his tenure has been remarkable for his breaking with Republican orthodox doctrine in his assault on the state's fiscal crisis. He is now seen as the state's most interventionist and innovative governor since Mr Pat Brown, Jerry's father, in the early 1960s. The Wilson formula has been, astonishingly for a Republican forged in the Reagan era, to increase taxes. Moreover he did so by working with, not against, the Democratic majority in the state assembly. He describes his philosophy as 'activism in a preventative way.' There was, perhaps, no way that he, or Mayor Bradley, could have prevented the spontaneous combustion of Wednesday night in Los Angeles but it is obvious that both are going to be active in seeing that it comes to an end. What happens after that, however, will be a bigger test of their capabilities. Success or failure may add lustre or tarnish the mayor's last years, but it may also determine whether the governor makes it to the White House four and a half years from now.</p>

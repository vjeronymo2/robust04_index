			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith attacks rise in crime MR JOHN SMITH yesterday urged the government to act over rising crime rates, saying it was 'a deplorable indictment of Conservative government' that crime had more than doubled during the party's years in office. During exchanges at Commons question time, the Labour leader asked the prime minister whether he thought it was 'remotely tolerable' that there were 'something like 25,000 break-ins in this country every week.' 'When are you going to do something about protecting our citizens from that?', Mr Smith asked. Mr John Major retorted by arguing the government's record on combating crime was 'comparable with that of other countries in western Europe.' Ever since the second world war, crime had increased under all governments. The prime minister said: 'You seem to want to put the blame for each and every thing on the shoulders of the government . . ' Government action on the problem had included the Public Order Act, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, two Criminal Justice Acts, the Prison Security Act and an Act to ban joyriding, he told Mr Smith, 'each and every one of which was opposed by you and your party'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 22 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia,  one of the emerging and fast growing economies in Southeast  Asia, can serve as a gateway for Mexican investors for the rest  of the region, Energy, Telecommunications, and Posts Minister S.  Samy Vellu said.    Malaysia's favourable investment incentives and its  off-shore  finanial centre would facilitate the flow of capital to the  region, he added.    The prospect of trade between both countries is bright and  tremendous as both governments have liberalised and privatised  state-run companies, including various utilities, he said.    He was speaking at the signing of a memorandum of  understanding [MOU] on communications between Mexico and  Malaysia in Mexico City Tuesday. The text of his speech was  released by his ministry here wednesday.    Minister of Communications and Transport Emilio Gamboa  Tatron  signed for the Mexican Government.    Under the MOU, both sides would explore the possibility of  using their satellite systems to handle communications traffic  between Latin America and the Asian region.    The Malaysian East Asia Satellite (Measat) is due for launch  next year, while Mexico already has its Solidaridad satellite.    The MOU would also explore the technical and economic  feasabilities of using both satellites to handle communications  traffic between both countries.</p>

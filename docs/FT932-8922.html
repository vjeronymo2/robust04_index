			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: London International London International Group should know perfectly well that the fact that everyone else is at it is no excuse for not taking precautions. Since, for once, it had firm evidence to go on, the stock exchange was right to censure it for selective dissemination of information. Companies such as LIG may like to prepare the market for disappointing news, but it is difficult to defend a procedure that gave 13 analysts and four institutions an advantage over the rest of the market. If that is common practice, as LIG claims, it is only because such clear infringements of the exchange's rules are difficult to prove. The exchange seems inclined to try harder after the Tiphook insider controversy and the Thorold Mackie case in Scotland. If it is interested in the integrity of its markets, the City should wish it luck. Tomkins showed this week that extensive disclosure still leaves a role for analysts. Its statement on the integration of RHM may have been mainly designed to boost its share price, but it was also a good example of how private briefing can be combined with public information. While wielding a bigger stick, the exchange should be sure to encourage this approach. Otherwise companies may end up disclosing even less.</p>

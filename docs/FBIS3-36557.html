			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service in  Ukrainian at 1400 GMT on 5 February begins broadcasting a live  phone-in program with Ivan Plyushch, chairman of Ukraine's  Supreme Council.    The program begins with Plyushch answering several questions  of a personal nature. He says that he is a self-critical  person, that his Ukrainian, although often criticized as being  far from literary, is the language spoken by ordinary people and  there is nothing wrong with a statesman speaking this language,  and that playing card games is his hobby.    Replying to a question from a program moderator on the cause  of the deep economic crisis that hit Ukraine despite the fact  that it was considered to have the greatest potential of all the  former USSR countries, Ivan Plyushch says that this is nothing  but a misconception. Ukraine did have better economic potential  but not starting opportunities, which are a different matter, he  says. The coal and ore mining enterprises in the Donetsk coal  basin and Krivoy Rog basin were supposed to be cost-effective  within the framework of the Warsaw Treaty organization but now  they are a burden for Ukraine. The Chernobyl disaster and the  huge army with the military and industrial complex should be  added to this, he states. These three factors consume one third  of Ukraine's budget. "Do we need such an army?" he asks. "We  started from almost 1 million. Now we have already reduced it  down to half a million, on paper. But today we pay more to the  pensioners, who had once been wearing shoulder straps, than to  maintain regular servicemen," he says.    Answering a question from a listener from New York Plyushch  points out that no help from the outside can lead a country as  big as Ukraine out of the crisis. The only way out is to ensure  conditions enabling the people of Ukraine to work efficiently  and fruitfully, he states. He admits that the parliament does  more toward solving political issues rather than economic.  Plyushch blames the government for introducing too many  amendments to the legislation worked out by the parliament,  which only steps up chaos. He says that the current parliament  is still to adopt the law on the election of local councils, in  compliance with the law on the formation of the local power  bodies and regional self-government, and the law on the election  of the president. Both elections are scheduled to take place  simultaneously in June 1994. "Besides, consultations are under  way with the government and the president on introducing  amendments and additions to the current legislation in February,  which would not hamper, not stand in the way of the economic  reforms, but, on the contrary, which would open up the way for  economic reforms," he states.    Answering a question from a listener from the Netherlands,  Plyushch says: "There are no countries encroaching upon  Ukraine's territorial integrity, except for the already  nonexistent parliament of the Russian Federation, which made a  notorious decision on Sevastopol that was condemned by the world  public and by such a structure as the UN Security Council. To a  certain extent one can link the election of Meshkov, president  of the Crimea, with the encroachments of the Russian  pro-imperial forces. However, in our policy and practical  actions we must proceed from interstate bilateral relations. At  present, we have such relations, which give us no grounds to  assert this. In addition, you know that in the latest  trilateral statement by Kravchuk, Yeltsin, and Clinton the sides  declare that they will not make territorial claims. Moreover,  they will not interfere in the internal affairs and, on the  contrary, will do everything to ensure territorial integrity,  noninterference, and collective security."    In his reply to a listener from Bavaria, Germany, who  expresses his dissatisfaction with the dominance of the Russian  language in Ukraine and the encroachment on Ukraine's  sovereignty, Plyushch says that the law on languages was adopted  in Ukraine. However the consolidation of Ukrainian as the state  language needs time and money, he says. Plyushch also remarks  that 149 countries have recognized Ukraine and diplomatic  relations have been established with 133 countries. Ukrainian  diplomatic representations are functioning in more than 40  countries. This means that Ukraine has consolidated its status  as a member of the European and world communities, he states.    In his reply to a listener from Australia who wants to know  what prompted Plyushch to write his book Who Are We And  Where Are We Going?, he says that this is a collection of  his speeches made over the past four years, published with the  sponsorship of the Soros Foundation. Ivan Plyushch says the  contents of all his speeches prove the invariability of his  stand and adherence to the ideas of democracy, glasnost, market  economy, Ukraine's sovereignty, and independence.    The program moderator asks Plyushch about his attitude  toward  such economists as Lanovyy, Pynzenyk, Pylypchuk, and Chernyak,  who are well known in Ukraine as proponents of market economy  and whose economic programs, however, were turned down. The  parliament speaker says he always respected the above economists  and respects them now, but they would never be a success unless  there was a unity of actions and a consensus between the  proponents of the market economy and those who stand on the  principles of administration-by-mere injunction.    In his reply to a listener from the United States concerning  the necessity of a spiritual revolution, Plyushch says that the  government's support for science and education is insufficient.  The trilateral statement, signed by Kravchuk, Yeltsin, and  Clinton, envisages $500,000 in aid to Ukraine. This will help  Ukraine solve at least some of its problems. He says: "This is  why the parliament did it right when it ratified START I and  allowed the government to exchange the instruments of  ratification and conclude direct agreements in fulfilment of all  the reservations put forth by the Supreme Council."    Concerning the issue of dual citizenship, touched upon by a  listener from Great Britain, Plyushch says that issues of dual  citizenship are considered in every individual case on a  bilateral basis.    The program moderator asks Plyushch about his attitude  toward  the economic union within the CIS. He also adds that Plyushch  was once against such a union and since then Ukraine has become  its associate member. Plyushch says: "I am not against the  economic union, and you, please, never say this again anywhere."  "I was saying an absolutely different thing. I was saying that  our country is a CIS member. We have already concluded more  than 400 various treaties and agreements and none of these  works. So, what kind of a union do you need?" He adds: "Who  stands in the way of their fulfillment? Who is talking about  some new economic union, some new agreements? Let him not  deceive anyone. What I have in mind is this: It is necessary  either to set up such a structure that would force the  fulfillment of those agreements or they must be fulfilled on a  bilateral, mutually advantageous basis."    Concerning the results of the work done by the Parliamentary  Assembly of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation, Plyushch says it  is too early to speak about any results, although the good  intentions of the Black Sea basin countries to solve their  problems jointly is a positive result in itself. Answering a  question from the moderator whether Turkey allowed the passage  of oil tankers to Ukraine through the Bosporus, Plyushch says:  "Turkey has never refused to do this. That was just an intrigue  by our wire-pullers."    In his reply to a listener from the United States concerning  the division of the former USSR assets, Plyushch indicates that  Ukraine had not received anything so far. On its part Ukraine  also failed to pay off its share of the former USSR debt. He  says: "There is an agreement at the level of governments that  the tactical nuclear weapons, which were withdrawn from Ukraine,  the cost of the uranium in those weapons, will be counted to  settle Ukraine's share of the former USSR debt."    Concerning Ukraine's security, Plyushch says that Ukraine is  a member of all the international institutions and structures  dealing with collective security. He expresses certainty that  the trilateral statement, signed by Kravchuk, Yeltsin, and  Clinton in Moscow, should contribute to consolidating Ukraine's  security.    Answering a question from a listener in Kiev concerning the  internal debt of Ukraine's government due to the USSR  disintegration, Plyushch confirms that the government of Ukraine  must compensate for the bonds and other securities of the former  USSR possessed by Ukrainian citizens.    Concerning the upcoming parliamentary election in Ukraine,  the parliament speaker expresses his strong conviction that the  election will take place without fail. At present 1,612  candidates for deputies are registered in Ukraine of whom 927  were nominated by electors, 500 by working collectives, and only  183 by political parties. Plyushch says that this is the result  of the fact that the parties pursue, first and foremost, their  own selfish, narrow-party, group interests. This is why their  members continue to say that the election will fail to take  place.    Answering a listener's question concerning the reliability  of  the trilateral statement signed in Moscow, Plyushch says: "I  believe that the president of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, made a  decisive, bold, and the only correct move when he signed the  trilateral agreement and its appendix. Today this is not only  my own opinion but the opinion of the 260 deputies who endorsed  this move with their votes. President Kravchuk was acting in  line with the reservations that had been made by the Supreme  Council on 18 November last year during the ratification."    Plyushch welcomes the ever-growing activity and  participation  of the new business representatives in the election campaign but  remarks that this refers to honest businessmen, not those who  make their money by plundering the national wealth.    Concerning the issue of privatization, touched upon by a  listener from Belgium, Plyushch says privatization in Ukraine is  backed up by a whole number of relevant laws. However, it is  hampered by the absence of those wishing to privatize property  and lack of finances.    Touching on the issue of building an oil terminal in Odessa,  raised by the program moderator, Plyushch says that today  Ukraine imports 90 percent of its oil. It would be unwise to  have only one source for the oil supply. This is why it is  necessary to have alternative sources. Even without the  terminal, which is being built in Odessa, Ukraine is already now  prepared to receive up to 5 million tons of oil. As for the  extraction of oil in Ukraine, experts say it can be increased up  to 10 million tons, but this will not be enough anyway, because  Ukraine needs at least 40 million tons.    Answering a question from a listener from Great Britain  concerning the fact that Kazakhstan is not in a hurry to  eliminate its nuclear weapons while Ukraine is eliminating  theirs, Plyushch says that in its declaration Ukraine pledged to  be a nonnuclear and nonaligned state. The nuclear weapons,  inherited by Ukraine from the former USSR, can be neither used,  maintained, nor modernized by Ukraine. "Besides, in the future  Ukraine is to become a nonnuclear state. It will accede to the  nuclear nonproliferation treaty. More than 130 countries have  already acceded to it and 180 countries, as far as I know,  intend to accede to it. We will be a peace-loving state,"  Plyushch says.    Dwelling on the issue of mutual settlements between Ukraine  and Russia raised by a listener from Belgium, Plyushch admits  that the balance of payments today is not in favor of Ukraine.  "We are far from covering the cost of the power sources,  received from Russia, by our products exported to Russia," he  states.    Concerning the issue of borders between Ukraine and Russia,  raised by the same listener, Plyushch says that it would take  time to built genuine borders.    To conclude the question-and-answer session, Plyushch says  that foreign observers are expected to take part in the coming  parliamentary election in Ukraine. The program ends at 1530 GMT.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> 3 ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS SUE EXXON FOR BILLIONS TO RESTORE FOULED AREAS  </P> <P> Exxon Corp. should be forced to pay billions of dollars to restore Alaskan  areas fouled by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, three environmental groups said  today in announcing a lawsuit against the company.  </P> <P> The suit was to be filed later in the day in Alaska Superior Court.  </P> <P> It seeks to force Exxon and the Alyeska pipeline company to finance the cleanup  and restoration of the environment through an independently supervised trust  fund after the March 24 tanker spill of about 11 million gallons of oil into  Alaska's once-pristine Prince William Sound.  </P> <P> "We expect that the fund will amount to billions of dollars," said Sharon  Newsome, vice president of the National Wildlife Federation. Other participants  in the suit are the Wildlife Federation of Alaska and the Natural Resources  Defense Council.  </P> <P> The suit also seeks punitive damages against the companies, alleging that they  engaged in fraud and misrepresentation of their ability to react to a major oil  spill. The damages would be paid into the fund.  </P> <P> Exxon already faces 150 lawsuits, mainly by Alaskans whose livelihoods were  impaired by the oil spill. In addition, the state of Alaska filed suit Tuesday  seeking unspecified damages.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Oblast News" ] </F>   [Text] Representatives from Russia, Japan, Poland, U.S.,  South Korea, and the PRC recently signed an agreement in the  U.S. capital of Washington to regulate Alaska pollock fishing in  the central part of the Bering Sea. Our correspondent Yuriy  Kuzmenko asked Stanislav Mikhaylovich Korochkin, chief of  Magadan Basin Okhotrybvod [Okhotsk Sea Fishing Administration]  Department to comment on the event.    [Begin recording] [Kuzmenko] Stanislav Mikhaylovich, does  the Washington agreement specifically provide solutions to  problems affecting the central part of the Okhotsk Sea?    [Korochkin] After a great deal of preparatory work, three  years of preparatory work and 10 meetings, six countries finally  signed an agreement in Washington agreeing to regulate fishing  in the central part of the Bering Sea. Subsequently, if  governments of four countries ratify this agreement, it will  acquire the power of a convention with all its ensuing  consequences. A fishing moratorium has been placed on the  central part of the Bering Sea until the end of 1994, after  which, a committee will be formed to determine the Alaska  pollock catch quotas based on research into stocks. The fishing  quotas will be distributed at a conference of the member  countries. Moreover, I want to emphasize that Russia and the  United States will have 80 percent of the possible catch, 20  percent will be shared by the remaining countries. It can be  said without exaggeration that this is a unique agreement. This  is the first time that such an agreement has been signed  concerning the northern Pacific Ocean and this, of course, gives  certain hope that a similar solution can be found to the central  Okhotsk Sea issue.    [Kuzmenko] So this means that there is hope that foreign  fishermen will cease their shameful conduct in the Okhotsk Sea?    [Korochkin] Yes, there is certainly hope. However, the work  on the Bering Sea agreement took three years because powerful  pressure was exerted by the United States, since the Alaska  pollock there belongs to the Aleutian state primarily because it  is in the U.S. zone. However, the Alaska pollock in the Okhotsk  Sea is (?mostly) ours and that is why everything depends on the  actions of our government and on how it can prepare and  influence the position of other countries.    [Kuzmenko] Stanislav Mikhaylovich, what is the situation  today in the central part of the Okhotsk Sea?    [Korochkin] Today, the usual situation prevails in the  central part of the Okhotsk Sea. Our fleet is not working there  since the introduction of the moratorium last year. However,  Polish and Chinese vessels continue to work there, some 40-50  ships. However, South Korea has withdrawn its fleet from the  central part of the Okhotsk Sea. In exchange for the South  Korean Government's agreement to withdraw the fleet, our  government has allotted the South Korean fleet 32,500 tonnes of  Alaska pollock in our economic zone in western Kamchatka, the  northern Okhotsk Sea fishing area, and [words indistinct]  Kamchatka region.    [Kuzmenko] And at the present time, Okhotrybvod vessels with  inspectors on board are constantly patrolling the central part  of the Okhotsk Sea.    [Korochkin] Yes, quite right. After the introduction of the  moratorium, the Fishing Committee issued an order making  Okhotrybvod responsible for the main coordinating work to  protect the central part. Beginning in the summer of last year,  one of our command patrol boats has constantly patrolled the  area with inspectors on board and, money permitting, we  regularly carry out aerial surveillance of the area. That is,  we have the situation fully under control.    [Kuzmenko] Thank you. [end recording]</p>

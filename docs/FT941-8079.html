			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Switch lifts Bowater The paper and packaging sector suffered the effects of a shift in funds after UBS, the Swiss-owned securities house, advised investors to switch holdings from Bunzl to Bowater. The former dipped 4 to 178p while the latter resisted the overall market trend to rise 7 1/2 to 483 1/2 p. The Swiss house argued that, after a fall of 40p over the past month, Bowater was on an undeservedly low market rating. It told clients that the company was a recovery stock with long-term growth prospects and had made acquisitions in 'some above-average growth markets'. Alternatively, UBS believes that Bunzl's share price has already taken on board the recovery in paper prices and that the company needs to make both a rights issue and acquisitions if it is to maintain its premium rating.</p>

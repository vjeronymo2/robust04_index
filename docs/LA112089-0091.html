			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BEACH ACCESS BATTLE PITS STATE AGAINST CITY OFFICIALS;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: HUNTINGTON BEACH PIERSIDE VILLAGE PLAN PROMPTS LEGAL ACTION BY  STATE OFFICIALS WHO SAY IT WILL LIMIT PUBLIC'S ACCESS TO SHORELINE.  </P> <P> In a case with potentially far-reaching consequences for California beach  communities, the city of Huntington Beach is locked in a legal battle with the  state over plans to redevelop the area near the city's historic pier.  </P> <P> At issue is Huntington Beach's long-proposed Pierside Village redevelopment  plan. Pierside Village envisions a landscaped plaza of restaurants -- some  formal and some outdoor and casual -- on the beach between Main and Lake  streets, just south of the municipal pier. The proposal is a keystone in the  city's multimillion-dollar effort to redevelop downtown.  </P> <P> But unexpectedly, the state, fearing that increased development will interfere  with public access to the beach, has moved to block building of any new  restaurants, leaving the fate of Pierside Village in limbo.  </P> <P> "The state's action caught us flat-footed," said Huntington Beach Mayor Wes  Bannister.  </P> <P> State officials see the legal battle now under way as one of major significance  in their attempts to preserve California beach areas. If no out-of-court  settlement can be reached, the case is scheduled to be heard next March in  Orange County Superior Court.  </P> <P> "It's a very important case," said Curtis Fossum, senior staff counsel for the  State Lands Commission. "The sandy beaches of California are a limited  resource. . . . We want to make sure that the public has access to those  beaches and that development does not supplant recreational use."  </P> <P> Fossum said construction of more restaurants on the ocean side of Pacific Coast  Highway would hinder people from being able to walk to the shore. He said the  case has significance to other coastal cities that also may be tempted to  convert public land.  </P> <P> "There is development pressure on whoever owns the (beach) property, but we  believe that if the land has public rights attached to it, those public rights  must be protected," Fossum said.  </P> <P> However, Huntington Beach Councilman Don MacAllister said he cannot understand  the state's opposition.  </P> <P> "A lot of people think this (Pierside Village area) is open beach, but it  isn't," MacAllister said last week at a City Council meeting. MacAllister noted  that the entire beach area under question already has some form of development,  ranging from Maxwell's Restaurant, next to the pier, to several adjoining  parking lots extending southward to Lake Street.  </P> <P> The Pierside Village proposal calls for several new restaurants on paved land  now used as parking for beach-goers. Maxwell's would remain; its existence is  not threatened by the state's action.  </P> <P> But according to city officials, the Pierside Village concept falls apart if  new restaurants are prohibited.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Income for the City  </P> <P> Gail C. Hutton, city attorney for Huntington Beach said: "All of this is  necessary to fund the pier improvements and to develop the new lifeguard  headquarters. The purpose of this new development is to provide the city with  income to support the improvements."  </P> <P> She referred to public buildings planned near the pier. One structure would be  a plaza and surfing museum at the base of the proposed new pier. The  deteriorating old pier, which has been closed since July, 1988, is scheduled to  be replaced. The pier funding, however, does not rely on the  restaurant-construction proposal. A combination of public grants and private  fund raising is planned to pay for the new pier.  </P> <P> Hutton leads the city's legal defense of Pierside Village. Ironically, it was  her office's routine legal action in 1986 to try to clear title to the beach  land that triggered the state's opposition.  </P> <P> The land in question once was privately owned by the Huntington Beach Co., with  part ownership by Standard Oil and the old Pacific Electric Railroad Co. The  city successfully sued in 1932 to gain public easement rights.  </P> <P> But the easement did not give the city full ownership. Instead, it granted  right-of-access to the land "for public, recreational, park and playground  purposes and other uses appurtenant or incident thereto."  </P> <P> To gain full title to the land so it could be redeveloped, Hutton's office  filed a condemnation action, while also negotiating with the owners. Hutton  said the Huntington Beach Co. and Chevron (the successor to Standard Oil) "are  public-spirited companies and they agreed to give up their rights." The  Southern Railway Co., which succeeded the Pacific Electric Railroad Co., has so  far not agreed, Hutton said.  </P> <P> One other interest-holder in the land also balked: the state of California.  </P> <P> "We included the state in our litigation because the title company was of the  opinion that the state might have some public interest in the land," Hutton  said.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, the State Lands Commission notified Huntington Beach that it  opposes the proposed change in the beach land arrangement. The Lands Commission  is a little-known but powerful agency that controls all of California's  submerged lands and its shore lands to the high-tide mark. The Huntington Beach  land in question, however, is not directly governed by the Lands Commission  because it is several hundred yards north of the high-tide mark.  </P> <P> But commission lawyer Fossum said the Lands Commission is involved because it  believes that the public's access to the shore is threatened.  </P> <P> "The water area of a beach is state-owned, and if a city attempts to limit  public access to our public lands, obviously we have an interest," Fossum said.  </P> <P> Mary Gray Holt, a deputy state attorney general who is handling the state's  legal opposition to the redevelopment, said the state also opposes the proposed  redevelopment because the California Constitution dedicates beaches to public  use.  </P> <P> "The state is taking the position that this area should be maintained as a  public beach recreational area," Holt said. "Our belief is that the city's  easement is inappropriate for private commercial purposes such as valet-parking  restaurants. Now that doesn't mean the city can't have hamburger stands or  little breakfast places -- things that serve the beach-going public -- in that  area."  </P> <P> Jonathan Chodos, the West Los Angeles-based developer of Pierside Village, said  last week that the building plans include a mixture of small, outdoor eating  places and two larger, indoor restaurants, including Maxwell's.  </P> <P> "Public access to the beach wouldn't be limited; instead it would be enhanced,"  Chodos said. "Our revised plan calls for a mixture of eating experiences,  including some cantina-like outdoor restaurants and patios. The plan is very  much like the public riverfront concept in San Antonio (Tex)."  </P> <P> Some city officials, including Councilman John Erskine, have questioned why the  State Lands Commission objects to the plan, which won the blessing of the  state's Coastal Commission in December, 1986. The Coastal Commission is the  watchdog agency over lands extending beyond the high-tide mark.  </P> <P> Holt, of the attorney general's office, said: "For one thing, the Coastal  Commission didn't know at the time that the city only had an easement to that  land and that the easement was dedicated to the public. And for another thing,  the Coastal Commission's permit (for the proposed redevelopment) has now  expired, and the city will have to seek it again."  </P> <P> Holt doubts that the Coastal Commission will approve a permit the second time  around. "I think that the commission takes a strong stand on public-dedication  easements," she said.  </P> <P> A new residents' group in Huntington Beach, called Save Our Parks, opposes the  restaurant construction. In a fiery speech to the City Council on Nov. 13, Save  Our Parks member Larry Geisse said the organization strongly supports the state  in its effort to oderail Pierside Village.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Cheering State On'  </P> <P> Debbie Cook, chairwoman of Save Our Parks, said later in the week: "We're  cheering the state on. This (beach) land is supposed to be used by the people."  </P> <P> City Council members last week said the land will continue to be used by the  public if it is redeveloped. The only difference, they said, would be a better  atmosphere and more dining spots.  </P> <P> But Fossum, of the Lands Commission, said that paradoxically, Huntington Beach  is now trying to privatize some valuable land it won for public access back in  1932.  </P> <P> "Huntington Beach would not be the beautiful community it is today if its  leaders had not had the foresight to get public access to that beach land back  in 1932," Fossum said. "If they had done nothing, that land could be full of  condos and commercial buildings today. Instead, it's public access land.  </P> <P> "All the people of California should be thankful to Huntington Beach for what  it did back in 1932, when it was not popular to do that kind of thing to help  public access to the beaches. The city took on an important responsibility when  it got that public easement. We just want to make sure that the city fulfills  that responsibility."  </P></p>

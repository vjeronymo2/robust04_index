			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleko Aslanishvili and Odik Kukhilava under </F> rubric "Report from the Emergency Zone": "The Sun Is Peeking  Through"]    [Text] 2. ANYONE WHO STILL HAS FAITH IN  TOMORROW...    As the saying goes, there are as many opinions as there are  people. We were told in Zugdidi that Rayon Head Edisher  Chargazia is a tough man. Some went so far as to say he's  unfriendly or even crude. As it happens, we didn't get a chance  to talk to Batoni Edisher. We did meet him, but our brief  meeting, distinguished by impeccable courtesy, was not enough to  say much even approximate, let alone specific, about the man, or  rather his character.    The most astute observation, in our opinion, came from a  cheerful native of the village of Tkaia: "You won't get anywhere  being nicey-nice; it takes sternness and toughness to tidy up  this messy rayon of ours, and just because he doesn't pat  everybody on the head, they think he's a heavy character."    Indeed, the rayon head did not waste time being nice but  swiftly kicked out the ideologues and financiers of the  "resistance." He got rid of the managers of educational,  cultural, and administrative bodies, retail and trade  organizations, banks and many enterprises and establishments,  and almost all village heads and assembly leaders who, through  action or inaction, fostered regional destabilization and  funneled large amounts of state and civic bodies' funds to  followers of the ex-President. He installed new people in their  place.    In Chargazia's words, "We're not fighting those who 'think  differently,' we're fighting those who would 'differently'  destroy the country."    We have already reported some of Zugdidi's destruction and  ruination, which have impacted not only agriculture but also  industry. Still, stabilization--despite difficulties (the  shortage of electricity and petroleum products, the lack of raw  materials, transportation problems, financial straits, and so  on--has enabled Zugdidi's enterprises to resume operations.  Programs have been worked out, local resources are being  mobilized, old contacts are being restored, and the groundwork  is being laid to resume full-capacity operation soon (this may  sound a lot like officialese, but in this case we prefer it:  officialese may be dry and bland, but it is incomparable in  terms of conciseness).    In short, the people of Zugdidi (like all of Georgia's  people) are eager somehow to get the wheel-rusted, stripped and  looted train of industry moving again after its tracks have been  torn up fore and aft and the rails are scattered far and wide....    Zugdidi Chinaware Factory is one of the few enterprises  which  escaped looting and wrecking. Attempts were made on it, but not  a single motor or machine was lost, even though the enterprise  stood idle almost eight months. The reason is that Director Givi  Soselia and his shop chiefs guarded it day and night with  weapons in their hands.    There was a time when the shops of this only-begotten child  of the Georgian chinaware industry employed 800 workers; now,  only 350 are left. But in this case, that "only" actually  represents a victory: most of the republic's industrial  enterprises are idle, while the Zugdidi Chinaware Factory is  working, even if only at half capacity.    "We resumed production in January," Batoni Givi told us.  "People realized that this endless 'oppositionizing' and  'national disobedience' was going to destroy the country. The  old way of life is gone. Furthermore, the working man craves to  work and has eventually come back. The rayon's new leadership is  helping us in every way. No 'witch hunt' is going on, nobody is  going to persecute you for your belief if you are not guilty of  a crime. People have realized that the reconciliation process is  real and deep-seated, not just empty words...."    Givi Soselia is a well known executive not only in the rayon  but all over Georgia; he has almost three decades of experience  as a manager and has been in charge of this factory for seven  years now. He shrewdly foresaw the processes to be expected  following the breakup of the USSR and the possibility that ties  would be broken, and he took advance measures to stock up on raw  materials, which are now so expensive and hard to import (96  percent of the raw materials the Zugdidi Chinaware Factory needs  comes in from outside; it was planned that way from the start,  and continues to this day!); now these supplies are enough for  the factory to operate at full capacity for two years!    But what then? What will it take to prevent the country from  being exploited over imported raw materials? Then there are the  endless crises, the destruction, hyperinflation and chaos.  Soselia and his collective have to think about tomorrow. They  are working with the Caucasian Mineralogical Institute and the  Technical University's Chemistry and Geology departments to find  ways to convert to Georgian raw materials. There are already  some encouraging findings: in Bolnisskiy Rayon's Begtakari  village they found a deposit of excellent kaolin, enough to last  200 to 300 years! Hence, soon Georgian chinaware will really be  Georgian. It is also possible that 60 to 70 percent of the  factory's output will meet European standards.    The Zugdidi factory also has close ties with Germany's  famous  Dorset Firm, which is the leading supplier of chinaware and  ceramics production lines to the world. The Dorset Firm has  worked out a blueprint to rebuild the Zugdidi factory to  accommodate the production of new items such as facing tiles and  plumbing fixtures. German specialists will visit Georgia soon,  and the question of further cooperation will be decided on the  governmental level.    Except for plates, the Zugdidi Chinaware Factory  manufactures  all kinds of dishware (because of erratic electricity and the  high price of fuel oil, it can't manufacture plates--there are  only two big kilns operating). We saw something that is unusual  and rare in Georgia at the present time: construction going on.  They are building a new, temporary cafeteria on the first floor  (the factory's excellent permanent cafeteria was blown up in  1992--by the "resistance movement"). Every month the factory  spends 50 million coupons so workers can buy meals at a  discount. It may be a drop in the bucket, but it's real, it's  progress. It shows the working man that the factory does care a  little and is ready to help....    Scant months have passed since the terrifying, chaotic  events  of September-October, when many no longer believed that this  impossibly disordered country could get back on its feet, when  the administration and no more than a handful of Zugdidian  policemen doggedly, tirelessly stood watch over the beleaguered  factory, so that later, after the sun broke through again, the  state wouldn't give it up for lost.    So now it is working, turning out goods; Georgia's firstborn  of chinaware is operating. Thanks are due to Batoni Givi Soselia  and his comrades-in-arms.    P.S. The factory people asked us to convey their thanks  to the Zestafoni officers of the Internal Affairs Ministry's  Property Protection Administration who patriotically came to  their aid in November-December, and in addition to serving as  alert sentinels, they shared their own food with the people who  had taken refuge in the factory.    A number of formerly idle enterprises have resumed  operations  in Zugdidi. All the tea industry facilities are operating, work  is underway on restoration of the machine building plant, and  two of the Inguri Pulp and Paper Combines' shops are operating.  We personally tasted samples of Tarkhuna, a soft drink made by  the Beer and Nonalcoholic Beverages Bottling Plant. It was  pretty good, not bad at all!    This plant is worth some discussion.    The Enguri Firm (whose chairman of the board is Zurab  Gogokhia), to which his plant belongs, happened to be founded in  the time of troubles, and, as the saying goes, it bore the brunt  of them.    This relatively stable factory always did a fair job of  meeting the region's needs, producing 25 to 30 tonnes of beer  and 25,000 to 30,000 bottles of soft drinks a day. But for eight  months now they haven't been brewing any beer, and in the past  two months they have only supplied 40,000 bottles of soft drinks  to consumers.    This does not mean, however, that the enterprise is  neglected  and hopelessly dead. Not at all! We talked to deputy board  chairmen Gigla Alshibaia and Tamaz Antia and  engineer-technologist Tornike Gelendava. They are optimistic  about the future. The enterprise came out of the civil war's  destructive blows unhurt. The collective fought tooth and nail  to save the factory.    Gigla Alshibaia had this to say: "Every night, seven of us  took turns guarding the place against looting. And we saved the  plant's facilities. On the other hand, we failed to save the new  enterprise we are building not far away. Two of the new  facility's three stories were already completed, but somebody  dismantled it and took the blocks away. It's a good thing that  the production lines that had been bought for it were here and  were saved. We can actually start making beer today, we have the  necessary materials in stock, and all we need is a steady supply  of electricity. As you know, the brewing of beer is a lengthy  and complex process; if the electricity goes off it can do a lot  of damage, the cycle is interrupted and beer that is almost  ready has to be dumped."    "But hey, you are making soft drinks. Do you have enough  sugar?"    "Instead of sugar we use syrup which we manage to find. As  they say, 'Where there's a will there's a way.' In order to get  uninterrupted power directly from the substation (they promise  us this will soon happen), we spent our own money to switch the  district's population over to a separate power line. Give us  peace and quiet, and we'll run this like clockwork. We have many  plans, and converting to leasing has made everything easier."    We have cited the Chinaware Factory and the Enguri Firm to  show that love of one's job, patriotism, and faithfulness to  one's enterprise can do a lot. At a time when brother was  fighting brother, and looting and robbing ruled, when it was  every man for himself, and when destructiveness was no disgrace,  these enterprises preserved people's hope for the future and did  what was needed to make that hope a reality.    The Odishi Tea Combine saved itself the same way (Demur  Todua, director). We learned one remarkable fact--considering  today's conditions, anyway: after making their inspection, the  Finance Ministry's auditors awarded a prize to Rezo Kantaria,  the head accountant of the Zugdidi Experimental Tea Combine  (Nugzar Gulua, director) because of the excellence of his work.    Zugdidi is licking its wounds, working hard and striving for  normalcy, with great effort and toil, sometimes confidently and  sometimes hesitantly. The process will probably go more quickly  when the army of refugees goes back home. Today (according to  the February count) 65,800 refugees have taken shelter there  (26,000 in the city). There is hardly a family that hasn't taken  someone in. Koki Sherozia's three-member family in Tkaia at one  time, almost a whole month, had 37 relatives as guests. Today  there are 12. There are many such families.    The refugees are having a hard time of it. Sad to say, not  all of them have a host. Dormitories, children's homes,  administration buildings--and even cattle sheds--are packed.    This huge mass of people are painfully concerned about every  nuance of the negotiations about returning to Abkhazia. Anyone  who has looked into the matter can detect processes which  indicate that among them there are active political opponents  working to foster destabilization. There are indications that  agents of the enemy are working among them. One indicator of  that, perhaps, was a provocative challenge which we ourselves  witnessed: "Let us enter Abkhazia carrying white flags and, if  there is no other way, register ourselves as Abkhazians." Along  with this, a thousand rumors are being circulated, and some  people, in despair, are seizing upon them eagerly. For example:  "They say that the Abkhazians in the village of Chuburkhindzhi,  Galskiy Rayon, have hung a big banner which reads, in  Mingrelian, 'We must create an Abkhazian-Mingrelian Republic. Do  not hinder us'"; or, "They say Ardzinba has said he won't bother  the Mingrelians, he will repatriate them all, if they will  change their passports and register as Mingrelians." A laughing  matter? Not at all! Foreign and domestic enemies are cleverly  exploiting the plight of the refugees, trying to fragment and  corrupt people and pit them against one another, to launch a new  wave of destabilization, to place the settlement of the  Abkhazian question in jeopardy. Maybe someone will swallow the  hook?!    The main thing, however, is faith in the future. God forbid  we should lose it.</p>

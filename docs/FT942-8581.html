			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: US West moves on telecoms There was strong demand for the big telecoms stocks throughout the day and ahead of the startling news, released after the market closed, that US West International, the American telecoms group, is to announce 'a major UK acquisition' this morning. Analysts said there were no strong rumours to link US West with any of the big quoted stocks in London. A bid for Vodafone was ruled out, as was a move to acquire Mercury, telecoms subsidiary of Cable and Wireless. US West has a half-share in the One-to-One cellular phone business, along with C&amp;W, and is involved with various cable television groups. BT, scheduled to announce preliminary figures this morning, edged up 2 1/2 to 379p, and Cable and Wireless, helped by buy recommendations from Cazenove, NatWest Securities and Merrill Lynch, put on 6 1/2 at 464 1/2 p. Vodafone held at 527p on its highest daily volume this year, 9.8m. Securicor, which along with Security Services has a 40 per cent stake in Cellnet, advanced 9 to 865p.</p>

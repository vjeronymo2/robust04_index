			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> DESPITE A SWEEP, KNICKS HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF BARKLEY  </P> <P> It was touted as the most competitive of the opening-round National Basketball  Assn. playoff series, but the New York Knicks' paper-thin eight-point margin  during its 3-0 sweep of the Philadelphia 76ers might have been considerably  greater were it not for the formidable presence of Charles Barkley. The trigger  man of the 76ers' offense, the power forward drew double teams virtually every  time he touched the ball.  </P> <P> Down the stretch of each game, Barkley took over, muscling his way to the  basket, grabbing or keeping rebounds alive for teammates or passing off for  scores.  </P> <P> "I think I'm one of the two or three best players on the planet Earth. Taking  over is my job," he explained. "I've talked with Michael (Jordan) about it --  I'm capable of doing it and there's no reason not to."  </P> <P> But although Barkley put up some prodigious numbers during the three-game  series, averaging 27 points, 12 rebounds and five assists, he learned that one  man, no matter how great, isn't enough during the playoffs. So it is that the  Knicks find themselves in the conference semifinals, awaiting the winner of the  Chicago-Cleveland series.  </P> <P> The Knicks' 116-115 overtime victory wrapping up the series Tuesday night  showed the difference between a competent team and an outstanding individual.  It was also indicative of the young New York squad's development this season.  </P> <P> Although they have all-stars Patrick Ewing and Mark Jackson, the Knicks don't  have a single force whose play demands the basketball in the waning stages of a  game, a' la Barkley. At times that appears to be a liability, such as in the  fourth quarter of Game 3, when the five Knicks on the floor were practically  tripping over themselves trying to rush to glory.  </P> <P> "If there's a big shot to be made, everybody wants to take it," said Ewing. "No  one's gonna shrug away from it. I think that shows character."  </P> <P> With six seconds to play in overtime it was guard Gerald Wilkins who came up  big, hitting a jumper from near the top of the key. The shot came after a  dribble to the right, with Wilkins shooting on the move, a play he's supposedly  unable to make.  </P> <P> "When I took the shot I didn't have time to hesitate," he said. "It seemed like  when I was up in the air it was just me."  </P> <P> Wilkins ended the game with 22 points, 11 rebounds, eight assists and four  steals. Before Barkley forced the overtime, with eight points, a steal and a  blocked shot in the final 3:37 of regulation, it appeared Jackson would be the  hero. His pair of three-point field goals helped the Knicks overcome an early  fourth-quarter deficit and go up by 100-94 with four minutes left.  </P> <P> The back-court efforts were needed because Ewing was struggling to a  three-for-12, eight-point night. The former Georgetown star's problems weren't  entirely of his own making. In foul trouble early, Ewing was whistled for his  fourth personal with 10:02 to play in the fourth quarter. Ewing complained, but  moments later he was called for his fifth.  </P> <P> "They were all judgment calls but unfortunately I was on the short end of the  stick," he said. "But we won anyway, so that's over and done with."  </P> <P> With a couple of bounces off the rim, the Knicks could be over and done with.  New York clinched a 102-96 Game 1 victory when Jackson hit a 30-foot jumper to  beat the shot clock in the final minute of play, then took seemingly lost Game  2 when Trent Tucker hit another three-pointer with 10 seconds remaining.  </P></p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: A sound constitution At least France will not be able to blame Anglo-Saxon speculators if Germany's constitutional court comes out against the Maastricht Treaty tomorrow. The ruling is one of those awkward instances where financial markets have to rely on guesswork to predict what will happen. A decision that Maastricht is unconstitutional or that ratification requires a referendum would deal a body blow to any lingering hopes of European monetary union. That could cause a fresh surge of demand for D-marks with, at the other extreme, a sharp sell-off in the Ecu bond market. Insofar as any outcome can be discounted in advance, though, the expectation is that the court will give the Treaty a qualified approval. The trick will be to decide how serious any qualifications might be. Anything that necessitates renegotiation of the Treaty would be as awkward as an outright no. Some qualifications could turn out less innocuous than they sound. For example, the court could limit the scope for changing the economic convergence criteria, even though the EC Commission might deem change necessary to maintain the progress towards monetary union. Since the ERM was forced to scrap its narrow bands at the start of August, few people have much faith in monetary union arriving on target anyway. That may limit the market's response, especially since the D-Mark has already advanced on Friday's disappointing US unemployment figures. But a further setback for monetary union would see those gains consolidated. The question then will be whether the Bundesbank will respond by accelerating its interest rate cuts.</p>

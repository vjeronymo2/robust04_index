			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Europe, Pacific Rim markets break records Plenty of records were broken last week, particularly among markets on the Pacific Rim, while special situations boosted activity in Tokyo. In continental Europe records were set on Tuesday in Germany, France and the Netherlands, although activity weakened thereafter, leaving the FT-Actuaries European component of the World index down almost 1 per cent on the week. The World index gained 0.5 percentage points in local currency terms last week. Mr Michael Woodcock of Nikko Europe comments that the French equity market has risen by 17.5 per cent in the last three months, and is selling on a p/e of 23.9 times 1993 earnings, compared with 15.7 times for the UK and 26 times for Germany. He adds that 'US investors remain overweight in French equities, but the domestic press is increasingly uneasy about the level of the market in the absence of an interest rate cut'. Indeed, the absence of a rate cut in France was one reason for the decline in the market, as some investors had been hoping for the Bank of France to make an announcement as early as last Monday. Another contribution to the fall back in Paris was a spate of disappointing interims from, among others, Elf Aquitaine, Rhone Poulenc and Club Med. This Thursday sees another Buba meeting, and the markets will he hoping for a slight easing in interest rates. The UBS Global research team are not alone in forecasting a cut of 50 basis points in official rates on Thursday. 'While German domestic monetary conditions have hardly changed dramatically since the last (Buba) meeting, the D-Mark's strength and Mr Otmar Issing's soothing message on inflation will tip the balance in favour of an easing move,' writes UBS in their latest strategy document. The research team at UBS also notes that 'those inclined to abandon the turmoil of Europe and switch into Japan would be wise to note that in dollar terms Japan has risen 50 per cent this year, and Europe less than 20 per cent'. If monetary easing is accelerated, they add, then European markets are likely to advance whereas Japan's upside is limited. Spain was one of the world's worst performing markets last week: after seeing a record high on Monday, the index retreated sharply over the next four days and did not respond at all to Friday's interest rate cut. In Asia there was an impressive performance from Malaysian equities, while Singapore also hit a succession of record highs during the week. The recent dynamism of Malaysia has as much to do with the impressive strength of the economy - 1993 GDP growth forecast at 8.6 per cent and inflation expected to fall from 4.5 per cent to 4.0 per cent by the end of 1994 - as with high liquidity and expectations of sharp falls in interest rates.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               % change                                                    % change    in US                 % change in local currency*         sterling*  Dollars*              1 Week   4 Weeks   1 Year  Start of    Start of  Start of                                           1993        1993       1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       +1.45     +3.72   +36.51   +28.55      +25.42     +26.46 Belgium       +1.68     -0.56   +28.54   +20.49      +12.40     +13.32 Denmark       +1.09     +4.68   +33.50   +32.03      +22.54     +23.56 Finland       -4.39     +0.63  +168.45   +70.61      +51.28     +52.54 France        -1.16     +0.72   +22.53   +19.00      +13.96     +14.89 Germany       +0.98     +2.70   +25.14   +24.00      +22.75     +23.77 Ireland       -0.65     +1.78   +42.84   +44.15      +25.49     +26.52 Italy         -1.84     +5.81   +91.88   +52.67      +40.55     +41.70 Netherlands   -1.38     +3.05   +27.33   +22.84      +21.56     +22.56 Norway        -0.15     +3.95   +53.37   +31.95      +27.38     +28.42 Spain         -2.73     +8.42   +39.20   +37.88      +17.74     +18.71 Sweden        +1.42     +2.28   +62.89   +28.63      +12.75     +13.67 Switzerland   -1.28     +0.53   +36.45   +19.16      +21.15     +22.15 UK            -1.39     +2.77   +32.59    +9.39       +9.39     +10.29 EUROPE        -0.90     +2.57   +33.63   +18.74      +15.85     +16.81  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia     +0.52     +5.59   +23.04   +21.05      +12.81     +13.73 Hong Kong     +1.26     +0.44   +26.38   +33.95      +32.71     +33.80 Japan         +1.76     +2.51   +20.33   +28.68      +51.75     +53.00 Malaysia      +4.80    +12.02   +75.86   +51.38      +53.91     +55.18 New Zealand   -0.20     +6.09   +42.47   +33.69      +40.43     +41.59 Singapore     +1.62    +10.12   +51.38   +32.97      +34.79     +35.91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        +0.04     +4.20   +10.20   +14.74       +8.87      +9.77 USA           +0.23     +2.76   +10.72    +5.88       +5.01      +5.88 Mexico        -0.11     +7.29   +37.71    +6.67       +6.06      +6.94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa  -2.11     -3.47   +24.50   +24.32      +26.02     +27.06  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   +0.47     +2.70   +20.12   +16.38      +20.74     +21.74  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Based on September 3rd 1993.

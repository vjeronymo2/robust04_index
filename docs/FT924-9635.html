			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: New team for GM drive in Europe  -A look at efforts to revive the US carmaker's bruised fortunes MR Jack Smith, the new chief executive and president of General Motors, has brought together a small and trusted team to try to resuscitate the battered fortunes of the world's largest industrial corporation. 'The chemistry goes back a long way,' says Mr Louis Hughes, president of GM Europe and since Monday also executive vice-president with responsibility for international operations. GM's New York treasury office and the group's European operations run like a common thread through the careers of the small group of key executives chosen on Monday by a frustrated GM board desperate to staunch the group's massive losses in its North American automotive operations. 'The group knows itself very well,' said Mr Hughes yesterday after landing in the UK from Monday's climactic New York board meeting. Today the company is opening its Pounds 190m (Dollars 290.7m) V6 engine plant in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, in north-west England as part of its increase in capacity by 25 per cent in Europe from 1990 to 1995. 'Bill Hoglund (GM assistant treasurer in New York from 1972-74) hired me, and Jack Smith was reporting to Bill at the time in the treasurer's office. Later I hired Rick Wagoner to that office, said Mr Hughes.' These four, together with Mr Harry Pearce the group's general counsel, now form GM's key five-man management committee. The appointments have radically reduced the age of the top GM team, with Mr Smith at 54, Mr Hoglund, now a member of the board and assisting Mr Smith in the running of the North American operations, 58, Mr Pearce at 50, Mr Hughes at 43 and Mr Wagoner, now chief financial officer, 39. When Mr Hughes left Adam Opel, GM's key German subsidiary and the heart of its European operations, to become president of General Motors Europe in April this year, he was presented with a crystal ball by the workers' council at Opel's Russelsheim plant, near Frankfurt. It now sits in his Zurich office. 'It does not help me tell the future,' he said yesterday, and even his crystal ball might have been reluctant to predict quite such a meteoric rise for himself during 1992. In less than eight 8 months he has gone from the post of chief executive at Opel to his positions at GM. However, despite being a member of the five-man inner circle at GM, Mr Hughes will continue to be based in Zurich at the GM Europe headquarters. 'It makes sense,' he said in an interview yesterday. 'We are trying to take out layers of management. Europe is the critical mass of our international operations. It is part of our strategy to use Opel engineering and the Opel brand worldwide outside North America. 'And the other critical mass in Europe is Saab. It makes no sense to sit in Detroit with all the challenges in Europe. We will have to get better telecommunications for our management meetings.' Mr Hughes sees GM Europe with Opel's German engineering at its heart playing an increasingly central role in GM's worldwide operations outside North America. Opel technology already supports GM's Holden operation in Australia, it has previously supported Daewoo Motor in South Korea until last month's divorce between GM and the Daewoo group became absolute. Opel cars will be assembled in Taiwan from next year, and there are growing links in both products and components with South America. 'We hope that if Brazil gets into volume production of our Opel cars, we can ship some components, while they manufacture and export through Latin America. 'We already design in Germany for so many countries,' said Mr Hughes, 'but we must be cost-competitive. 'We will transform the structure of the international operations. It's time to re-think the way we have done business. We cannot ship all the support staffs from Detroit to Zurich, which is one of the most expensive cities in the world to have as headquarters. 'For me it is a clean sheet of paper. I am willing to think about anything in terms of structure. We have a new management committee and we are going to have a new GM. That is the only we are going to win.' He insisted yesterday that GM's financial traumas in North America had not undermined any capital investment or product programmes in Europe, where GM is the most profitable volume carmaker. After dipping in the late 1980s GM Europe capital spending had begun to climb rapidly at the beginning of the 1990s, and spending would be high for the 'next few years', said Mr Hughes.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (8): Region of huge contrasts - Telecommunications EASTERN Asia is a region of huge contrasts in telecommunications. Large countries such as China and Indonesia have fewer than one telephone line for every 100 people. But small territories, in particular Hong Kong and Singapore, have telecommunications networks that rival the best of those in western developed countries. In most of the region, the challenge is to provide new telephone lines quickly enough to satisfy pent-up demand. In the more advanced countries - such as South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan - the challenge is to develop advanced telecommunications networks. Singapore has made telecommunications a high priority for many years. Its aim has been to use advanced networks to attract foreign investment in industries such as financial services, and to develop itself as a regional hub for telecommunications traffic. Singapore Telecom has international call charges which are among the lowest in the world. It has also pioneered new services such as Integrated Services Digital Network, which allow high-speed data and telephone services to be carried simultaneously on the same telephone line. The Singapore government is moving ahead with plans to privatise Singapore Telecom. And, from 1994, Singapore will be directly linked to Europe with an underwater fibre optic cable. Hong Kong has had a similar focus on high quality services at low costs. Hong Kong Telecom, a subsidiary of the UK-based Cable and Wireless Group, has a monopoly on basic domestic and international services. But it faces competition in mobile communications from several rivals including Hutchison Telecom, part of Mr Li Ka-shing's Hutchison Whampoa conglomerate. One of Cable and Wireless's strategic objectives has been to open up telecommunications links with southern China. The result has been a surge in the telecommunications traffic between Hong Kong and China. This route accounted for 410m minutes of traffic in 1990 - making it by far the busiest bilateral route within the region, according to a report from the London-based International Institute of Communications. Cable and Wireless is also trying to turn itself into the main carrier for the Pacific basin. It recently became the second operator in Australia and its AsiaSat satellite - a joint venture with Hutchison Whampoa and the Chinese government - is providing services in Thailand, Mongolia and eastern Siberia. South Korea, which has established a high-quality basic telecommunications service, is now liberalising its market with the aim of developing more advanced services. Last year, Dacom, a local telephone company owned mainly by large Korean companies, started providing a rival international service to that run by Korea Telecom, the state-owned group. Prices immediately fell sharply. This year, the government is holding a competition to find a new operator for cellular communications. Other countries in the region are still struggling to provide adequate basic telecommunications. The twin challenges are to reform the telecommunications industry so that modernisation can proceed efficiently and to find sufficient finance for investment. There is a trend towards putting national telephone companies, which have traditionally been run as government departments, on a more commercial footing. Malaysia has already partly privatised its Telekom Malaysia. Other countries, such as Indonesia, have retained state ownership but established a more arms-length relationship between the telephone company and the government. There is also a greater willingness to countenance foreign investment. While political sensitivities often prevent full-scale privatisation, Thailand and Indonesia are experimenting with halfway houses which involve attracting private capital while retaining state control. The largest scheme of this type is a 25-year concession for Nynex, the US telephone company, and Charoen Pokphand Group, the Thai agri-industrial conglomerate, to build and operate 2m lines in Bangkok at a cost of about Dollars 3bn. China is in a category on its own. Foreign investment has been welcomed in equipment manufacturing, with western companies such as France's Alcatel, Germany's Siemens and Britain's GPT forming joint ventures. But there is almost no foreign participation in the provision of services. Even China, though, has started restructuring its telecommunications industry in order to improve efficiency. Over the past few years, the central government has delegated power to decide prices and some aspects of investment to 2,500 post and telephone enterprises in cities, towns and rural areas. It is now contemplating a second phase of restructuring which would involve turning these enterprises into corporations. The Chinese telephone network has been growing at a compound annual rate of 20 per cent. About Dollars 2bn is being invested each year, making this the largest telecommunications programme ever in a developing country. But there are still only 8m telephone lines in the whole of China - about the same as in London.</p>

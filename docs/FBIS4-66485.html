			<p>CSO     [Text] Plans for a joint R&amp;D project intended to promote  the commercialization of photoforming equipment and photo  sensitive polymers are under way. Photoforming system and  polymer manufacturers will join with photoforming equipment  users to conduct research designed to improve photoforming and  to lower the cost of photoforming systems. The project is a part  of the `R&amp;D Program for Basic Technology To Aid Knowledge  Collection for Small To Medium Sized Enterprises' run by the  Small to Medium Sized Enterprise Corporation. Official  selection of participants is scheduled for June. Candidates from  polymer manufacturers include Japan Synthetic Rubber Co., Ltd.,  Sanyo Chemical Industries, Ltd., Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd.,  DuPont, and Ciba-Geigy.    Photoforming equipment is designed to build thin plastic  parts from photosensitive liquid polymers using CAD data derived  from three-dimensional models. Horizontal layers of the parts  are formed one on top of another while solidification through  laser irradiation takes place to finally form three-dimensional  objects. Photoforming equipment has the advantage of not  requiring dies to make three-dimensional objects. However,  because of the high cost of equipment and poor strength and  precision of polymers, the applications are limited at present  to industrial design models. The equipment currently costs about  500 million yen. Only 2-3 units have been sold in Japan in FY93.    The project, which is supposed to take off soon, will  include  research and development intended to lower the cost of  photoforming equipment and to improve the performance of  polymers. Developers will try to reduce costs to about 200  million yen per unit including the cost of lasers, an important  component of theequipment, and software that slices the CAD data  just like CT scanning.    On the other hand, R&amp;D on photosensitive ploymers will  include better understanding of photosetting mechanism theory  and high performance polymers with high shock resistance and  high prescision. Development of high performance polymers is  the key to wide marketability and general purpose photoforming  equipment.    Candidates for participation in the project other than  polymer makers include NEC Corporation. Toshiba Corporation, and  Ushio Inc. for development of lasers, Teijin Seiki Co., Ltd. and  Sony for scanner development, and Seamet [phonetic] and Deemec  [phonetic] for photoforming equipment. Among equipement users,  small to medium sized plastic works companies intend soon to  form a consortium before joining the project.    The project is scheduled to last four years. The Small to  Medium Sized Enterprise Corporation has allocated it &yen;180  million under the FY94 budget.</p>

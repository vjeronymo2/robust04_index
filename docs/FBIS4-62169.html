			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vadim Prokopenko report under the "Topic of the Day" </F> rubric: "Ownerless Atomic Bomb Waiting for Its Fate To Be  Decided for Over Three Years"]    [Text] "Following the breakup of the Soviet Union the  Belovezhskaya agreement, the Almaty declaration, and agreements  among the CIS heads of state say that everything that is on the  territory of each state is its property. The Baykonur  cosmodrome and the Semipalatinsk test site are the property of  Kazakhstan.... So Russia has nothing to do with them," Nursultan  Nazarbayev said in a speech at UN headquarters in New York in  1994.    But it does. Russia very directly has something to do with  the Semipalatinsk test site. No matter how Nursultan Nazarbayev  wanted to stun the whole world community in the golden hall at  UN headquarters with his presidential authority, he has to give  Russia's atomic specialists their due.    Back in May 1991 a physical irradiation experiment was  prepared at installation 108-k in the granite Degelen mountain  "in order to improve military equipment." This means that a  tunnel 592 meters long was driven through a mass of granite  around 20 km in diameter at a depth of at least 126 meters from  the surface. A small (by present-day standards) atomic bomb  with a yield of 0.4 kilotonnes, equivalent to 400 tonnes of TNT,  was set up at one end of this tunnel 108-k, and specially  designed objects were set up at the other end. When the bomb  was detonated, the articles would receive the full impact.  Scientists would bring them to the surface, study the damage,  and refine the latest achievements of the Soviet Union's  military thought. On whose territory, I would remind you, both  Russians and Kazakhs lived until the end of 1991....    In August 1991 the Kazakhstani president closed the  Semipalatinsk test site, but the atomic bomb remained deep  within Degelen mountain. It could in principle have been  detonated long since. But in big-league politics Kazakhstan had  employed the tactic of a state which had voluntarily renounced  nuclear arms, and an underground explosion with that kind of  yield would have been noticed by satellites all around the  world....    A decision was made to remove the atomic charge and the  military equipment back in 1992. Since then talks have been  under way at the highest state level. Kazakhstan has even  recruited U.S. specialists. They have insistently recommended  that this problem be entrusted to Russia.    "We have experience of unearthing atomic charges. Through  the history of the test site there have been several known cases  of buried charges' suffering technical failure," according to  Anatoliy Matushchenko, a specialist from the Russian Federation  Ministry of Atomic Energy. "A joint Russian-Kazakhstani group  is now starting work and is to implement a project formulated by  the All-Union Scientific Research and Planning Institute of  Industrial Technology (Moscow) and draw up an estimate of  expenditure. The whole job could take more than six months, but  it must be done before winter sets in. The Russian side will  cover all the expenditure. By all accounts this will amount to  in excess of 1 billion rubles...."    Everything that is removed from under the ground will be the  property of the Russian Federation. Corresponding agreements  have already been signed to this effect. No one, not even  Kazakhstan representatives, will be able to see the irradiation  facilities or touch the bomb that has spent over three years  underground. Incidentally, nuclear charges have never been  stored for so long out of storage facilities. So in this  respect the Semipalatinsk experiment will prove unique in its  own way.</p>

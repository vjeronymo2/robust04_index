			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / International Company News: SAS in aircraft leaseback deal SAS, the Scandinavian airline group, yesterday announced a SKr3bn (Dollars 359m) sale and leaseback deal for six of its Boeing 767 passenger aircraft with an unnamed external partner and the sale of its SAS Royal Hotel in Cologne to a German investor group. The aircraft transaction, which leaves SAS with a SKr800m capital gain, is an important step towards the airline's financial consolidation, SAS said. The group is carrying out a tough programme to cut costs by SKr2.5bn by the end of 1994 following a SKr1.1bn loss in the first nine months of 1993. The loss included unrealised exchange rate losses of SKr1.15bn, reflecting the depreciation of the Swedish krona since it was floated in November 1992. A rise in the value of its aircraft of approximately the same order, however, was not entered into the profit and loss account, SAS said. SAS said the SKr800m capital gain from the arrangement is 'primarily a foreign exchange gain, which will neutralise most of the foreign exchange loss in 1993'. The group is still considering its options following the collapse of the Alcazar project at the end of November, which was to have brought about a merger between SAS, KLM, Swissair and Austrian Airlines to form a leading new European airline.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Shops' burglary bill hits Pounds 175m RETAILERS are spending about Pounds 400m on combating crime each year and losing about Pounds 175m in burglaries, according to preliminary findings of the British Retail Consortium. The findings will be discussed today at the first meeting of the Home Office's Retail Action Group, a committee including retailers, police and local authority officials set up to tackle the growing problem of retail crime. The difficulties faced by retailers were highlighted in June by Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, the UK's largest electrical retailer, who told a conference that shops were being forced to adopt 'vigilante tactics' to combat crime. He said crime cost Dixons Pounds 20m last year. A report last month found a quarter of shops in some parts of London had been victims of a robbery or attempted robbery in the past year. The consortium, which represents more than 90 per cent of the retail industry, set up an initiative on crime in June to gather information about the true size of the problem. Its survey is the first attempt to collect figures in such detail from across the industry. The study says 150,000 burglaries were committed against retail premises last year, with losses totalling about Pounds 175m. That would account for more than half of the Pounds 320m attributed to all commercial burglaries in Home Office statistics on crime. The study also found that 440,000 customers were apprehended for theft by retailers last year.</p>

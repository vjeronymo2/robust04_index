Kozyrenko, Institute of </F> Applied Astronomy, Russian Academy of Sciences,St. Petersburg;  UDC 621.397.611.037.372]    [Abstract] A device to isolate  syncrhonizing sequences at 5 MHz from a playback signal in an  RT-1 VHS recorder (recording speed 5 megabits/second using a  self-synchronizing Miller code) has been developed at the  Institute of Applied Astronomy for ultralong baseline radio  interferometry. The device operates on the principle of digital  phase automatic frequency adjustment. Digital operation is  easily implemented even at rather high frequencies. Tuning is  reliable and easy. The space-saving design may be used in the  construction of multichannel systems. Figures 3; references 3  (Russian).</p>

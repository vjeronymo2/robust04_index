			<p>CSO     [Text] The Foreign Office has opposed the reopening of one  of Britain's most historic airfields because of fears that it  could be used for a terrorist attack on the Foreign Secretary's  official country home.    The airstrip at Combe Bank Farm in Sundridge, Kent, which  has  the country's earliest surviving hangars, is two miles from  Douglas Hurd's country home at Chevening.    Sevenoaks Council was due to decide last Wednesday on the  application from Timothy Barr-Smith, a farmer, but at the last  minute the Foreign Office letter was received. It opposed the  plan "on the grounds that Chevening House is the residence of a  cabinet minister who, as a potential terrorist target, is  subject to a high-security requirement. The close proximity of  low-flying aircraft ... and the lack of air-traffic control,  constitute an unacceptable risk in our view."    Planners were expected to recommend that the proposal be  approved, but it has now been deferred.    Mr. Barr-Smith submitted his plan for the airfield last  October, emphasising its historic past as the site of some of  the earliest adventures in aviation. Biplanes and triplanes were  tested there in the 1910s.    English Heritage supported the scheme because it would  ensure  the survival of the hangars, which had been used as hay stores.  They were listed as buildings of grade two architectural and  historical importance in 1988.    Mr. Barr-Smith was reluctant yesterday to discuss the  intervention by the Foreign Office. "Publicity at this stage  would not help my cause," he said.    Lee Prebble, chief development control officer of Sevenoaks  Council, said the recommendation for planning permission had  been withdrawn because of the Foreign Office letter and concern  about crime, and a noise objection.</p>

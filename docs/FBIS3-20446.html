There was a young Hong Kong  capitalist, 30-some years old, who was in the textile-garment  business, primarily making blue jeans. Sorry I cannot recall his  name now; I only remember people used to call him "trousers  king." He was from Guangdong's Huizhou. During the Cultural  Revolution, he was among the Red Guard's "leisure faction," and  he fled to Hong Kong illegally. At first he worked in a small  garment factory, and after finishing his own work, he would  volunteer to help the boss with odd jobs. The boss liked him and  promoted him to foreman and later assistant plant manager to  help run the business. During the oil crisis in 1977, Hong Kong  was in an economic slump. The boss did not want to continue the  business and sold it to him at a very low price. Then he began  to receive orders from the United States and got his quotas, and  that was how he got started.    When I visited him, he had already set up a branch company  in  the United States. He had more than a dozen branch factories in  Hong Kong, Africa, and the mainland. He not only had Hong Kong  quotas but also mainland quotas and was doing $200 million in  business a year. This was a typical example of how Hong Kong  people took advantage of every opportunity. This young man was a  vegetarian; he never married; he worked hard and was an honest  man. He moved his brothers from Guangdong to Hong Kong and let  them manage his companies. When Tan [word omitted] yun and I  toured his factory, he laid out everything and talked for more  than an hour about how he got started by utilizing Mao Zedong's  dialectics to run his business. He changed the quotations from  Mao Zedong slightly and turned them into his own ideologies,  terms, and rules in educating his workers. Slogans were posted  everywhere on the walls of his factory. He told me that he had  gotten started on the quotations from Mao Zedong. He did not  appear to be insincere; he probably did apply the principle of  dialectics to market operations. I asked him, "How many are  there in Hong Kong who are just like you?" He said, "I am not  the only one." I was moved. There was a saying, "a worm in the  mainland turns into a dragon in Hong Kong." It vividly showed  that the mainland system restricted human development as well as  economic development.    Let's tell another story of how a "worm turned into a  dragon." Liu Yongling [0491 3057 7881] went to Hong Kong in the  1960's, and when he first arrived, he had only $20 on him. I  visited him when I was working in Hong Kong. By then, his house  was no smaller than Pao Yu-kang's [0545 3768 0474] summer home.    He was working with Nanjing's No. 8 Machine Tool Factory and  Suzhou's Changfeng Machinery Factory to produce plastic molding  machines. At that time, the mainland's plastics industry was in  its infancy, and there was tremendous demand for plastic molding  machines. His method was to process imported materials; he  imported spare parts and components and made large molding  pieces in the Chinese factories and then complete the assembly  work. In fact, based on the amount of work performed to complete  each machine, more than 70 percent of the processing work was  done in the mainland; basically, they were mainland-made  products. But according to Chinese policies at that time,  processed imported materials were not counted as Chinese-made,  and basically they had to be sold abroad. Liu Yongling took  advantage of that loophole and used the so-called "taking  delivery of a foreign-sale product on the mainland" approach to  sell those machines on the mainland. That was how he got  started. Subsequently, he set up a processing plant in  Shataukok's tax-free zone and became very successful. His  company was appraised to be worth more than his original  investment. He then mortgaged his assets and took out a loan  from a Hong Kong bank to open a 100,000 sq meter factory in  Shenzhen's Shekou.    I cut the ribbon for his new factory when it opened in 1989.  He told me then he intended to hire 10,000 workers. He already  had 3,000 people, including several hundred technical personnel  who had graduated from various Chinese universities. He no  longer limited himself to making molding machines but was also  producing some mechanical and electronics products. He had  invited the presidents and vice presidents of Beijing  University, Qinghua, Fudan, Shanghai's Jiaotung University, and  Nanjing University to attend the opening ceremony. He told me  that he had signed contracts with those five famous universities  to do scientific research and development work. I thought that  was indeed farsighted. Giving priority to scientific and  technological development meant that success would be no  accident. He had gathered the technological and scientific  talents of several hundred university graduates and was  combining that with the scientific and technological strength of  five famous universities. His future development will be even  greater. He probably was the first in Hong Kong to take that  approach. He also has a unique way of thinking. He said he did  not support communism, but he supported the current CPC  leadership.    China's reform and opening up once again brought the Hong  Kong people's spirit of seizing every available opportunity into  full play. China was a main target of Hong Kong investments.  Prior to 1990, Hong Kong had accounted for more than 60 percent  of all investments made by foreign nations and regions. Today,  although there are substantial Taiwanese and foreign  investments, the percentage of Hong Kong investments remains  high. Today, not only small and medium-sized businesses are  investing in the mainland, but some of the biggest names such as  Li Ka-Hsing and Wu Kuang-cheng [0702 0342 2973], Pao Yu-Kang's  son-in-law, are also doing business there. No doubt they will be  very successful.    We can say that Hong Kong has not failed to seize every  political and economic development opportunity the world and  Southeast Asia have to offer; it has made timely development  every time. Hong Kong has become a free, open, diversified  market. Despite its tiny size, it has shown tremendous capacity.  Today, Hong Kong businessmen and Hong Kong money are showing up  all over the world. To different extents the continents have  become Hong Kong's market and business arena.    Hong Kong is indeed a miracle to be proud of.

Yokohama left a deep impression. Of Japan's eight  major cities, Yokohama was the only self-sufficient one; the  Japanese central government had to subsidized the others. When  we toured the city, the mayor made a special point of telling us  their experience, and I was very interested and asked some  detailed questions. Gu Mu teased me, telling the mayor, "Mr Xu  is very interested in your experience because he hopes to apply  that in Jiangsu."    The reason Yokohama was self-sufficient was because the city  government operated many businesses, especially the real estate  business. To build the grounds for the World's Fair, they  leveled mountains and filled the sea to create land. Must of the  funds came from bank loans. They signed one contract with the  banks and took out loans in installments.    At that time, I could not understand why they turned to bank  loans and how they took out loans in installments. I asked the  mayor. He explained that the first loan installment was for  development. After the preliminary development, the project was  turned over to private parties for further development. The  businesses that took over the project had to pay a percentage in  deposit, and the city government used that money to start  another project and used the second and third loan installments  to make interest payments. The mayor said that not only were  they reclaiming land from the sea but the flattened hillsides  also provided new land for development. The land development  projects were undertaken by city-owned companies. The city  government used revenues generated by these city-owned companies  to supplement tax revenue shortfalls and other municipal  expenses, and therefore they did not need central government  subsidies.    That was the first time I learned about how real estate  development could be so profitable.    When I began working in Hong Kong, I felt that Hong Kong  people's approach to the real estate business was no less  brilliant.    Take the example of Huang Jin-hui [7806 6930 6540],  son-in-law of former KMT general and united front target Wang  Yao-Wu [3769 5069 2976], who developed a piece of land in the  New Territories and built a village there. Fei Yimin [6316 1744  3046], a good friend of Huang, persuaded me to take part in the  ribbon-cutting ceremony. I agreed.    Fei Yimin's son was manager of Huang's company. On the day  of  the opening ceremony, he gave me a ride, and in the car, he told  me about how they did business. Huang Jin-hui had bought a piece  of land in the New Territories for more than HK$100 million.  After the land was developed, they began to offer pre-sales,  meaning that even before they began building the houses -- when  they only had the drawings on paper, they would sell those  houses; the buyers only made a down payment.    In the village to be built by Huang Jin-hui, the buyers paid  30 percent down. With those deposits, he had the money to build  the houses and could operate without borrowing money from the  bank. Installment payments allowed more people to afford their  own homes, and it made it easier for the sellers to sell homes.  This kind of "buy now pay later" policy which increased the  consumers' purchasing power and accelerated the circulation of  real estate funds really impressed me.    I reported to Zhao Ziyang and Li Xiannian on this approach.  I  said, Hong Kong's real estate industry has become one of the  Hong Kong economy's mainstay industries. Its real estate  industry to a large part owes its development to the separation  of ownership rights and use-rights. Ownership right to the land  belongs to the Hong Kong government, but use-right can be bought  and sold, and a time limit is put on the use-right -- 99 years  for Hong Kong island and 75 years for the New Territories. I  suggested that the mainland also adopt the method to develop the  real estate industry -- ownership right should go to the state  and should be publicly-owned, so as not to compromise the public  ownership system, and use-right should be privately owned. They  did not respond at the time, but they probably paid some  attention.    With respect to the use of bank funds and social funds, Hong  Kong people are very smart. This was obvious in the way the Hong  Kong businessmen invested in hotel constructions in the  mainland. When they built hotels, they utilized little of their  own funds, but they were very profitable. This was because they  mainly used bank funds, and at first, their loans were  guaranteed by Bank of China. From the selection of hotel sites  to the design, construction, installation, finishing of the  interior, and actual operations, everything was managed by the  Hong Kong businessmen. Often they were able to recoup their  investment, and even made a profit, in material and equipment  purchases and in interior installations alone. At first I did  not understand the arrangement where the Chinese side would  provide the land and the Hong Kong side would control the stock  and the operation but let the Chinese take over the hotels in 15  or 20 years. It was later that I came to understand that by the  time the hotels were turned over to the Chinese, the Hong Kong  businessmen would have earned 15-20 years' worth of profit  already. (Installment No. 84)  <H5>  [28 Jul 93 p 2] </H5>   [Text] The Unique Hong Kong Culture    Hong Kong is an open society. Information travels fast and  business competition is intense, and these allow the Hong Kong  people to quickly adapt to and utilize the latest methods of  modern market and enterprise management and administration. They  make continuous improvements and changes with each passing day.  In 1986, a Hong Kong entrepreneur introduced me to the  investment concept of mutual funds. Back then, Hong Kong did not  have many mutual funds, but within a few years, they became very  popular. Mutual funds of all types flourished like bamboo shoots  after a spring rain.    Hong Kong people accept and utilize modern, advanced tools  and management methods quickly and effectively. The driving  force behind that ability is Hong Kong's unique cultural pattern  (and that itself is also a part of Hong Kong's own culture.)  This is a main reason behind Hong Kong's rapid rise to becoming  a great international metropolis.    We should begin with the educational background of Hong  Kong's development. Hong Kong's education system, from  kindergarten to university, emphasizes English. English is the  first language of the upper-middle class. Government documents  and company and institutional correspondence are primarily in  English. It is this language foundation that enables Hong Kong  people to go everywhere in the world to do business without  having to rely on translators. Businessmen from all over the  world who come to make connections and do business in Hong Kong  find it extra convenient because they speak the same language.    Hong Kong's lower-middle class primarily speaks Cantonese,  but Hong Kong's Cantonese is different from that spoken in  Guangzhou. Hong Kong's language contains a lot of English terms  which have been turned into a sort of colloquialism for the  common people. For example, they call street cars, "bashi"  ("bus"); a ball, "bo" instead of "qiao"; and hired cars, "dishi"  ("taxi".) Some people say that Hong Kong culture is neither  Eastern nor Western, Chinese nor English. They think that this  is backward. I disagree. I find Hong Kong's culture a good mix  of Chinese and foreign cultures; it has its progressive side. We  cannot judge it by its inability to carry forward and to absorb  our intrinsic culture; we should also look at the development  side.    Hong Kong's language and culture give it a definite edge and  facilitate international exchange and rapid absorption of  advanced experiences. With the exception of Singapore, no other  major Far Eastern cities, including Tokyo, Shanghai, Taipei, and  Soeul, are equipped or ready to replace Hong Kong in this  respect in the near or even not-so-near future. Hong Kong indeed  owes it all to the "English."  <H3>  A Proposal To Develop the Hainan Special Zone (Part 1 of 2):  Li Ka-Shing Expresses Interest In Investing in Hainan; He Wants  To Make Me Consultant and Li Pengfei Chairman of the Board </H3>   Applying the Hong Kong experience to develop the Hainan  Development Zone was an idea I suggested to Deng Xiaoping in a  letter.    Around 1986, at a private meeting with Li Ka-shing, we  talked  about constructions in Hainan Island. Li himself said that he  was interested in investing there. He said, "I can make a  one-time investment of HK$100 million to develop Hainan. But I  have one condition: Either you go to Hainan and take up  leadership position there -- perhaps as a concurrent position,  or I can set up a company and you act as chairman of the board."    When I first arrived in Hong Kong, Li Ka-shing had indicated  that he had no interest in investing in the mainland. He had  been complaining then that, "Even before I finished negotiating  a project, people are already saying I am making this much or  that much money off of the state. I have decided never to invest  in the mainland. I may donate some money though." This time, he  actually volunteered to invest in Hainan, which was quite  unexpected. I immediately applauded him, but I also said, "I am  already 70-something. I am too old to govern Hainan. The central  authorities probably will not let me go. I am too old and have  little energy left. The central government probably will not  let me serve as chairman of the board either. But if you invest  there, I can be your consultant. I think the government will  agree to that."    I figured that Li was worried that his investing in the  mainland would make things difficult all around. I could serve  as his advisor to smooth things for him, and he would have less  to worry about.    Upon hearing that, Li asked me, "How about getting Li  Pengfei  to be chairman of the board?" I said, "So long as you trust  him." I promised Li Ka-shing that I would report to the central  government on his plans.    At that time, I thought, if Li Ka-shing would indeed invest  in Hainan Island, it not only would help develop the mainland  but would also create a new situation where Hong Kong and  overseas funds would be attracted to the mainland. It would also  have a tremendous effect on stabilizing Hong Kong. But I had  never been to Hainan, and everything I knew were second-hand. I  decided to pay a visit. At that time, the National People's  Congress was in session. I looked up Guangdong's provincial  party commission secretary, Lin Ruo [2621 5387], and Governor Ye  Xuanping [5509 6693 1627], indicating that I was interested in  visiting Hainan while the Congress was holding group meetings.  They both said that I would be welcomed. Ye Xuanping explained  that he was heading the delegation and could not take time off  and so he could not accompany me, but he immediately called up  Hainan's district party committee and made arrangements for me.    I requested a few days off from the Congress's secretary  general and went off to Hainan. Hainan Administrative District's  party committee secretary, Yao Wenxu [1202 2429 4872], met me  and showed me around the island. He and the Hainan district,  county, and city leaders made a detailed presentation of the  situation there. Hainan indeed is another pearl of South China.  It has great location, climate, and plenty of natural resources  (although it has a shortage of trained personnel, and its  educational standard is low.) The only thing it needs was to be  developed.    I told Yao Wenxu my tentative plans after the tour. I said I  planned to suggest to the central government to separate Hainan  from Guangdong and turn it into a separate province and make it  the nation's largest special zone. I wanted the central  government to grant the Hainan special zone more "special"  policies than any other special zone. Upon hearing that, the  district party committee comrades were delighted. Yao Wenxu  said, since the "auto incident" (see footnote,) the central  government had "taken away" all preferential policies once  granted to Hainan. Things had been tough and morale had been low  among the cadres. He was hopeful that the central authorities  would consider my proposal. He added, "Before setting up the  large special zone, it would be best that the central  authorities could restore the preferential policies, or at least  restore some of them even if not all them." I understood. He  had little confidence that my suggestion of a large special zone  would be accepted. (Installment No. 85)</p>

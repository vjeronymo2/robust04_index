			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: GKN invests Pounds 50m in joint venture with Fiat GKN, the motor components and industrial services group, is to invest Pounds 50m in a joint venture with Fiat which will supply the Italian vehicle maker with key driveline components from a new factory near Florence. GKN will hold 85 per cent of GKN Component Firenze with Fiat Auto holding the balance. It will initially take over an existing Fiat business making constant velocity joints and driveshafts under GKN licence at Novoli in Florence. This site, which employs 700, will remain under Fiat's ownership. It will stay in production until the new plant is brought on stream at the end of next year at Campo Bisenzio, 15km west of Florence, to which most of the work force is expected to transfer. The new venture will supply components for Fiat's car plants in Italy and eastern Europe, with the possibility of non-Fiat customers being added later.</p>

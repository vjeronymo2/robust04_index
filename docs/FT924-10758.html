			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bauxite output down in Jamaica JAMAICA'S bauxite (alumin-ium ore) production in the third quarter of this year was 2.87m tonnes, 6.2 per cent less than in the corresponding quarter of 1991. The Jamaica Bauxite Institute, the state agency that monitors the industry, said export of crude bauxite in the third quarter was 1.09m tonnes, 10 per cent less than in the third quarter of 1991. Third-quarter exports of alumina (aluminium oxide) fell 1.7 per cent to 728,781 tonnes. The declines in production and exports were caused mainly by the termination late last year of a contract to supply 1m tonnes of ore a year to the former Soviet Union.</p>

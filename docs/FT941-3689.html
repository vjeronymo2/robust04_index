			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: ECC holds pay-out despite earnings fall English China Clays held its 20p total dividend for 1993, as promised with last year's rights issue, although earnings per share of 20.45p, against 26.72p, barely covered the pay-out. Mr Andrew Teare, chief executive, said the thin dividend cover had not constrained the business. Calgon, the US-based chemicals business acquired halfway through the year for Pounds 202.3m, partly funded by the Pounds 113.4m rights issue, contributed Pounds 7.2m to operating profits of Pounds 105.2m (Pounds 90.7m). Its purchase was 'mildly earnings enhancing,' Mr Teare said. Group turnover rose 17 per cent to Pounds 1.13bn, with continuing operations up 9 per cent at Pounds 1.05bn. Pre-interest profits of Pounds 105.3m (Pounds 105.6m) included nearly Pounds 18m of profits on land sales, part of ECC's strategy of running down its housing land bank. They were struck after a Pounds 1.8m of profits on disposals and Pounds 1.7m of provisions for costs of the demerger of the construction materials side. In 1992 there was a net Pounds 17.1m profit on disposals. Interest charges rose by Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 17.2m, to leave pre-tax profits down from Pounds 100.2m to Pounds 88.1m. At the operating level, ECC International, the minerals division, increased sales volumes by 2 per cent, but a squeeze on prices and cost increases cut operating margins from 15.6 to 11.1 per cent, with operating profits down from Pounds 91.8m to Pounds 74.4m, before Pounds 3.3m of rationalisation costs. Construction materials profits recovered from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 16.9m, before an asset write down of Pounds 1.4m (rationalisation costs of Pounds 5.5m). Construction, which included the land sales, chipped in Pounds 20m (Pounds 8.3m).</p>

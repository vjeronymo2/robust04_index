			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> SIRI LANKA CURRY HOUSE: TASTEFUL TOUCH, RARE CUISINE  </P> <P> About 10 years ago, there was a Sri Lankan restaurant in Encino, right across  the street from a Burger King, and it was one spunky little place. Unknown as  its cuisine was in Encino, it boldly answered the Home of the Whopper with a  sign declaring itself to be the "Home of the Hopper."  </P> <P> The problem was that not enough people knew that a hopper is a Sri Lankan  delicacy, a delicate crepe made from coconut and rice meal. Encinans didn't get  the joke, and they didn't eat anywhere near enough hoppers. Pretty soon the  Home of the Hopper disappeared.  </P> <P> It was a shame, because Sri Lankan food is very attractive, rather like Indian  food, though not as similar as Sri Lanka's location off the southern tip of  India might lead you might expect. Often, with its coconut sauces and  non-chutney side dishes, it seems a first cousin to Indonesian food.  </P> <P> It's also a rare cuisine; there are only three Sri Lankan restaurants in the  entire country, according to the owners of one in Hollywood that is buried in a  corner of a mini-mall and insists on making it hard for people to get its  number from Information by spelling "Sri" as two syllables ("Siri").  </P> <P> Don't let that stop you. This is a very interesting restaurant indeed, starting  with the papadums. As at many an Indian restaurant, they bring out these  paper-thin chickpea nachos before you order, accompanied by a hot and a sweet  chile sauce, and also an unusual apple chutney. It's chunks of stewed apple  mixed with what tastes remarkably like American barbecue sauce. The restaurant  even sells the sauce by the pint for barbecue purposes.  </P> <P> These sauces, chutneys or whatever you wish to call them, are also handy if you  order any of the knickknacks (Sri Lankans do not actually eat an appetizer  course, but the restaurant offers some Sri Lankan snacks, under not  particularly helpful names; e.g., "patties" are samosas). I'm thinking of the  vades, "vegeburgers" made from yellow lentils, green chiles and onions; by  themselves they're a little dry, served with nothing but a condiment of fried  coconut.  </P> <P> The main part of the menu is a list of nine curries, including squid curry and  even chicken giblet curry. They're all prepared differently. The crab curry,  for instance, is in a tart coconut sauce said to have some ground rice in it --  it's a great sauce, and makes up for the fact that there's not much to the crab  that's served in it.  </P> <P> Four of the curries go into a Sri Lankan specialty called lampries. This word,  pronounced "lump rice," has nothing to do with the eel-like fish called  lamprey, excessive eating of which is said to have killed Henry I of England.  Like the Indonesian rijsttafel, it's a Dutch word (lomprijst) and in a way it's  the equivalent of that Indonesian feast.  </P> <P> But whereas rijsttafel is rice plus a lot of side dishes, lampries consists of  rice, lamb, chicken, beef and pork curries, and several other things mixed  together and steamed in a banana leaf. Eating lampries is not the best way to  learn the difference between the different curries, of course, but you can  distinguish the lamb (tamarind flavor, gamy lamb aroma), the beef (coconut and  garlic) and the pork (ginger, tomato) from the chicken (just sort of curried).  </P> <P> Mixed in with the curries are likely to be a sweet eggplant condiment (I could  make a meal of it alone), a similar condiment called seenisambola made from  onions fried dark brown and cooked with tamarind and sugar, and a couple of  other things like toasted shredded coconut and cashews. Lampries needs to be  advance-ordered, with about an hour's notice.  </P> <P> There are a dozen other entrees ranging from a curious dish called "roasted  curried chicken" to a fish marinated in lemon and saffron and served in a  surprisingly spicy sauce with a generous chicken pilaf on the side. The chicken  has the waxy texture of duck and is not particularly spicy, but it comes with a  coconut sauce, a vegetable pilaf and the usual accompaniments of sweet eggplant  and cucumber and onion in yogurt.  </P> <P> Apart from the curry list there are several vegetable dishes, a list of  specialties including mallung (shredded vegetables fried with mustard, garlic  and coconut; you sprinkle it on other dishes for a tart flavor) and of course  hoppers, which you can get with any curry. Even better than plain hoppers  (called appe on the menu) are the curiously named string hoppers, little  patties of steamed vermicelli made from rice and coconut.  </P> <P> The desserts are a strange handful. Vatalappan is a Sri Lankan cousin of  coconut flan, but with a rather flabby texture, and there are some very strange  cakes: rich cake, which tastes like fruitcake, and love cake, which tastes like  compacted coconut. The best dessert by far is ice cream with a generous  sprinkling of "cashew nugget," which turns out to be like the French almond  candy praline, only made from cashews.  </P> <P> I know Siri Lanka Curry House hasn't asked my advice, but I think they should  have a sign reading: Home of the Lampries, the Cashew Nugget and the String  Hopper.  </P> <P> Suggested dishes: vegetable patties, $1.60; string hoppers with meat curry, $5;  lampries, $11; ice cream with cashew nugget, $1.50.  </P> <P> Siri Lanka Curry House, 1308 Fountain Ave., Los Angeles. (213) 466-8238. Open  continuously for breakfast, lunch and dinner daily. No alcoholic beverages.  Parking lot. All major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $13 to  $35.  </P> <P> </P></p>

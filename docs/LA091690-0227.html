			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO SIDES OF THE GETO-GEFFEN FLAP  </P> <P> In the Aug. 26 Pop Eye column, Monica Lynch of Tommy Boy Records and Bill  Adler, rap activist and marketing agent, charged that Geffen Records exercised  racism by refusing to release an album by the controversial rap group the Geto  Boys even though the company had released albums by offensive comedian Andrew  Dice Clay and foul-mouthed rockers Guns N' Roses.  </P> <P> Critics of Geffen Records fail to realize that groups such as the Geto Boys  rely exclusively on raunchy lyrics glamorizing violence, racism and misogyny.  </P> <P> Their music and lyrics have little purpose other than to shock and create  controversy.  </P> <P> Acts such as Clay and Guns N' Roses use controversial topics and foul language  to add to their material and enhance the overall product. Guns N' Roses'  oft-criticized song "One in a Million" uses seemingly racist and homophobic  comments to portray the confusion and fear of living on the streets of Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Clay's offensive material complements his persona and entire act, which is not  composed of only vulgar material.  </P> <P> People are often too quick to cry "Racism!" when presented with two seemingly  similar cases in which different ethnic groups are represented. This time they  should look beyond the surface and see that this is not a case of white versus  black, but rather art versus trash.  </P> <P> MICHAEL LIM  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Estates  </P></p>

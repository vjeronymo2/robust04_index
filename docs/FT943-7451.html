			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Aerospace Engineering 71% ahead Aerospace Engineering, the precision engineering group, lifted pre-tax profits by 71 per cent from Pounds 214,000 to Pounds 367,000 during the year to April 30. Mr John Davis, chairman and chief executive, said the group was benefiting from the rationalisation programme completed last year. The balance sheet was strengthened, he added, following the sale of a surplus property in Swindon. There was improved demand for printed circuit boards and the group expected microwave board demand to continue growing. Turnover of continuing activities slipped to Pounds 15.7m (Pounds 17.6m). Earnings per share rose from 0.25p to 0.64p and the dividend is held at 0.75p with an unchanged final of 0.5p.</p>

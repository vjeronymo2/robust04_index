			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the legal requirements respecting proprietary information, the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and FOIA Exemption 6, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6), pertain to the disclosure of information on individuals. Accordingly, even if information is not withheld as proprietary, it still may be withheld pursuant to the Privacy Act or Exemption 6. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Information Regarded as Proprietary by the GSEs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to March 1, 1994, Departmental staff met separately with staff of each GSE to discuss the subject of proprietary information in view of the impending deadline for receipt of materials by HUD in accordance with the Notices. Fannie Mae staff advised that, notwithstanding that it considered most of the information submitted under the Notice to be proprietary, Fannie Mae sought for HUD to withhold only certain data from the loan-level data files because, if released, such data would cause substantial competitive harm to Fannie Mae. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both GSEs pointed out that, because the Act requires the Secretary to release information on census tract location of properties, releasing other details on specific loans such as unpaid principal balance (UPB), date of mortgage note, loan type, loan-to-value ratio (LTV), and similar terms would cause competitive harm by permitting the other GSE or other market competitors to gain competitive advantage from the information. For example the GSEs argue that: Releasing loan-level information on each properties' UPB and census tract location will reveal what size loans a GSE is willing to buy in a particular area, at what prices and on what terms, and that such information will assist competitors in the same market and other markets. Likewise, customers will use the information to obtain insight into each GSEs' pricing and marketing strategies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Correspondence from the GSEs details the GSEs' objections to release of items in the loan-level data files. This correspondence, attached to and incorporated in this Notice of Temporary Order, includes: Exhibit B_a letter from Anthony F. Marra, Senior Vice President and Deputy General Counsel of Fannie Mae, to Kenneth A. Markison, Assistant General Counsel for Administrative Law, dated March 11, 1994; and Exhibit C_a letter from Allan G. Ratner, Vice President and Deputy General Counsel of Freddie Mac, to Mr. Markison, dated May 9, 1994. This correspondence lists the particular data items that each GSE requested be withheld. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Freddie Mac requested the withholding of more items than Fannie Mae. Both GSEs requested that the Secretary treat the GSEs' information the same so that any information deemed proprietary for one GSE is deemed proprietary for the other GSE. Accordingly, where only one GSE requested proprietary treatment for a particular category of information, this Temporary Order provides that such information is treated as proprietary for both GSEs. Exhibit A identifies the items requested to be withheld as proprietary: Solely by Freddie Mac (marked with an ``*''); solely by Fannie Mae (marked with ``**''); and by both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae (unmarked). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department will comply fully with the requirements of the Act and will make available to the public data submitted to HUD by the GSEs, consisting of income, census tract location, race, and gender of mortgagors of single family properties. However, having considered the views of the GSEs concerning the disclosure of the remainder of the data and the statutory requirements concerning withholding proprietary information, it is concluded that a Temporary Order is necessary to protect other information submitted by the GSEs, not in the foregoing categories, which the GSEs regard as proprietary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The legislative history of the Act characterizes the lack of information on the GSEs' performance as ``an information vacuum.'' S. Rep. No. 102&hyph;282, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. 39 (1992). The legislative history notes that ``public access and disclosure of information is a key tool for permitting appropriate public scrutiny and oversight of the activities of the [GSEs] and in evaluating possible improvements in housing finance markets.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ID <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . at 44. On the other hand, the Act also protects proprietary information from release. Based on the submissions of both GSEs, the information in the attached Exhibit A shall be deemed proprietary. The Secretary further concludes, however, that: This Order should be temporary; the public should be accorded full opportunity to comment during the regulatory process; and this Temporary Order should expire no later than the date regulations fully addressing this subject are effective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This Temporary Order does not extend to aggregated data information in the data reports and the written reports submitted by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Such data are not regarded as causing substantial competitive harm by the GSEs and, at such time as this information is requested by the public, it will be released. Even though loan-level information is not deemed proprietary under this Temporary Order, other statutes, including the Privacy Act of 1974 and Exemption 6 of FOIA, may pertain and result in withholding of information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

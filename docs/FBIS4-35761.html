			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Israel has continued its acts of aggression  against Lebanese territory. According to reports from south  Lebanon this morning, in the past few hours Israeli forces  bombarded a large number of the central sector villages with  heavy artillery. In addition, Israeli helicopters flew over  Tyre and the coastal road from the city up to the western  sector. The Lebanese Army confronted the Israeli aircraft with  various types of antiaircraft weapons and prevented them from  achieving their goals. [passage omitted]    We have just received the following report from the editor's  desk: According to the NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY correspondent in  al-Nabatiyah, Israeli warplanes flew at low altitude over  al-Nabatiyah and Iqlim al-Tuffah between 0630 and 0710 this  morning. The Lebanese Army ground defenses engage the planes.  The al-Litani River basin and nearby areas came under an  artillery barrage from the Israeli positions in Tallat 'Alman  and Tallat al-Shumariyah shortly after midnight. The barrage  was accompanied by machine-gun fire targeting the outskirts of  Zawtar al-Sharqiyah and Zawtar al-Gharbiyah. Israeli warplanes  continued to fly over the south all last night and dropped  dozens of flares. Israeli aircraft continue to fly over the  south.</p>

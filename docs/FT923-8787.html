			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / International Company News: Swiss Volksbank slips 8% in first six months SWISS VOLKSBANK, Switzerland's fourth largest bank, has reported an 8 per cent slide in its pre-tax profits to SFr172m (Dollars 130.3m) in the first half. The bank shied away from a forecast for the full year, observing that its first-half result had been 'positively influenced partly by volatile earnings factors'. 'Our overall result will be decisively influenced by the future development of interest rates as well as by our provisioning requirements,' Volksbank said. Gross revenue fell 2.7 per cent to SFr581m because of an 11 per cent slump in interest income to SFr323m. Commission business was up 10 per cent to SFr121m and trading gained 8.3 per cent to SFr117m. The bank has announced a programme involving eliminating 500 jobs by the end of 1993. Holvis Holzstoff, the Swiss distribution and nonwoven fabrics group, said sales advanced 5.5 per cent in the first half to SFr428.3m. It forecast turnover growth of about 8 per cent for the full year and expected the profit margin to be equal to or slightly better than that achieved last year.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Hopes fade for cut in US rates: Fed believes recent data do not point to a fresh slowdown THE US Federal Reserve seems unlikely to cut interest rates before the presidential election on November 3 because it regards as inconclusive recent signs of a slowing of economic growth. Recent data confirm that economic growth is not accelerating, as previously predicted, but they do not point conclusively to a fresh slowdown, a senior Fed official said. The official said relatively strong figures for car, truck and retail sales conflicted with other evidence of economic weakness, such as last week's poor employment data. He said the most likely prospect was for a continuation of growth in the 1-2 per cent range. But he conceded such sluggish growth might result in a further increase in unemployment in coming months. A cut in US rates was widely expected in financial markets this week following disappointing economic reports, including falls in industrial orders, consumer confidence and employment. The Fed's reluctance to cut rates probably also reflected a desire not to appear partisan in the approach to the presidential election or to cause further turbulence in currency markets, where the dollar remains weak. The official said much of the dollar's weakness reflected temporary interest rate differentials and was not a source of concern in the longer term. He was sceptical of the merits of a short-term fiscal boost to 'kick start' the economy, even if it were linked to longer-term fiscal restraint. The main factor depressing economic growth was balance sheet strains, reflecting high debts accumulated in the 1980s to buy assets, such as real estate, that had since fallen in value. The need to rebuild savings and reduce debts had diverted purchasing power and meant there was no way of avoiding a long adjustment period, he said. He added that the process of repairing balance sheets had been under way for almost three years but was only about half complete. The economy might be affected by weakened balance sheets for another three years although the effects might progressively diminish. Reductions in long-term bond yields would do far more to stimulate the economy than further cuts in short-term rates, which were already down to 3 per cent. Long-term rates were high mainly because markets were worried by the US's large structural budget deficit and by the risk that inflation would begin rising again in a few years. The official said long-term rates could fall as much as 1.5 percentage points, to about 6 per cent, if agreement could be reached on a credible fiscal package involving statutory reductions in 'entitlement' programmes such as federal health care and pensions. The official defended the Fed's 'gradualist' policy of lowering interest rates. He said the Fed could not have moved any faster for fear of raising inflationary fears and putting upward pressure on long-term bond yields. Southern comfort, Page 20 US stocks, Page 41</p>

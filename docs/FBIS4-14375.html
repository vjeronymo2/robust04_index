			<p>BFN     [Text] Informed Palestinian sources have said that  Damascus refused to receive Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat's envoy, whom he dispatched last week in an attempt to  improve Syria's relationship with the chairman of the PLO  Executive Committee.    'Arafat's envoy, who is a member of the PLO Executive  Committee and who arrived unexpectedly in Damascus, returned  without achieving anything because of the Syrian officials'  refusal to receive him.    It has been learned that 'Arafat's envoy met Khalid  al-Fahum,  head of the Salvation Front, but nothing has been reported about  what transpired at this meeting.    The PLO Executive Committee member who visited Damascus has  reportedly said that he did not have a mission of reconciliation  between the Syrian president and 'Arafat but that he traveled  there "to perform a social duty."</p>

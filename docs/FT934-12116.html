			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Construction orders decline CONSTRUCTION orders fell by 1 per cent to just under Pounds 4bn in the three months to August, Department of the Environment figures released yesterday show. The figures underline the industry's fragile recovery. The decline from the previous three months provided further ammunition for the industry, which is increasingly worried about possible cuts in government construction spending in next month's Budget. Although total orders rose 8 per cent compared with the same period of 1992, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said the latest figures offered 'few crumbs of comfort'. New orders in private housing were 8 per cent lower in the June-to-August period than in the previous three months, but 6 per cent higher than in the same period last year. Private commercial orders were 13 per cent higher than in March-to-May and 21 per cent higher than in June-to-August of last year.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: International Semi-Tech in Dollars 140m Singer issue INTERNATIONAL Semi-Tech Microelectronics, the fast-growing Toronto-based holding company, is raising USDollars 140m through a Hong Kong affiliate by issuing shares to the public in Singer, the sewing machine and household appliance company. Semi-Tech Global, a Hong Kong-based public company 40 per cent owned by ISTM, plans a secondary offering of 7m Singer common shares at USDollars 20 each. Another 1.1m shares would be available, if necessary, to cover any over-subscriptions. The issue will cut Semi-Tech's stake in Singer from 67 per cent to 51 per cent. The bulk of the offering will be in the US, but a tranche of 1.75m shares will be available to an international syndicate led by Merrill Lynch, Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Credit Suisse First Boston. Singer was listed on the New York Stock Exchange last August. Its shares were trading at Dollars 20.25 each before yesterday's announcement. Mr James Ting, Semi-Tech's chairman, said the proceeds would be used for acquisitions to complement Singer's businesses. He said Semi-Tech had no intention of further reducing its stake in Singer.</p>

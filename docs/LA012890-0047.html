			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR MORTGAGE;  </P> <P> MAKING SENSE OF LENDERS' TERMS  </P> <P> QUESTION: We are shopping around for a mortgage for our first home, and are  very confused about the many mortgages that currently are available. The  adjustable-rate mortgage is of interest to us, but we do not understand how  that works.  </P> <P> We have heard that there may be problems with this kind of loan. What exactly  is an adjustable-rate mortgage, and do you have any advice on whether we should  use this form of loan?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Every day, it seems that the creative mortgage financing industry comes  up with a new kind of mortgage -- or at least a new twist on the old ones. Many  of the mortgages have acronyms, and thus you may see such mortgages as RAMs  (reverse annuity mortgages), SAMs (shared appreciation mortgages), GEMs  (growing equity mortgages), and, of course, ARMs (adjustable rate mortgages).  </P> <P> The larger number of mortgages currently available makes it quite difficult for  anyone -- be you a first-time buyer or an experienced investor -- to determine  exactly which mortgage is best.  </P> <P> The adjustable-rate mortgage was created in the early 1980s, when lenders were  burned because homeowners were repaying their loans at 8%, 9% or 10%, while the  cost of that money was then over 15%.  </P> <P> About eight or nine years ago, lenders made a basic decision. The shorter the  term of the loan, the lower the interest rate would be. Thus, today you can  still obtain a fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage, meaning that you will be  guaranteed that the mortgage payment will be the same every month. But the  fixed-rate 30-year mortgage -- even though currently quite low -- still carries  about the highest interest rate going.  </P> <P> The adjustable-rate mortgage is also guaranteed to stay on the books for 30  years, but the interest rate is adjusted periodically. There are variations on  the adjustable-rate theme. If the rate is adjusted every five years, for  example, the initial rate will be lower than for a fixed 30-year mortgage, but  higher than an adjustable-rate mortgage that adjusts every year.  </P> <P> Today, the most common ARMs are the one-year or three-year adjustable. But even  here, consumers should shop around for the best deal.  </P> <P> Here is what you should look for:  </P> <P> First and foremost, what is the initial interest rate? This rate is defined as  the rate on which your loan will be based in the adjustment period, whether  that is one, three or five years.  </P> <P> Second, is the ARM based on a negative amortization schedule? Although my  experience is that most ARMs currently are not amortized on a negative basis,  some lenders are still using the negative factor.  </P> <P> This means that, although you may be paying a low interest rate for the first  year -- let's say 7 1/2% or 8 1/2% -- the interest is still being charged on  your loan at a higher rate, for example 10% or 11%.  </P> <P> If this is the case, the extra interest payment (the difference between what  you are paying and what is being charged you) is added to your mortgage  balance. Under no circumstances can I recommend the negative amortization  mortgage.  </P> <P> Next, determine what the yearly rate adjustment will be. Is there a cap on the  yearly increases, and on what index does your lender base the adjustable rate?  </P> <P> Many lenders look at the weekly average yield on one-year Treasury bills, which  is published periodically by the Federal Reserve Board. Other lenders use the  so-called "cost of funds" approach, while others are beginning to use the  London Interbank Offered Rate (also called LIBOR). The question of which index  is better for home buying consumers is hotly debated, and must be reserved for  a subsequent column.  </P> <P> However, the lender then adds to that index a rate adjustment (called a  margin), and if the adjusted rate is higher than the old one, your interest  will be modified accordingly for the next year. This is confusing, but let us  look at an example.  </P> <P> The current Treasury Bill Index for one year is about 7.8. If the rate  adjustment offered by the lender (the index or margin) is 3 points, even if the  index stays at 7.8% next year, your new payments for the next year could be  increased to 10.8% (7.8 plus 3).  </P> <P> However, if there is an annual rate cap, you cannot be charged more than that  cap. Thus, if your loan is $100,000 at an initial rate of 7.5%, and if there is  a two-percentage point cap on yearly adjustments, even if the index increases  substantially, your new interest rate can only rise the first year to 9.5% (or  7.5 plus 2% cap).  </P> <P> Another point to consider is whether there is a ceiling on the overall amount  that your rate can increase. Lenders realize that the ARM without such a  ceiling is a potential disaster for consumers. If you start with a 7.5% loan,  and if there is a 2% point cap on the yearly increases, it is conceivable that  at the end of the fifth year you could be facing a mortgage rate of 17.5%, if  our economic picture becomes severe.  </P> <P> Thus, most lenders are now putting an overall ceiling on the amount that your  interest rate can rise. And usually it is limited to between 5 and 6 percentage  points. Thus, if your initial rate is 7.5%, the most you can ever pay wold be  13.5%.  </P> <P> Make sure that you understand what the ceilings are and get them in writing  before you commit yourself to an adjustable-rate mortgage.  </P> <P> Many lenders are also offering the option of converting the adjustable-rate  mortgage into a fixed-rate mortgage down the years. If this option is  available, obtain a clear understanding of how it works, when you can exercise  this option and what, if any, fee will be charged.  </P> <P> The adjustable-rate mortgage offers flexibility for many homeowners. However,  as in today's market conditions, where the spread between the initial ARM and a  fixed-rate mortgage is relatively small, you have to give serious thought to  whether you want the luxury of an initial low rate, with the potential drawback  of that rate increasing in subsequent years.  </P> <P> Additionally, you also have to determine how long you believe you will be  staying in your new property. If you will be keeping the house or the  condominium for only three or four years, in my opinion it certainly makes  sense to use the lower ARM concept.  </P> <P> Remember, you have the right to shop around for the best possible rate.  </P></p>

			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Old ways imperil the new Russia: The vested interests which hinder reforms MR Sergei Glaziev, Russia's 32-year-old minister for foreign economic relations, was en route to Africa on Friday when the Kremlin ordered his aircraft back in mid-flight. Before leaving he had introduced draconian rules to crack down on corruption in the distribution of lucrative export quotas. Before the weekend was out, Mr Glaziev had offered to quit his job, saying he had been the victim of 'mafia structures' and officials whose corrupt interests he had threatened. Mr Glaziev's resignation offer, a day after the resignation of Mr Mikhail Fedotov, the information minister, is symptomatic of the chaos at the top of reformist Russia as it seeks to shed its communist past for more democratic government. Yesterday morning, soon after Mr Fedotov said he was quitting in protest against parliament's moves to muzzle the media, gun shots were fired at his office. Mr Fedotov says he wants the media to be free of control from the presidential camp, but can do nothing because television is really controlled by Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, the presidential aide who is likely to take his job. The resignation of two young reformist ministers reflects more than just the harsh reality of politics around the world. In Russia it marks a struggle for reform without reformed decision-making. A chaotic and slow bureaucracy, set at times against the extensive personal power of President Boris Yeltsin, has become potentially lethal, given the all-out political war between president and the parliament which Mr Yeltsin wants to replace with a new bicameral assembly and a modern constitution. Although bitter at intrigues from within the presidential camp, even Mr Fedotov said there was no room for compromise with parliament on Mr Yeltsin's bid to push through new parliamentary elections in the autumn. 'We don't have a parliament. We have a parliamentary party,' he said. 'It and the presidential party must solve their argument through elections. The parliament does not want to compromise with the president - it just wants to do whatever it likes.' In the interim, though the alternatives presented by parliament are even less appealing, Mr Yeltsin's powers are clearly open to abuse, sometimes at the expense of the democratic, market-oriented reforms he says he is pursuing. In the case of the relatively junior and expendable Mr Glaziev, if his resignation is accepted, he will have become a scapegoat for Mr Yeltsin's need to appear as 'Mr Clean'. One sympathiser from the reformist wing of the government, who declined to be identified, said he was convinced Mr Glaziev was honest, even though officials in his ministry were certainly taking bribes. Until Russia removes export quotas altogether, foreign trade will remain a breeding-ground for corruption. But it is Mr Glaziev, who took the courageous decision to cut the number of organisations allowed to export strategic commodities, who is being forced to take the blame for trying to limit the abuses. In his resignation letter, Mr Glaziev said he had been hounded out of office by Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister and a key Yeltsin aide, who is being investigated for corruption at parliament's request. Previously a political weapon in the struggle between parliamentary and presidential camps, corruption allegations are now helping to tear apart the reformists in government. Radical reformers such as Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister who has complained of intrigues within the cabinet, have attempted to overcome inefficiency and abuses by taking as much decision-making as possible out of state hands. But Mr Yeltsin's own extensive powers, designed to cut through the inefficiency, have also proven a liability, given the amount of property and economic decision-making still controlled by the state. For instance, the president at the end of last year signed a decree which led to the 'irrevocable' transfer of a building worth millions of dollars in the centre of Moscow to a mainly private investment company headed by the former industry minister. In later trying to recover the building for other purposes, despite the terms of the contract saying it could not do so, the State Property Committee, which is responsible for both privatisation and managing property still in state hands, violated the very respect for property rights the economic reforms have tried to promote.</p>

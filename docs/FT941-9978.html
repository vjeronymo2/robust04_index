			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News (Results Preview): Downgrading of forecasts again outstrips upgrades - Profits are rising. But high share valuations imply companies can produce rapid earnings growth at a time of low inflation and slow economic growth. FT writers assess the prospects The stock market approaches the coming results season with the hope that the economic recovery which officially began in the second quarter of 1992 will at last be feeding through to corporate profits. It is, however, not an entirely confident expectation. While there were high hopes for 1993 early in the year - with stockbrokers BZW, for instance, seeing analysts upgrades exceed downgrades in the second quarter of the year for the first time in many quarters - that was reversed in the second half. Profit forecasts were hit by some severe downgradings towards the end of last year - for instance on stocks as diverse as BTR, GEC and food retailers. Mr Richard Kersley, market analyst at BZW, notes that the downgrades of 1993 had a different character to those in 1991 and 1992, when it was usually a case of the downturn in the economic cycle hitting profits. In 1993 the downgrades had little to do with the cycle, more with companies' ability to increase prices. While businesses in some sectors, such as building materials, were able to raise prices reflecting a cyclical upturn, it was sectors such as food retailers and pharmaceuticals that were hit by their lack of pricing power. Trading statements from companies have continued to lower analysts' expectations. There is a new spirit of disclosure by companies which should mean that those which can see that estimates are significantly different from the likely outturn put out a statement to that effect. That might be expected to prevent any nasty surprises coming out in the results as they are reported. Yet analysts are less sure than they once might have been about their forecasts, since many have been wrongfooted by such warnings. More important, perhaps, for the value of the stock market, will be the tone of chairmen's statements about current and future trading. However, as the numbers appear on dealing screens there is the possibility for much confusion as sizeable exceptional items are likely to continue to distort profits and the implementation of FRS 3 last year has, if anything, made the reported profit figure more difficult to inter-pret. In general, 1992 was a year of restructuring, rationalisation and redundancy costs with the addition of write-downs of asset values. By contrast 1993 figures will reflect a bounce in reported profits, simply because of the absence of such negatives. Mr Robert Buckland, market analyst at NatWest Markets, points out that the absence of large write-offs from three large companies alone, British Petroleum, British Aerospace and ICI, will account for a Pounds 2bn profit rise, equivalent to 10 per cent of the market's earnings base. On top of that, the benefit of cost-cutting measures and the ability to make higher profits from written down assets - such as housebuilders which have cut the value of their land banks - should be coming through in higher profit margins. The profit rise from the former is exceptional, but the gain from the latter can be argued to be either unrepeatable or to reflect underlying growth. Or as Mr Roger Barker of UBS, the brokers, puts it: 'We are now starting to see more of the profits increase generated from higher demand rather than productivity'. As a result of the large write-offs in 1992, there is a wide difference in forecasts of reported 'headline' numbers and profit rises excluding exceptionals. A further complication is that write-offs are likely to have continued into 1993. While it might have seemed that the 1992 results included the kitchen sink, many companies will have found further causes of one-off costs in 1993. While the headline number could show a rise for industrial stocks of 20 per cent or even 30 per cent, most forecasts for underlying, adjusted profits growth percentages lie somewhere in the teens. Most brokers focus on growth in profits and earnings from the industrial group, which excludes oil and gas, and the financial sector. The oil and gas and financial areas are likely to show much better growth than industrials, if only because of the bounce back from difficulties. Banks, for example, are recovering from the massive bad debt provisions they were forced to take in the recession. Expectations of earnings growth in 1994 are for about 15 per cent from the industrial sector, although as one market strategist said: 'If it turns out that people were not in the right place for 1993, that could undermine confidence in 1994 forecasts'. The 1994 estimate is likely to be a more 'real' figure than the 1993 number which will reflect recovery more than growth. As one analyst puts it: 'The quality of earnings is rising'. It must be remembered too, that forecasts of percentage earnings growth in the mid-teens for both 1993 and 1994 compare with inflation forecasts in low single figures. The combination of 1993 and 1994 will produce a sharp rise in real earnings, which many strategists believe underpins the stock market's current valuation. Most expect a much slower rise in dividends than in earnings, as companies seek to rebuild cover which sank to low levels in 1992. While earnings were falling in 1991 and 1992, dividends at the end of 1992 were at the same level as they had been in 1990. Forecasts centre on a 4 per cent rise in 1993 and 6 per cent in 1994, although some are higher, such as BZW at 6 and 8 per cent respectively. This is based on the increase in the net dividend. Gross dividends will be distorted as the change in the rate of tax credits on dividends works through. Another distortion comes from the prevalence of enhanced scrip dividends in 1993, with companies paying 50 per cent more in shares than in cash, which makes it harder to calculate an average number. Further, the rise in dividends is expected to be heavily weighted by increases from the utilities, and to some extent by pharmaceuticals. Among financials, banks are due to reward their shareholders' patience with bigger pay-outs. Even so dividend cover, which according to Mr Mark Brown, strategist at brokers Hoare Govett, has sunk to 1 1/2 times if utilities are excluded, will take some time to get back to average levels of 2 1/2 times. Investors will be looking for signs of whether companies want to return to that level of cover. With balance sheets strengthened by rights issues, companies have more flex-ibility to decide whether to channel cashflow towards financing recovery or to be more generous to their shareholders. With inflation at low levels, there is an argument that companies can live comfortably with slimmer dividend cover than they have wanted in the past. Another feature of the results season could be more rights issues, although the number of companies calling on shareholders for cash is likely to fall. Much work has already been done to rebuild corporate finances. But with a recovery to finance, companies may take advantage of the high level of the stock market which makes it attractive to issue shares. If such issues are combined with optimistic statements from company chairmen about the economic recovery, and profit forecasts are met, then the stock market should survive the results season without much damage.</p>

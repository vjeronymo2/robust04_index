			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ATF believes that its regulations should address all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrangements that clearly embody the substance of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``consignment sale'' practice proscribed by Congress, and not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> merely particular forms of that practice. Therefore, ATF  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes to amend its regulations to specify payment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``slotting allowances'' from an industry member to a trade buyer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a form of consignment sale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 11.32, Defective Products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current regulation specifically allows products which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are unmarketable for certain reasons to be exchanged, under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain conditions, for an equal quantity of identical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products, but is silent as to whether such products may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> returned for cash or credit. Industry Circular 81&hyph;11 states  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a return of such products for cash or credit is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precluded by section 11.32. ATF proposes changing this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation to incorporate the provisions of Industry Circular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 81&hyph;11 into the section. The revised section would also delete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> references to mutilated and missing strip stamps since they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no longer a requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 11.34, Products Which May No Longer Be Lawfully Sold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ATF proposes revising the current regulation to allow the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> return of a product if, due to a change in law or regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over which the trade buyer has no control, a particular size or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brand is no longer permitted to be sold. The addition of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> phrase ``over which the trade buyer has no control'' is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to address situations in which the trade buyer is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agency with the authority to delist a particular product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 11.35, Termination of Business  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ATF proposes revising this section to cite &sect;11.39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instead of the incorrect &sect;11.40 citation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It has been determined that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a Regulatory Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Based on information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently available, it is hereby certified under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 605(b)) that this proposed regulation, if adopted, will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis is not required. It has been suggested, however, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing the proposed interpretation of exclusion may have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the effect of ``freezing'' industry member standings where they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are. For instance, a large wholesaler might be in a better  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> position to offer indiscriminately premiums for volume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchases, and retain a competitive advantage over a small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wholesaler who could not afford to offer a similar inducement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to all customers. On the trade buyer side, a small retailer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> might be more likely to lose its freedom in purchasing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions because of a relatively minor service or piece of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment it receives from a particular supplier. Although ATF  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that the proposed regulations are required to bring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATF's policy into conformance with Federal court decisions on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FAA Act, ATF requests the comments of small businesses and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their representatives on this subject. We will review this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification in light of any pertinent comments we may receive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The collection of information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in this notice of proposed rulemaking has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3504(h)). Comments on the collection of information should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directed to the Office of Management and Budget, Attention:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Bureau of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Office of Information and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, with copies to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reports Management Officer, Information Programs Branch, Room  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3450, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 650  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Massachusetts Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20226.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The collection of information in this regulation is in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 27 CFR parts 6, 8, and 10.

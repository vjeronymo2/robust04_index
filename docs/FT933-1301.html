			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Travis Perkins pleases market with 79% rise SHARES IN Travis Perkins gained 30p to close at 275p yesterday after the timber and building materials merchant reported better than expected first-half profits, boosted by increased housebuilding. Pre-tax profits advanced 79 per cent, from a restated FRS 3 adjusted Pounds 5.18m to Pounds 9.31m, in the six months to June 30. Earnings per share increased from 3.5p to 5.9p and the interim dividend is unchanged at 2.5p. The group operates 164 building materials depots and 11 garden centres. Its profit gain was achieved on turnover 10 per cent higher at Pounds 166.8m (Pounds 151.6m) and was led by trade sales to housebuilders. In contrast the secondary market - based on the household repairs, maintenance and improvement (RMI) business - which usually accounted for 70 per cent of turnover, currently represented only about 65 per cent as home owners continued to delay projects, said Mr Tony Travis, chairman. On a like-for-like basis sales volumes grew by 4 per cent in the first half, inflation added another 2 percentage points and acquisitions accounted for the remainder of the increase. A lower cost base and a further improvement in productivity helped boost trading profits to Pounds 9.09m (Pounds 4.85m). While gross margins remained under pressure in the 'very competitive trading environment', the level of the bad debt charge declined further to 0.75 per cent of sales, having peaked at 1.5 per cent. Net interest receipts of Pounds 27,000 compared with net interest payments of Pounds 305,000 in 1992, and mainly reflected substantial cash inflow. The group ended June with net cash of more than Pounds 9m. Profits were also helped by a Pounds 195,000 (Pounds 643,000) gain on the sale of surplus properties; the group has a further 20 properties earmarked for disposal. On the outlook Mr Travis said the improvement that began in the second quarter had continued, but he cautioned that 'consumer confidence in the housing market is still fragile', and added 'although a recovery is under way it is not yet firmly established'. COMMENT Travis Perkins' performance was substantially better than the market had been expecting and highlights the management's success in taking out costs during the recession. As a result even a slight pick-up in volume can have a dramatic effect on the bottom line. As the recovery in housebuilding begins to boost confidence the RMI business should also improve. Look for pre-tax profits of about Pounds 19.5m this year, equivalent to earnings per share of 12p. This is a quality stock but yesterday's price gain means it is trading on a lofty prospective p/e of almost 23 - it looks much cheaper against a 1995 profits forecast of Pounds 33m, equivalent to 22p per share.</p>

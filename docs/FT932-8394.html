			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Cable telecoms INFORMATION super-highways are becoming the rage on both sides of the Atlantic. Their advocates argue that such fibre-optic networks would be able to provide customers not only with basic telephony and cable television services but a range of advanced services such as video libraries, high-speed databases and home shopping. US Vice-President Al Gore has picked up the idea, while a UK parliamentary select committee has launched an inquiry into the subject. Companies are also keen. Building such networks was the principal reason for this week's Dollars 2.5bn investment by telecommunications group US West in Time Warner Entertainment, a leading US cable television company. BT, the largest UK telecommunications group, is anxious to get into the business too. While there is nothing wrong with such enthusiasm, it is important that information super-highways are built because of genuine consumer demand rather than out of a desire by politicians and engineers to promote a captivating new technology. Such a technology-driven approach, dubbed plan cable, was tried by France in the 1980s and failed. But if development of such networks is to be left to the market, it is important that the market is allowed to function freely. Unfortunately, in both the US and the UK, regulatory barriers prevent the main telephone companies providing entertainment services over their networks. This undermines the economics of fibre-optic technology, since the phone companies are denied the chance to tap an important source of potential revenue which could be used to pay back their investments. There seems little reason why this restriction should not be removed in the US. Mr Gore would be well advised to put his weight behind such deregulation and abandon his current flirtation with subsidies. In the UK, the situation is more complicated because the government made a clear statement only two years ago that the ban would remain until 2001, subject to possible review in 1998. The idea was to protect fledgling cable TV companies from competition from BT until they were better established. This argument was wrong-headed. Governments have no more business to force-feed competition than they do to force-feed particular technologies. But, given that the commitment was made, there would have to be compelling reasons to overturn it. These are lacking since it is highly unlikely that BT would immediately put fibre into people's homes even if the ban was removed. However, there is a compromise which would allow BT to get moving without going back on promises to the cable industry. This would be for the government to remove the ban now for those parts of the country where no cable franchises have been awarded and to indicate that it favours lifting the ban entirely in 1998.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Labor Minister Chikara  Sakaguchi said Friday [22 April] local and central governments  should take a greater role in job training.    Job training is focus of a new medium- and long-term program  to be announced in May, he told reporters.    Up to now job training has been provided mainly by  corporations. Both the central and local governments should  review ways to take on some of the role in training workers  along with the private sector, he said.    He pointed to the need to study how to deal with job  training  at small and medium-sized companies, which account for roughly  90 percent of all companies in Japan.</p>

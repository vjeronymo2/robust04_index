			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Letter: Inspired reshaping Sir, As the president of the Board of Trade, Michael Heseltine, assures us that he is in a mood to intervene in the operation of the UK economy in a manner of his European counterparts, I trust he will not overlook Japan as a source of inspiration. He could do worse than first study Japan's success in restructuring its coal industry in which employment has fallen from 348,000 at 736 mines in 1950 to a current level of less than 5,000 at five mines. This radical restructuring has, through government subsidy, been achieved without irreparably damaging the fabric of Japan's traditional mining regions. It has also been accompanied by the targeted redeployment of resources into the development of new industries. One of the infant industries of 1950 has over the same three decades become a global colossus. The products of this industry are cars. Meurig Williams, 18 Faroe Road, London W14 0EP</p>

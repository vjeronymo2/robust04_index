The state will finance the building of homes only for poorer  people, large families, pensioners, and war and labor veterans.  Under the decree, an individual building a house for himself  does not have to produce an income declaration, may receive a  credit from a bank for at least 10 years at 20 percent interest  and buy building materials at reduced prices.</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS: PASTA AND LOVE, LA GRIGLIA STYLE  </P> <P> There's a romantic story behind La Griglia, the cozy trattoria that opened  recently in Anaheim Hills. Owner Gaetano Ianni literally met his wife, who is  the restaurant's unofficial maitresse d', on the Love Boat. The young man from  the southernmost city in Italy and the young Irishwoman fell in love while they  were working for Princess Cruise Lines.  </P> <P> Today Ianni and his wife, Donna, are in dry dock at their new restaurant, a  real charmer that has brought instant improvement to dining in the remote  foothills near the Riverside County line.  </P> <P> The cooking here is Italian to the bone, but the decor is somehow French. The  dining room is pink and pastel green, with a bay window and flowery curtains.  Fresh orchids in Art Deco swan vases grace every table, and the white  tablecloths and minimalist black designer chairs, standing on a gleaming white  tile floor, look ever so simple in contrast. It's a casual, airy room and it  suits the home-style food the restaurant serves.  </P> <P> A few feet behind the tables, chefs toil away in the open kitchen. Right in the  middle of the space is a large metal spit where Ianni and the chefs roast  rabbit, lamb and chicken. He is fond of fresh herbs, and the scents of thyme  and rosemary permeate the air. You catch a whiff of them the minute you enter,  and it becomes almost impossible to limit yourself to a meal of salad and  pasta. It's one of the most irresistible sales techniques I can think of.  </P> <P> To the left of the kitchen is a large deli case where most of the antipasti are  displayed. That's good technique, too, because it allows you to choose from  what looks good to you. One antipasto you won't see is bruschetta, normally  garlic-rubbed, grilled bread with olive oil, chopped tomatoes and fresh basil.  As in most Italian restaurants around here, authenticity is skirted with this  dish; the bread is oven toasted rather than grilled. But La Griglia serves a  delicious version with the right combination of flavors dominated by sweet,  fresh basil.  </P> <P> I wasn't as thrilled with antipasto misto, just some marinated vegetables with  the usual combination of cold cuts and cheeses. They seemed a bit tired, as if  they had been sitting already cut for a while. But there is an arresting  starter called olive all'Ascolana. It's billed as a green olive stuffed with  veal and cheese, but in reality the olive is the stuffing, with a breaded,  crumbly mixture of the meat and cheese on the outside. It's a real pub dish,  like what the English (or the Irish) call a Scotch egg, with a Kalamata olive  playing the part of the egg. Maybe they should change the name to olive alla  Scozzese, or Scotch olive.  </P> <P> There's an interesting mix of soups and salads here, too, should the antipasti  seem too indulgent. Other than a lunchtime Caesar annoyingly made with iceberg  lettuce instead of romaine, I liked them all, and found several quite  innovative.  </P> <P> The minestrone alla contadina, for example, is done with peas, green beans and  Swiss chard, all of which stand up nicely in hearty chicken broth. Pastina,  those tiny semolina pearls that Italian mothers have been feeding their babies  for centuries, are brightened by a beef broth flavored with fresh parsley and  basil. The salads are good too, especially insalata caprese, which the  restaurant makes with a tasty, finely textured mozzarella it buys from a Los  Angeles cheese maker. Ask for his scamorza or smoked mozzarella, as well. Ianni  brushes it with olive oil, a bit of pepper and some oregano. It's delightful.  </P> <P> The pastas here are rich and saucy, with the stamp of southern Italy on most of  them. The filling penne alla rustica for one: tube-shaped pasta with fresh  tomato, sausage, mushrooms, red wine and pancetta makes a complete dinner.  There is a classic penne alla puttanesca dosed with Greek olives, lots of  garlic and capers and a heady red sauce. Lasagna pecorara is a dense pie heavy  with ricotta and cream, dotted gently with a touch of ground meat. Only  vermicelli Calabrese, from Ianni's hometown of Reggio Calabria, approaches  lightness. The thin spaghetti with broccoli, olive oil and red pepper make a  palatable dish you could eat every day.  </P> <P> By now you know that it's a task to save room for the roasted meats, but since  you are constantly reminded of them by their scents they will not slip your  mind.  </P> <P> Chicken is the lightest of them, and probably also the best, served with  lightly sauteed vegetables. It is rubbed with rosemary and comes out with a  crisp skin.  </P> <P> I wasn't as happy with the lamb or pork, although both were basically sound.  The lamb looked wonderful on the spit, with a brown crust I wanted to taste.  But when the meat arrived, the crust had been cut off, and I couldn't detect  the herbs. The pork seemed a bit tough and came blanketed in a thick,  overpowering thyme sauce.  </P> <P> Avoid the gummy, storebought cheesecakes at dessert and head right into Donna  Ianni's special tiramisu, served in a wine glass. Just when I think this dish  is getting to be a cliche, someone comes up with a fresh version that I want to  eat again and again. This is an impossibly rich tiramisu, layers of  unadulterated mascarpone cheese punctuated with pungent espresso coffee and  rum-soaked ladyfingers.  </P> <P> La Griglia is high end moderate. Antipasti are $3.50 to $5.50. Paste are $8.50  to $15.50. Meats are $14.75 to $19.50.  </P> <P> LA GRIGLIA  </P> <P> 5636 E.

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Finance &amp; the Family: Witan reduces in-house bias - At a Glance Witan Investment Company, the investment trust managed by Henderson Touche Remnant, found an ingenious way of reducing the 'in-house' bias of its investment policy this week. It raised a Pounds 56.25m bond, convertible into the shares of three other Henderson trusts (Electric and General, Greenfriar and Lowland). It also sold an 8.2 per cent stake in Henderson itself. Previously in-house investments formed more than Pounds 100m of Witan's Pounds 880m portfolio. According to Micropal, the trust was 12th (out of 19) in the international general sector over the five years to July 1 and 11th out of 19 over 10 years.</p>

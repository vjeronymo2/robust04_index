			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEAVY STORMS RIP DESERTS; ROADS CUT OFF, TOWN FLOODED  </P> <P> Heavy, wind-swept thunderstorms that blocked the Los Angeles Aqueduct near  Olancha hammered California deserts for the second straight night on Wednesday,  flooding the Imperial County town of Winterhaven and cutting several major  highways across the state.  </P> <P> The storms prompted flash-flood warnings Wednesday along a 200-mile front from  the Mexican border to the Sierra Nevada.  </P> <P> Torrents of water up to two feet deep poured into homes in Winterhaven, a  Colorado River town about five miles northeast of Yuma, Ariz., and water up to  three feet deep closed Interstate 8 -- the main route east from San Diego.  </P> <P> Across the river, in Yuma, officials said much of the city was awash, although  the flooding was shallower. "Most of our roads are gone," said Yuma County  sheriff's Deputy Kevin Kretchmer. "Lots of homes have water in them and we have  poles and wires down."  </P> <P> Strong downpours were reported Wednesday night throughout eastern San Diego,  Imperial, San Bernardino and Riverside counties, especially in locations below  the eastern slope of the coastal mountain ranges -- places like Barstow, Palm  Springs, Desert Hot Springs, Indio and Thermal. Minor flooding was reported in  Palm Springs about 10 p.m. Wednesday.  </P> <P> More than two-thirds of an inch of rain fell near Santa Ysabel, in eastern San  Diego County, in less than half an hour Wednesday afternoon. Powerful  cloudbursts were also reported Wednesday night in the Mojave Desert near Baker  and Twentynine Palms, in the Owens Valley near Olancha and in Mono County near  Benton, about 30 miles north of Bishop.  </P> <P> Forecasters warned Wednesday afternoon that flooding could cut Interstate 10  near Blythe and Interstate 40 near Needles -- two of the principal  thoroughfares to the east -- during the night. California 6 and California 120  were closed by floodwaters Wednesday night south and west of Benton, and debris  blocked California 168 near Deep Springs, about 30 miles northeast of Lone  Pine.  </P> <P> To the east, more storms spawned by the same, subtropical weather system washed  across southern Nevada and western Arizona on Wednesday. Dust storms generated  by the storm system cut visibility to less than half a mile in the Phoenix  area, and Arizona 95 was reported "barely passable" because of recurrent  downpours and flash-flooding in western Nevada's Esmeralda County.  </P> <P> On Tuesday night, severe thunderstorms swept through the Las Vegas area  bringing winds gusting up to 99 m.p.h. and causing damage estimated at $14  million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expected to Continue  </P> <P> Meteorologists said the storms, generated by a large, high-pressure system that  has been pumping moist, subtropical air into the Southwest from Mexico, were  expected to continue today, with more threats of flash-flooding over large  areas of California, Arizona and Nevada.  </P> <P> Utility crews were working around the clock near Olancha in Inyo County in an  effort to remove an estimated 100,000 cubic yards of mud, rock and sand that  were dumped into a two-mile stretch of the Los Angeles Aqueduct during an  intense thunderstorm Tuesday evening.  </P> <P> Officials said the tide of flood debris from the eastern slope of the Sierra  raced down Olancha Creek and poured into the aqueduct, which carries about 75%  of Los Angeles' water supply.  </P> <P> The debris quickly filled the open, concrete-lined ditch, causing the water  flowing down the aqueduct channel at about 4,500 gallons per second to spill  over onto U.S. 395. The overflow flooded the highway with several feet of  water, cutting off all traffic on the main route between Southern California  and the resort country of the eastern Sierra for several hours.  </P> <P> The utility crews had to open several spillways that empty into Owens Lake to  drain the upstream reach of the aqueduct before the cleanup of the  31-foot-wide, 15-foot-deep channel could begin.  </P> <P> Although the aqueduct cleanup is expected to take another seven to 10 days, the  city of Los Angeles will continue to receive an adequate supply of water from  reservoirs and through purchases from the Metropolitan Water District, which  draws on other sources, including the Colorado River, the Los Angeles  Department of Water and Power said Wednesday night.  </P> <P> Dennis Williams, a DWP engineer, said that returning the aqueduct to service  could take even longer if crews removing the debris find that the concrete  lining has sustained heavy damage.  </P> <P> More thunderstorms were reported in the area Wednesday night. While little  additional debris was drifting into the channel, crews said the heavy weather  was slowing the cleanup effort.  </P></p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Problem of own making Sir, Jonathan Aitken's comments on the growth of housing benefit ('Aitken targets housing housing benefit', September 6) are an example of what John Stuart Mill called the 'inability of the unanalytic mind to recognise its own handiwork'. He quotes figures for the growth of housing benefit since 1988, that is since the 1988 Housing Act deliberately adopted a policy of forcing up rents which has led, as could have been foreseen, to the growth of housing benefit. The government picked the rod for its own back. Cuts in housing benefit without rent reductions will make more people homeless - just when the route of the homeless into permanent rehousing is being closed. This will lead to much higher expenditure on temporary housing and to a rapid growth in street begging. I fear the prime minister might find it an eyesore.

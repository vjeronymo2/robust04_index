			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Only a niche position - John Authers says the international balanced unit trust sector has a place, but you need to know where FOR BREADTH of choice, the 'international balanced' unit trust sector offers more opportunities than any other. A quick look at their specifications shows why. According to the Unit Trust Association, these funds 'have less than 80 per cent of their portfolio invested in either equities or fixed interest securities'. Geographical areas are not mentioned. Fund managers, provided they keep a balance, can invest in virtually any security, anywhere in the world, which they believe will perform well. Such funds may be the unit trust world's answers to the stately galleons of the 'international general' investment trusts, which have broadly spread international assets. Managers face a different challenge from that in most other sectors. Usually their remit is tight. They must stay in, for example, UK smaller companies, even if they think these companies will underperform. Outperformance comes from superior stock selection. In the international balanced sector, asset allocation, not stock selection, is the determining factor. Ideally, they will ride with the best-performing asset of the moment, switching when necessary, and avoiding sharp changes or speculative moves by retaining balance. The only trust with a ten-year record, Gartmore Global Income &amp; Growth, appears to have delivered this, with growth of 538.45 per cent over ten years according to Micropal (offer-to-bid, with income reinvested). The powerful UK equity market performance of the mid-1980s lies behind much of this, while more recently holdings in Far Eastern equity markets and in international bonds have kept the fund growing at a respectable, if more sedate, rate. Its asset allocation at the beginning of the year included a wide mix, with 79 per cent in equities - 19 per cent in the UK, 10 per cent in continental Europe, 5 per cent in Japan, 27 per cent in the US and 18 per cent in the Far East and in emerging markets. There is a 4 per cent UK cash holding, and Gartmore also holds European, Japanese and American bonds. This reflects the 'top-down' asset allocation which the company also uses for its segregated pension funds. This dictates being overweight in emerging markets, the UK and the US, and underweight in Japan and Europe. Whittingdale Challenger, second over five years, could hardly present a greatest contrast. It holds no equities at all, and is split between cash and bonds. Roughly 70 per cent of the fund is in gilts (UK government bonds), and the managers are in the process of reducing exposure to the dollar and moving in to French francs and bonds. It went overweight in the dollar last year, enabling it to log 22.42 per cent growth during 1992. Whittingdale has built its reputation as a gilts manager, and does not wander far into the equity markets. However, the fund, occasionally, has held equities over the last few years. Look to the third strongest performer, The Master Portfolio, managed by Capel-Cure Myers, and yet another world asset allocation view emerges. Capel-Cure has 52.5 per cent in UK equities, 15 per cent in Europe, 15 per cent in the US, and 17.5 per cent in cash and bonds. This diversity means that investors looking for a trust must also adopt a different approach. Most managers try to make these trusts the potential bedrock for a portfolio, which will handle clients' asset allocation for them. For example, the Master Portfolio is intended to mirror the portfolio which would be established for an investor who came to an investment house with Pounds 1m to invest, according to Kenneth Levy of Capel-Cure Myers. Its minimum investment, of Pounds 50,000, is in line with this ambition. Similarly, Whittingdale Challenger wants to be treated as a 'benchmark' for other funds. So there might appear to be some sense in having a heavy international balanced holding, to be complemented by smaller holdings when they seem necessary. Interest has increased in recent years among managers, with 18 funds launched in the last five years, so there is now choice. But choosing a fund is difficult because they vary so widely. Anyone willing to do some rudimentary asset allocation of their own - or with a portfolio manager prepared to do it - can switch into sector funds managed by companies with strong stock selection expertise in that area. Good asset allocators may not have access to the best stock-pickers. International balanced funds work better than funds of funds (which have only managed 39.11 per cent growth over five years) at giving customers the best of all worlds, and Gartmore's 10-year figure shows their potential strengths in the long term. But they look weak by comparison with the grand old ladies of the international general investment trust sector. Over the same five-year period when international balanced unit trusts rose 54.91 per cent, on average, Law Debenture managed 166.8 per cent, Bankers 164.46 per cent, Alliance 159.39 per cent, and Second Alliance 155.09 per cent. The average for the sector was 119.11 per cent. The erosion of investment trust discounts will have exaggerated these figures, but they suggest the old dependables might provide a stronger foundation for a portfolio. The international balanced sector has a place, but only as an add-on to investment trusts.  --------------------------------------------------          Best performing international          balanced funds over five years  --------------------------------------------------                                          % growth  -------------------------------------------------- Gartmore Global Income &amp; Growth             79.02 Whittingdale Challenger                     72.54 The Master Portfolio                        55.53 Marlborough Managed                         45.13 Royal Life International Cautionary         39.73  --------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------          Best performing international         balanced funds over three years  --------------------------------------------------                                          % growth  -------------------------------------------------- Stewart Ivory Managed Equity                43.4 Whittingdale Challenger                     36.97 Gartmore Global Income &amp; Gth                30.22 Marlborough Managed                         29.37 Mercury Portfolio                           19.89 Average                                     18.75  --------------------------------------------------</p>

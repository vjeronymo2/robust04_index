			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRE NO LONGER KEEPS THE BEAST AT BAY;  </P> <P> INDIANS: IN TIMES PAST, THE PREDATORS WITHIN A MAN WOULD BE TAMED BY SONGS. NOW  THE SONGS ARE GONE, AND ALCOHOL IS THE BEAST THAT KILLS THEM BOTH.  </P> <P> There was a moment in which he knew he could not go on. But the moment passed,  and the next, and he was running still, and he could see the dark shape of the  man running away in the swirling mist, like a motionless shadow. And he held on  to the shadow and ran beyond his pain.  </P> <P>  -- N. Scott Momaday, "House Made of Dawn"  </P> <P> Sometime last April, the spirits left the body of William Smith along Highway  33, about 25 miles north of Ojai. Smitty was a Shoshone Indian from Fort Hall,  Ida., and his body is buried there. But the spirits he collected during his  lifetime should also be put to rest, as is customary, one year after his death.  </P> <P> Born in California on April 18, 1955, to a relocated Shoshone woman from Idaho  and an absent white father, Smitty died homeless, caught like a shadow between  two worlds, Indian and white. Most Americans know and accept Indians only if  they are feather-bedecked caricatures: "redskins" and "braves" who bear  Hollywood names like Tonto and Iron Eyes and do fine as targets for John  Wayne's hundred-round six-shooter. American guilt can, to a certain extent, be  assuaged of the theft of native land and resources by painting Indians as  aboriginal oddities in the realm of natural history rather than human history.  William Smith was none of these. He was a son, a father, a brother, a friend,  and an Indian homeless in his own land.  </P> <P> In the early 1960s, Smitty's mother found her way back to the reservation and  he grew up along the banks of the Snake River. Like most Indian reservations,  Fort Hall is an island of absolute poverty in the midst of awesome beauty. Like  most boys, Smitty was interested in baseball and fishing, and like most  Indians, he dropped out of school and learned a trade.  </P> <P> In past times, the native people marked the transition from child to adult with  a solitary stint in the womb of the earth mother. There they would seek out the  sacred names for predatory animals born into each human soul and shape the  animal spirit's energy into the cycles of all life. Nowadays, when the animals  awaken, there are no prayers. There is alcohol, and while it dulls the roar, it  also sharpens the claws and teeth until a beast is born that can rip the soul  to shreds. And so it was with Smitty.  </P> <P> Crime on an Indian reservation is a federal offense, and when the drunken spree  was over, Smitty was sent to a cell in Lompoc, less than a hundred miles from  his place of birth. Smitty was a short-timer, and was soon back on the streets.  He struggled with the beast, praying hard to hear its name, and for a time his  artwork and Indian singing kept the claws at bay. I remember his clear sweet  voice beside me in the sweat lodge, a place that Smitty sought out time and  again. There used to be lots of sweats around Southern California and Smitty  went to many. But the twin threats of pseudo-shamans and their new-age  supporters drove the sweats underground. And instead of the warm caress of  steam to still the beast he carried, Smitty poured poison down his throat.  </P> <P> In and out of jail a hundred times or more, and no one in the system could find  the name to call the beast growing inside Smitty. What had been an animal of  altruistic potential was now a monster who could only be tamed by ancient songs  and ceremonies. But many of the healing songs have died with the old ones,  stuck to their tongues, frozen there by the pilgrims who are only now wanting  to hear them, and steal them, like they did the land.  </P> <P> When Smitty's body could no longer absorb the alcohol, he tricked the monster  to sleep with a heroin assault. But the beast was tired, and angry, and hungry  for the songs that Smitty could no longer sing, for the fire that kept the  beast at bay also burned Smitty's throat until his voice cracked like dry  leaves underfoot. Since the songs the beast craved are born of the wind in the  language of the birds and four-leggeds, it was in their land, high up a  twisting canyon road, that the beast left the body of William Smith. No one was  there to see it, but Indians in the Americas know too well what happened; this  horror is familiar to us all.  </P> <P> The last time we saw Smitty, the beast was searching for a place for him to  die. And finally that happened, under some chaparral. Smitty's clothes were  strung out along the hill where the beast tore away the only things left that  looked human about the body of William Smith. In the last moments of struggle,  Smitty could not have sung his death song, for by then the chords were burned  like sticks to rattle in his throat.  </P> <P> There are other beasts, thousands of them, loose in the bodies of Indians who  can be healed only with ceremonies that can no longer be learned. For the wind  creates no songs against square stones and metal. And the lyrics of the birds  and four-leggeds are closed out with walls, or caged away. But I know that  there are still some songs being tended like small warm fires, here and there,  in sweat lodges. May one of them at this time be sung for the spirits of  William Smith.  </P></p>

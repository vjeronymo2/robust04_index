			<p>BFN     [Text] The traditional rulers of the seven eastern states  have pledged their loyalty to the Federal Government. In a  statement signed by the chairman of Imo state council of indieze  [traditional rulers], Eze Onu Egoke, on behalf of the  traditional rulers of the seven eastern states, they said they  did not want secession, but a united Nigeria. The statement  also said the traditional rulers had accepted to attend the  constitutional conference which, they say, offers Nigerians the  opportunity to air their views effectively on issues that affect  them. They said they believed in democracy and the return of  Nigeria to democratic rule as early as possible. The statement  was issued following the meeting the traditional rulers had with  the chief of general staff on the current political situation in  the country.</p>

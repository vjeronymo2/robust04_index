			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK child hours under attack MEPs yesterday voted to prevent Britain from avoiding restrictions on the use of child labour that other European Union members have agreed to. Britain had sought four years' grace before introducing limits on working hours and mandatory rest periods for young children and adolescents aged 16 to 18. The British Labour party employment spokesman in the European Parliament, Steven Hughes, had compiled statistics showing that 39 work-related deaths in Britain since 1990 involved 16-19 year olds. He said there were indications the European Commission would support parliament's move to end the British opt-out for working children but not for adolescents. If the Commission supports the assembly's move, then the Council of Ministers can only override this by a unanimous vote.</p>

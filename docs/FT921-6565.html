			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Green light for UniChem and Lloyds to bid for Macarthy UNICHEM and Lloyds Chem-ists, which each bid for Macarthy last autumn, were both cleared yesterday by the competition authorities as potential owners of the retail pharmaceutical group. Macarthy's shares rose 17p to close at 316p, valuing the group at Pounds 86.3m, as the market looked for a revival of at least one of the bids which lapsed when they were referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Both UniChem, which is a retailer and wholesaler of pharmaceuticals, and Lloyds, which runs the second largest chain of pharmacies in the UK, have 21 days to decide whether to bid again. UniChem, the earlier of the two bidders, said yesterday that there was still logic in a merger between it and Macarthy 'but only on the right terms'. Its shares closed yesterday at 203p, up 2p. At that price its previous offer of 7 new shares plus 240p in cash for every 6 Macarthy shares would be worth 276.8p per Macarthy share. Since the bid was referred, UniChem has acquired E Moss, taking its retail chain to 132 shops. Mr Allen Lloyd, chairman and chief executive of Lloyds, said Lloyds would 'be re-examining the attractiveness of Macarthy in the light of what has happened in the intervening period and of other opportunities available to Lloyds'. When it lapsed, Lloyds' offer had been recommended by Macarthy and accepted by holders of 65 per cent of Macarthy's shares. Lloyds and its associates also hold 9.9 per cent of Macarthy's shares. Lloyds' shares fell 5p to 340p yesterday as analysts thought it was likely to bid again. The original terms were one new Lloyds share and 21p in cash for every Macarthy share. Last October, Lloyds said that if it did bid again it would expect to offer not less than 306p per Macarthy share, the highest value of its earlier bid. If it wanted to offer less now it would have to show there had been a material change of circumstances. Last month Macarthy reported a 15 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for its last financial year but cut its final dividend. The MMC found that neither merger would be expected to operate against the public interest. It said that the regulation of the Pounds 3.8bn a year pharmaceutical market by the Department of Health was such that normal competitive pressures did not apply. It recommended that the DH should 'pay close attention' to the effect of regulations on competition in the retail pharmacy sector, and that the Director General of Fair Trading should scrutinise any developments that might reduce competition. The report found that Macarthy's share of the retail pharmacy market, through its Savory &amp; Moore chain, was only 1.5 per cent, which added to Lloyds existing share would give the combined group 7 per cent of the market. If UniChem were to succeed with a bid it would have only 2.5 per cent of the market. Trends in the wholesale market were towards fewer players, with only two, UniChem and AAH, having national coverage. If either merger were to go ahead, Savory &amp; Moore's custom would be lost to the general wholesale market. However, the MMC thought that the loss of custom would not materially weaken competition.

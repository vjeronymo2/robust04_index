			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EIGHTH DELAY ORDERED FOR TITAN 3 BECAUSE WINDS AGAIN ARE TOO HIGH  </P> <P> The maiden launching of a Titan 3 rocket carrying British and Japanese  communications satellites was postponed Friday for another 24 hours because of  high winds aloft, the eighth delay in 22 days for the hard-luck flight.  </P> <P> The $100-million rocket, the most powerful U.S. booster ever built as a  commercial venture, had been scheduled for liftoff from launching complex 40.  But the countdown was held at the T-minus-five-minute mark because of concern  about upper-altitude winds.  </P> <P> Officials with rocket-builder Martin Marietta Astronautics Group then ordered a  24-hour delay.  </P> <P> "Today's launch has been scrubbed because of high upper winds," company  spokesman Robert Gordon said. "The launch will be rescheduled for tomorrow."  </P> <P> The goal of the long-awaited launching is the deployment of Skynet 4A, a  British military communications satellite, and JCSat 2, a $150-million  communications satellite owned by the Japan Communications Satellite Co. and  Hughes Communications Inc.  </P> <P> The debut of the Titan 3 was scheduled for Dec. 7, but a computer programming  problem forced Martin Marietta officials to order a 24-hour delay. The next six  takeoff dates were missed because of bad weather, primarily  higher-than-allowable winds aloft.  </P> <P> The first Titan 3 mission marks a milestone in the nation's post-Challenger  effort to build a commercial launching industry to compete with the European  Ariane rocket and others being marketed by China and the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan banned commercial satellites from the shuttle in  the wake of the 1986 Challenger explosion -- creating a large backlog of  cargoes with no way to get into space -- to encourage development of a  private-sector launching industry.  </P></p>

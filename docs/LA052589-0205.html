			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TEACHERS VOTE TO END STRIKE -- FRIDAY RETURN EXPECTED;  </P> <P> PACT SETTLES NINE-DAY WALKOUT  </P> <P> Striking Los Angeles teachers approved a three-year contract at the Sports  Arena this afternoon, paving the way for classrooms to return to normal after a  wrenching nine-day strike.  </P> <P> In a voice vote, a majority of roughly 12,000 teachers at the session shouted  that they favored the contract. Union Vice President Frances Haywood then  declared: "The contract has been accepted." A written ballot, considered a  formality, is to be taken later today.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Unified School District board was meeting in a  closed session and was expected to decide to accept the pact as well. If that  happens, the teachers are likely to return to classes Friday.  </P> <P> Under a compromise agreement announced early today by union and district  officials, teachers will receive a 24% pay hike over three years. Teachers in  Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest school district, currently earn  salaries ranging from $23,440 to $43,319 a year.  </P> <P> The pact also called for teachers to receive half of the pay they were docked  for refusing to hand in grade reports before the strike. The rest can be earned  back through extra work.  </P> <P> Before the ratification vote this morning, the union's board of directors had  decided to make no recommendation on the proposed settlement to the full union  membership.  </P> <P> Teacher Dale Johnson, a member of the roughly 50-member board said, "We took a  'no position' because we have faith in the ability of our membership to make  the ultimate decision. They're the ones who carried the strike. They're the  ones responsible for the decision."  </P> <P> UTLA President Wayne Johnson said directors took the neutral stance because  many teachers are "furious" about the district's refusal to restore all of the  docked pay. "The docked pay is the fly in the ointment," he said.  </P> <P> District officials had fought to dock the teachers to set a precedent in case  of future job actions.  </P> <P> The agreement also calls for the elimination of mandatory playground  supervision by elementary school teachers and the creation of  shared-decision-making councils at schools, two issues that also had divided  the union and district during the strike.  </P> <P> The bitter strike has crippled classroom instruction in the huge district, with  two-thirds of the regular teachers walking picket lines and about half of the  students also staying out of school.  </P></p>

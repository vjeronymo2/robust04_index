			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Observer: Euroslogan contest The Conservatives have been having trouble dreaming up a catchy slogan for June's elections to the European parliament. With Tory Europhobes and Europhiles at Westminster sensitive to the slightest hint that the other side has gained the upper hand, the party's image-makers have their work cut out. One front-runner was 'Making Europe Work for You'. Rather dull, admittedly; but it has the merit of being studiously neutral and fits in nicely with a similar Tory theme for the May local government elections. But there's a snag - isn't there always these days for the Tories? It turns out that Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats - unpatriotic federalists in Tory eyes - have already unveiled their slogan: 'Making Europe Work for Us'. Back to the drawing board at Central Office. Perhaps 'Making Europe Work for Them'?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] There has been a revival of the war in Angola. This  afternoon Cuito, the capital of Bie Province, was the scene of  heavy fighting between government and UNITA [National Union for  the Total Independence of Angola] forces. At the moment no one  has given an explanation for the flare-up, which has already  caused at least 20 deaths. Our correspondent Paulo Juliao  reports:    [Juliao] Fighting between government and UNITA forces has  been resumed and the city of Cuito is once again under heavy  shelling. The clashes started at about 1600. The causes of this  new flare-up between the Luanda and Savimbi forces are still  unknown.    A source here in Luanda has said that 20 people have been  killed in Cuito in the past few hours. There are no figures for  the number of wounded.    The Cuito clashes are being interpreted here as a counter-  offensive by UNITA forces following their loss of a substantial  part of the city of Dalatando, capital of Cuanza Norte Province,  occupied by the rebels for over two years now.    It will be recalled that Cuito was recently visited by UNITA  leader Jonas Savimbi. Some believe that he instructed his  forces to resume the fighting, hence today's developments.

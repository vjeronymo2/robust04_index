			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> U.S. AGAIN DELAYS NOTE AUCTION  </P> <P> The Treasury Department today postponed a $12-billion auction of two-year notes  because of congressional inaction on legislation to raise the debt limit.  </P> <P> It was the third postponement in less than a week.  </P> <P> The debt limit dropped from $3.195 trillion to $3.12 trillion last Saturday,  and a bill to raise the ceiling is caught up in negotiations between the Bush  Administration and Congress over a budget for the fiscal year that began Oct.  1.  </P> <P> Since the lower ceiling already had been reached, the Treasury last Thursday  postponed an auction of $10.75 billion in 52-week bills. And on Monday, it put  off an $18.8-billion auction of three-month and six-month bills.  </P></p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / US housebuilding accelerates The pace of new housing construction in the US picked up last month, the Commerce Department reported yesterday , writes George Graham. Housing starts rose by 5 per cent in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.115m, the department said, after falling by 9 per cent the previous month. Market economists said that the figure was somewhat stronger than had been generally expected by most analysts, but still gave indications that higher mortgage rates were taking a toll on the strength of the housing construction market. Although the July pace of housing starts was 14 per cent higher than a year earlier, it still showed a drop of 12 per cent from the peak seasonally adjusted rate of more than 1.6m starts reached last December. Construction of new single family homes remained relatively weak, and much of the strength in July came from multi-family buildings.</p>

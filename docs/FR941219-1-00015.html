Background on the Alabama Plan <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Title IV of SMCRA established an AMLR program for the purposes of reclaiming and restoring lands and water resources adversely affected by past mining. This program is funded by a reclamation fee imposed upon the production of coal. As enacted in 1977, lands and waters eligible for reclamation were those that were mined or affected by mining and abandoned or left in an inadequate reclamation status prior to August 3, 1977, and for which there was no continuing reclamation responsibility under State or Federal law. The AML Reclamation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, title VI, Subtitle A, Nov. 5, 1990, effective Oct. 1, 1991) amended SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1231  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to provide changes in the eligibility of project sites for AML expenditures. Title IV of SMCRA now provides for reclamation of certain mine sites where the mining occurred after August 3, 1977. These include interim program sites where bond forfeiture proceeds were insufficient for adequate reclamation and sites affected any time between August 4, 1977, and November 5, 1990, for which there were insufficient funds for adequate reclamation due to the insolvency of the bond surety. Title IV provides that a State with an approved AMLR plan has the responsibility and primary authority to implement the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 20, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior approved the Alabama plan. Background information on the Alabama plan, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the approval of the plan can be found in the May 20, 1982,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (47 FR 22062). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and amendments to the plan can be found at 30 CFR 901.25. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary adopted regulations at 30 CFR Part 884 that specify the content requirements of a State reclamation plan and the criteria for plan approval. The regulations provide that a State may submit to the Director proposed amendments or revisions to the approved reclamation plan. If the amendments or revisions change the scope of major policies followed by the State in the conduct of its reclamation program, the Director must follow the procedures set out in 30 CFR 884.14 in approving or disapproving an amendment or revision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Description of the Proposed Amendment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By letter dated December 5, 1994 (Administrative Record No. AL&hyph;512), Alabama submitted a proposed amendment to its plan pursuant to SMCRA. Alabama submitted the proposed amendment in response to a September 26, 1994, letter (Administrative Record No. AL&hyph;511) that OSM sent to Alabama in accordance with 30 CFR 884.15(d). The provisions of the Alabama plan proposed for revision are ``Administrative and Management Structure of the Alabama Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Program Pursuant to 30 CFR Part 884.13(d)'' to incorporate contractor bidder eligibility screening under OSM's Applicant Violator System for the reclamation of coal and noncoal sites; and ``Ranking and Selection Procedures Pursuant to 30 CFR Part 884.13(c)(2)'' to exclude certain noncoal sites from reclamation; to require submission of Form OSM&hyph;76 upon project completion; and, to remove the fourth priority for noncoal reclamation sites. The changes would be applicable to reclamation of both nonemergency and emergency AMLR projects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

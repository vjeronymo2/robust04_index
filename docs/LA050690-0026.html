			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL, EDUCATORS REMAIN AT ODDS ON LANCASTER OVERCROWDING ISSUE  </P> <P> A months-long effort aimed at forcing developers and future residents to pay  for relieving school crowding in Lancaster has failed to produce a consensus,  leaving city and school district officials trading blame for the stalemate.  </P> <P> Beset by funding and classroom shortages, the Lancaster School District wants  the city to force developers who need certain city approvals to agree to  special long-term tax assessments on their land. Most of the actual taxes would  be paid by future owners.  </P> <P> But a special committee of developer, city and school district representatives  that was formed in February to work out an agreement returned last week with  none. That left the issue in limbo. The Lancaster City Council is scheduled to  consider the matter Monday.  </P> <P> School officials returned from the group's most recent meeting last Monday and  accused the city and developers of deliberately stalling the process. "They're  playing a game with us . . . We didn't realize we were being set up," Lancaster  school board President Frank Astourian said.  </P> <P> City officials, however, blamed the school district for not providing enough  information about needed school projects and their costs. "The city wants to  cooperate, but every time we ask for information from the district, we don't  get answers," Lancaster City Atty. Dave McEwen said.  </P> <P> It is the latest in a series of flare-ups between the city and the school  district over the school funding issue.  </P> <P> A similar debate raged several months ago in the Santa Clarita Valley, and  public officials and developers throughout the state are arguing over who  should pay for schools.  </P> <P> A $47-million schools bond measure failed to win approval from Lancaster area  voters in the April election.  </P> <P> On Monday, the City Council is scheduled to discuss whether to concur with the  school district's November declaration that it is overcrowded and needs relief  from the city. Under state law, the council could then delay or halt approval  of certain development projects.  </P> <P> The more likely application of the law, though, would be to give the city and  school district leverage in forcing developers to enroll their land in  so-called Mello-Roos assessment districts. School officials said the resulting  tax revenue could help bail out the district.  </P> <P> Under state law, developers can agree to have their projects assessed and pay  some initial taxes. But it would be the ultimate owners of the developed  property, whether houses or businesses, who would pay the resulting annual tax  levy for 20 years or longer to support new schools.  </P> <P> McEwen, citing the overcrowding issue, said he believes the city could refuse  to grant zoning changes to developers unless they agree to the special taxes.  He said the overcrowding declaration proposed by the school district might  bolster the city's case.  </P> <P> But whether the City Council is inclined to do that remains a question. Mayor  Bill Pursley, a city member of the schools committee, did not return calls  Friday. Neither did the two developer representatives, former Councilman Lou  Bozigian and former City Manager Jim Gilley.  </P> <P> All three work for Mid-Valley Real Estate, a prominent Antelope Valley realty  firm. School district officials said the building industry has been pushing  instead for a speeded-up conversion to year-round schedules to increase  capacity at the district's 14 existing schools.  </P> <P> Last week, the board voted to adopt its first year-round schedules at two  district schools beginning in August. At the same meeting, interim  Superintendent Ed Goodwin recommended that two more schools start on year-round  schedules a year later.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> On Monday, the Lancaster City Council will discuss whether to concur with the  Lancaster school district's declaration that it is overcrowded with students  and needs relief from the city.  </P> <P> If the council agrees, that could give the city and school district leverage in  forcing developers to enroll their land in special tax assessment districts to  help bail out the district. The city could do that by refusing to grant crucial  zone changes to developers unless they agree to the special taxes. Whether the  council is inclined to do that remains a question.  </P></p>

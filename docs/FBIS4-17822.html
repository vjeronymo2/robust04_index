			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service in  Ukrainian at 1000 GMT on 26 April carries a four-minute report  on the recent Russian-Ukrainian talks on the Black Sea Fleet in  Sevastopol.    Correspondent Vasyl Kukurichka asks Colonel General Ivan  Bizhan, a member of the Ukrainian delegation and deputy defense  minister of Ukraine, about his impressions of the talks. Bizhan  replies: "When we arrived here with specific intentions and  specific proposals with regard to resolving this problem -- I  will tell you that Army General Vitaliy Hryhorovych Radetskyy,  the defense minister, and we, too, searched for all ways to  carry out the instructions of our presidents. I will say that  our proposals and our approaches to this matter were, well, very  flexible.    "In the first place we took account of the social situation  and social problems, the current situation, the future  situation, but unfortunately, we did not meet such an approach  from the Russian side -- I am not talking about diplomats, I am  talking about the military. From the Russian side we met  demands that only that part of the Black Sea Fleet which will go  to Russia should be based in Crimea, but Ukraine's Navy should  be based beyond the boundaries of Crimea.    ``I will tell you that this is not only...[pauses] well, I  do  not see at all how one can dictate such conditions to a state,  in which the other state would like to be based. I think that  the problem of where the navies will be based is, after all, not  Russia's problem, but Ukraine's problem. But where the part of  the Black Sea Fleet, which will go to Russia, will be based --  this is precisely its problem, and therefore it should resolve  this problem, absolutely taking account of the interests of our  state, but unfortunately, as I have already said, we did not see  such a constructive attitude from the Russian side.''</p>

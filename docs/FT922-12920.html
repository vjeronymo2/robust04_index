			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Hongkong's cheap shot There is something not quite right about the marriage contract between the Midland and the Hongkong Bank. The immediate response of the Kuwait Investment Office was to put most of its 10 per cent stake up for sale. The stake also apparently failed to find a buyer at a price some 4 per cent below the initial value of the HSBC offer. It all suggests a high degree of resistance on the part of Midland holders. The latter must be doubly disconcerted by the firmness of the HSBC share price in London dealing after the details were announced. That hardly implies an excessive price tag. It would be very different if HSBC were prepared to offer cash. But using capital in this way is always difficult for a bank. The problem with a paper offer is that acceptance involves taking a stake in an amorphous bank with no record as a combined entity. The merger will generate only small cost savings and there is no guarantee of new business. On top comes HSBC's dismal record at managing its Australian and US subsidiaries. For the institutions, there must be better ways of investing in Asian growth. As it is, Midland investors have to consider whether the immediate increase in return is worth the dilution of growth prospects that may make an exit price of 378p seem a giveaway two years down the road. Not only is Midland's loan book in relatively good shape, but its large backlog of unrelieved ACT will swell recovering earnings, allowing a high level of retention and pushing net worth substantially above the current 299p. Perhaps its share price would have been firmer yesterday if the market really expected a counterbid from the likes of Lloyds. Such a bid might make sense because of the enormous scope for cost savings. But it seems unlikely. It would have to be hostile and would almost certainly raise issues of competition policy. The bidder would also be at a disadvantage because, unlike HSBC, it would have to enter the auction without having scrutinised Midland's books. HSBC appears to have set its price just high enough to make that risk excessive. So that leaves three possibilities. First, HSBC may scrape through: Midland's management has agreed to the offer, though it did have more to lose if the negotiations disclosed last month collapsed. Second, HSBC may increase its offer. But that means even more dilution in the short term and the risk of a battle with its own sceptical shareholders. Third, it will be rebuffed. Midland's price would fall steeply in the short term, but investors prepared to stay the course would still be able to share in the recovery of a bank that is now clearly strong enough to stay independent. HSBC has a tough selling job on its hands.</p>

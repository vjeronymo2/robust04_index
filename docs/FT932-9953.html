			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / US softens its policy on Ukraine Mr Strobe Talbott, America's special ambassador to the former Soviet Union, yesterday launched a softer US policy towards Ukraine, having apparently realised that efforts to pressure Ukraine to fulfil its pledge to become non-nuclear have succeeded only in strengthening Kiev's growing pro-nuclear lobby. 'This visit demonstrates that a new, independent state and a new administration in Washington have been able to turn over a new leaf in their relations,' Mr Talbott said. The most concrete result in the shift from cool relations to meetings, which Mr Talbott described as 'cordial', was an American offer to act as a mediator between Ukraine and its sometimes hostile neighbour, Russia. 'We told our Ukrainian hosts that the US would like to try to find a way to serve as a facilitator in the complex relations that exist between Ukraine and Russia, if that is acceptable to both sides,' Mr Talbott said. These are reassuring words for Ukrainian officials, who in the past few weeks have expressed fears that the US was willing to act in concert with Russia in an attempt to pressure Kiev into surrendering its nuclear missiles. A sign of the thaw in the US-Ukrainian relationship was Mr Talbott's last-minute meeting with the Ukrainian president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, who had initially refused to meet the US envoy. A senior Ukrainian official said that the US delegation had made an important new proposal with regard to Ukrainian security. He said that he expected an American announcement on this issue in the near future. Finding an arrangement which assuages Ukraine's security concerns could have a crucial impact on the Ukrainian parliament, which is scheduled to begin debate about the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty next week. Ukraine's tentative rapprochement with the US could also help clear the way for assistance from the International Monetary Fund,. Ukrainian officials have said that if the government succeeds in its campaign to take tighter control over the central bank later this month they could receive an initial tranche of Dollars 250m by the end of July.</p>

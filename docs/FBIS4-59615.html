			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kamal al-Tawil: "Algerian Salvation Front </F> Welcomes U.S. Administration Positions"]    [Excerpts] London -- The (disbanded) Islamic Salvation  Front [FIS] yesterday welcomed recent U.S. positions on Algeria.  It described them as "characterized by objectiveness and  maturity." It vehemently criticized France, advising it to be  "neutral."    A senior FIS official told AL-HAYAH that France knows that  the FIS is "an Algerian party which won the elections twice  (municipal and legislative)." He expressed his surprise at  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe's statement describing the  FIS as "a terrorist organization" hostile to Europe and the  West. The official said: "We consider this statement  unjustifiable interference in Algerian affairs and blatant bias  toward the current regime in Algeria." He went on: "Let France  know that the change in Algeria is taking place on Algerian  territory and through the will of the people. France might  through its conspiracies manage to limit the speed of the  change, but it is impossible to stop the change. Thus we say  once again that it is better for France to be neutral if it  cannot side with the people." [passage omitted]    Commenting on the U.S. position, the FIS official said that  the Clinton administration's position "has recently been  characterized by objectiveness and maturity." He went on: "In  its dealings with the outside world, the FIS takes account of  every state's position on its conflict" with the Algerian  regime. This is why "we are interested in knowing at the time  of crisis who supports the people's freedom and who wants them  to live under suppression."    Asked about the marches staged a week ago in support of the  dialogue in Algeria, and whether the FIS took part in them, he  said: "The FIS cannot ask people to take to the street" in  support of the marches while the "operations of repression  continue to be launched against FIS supporters or those thought  to belong to it." [passage omitted]    On the development of the dialogue between the authorities  and the FIS, the official said that, "if a negotiated solution  is wanted to move a step forward, (President Major General  Liamine) Zeroual must keep his pledge and thus release the  cheikhs (FIS leaders). Negotiations must be held with them, and  no one else."</p>

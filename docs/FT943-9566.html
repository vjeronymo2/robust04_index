			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: Sale of MIM shares lifts Metall Mining to CDollars 6.1m Earnings at Metall Mining, the international mining arm of Germany's troubled Metallgesellschaft, improved sharply in the second quarter, due largely to gains from the sale of options and shares in MIM Holdings, the Australian metals group. Metallgesellschaft is keen to dispose of its 50.1 per cent stake in the Toronto-based company as part of the German group's radical restructuring. But a public share offering of Metallgesellschaft shares has been held up by restrictions involving Metall's partners in various metal projects. Metall's earnings rose to CDollars 6.1m (USDollars 4.42m), or 8 cents a share, in the second quarter, from CDollars 110,000, or zero cents, a year earlier. The sale of MIM shares and options boosted earnings by CDollars 5.6m. Revenues almost trebled to CDollars 195.8m, due mainly to the acquisition last year of Metallgesellschaft's 35 per cent stake in Norddeutsche Affinerie, a leading European copper smelter. Earnings were lifted by a higher contribution from the Ok Tedi copper-gold mine in Papua New Guinea and the Winston Lake zinc mine in Ontario.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Shake-up at Kidder may signal sale Kidder Peabody, the troubled investment banking arm of General Electric, is to move Dollars 20bn-Dollars 30bn (Pounds 12.6bn-Pounds 18.9bn) of securities to another part of the US industrial group as part of a restructuring announced yesterday. It also emerged that Kidder has held talks about selling its retail broking business in the US, an operation widely regarded as its 'crown jewel'. These moves represent the first steps taken by the new management team put into Kidder in June to sort out the firm's battered reputation on Wall Street. Kidder was rocked in April by its claim that a trader had created fictitious profits of Dollars 350m, and its trading businesses suffered losses with the downturn in bond markets during the spring. The changes could also mark the first step in a disposal of Kidder. GE has tried to sell the investment bank and is widely thought to want to either sell it or close it down. The turmoil of recent months, though, has made the bank unsellable in its current form, according to other Wall Street houses. Under what it called a 'repositioning', Kidder said it would cut its balance sheet from Dollars 80bn to Dollars 50bn-Dollars 60bn by the end of the year. This would be achieved by shifting a Dollars 6.7bn portfolio of difficult-to-value and complex mortgage-backed securities, known as collateralised mortgage obligations, to part of GE Capital, the group's financial services arm. The remaining securities to be shed by Kidder are understood to be instruments hold to hedge - or protect against a fall in value in - the CMO holdings. The shrinkage of Kidder's balance sheet will reduce any pressure on GE to put further capital into the troubled bank. Earlier this year, Dollars 400m of extra capital was injected into the firm to cover losses and bolster its balance sheet. Since then, Kidder is thought to have suffered further losses in its trading operations. Mr Dennis Dammerman, Kidder's chairman and chief executive, said the bank would remain in the mortgage-backed business, an area where it is the recognised leader on Wall Street. Kidder also said it planned to cut some 550 jobs, out of total of 5,500, as part of an effort to reduce costs by Dollars 100m a year. It added it would narrow the scope of its investment banking business and concentrate on a small number of industrial sectors. The bank refused to comment on discussions it has held with PaineWebber, another US securities house, about selling its retail broking operation. With 1,250 brokers, this is considered to be one of Kidder's most attractive businesses. The discussions, which are at an early stage, could shrink the bank's business further, leaving GE with the option of either selling or closing down the rump that remained.

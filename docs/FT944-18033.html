			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: Hanson US coal arm buys Exxon unit assets Peabody Holding Company, the US coal mining subsidiary of Hanson of the UK, is to buy the assets of Exxon Coal's Carter Mining Company for Dollars 360m in cash. The purchase will double Peabody's holdings in Wyoming's Powder River Basin, which is known for its low-sulphur, clean-burning coal. The acquisition is strategically important for Peabody, which in recent years has sought to increase its ownership of clean coal reserves while ensuring cash flow by purchasing properties that come with long-term coal supply agreements. Long-term sales of more than 255m tons are covered by coal supply agreements included in the transaction. Hanson said 90 per cent of the 25m tons of coal produced last year at Exxon's Wyoming mines was sold to electric utilities under contracts of between five and 15 years. Peabody is acquiring Exxon's Rawhide and Caballo mines, which together have 888m tons of economically recoverable reserves, and another 400m tons of unclassified reserves. Peabody, through its Powder River Coal Company subsidiary, already owns about 1.2bn tons of Wyoming coal reserves. As well as the coal reserves and long-term supply agreements, Peabody is acquiring mines and equipment with net asset value of Dollars 170m. None of the mines included in the deal are unionised. A prolonged coal strike by the United Mineworkers union hit Peabody's eastern coal operations last year. The Caballo mine lost Dollars 1.1m in the first half of this year, largely due to problems with a new excavator. Peabody plans to abandon the machine, and institute less expensive procedures at its own mines in the area. Mr Larry Metzroth, senior economist with Resource Data International, a Colorado-based coal consulting firm, said Exxon 'got a very good price' for the mines.</p>

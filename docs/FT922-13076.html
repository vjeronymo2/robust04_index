			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / World Trade News: US steel groups file dumping complaints INLAND Steel and a division of Bethlehem Steel yesterday filed unfair trade complaints against producers in the UK, Brazil, France and Germany, charging them with dumping heavily subsidised steel products on the US market. The complaints, lodged with the Commerce Department and the US International Trade Commission, assert that leaded and bismuth steel products from the four countries have been substantially subsidised and sold in the US below prices in home markets or below the cost of production. The companies claim they have suffered material injury from this and say duties to eliminate the effects would exceed 128 per cent for Brazil, 69 per cent for France, 79 per cent for Germany and 53 per cent for the UK. The US steel makers are also requesting that countervailing duties be imposed to address subsidisation of 20 per cent for France, 25 per cent for Germany and 10 per cent for the UK. Insufficient information about Brazil's subsidies made an estimate of this duty impossible, they said. The Commerce Department and ITC must determine whether the charges are justified. If the complaints are deemed reasonable, they will be investigated. The move comes after the lapse at the end of March of voluntary restraint agreements on steel imports and a failed attempt to reach a multilateral steel accord.</p>

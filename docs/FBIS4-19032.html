			<p>BFN     [Text] Strasbourg, 12 April (CNA)--President Kliridhis  outlined his views on the Cyprus issue and other international  problems during question time at the Parliamentary Assembly (PA)  of the Council of Europe, following his address to the Assembly.    The president defended the joint Cyprus-Greece defence  policy, welcomed possible European Union (EU) mediation effort  on Cyprus, and strongly argued for Cyprus' entry into the EU.    Asked by British Labour MP Tom Cox about his expectations  from the U.S., the president said he would like to see the U.S.  "consider the Cyprus issue as one of invasion and occupation and  exert their influence on Turkey to remove its troops from  Cyprus" and encourage the Turkish side to accept his  demilitarisation proposal. Replying to a question by  Portuguese communist MP Urbano Rodrigues on the joint defence  dogma and its effect on a Cyprus settlement, Kliridhis stressed  he had no intention of attacking but intended to defend the  country. He said the presence of Turkish troops created  "anxieties among Greek Cypriots" and noted he would fail in his  duty as president if he did not address these anxieties.    Asked by Polish Social Democrat MP Jerzy Jaskiernia to  outline his position on Sunday's NATO bombing of Serbian  positions, Kliridhis remarked that the credibility of the U.N.  would have suffered a severe blow if they had taken no action,  following a U.N. request to NATO for air-cover.    "Whether this would contribute to a solution, I have my  doubts", he added.    Setting out his views on the problem of F.Y.R.O.M. (Skopje),  the president advocated the elimination of references to greater  Macedonia in the Skopje Constitution, followed up by talks.    He noted he learned in the U.K. during his education there  that Macedonia is Greek "and I am too old to go back to school  to learn differently," he said.    Conservative MP Sir Keith Speed sought an explanation on the  definition of political equality and President Kliridhis noted  "we accept the notion of political equality but this does not  mean numerical equality."    Referring to Cyprus' European aspirations, the president  said  in a reply to Social Democrat (Dutch) MP, Ole Espersen he  believed Cyprus accession to EU would alleviate fears of Greek  Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots.    "The knowledge that we will enter the EU would be a great  contribution towards pacifying anxieties of both communities  Greek Cypriot fears of another Turkish advance and Turkish  Cypriot fears of being reduced to second class citizens."    Asked by a Spanish MP whether the EU should send a mediator,  the president said "we would be delighted to have a EU mediator"  but noted such a move could not occur while the U.N. Security  Council authorised the U.N. secretary-general to "use his good  offices mission to find a solution," explaining at the same time  that Cyprus does not authorise the U.N. secretary general.    Asked by a Greek MP about what the Council of Europe should  do to end the problem of Cyprus, Kliridhis advocated a two-fold  role.    The Council can play a role in various directions, first the  direction of the demilitarisation of Cyprus and secondly to put  an end to the illegal practice of colonising the occupied areas,  the president said.    Replying to another question on the issues of the 1,619  missing and the refugees in Cyprus, Kliridhis said the  humanitarian issue of the missing "affects adversely the CBM's"  and argued for its resolution.    Asked by Polish MP Jansz Szymanski about Cyprus official  reaction to the idea of PFP (Partnership for Peace), the  president favoured the Republic's participation in bodies  promoting peace and called for such a partnership to cover  former East Bloc states.    Reiterating this idea, at the press conference later Tuesday  afternoon, Kliridhis said "we are willing to participate in any  European force created for the maintenance of peace and  stability."    He expressed the belief that Europe must have a defensive  force to maintain peace, adherence to human rights and the rule  of law in Europe and elsewhere, noting also Cypriot membership  of the Western European Union would be on the cards when Cyprus  eventually joins the EU.    Asked to estimate when Cyprus would become a EU member,  Kliridhis believed access of new members would not occur until  after 1996 when certain problems within the EU are ironed out.</p>

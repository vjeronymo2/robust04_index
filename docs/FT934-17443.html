			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UN sends biggest weapons team to Iraq MR ROLF EKEUS, United Nations envoy, is due to arrive in Baghdad today on a mission to persuade Iraq to begin implementing permanent, long-term UN monitoring of its weapons programmes - agreement to which could pave the way to the lifting of sanctions. Mr Ekeus, head of the UN special commission on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, will join the biggest team of weapons inspectors to visit Iraq since the Gulf war, which yesterday began what it hopes could be a definitive investigation of Iraq's existing weapons capabilities. The combined UN effort - perhaps the most critical since inspections began immediately after the war - comes amid signs that Iraq's political and financial stamina in weathering the three-year-old sanctions may be falling, and that President Saddam Hussein is trying with greater urgency than even to win back the right to export Iraqi oil. The 50-strong UN team will spend more than a month making surprise visits to declared and undeclared weapons sites, verifying information provided by Iraq during high-level technical talks on their military programmes held this month at the UN in New York. Iraq also promised to hand over details of the complex and secret international supply network which fed its chemical, biological, ballistic and nuclear weapons programmes before the Gulf war - data Iraq has otherwise withheld. Full co-operation by Iraq during the inspection could thus go a long way to satisfying the UN that Baghdad had destroyed all weapons of mass destruction prohibited under the terms of UN ceasefire resolution 687.  Provision of procurement details is considered vital to prevent Iraq from rebuilding its military machine.  'This inspection is expected to provide us with enough information for us to close a chapter,' Ms Anne Hecht, a special commission official, said from Bahrain. Iraq last week agreed that video cameras, installed at two missile test sites as part of the long-term monitoring, could be switched on - a move Mr Ekeus made a condition of his visit to Iraq to continue the technical talks.</p>

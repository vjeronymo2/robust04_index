			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: Saudi British Bank up 10% SAUDI British Bank (SBB), the joint-venture Saudi Arabian bank, yesterday announced a rise of 10 per cent in net profits for the first half to SR128.4m (Dollars 34.2m) from SR116.6m in the same period a year earlier, AP-DJ reports from Manama. Total assets advanced 20 per cent to SR17.5bn at the end of June compared to SR14.6bn in the previous year. The latest net profit figure was struck after SR18m of provisions against possible loan losses, unchanged from the first-half provisions in 1991. SBB said it considers its provisioning 'sufficient to absorb any unforeseen contingencies'. SBB is 40 per cent owned by the British Bank of the Middle East, itself a subsidiary of the HSBC.</p>

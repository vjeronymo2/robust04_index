			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW ERA FOR TWO WARRING VEGAS PAPERS  </P> <P> Some of those Hank Greenspun afflicted during his life have a joke that they  tell even now.  </P> <P> At his funeral in July, a crowd of more than 1,200 -- gamblers, politicians,  friends and employees -- came to stand in the 100-degree desert sun. Some were  there to say farewell, the joke goes, others to make sure he was really dead.  </P> <P> But a month later, Greenspun had the last laugh. The one-time gun smuggler for  Israel who ran a newspaper here, called Joe McCarthy a homosexual in print  without any proof, sued the state's most powerful politician for conspiracy and  won, and ran a sting operation on the sheriff, showed them he wasn't quite as  dead as they thought.  </P> <P> Hours before he died, it was announced on Aug. 8, Greenspun's family had signed  a deal to keep his flagrant but failing newspaper, the Las Vegas Sun, alive for  another 50 years. The Sun would merge business operations with the town's other  paper, the profitable Las Vegas Review Journal, but maintain separate news and  editorial staffs.  </P> <P> Greenspun was gone, but his irascible or damnable, crusading or abusive,  anything-but-timid newspaper was not.  </P> <P> The agreement still must win federal exemption from antitrust laws. And many  believe, if the two papers become partners, that the furious Sun will change  its ways, in part because Hank's son, Brian, a gentler soul than his father, is  running it. Brian had to sign over $20 million worth of family stock in the  local cable franchise to make the deal and gets just 10% of the papers'  combined profit in return.  </P> <P> But even if the Sun changes, the merger will preserve a competition that once  was among the meanest, weirdest, most raucous and -- by modern standards --  most unethical newspaper wars ever seen.  </P> <P> It was a war, really, of two men, the two papers' owners, and their two  different philosophies of life.  </P> <P> One was Herman "Hank" Greenspun, the Brooklyn-born lawyer who came to Las Vegas  in 1946 fresh from the Army hoping to start a race track and who became a  celebrated crusader instead.  </P> <P> The other is Donald W. Reynolds, an Oklahoma-bred son of a poor grocery peddler  who parlayed $300 into a media company so private that few have heard of it.  Yet Donrey (for Don Reynolds) Media Group owns more daily and weekly newspapers  around the country than giant Gannett Co.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Carried Gold Cards  </P> <P> And as the owner of every dime's worth of stock, the reclusive 82-year-old  Reynolds, who moves constantly among his seven homes, is one of America's 55  billionaires.  </P> <P> Between them there was real dislike, honestly felt. In print, Greenspun usually  referred to Reynolds as "Uncle Piggy." Friends say that in private, Reynolds  described Greenspun with expletives. In public, he cleaned it up and just  called him "Vermin Greenscum."  </P> <P> Nor was either man accused of running a great newspaper. For years, reporters  here carried gold cards that entitled them to free meals and drinks at local  hotels, and the papers let their advertising departments influence news  coverage.  </P> <P> It was in 1949 that Reynolds bought the Review Journal, then just his third  newspaper, and promptly tried to break the unions. The paper that Greenspun  would buy a year later and call the Sun was actually a strike paper started by  Review Journal printers.  </P> <P> The town was small and wide open, a collection of low-slung stucco buildings, a  few casinos and, among the new residents, a mobster named Bugsy Siegel with a  vision about a city built on the fantasy of greed.  </P> <P> Reynolds ran his newspaper for the same reason -- money. He is "strictly a  bottom-line operator," said former Review Journal General Manager Bill Wright,  the top executive at the paper from 1966 to 1981.  </P> <P> In Reynolds' strategy, the editorial quality of the paper was not a primary  concern, and the Review Journal was bland at best, though he always spent money  on equipment to get the paper out fast and with a modern look.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Extraordinarily Profitable  </P> <P> Reynolds, who would come to own most of the major media in Nevada and most of  the billboards in Las Vegas, is so frugal, employees said, that he has located  Donrey's executive offices in a compound with his home so that he can partly  deduct his house as a business expense.  </P> <P> As Las Vegas grew, Wright said Reynolds used the paper as "the cow that has  financed his empire," acquiring tiny papers in places like Arkadelphia, Ark.,  and Oskaloosa, Iowa. Today, the 135,000-circulation Review Journal is as big as  almost all the other Donrey papers combined.  </P> <P> And it is extraordinarily profitable. With revenue of more than $70 million and  operating profit of more than $20 million a year, according to insiders, the  Review Journal is more successful financially than all but a couple of Las  Vegas casinos.  </P> <P> Donrey President Fred Smith denies that the company has little concern for news  quality. "We are bottom-line oriented," he said. "But we know to have a bottom  line you have to have a good product."  </P> <P> In Reynolds, Donrey also had a boss who employees say can be could be brutally  abrupt and explosive. He fired his own son from the company, and his general  managers call their annual meeting in Lake Tahoe "The Reaming in the Pines."  </P> <P> If Reynolds owned his paper to make a profit, Greenspun owned his to make  trouble.  </P> <P> "For Hank, the idea of the Sun was kicking the hell out of everyone who  deserved it," but "he didn't have the slightest concept of how a newspaper was  produced on a daily basis," said Bryn Armstrong, executive editor of the Sun  from 1963 to 1974.  </P> <P> When the race track plan that brought him to Vegas failed, he tried to start a  magazine and then went to work as a publicist for Siegel's Flamingo hotel.  After Siegel was murdered in Los Angeles, Greenspun ran into other unsavory  business partners and finally decided to buy the local strike paper from the  printers union for $1,000 down.  </P> <P> Before he could start in earnest, he was convicted of smuggling guns to Israel.  Greenspun had been recruited by the fledgling nation to run guns through Mexico  three years earlier -- in violation of American neutrality in the Middle East.  The sentence didn't include jail, however, and Greenspun returned to Las Vegas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lived Up to Promise  </P> <P> At the Review Journal, the publisher's column was called "From Where I Sit."  With characteristic delicacy, Greenspun called his "Where I Stand," slapped it  on Page 1 and promised on day one that he would never be impartial.  </P> <P> He wasn't kidding.  </P> <P> His first target was Nevada's most powerful man, Democratic Sen. Patrick  McCarran, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, boss of the state political  machine, close ally of Joe McCarthy.  </P> <P> "The old buzzard," Greenspun called him in print, leading a pack of "crawling  sniveling jackals." He warmed up from there, combing the Kefauver hearings for  links between McCarran and organized crime, writing column after column for  nearly a year.  </P> <P> Finally, McCarran retaliated by ordering the casino owners to pull their  advertising from the Sun. Twelve of the 13 casinos complied within two hours.  </P> <P> Greenspun sued the senator and the hotels for conspiracy. Town bookies gave him  only 20-to-1 odds. But after Greenspun found a casino secretary who took the  call from Washington with the boycott order, the casinos settled. And  Greenspun's career was launched.  </P> <P> Two years later, McCarran, giving a speech in Hawthorne, Nev., uttered the  words "Greenspunism must be defeated," and dropped dead.  </P> <P> By then, however, the Sun had gone on to be one of the first papers to publicly  take on Sen. Joseph McCarthy, who at one point accused Greenspun of being an  "ex-communist."  </P> <P> Greenspun wrote in a style he called "fighting the devil with his own fire."  </P> <P> It is "common talk," one Greenspun column read, "that Sen. Joe McCarthy has  often engaged in homosexual activities." Whether Greenspun had any proof was in  doubt.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Darling of Liberals  </P> <P> Eventually, a Greenspun column even predicted that McCarthy would be killed.  "Huey Long's death will be serene and peaceful compared with the demise of the  sadistic bum from Wisconsin."  </P> <P> Provoked, McCarthy persuaded the Postmaster General to try to revoke the Sun's  second-class postage rights, alleging that Greenspun was inciting violence. The  effort failed, and Greenspun had become a darling of liberals.  </P> <P> Through the years, there were other crusades -- helping elect Michael  O'Callaghan governor, fighting against atomic waste dumping and against the  Internal Revenue Service -- all of them, in Greenspun's mind, in defense of the  little guy.  </P> <P> Perhaps the best, though, was the case of Clark County Sheriff Glen Jones and  "Roxie's" motel brothel, an establishment that had operated for years without  interference from the law.  </P> <P> When Greenspun accused Jones of being a secret partner in Roxie's, the sheriff  sued for libel. And Greenspun countered with a bit of journalism not taught in  any college.  </P> <P> He hired a private investigator to pose as a Mafioso, wired him for sound and  sent him off to offer to buy Roxie's from its legally entangled owner, Roxie  Clippinger.  </P> <P> When the fake mobster inquired about "protection" for his investment, Roxie  assured him that the good sheriff was on the payroll, a claim verified in other  tape-recorded meetings as well.  </P> <P> A 12-part series in the Sun followed, and Jones dropped his libel suit.  </P> <P> As often as not, Greenspun shot from the hip, writing first, gathering his  evidence later. Sometimes he was right, and sometimes, even his own editors  said, he was not.  </P> <P> But he always believed his cause, said O'Callaghan, now a Sun executive, even  if his many enemies say he never did a thing that wasn't for his own profit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gaming Ignored  </P> <P> At every opportunity, he railed against "Uncle Piggy," and the "knuckleheads"  who ran "the little paper down the street," always in sarcastic prose. When the  Reynolds' paper criticized his business dealings, he called it "a eunuch  judging a man's lovemaking."  </P> <P> With all this crusading, and with Reynolds' penny pinching, why did Reynolds  ultimately win the war?  </P> <P> First, neither paper was a model of journalistic prestige.  </P> <P> Neither assigned reporters to cover the town's biggest industry -- gaming -- or  the gaming commission full time until an upstart third paper, the Valley Times,  began doing so in the mid-'70s.  </P> <P> Nor did they cover the mob. It was the Chicago Sun-Times that exposed how Jimmy  Hoffa used the Teamsters pension fund to bankroll the expansion of Las Vegas in  the 1950s.  </P> <P> And in a practice most newspapers would consider dishonest, for years the  advertising sections ran the entertainment coverage of the papers -- and only  those hotels that advertised got stories written about them.  </P> <P> The Review Journal ad department even had a rubber stamp, which it used to mark  "OK" those press releases that the news staff could put in the paper, usually  unchanged.  </P> <P> Review Journal General Manager David Osborne says the hotels might have "taken  advantage" and withheld advertising if the paper hadn't employed such policies.  He says the policy has since been changed, though advertising experts in town  disagree.  </P> <P> At the Sun, Brian Greenspun freely admits there is a category of story in his  paper called "puff" -- which means stories written by the hotels themselves --  "if they aren't advertisers, they have to wait in line for the space for puff."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, for a time in the 1950s and early 1960s, during Greenspun's  greatest crusades, the Sun was gaining on the Review Journal. By September,  1963, only 7,500 in circulation separated them (the Review Journal led with  35,441 copies).  </P> <P> Then, on the morning of the Nov. 20, fire destroyed the Sun building and  presses.  </P> <P> Greenspun managed to continue publishing, for months flying the paper in from  California. But delivery was sporadic, often late, and the paper was thin.  </P> <P> By the time the Sun rebuilt, the Review Journal had gained a circulation lead  of more than 20,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Helped Howard Hughes  </P> <P> Greenspun's shortcomings as a manager were another problem. The Sun payroll was  stocked with relatives, any one of whom -- including the telephone operator --  could order stories into the paper. Nor did Hank cover the city in any coherent  way. He liked to focus on one crusade at a time, didn't like the idea of  regular beats and disdained covering public meetings.  </P> <P> In his later years, many think even Greenspun's personality and reputation as a  crusader waned. Some believe that it began to tarnish when, following a  presidential pardon by John F. Kennedy on the smuggling charges, Greenspun ran  for governor in 1962 and was soundly beaten in the Republican primary.  </P> <P> Others think the decline started when he met Howard Hughes, who Greenspun  helped to buy the Desert Inn upon Hughes' arrival in Las Vegas in 1966. Over  the course of the next four years, Hughes and Greenspun would have complex  business dealings, including a $4-million loan to Greenspun at 3% interest and  the sale of Greenspun's TV station to Hughes for another $3.6 million, mostly  so Hughes could program the all-night movies he would watch.  </P> <P> By the time Hughes fled Las Vegas for Nassau in 1970, Greenspun had become  wealthy, and thereafter, some say, his role as defender of the little guy  seemed less credible.  </P> <P> Some critics, such as University of Nevada at Reno journalism Prof. Jake  Highton, contend that the Sun might have beaten the Review Journal had Hank not  diverted his money into other enterprises. His son counters that it was these  outside business that have kept the Sun alive, paying for more than $13 million  in losses since 1981.  </P> <P> In any case, it is doubtful that Greenspun's paper and personality were suited  to the battle, even if he had had the money. And by the early 1980s, the Sun  had entered a downward spiral. Its readers, Review Journal surveys showed, were  mostly older Las Vegans who were dying out. The growing number of new residents  read the Review Journal.  </P> <P> Since 1984, the Sun's share of advertising lineage has dropped to less than 30%  from 40% of the market. Daily circulation has dropped to 29% from 37%.  </P> <P> Did the Greenspuns ever consider selling the paper to preserve it? No, says  Brian Greenspun. And the two most common rumors in town, that Gannett and Times  Mirror Co. were interested in buying, are both false, the companies said.  </P> <P> But Brian Greenspun claims that as early as 1979, his family approached Donrey  about a merger. Discussions went nowhere, and in 1985, the Greenspuns tried  again, this time ready to offer part of the family cable franchise. Again,  Donrey said no.  </P> <P> The last negotiations began in the summer of 1988, after doctors found that  Hank had cancer, and by December many of the details were hammered out.  </P> <P> Donrey would get 10% of the local cable company that the Greenspuns owned and  an option to buy 35% more, if the Greenspuns could maintain majority share.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wasn't as Fun  </P> <P> Even this must have tasted bitter. Years earlier, the Greenspuns had gone to  court to keep Donrey out of the cable business on the basis that it already  owned one of the local TV stations. Since then, Donrey lost its license for the  station after the government found that it had cheated advertisers.  </P> <P> Why accept the offer now? Donrey President Smith adamantly denies that it was  because Hank would no longer be on the scene. Rather, he said, the Greenspuns  offered more.  </P> <P> Now, Don Reynolds is nearly 83, enfeebled by arthritis and no longer running  his company day to day. And Hank is gone, like others who carved Las Vegas from  the sand.  </P> <P> Corporations own most of the casinos now, making their big money on slot  machines, not high rollers. It isn't the scent of sin and gangsters that brings  the tourists to town anymore.  </P> <P> Hank Greenspun used to curse the changes, his assistant, Ruthe Deskin, said.  Running the newspaper wasn't as fun anymore. He didn't always like it that his  town was growing up.  </P></p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Germany's private steelmakers revolt Germany's private-sector steelmakers will today tell Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, that they are not prepared to make any further cuts in production capacity for flat products, in spite of the European steel crisis. The big unsubsidised German producers, including Thyssen, Krupp-Hoesch and Preussag, are up in arms over public-sector subsidies being provided to other manufacturers, allowing them to maintain unwanted production capacity. They are particularly furious about the rescue plan for the Klockner-Werke steel plant in Bremen, which was formally signed on Tuesday, involving a consortium led by the government of the city-state. The deal, which is under investigation by the European Commission for hidden public-sector subsidies, will maintain crude steel capacity of around 3m tonnes. 'This is the legalisation of a catastrophe,' one leading steel producer said yesterday. 'It means that production capacity is being subsidised in both Bremen and at Ekostahl (in east Germany), while private manufacturers have already made huge capacity cuts without any subsidies at all.' The private steel manufacturers are also angry and bitter about last December's deal negotiated by all the 12 European Union member states, allowing substantial subsidised production capacity to be maintained by the state-owned steel companies in both Italy and Spain. Today's meeting with Mr Rexrodt is intended to prepare the way for talks on February 15 with Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner in Brussels. 'We are looking for a restructuring concept from the industry, but we do not have any wild expectations that we will get one,' a German Economics Ministry spokesman said last night. 'We will be urging the private producers that something more must happen.' The response seems likely to be blunt. 'We will tell him that we have done enough,' one producer said. 'None of the unsubsidised producers are prepared to make more capacity cuts in flat products. That goes for Thyssen, Krupp-Hoesch, and Preussag, as well as British Steel and Usinor-Sacilor in France.' The European Commission's warning on Tuesday that its steel rescue plan was on the brink of collapse appears to have been aimed at pressuring the private steelmakers to offer further cuts in production or face a free-for-all which would lead to more bankruptcies. 'There is a clear message (to the private sector),' a spokesman for Mr Van Miert said yesterday, 'if you don't do it now, you can forget it.' 'The real problem is structural,' he added. 'It is overcapacity.'</p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Letter: New ways to fund Tecs needed to achieve training revolution Sir, The call by leaders of training and enterprise councils for the government to fund 'Investors in People' (IiP), to boost the expansion of in-work training, is most welcome ('Tecs pressure Shephard on training policy', April 27). However, the proposed Pounds 20m budget for IiP - around Pounds 250,000 per Tec - is hardly going to create the training revolution to which government and Tecs are committed. There should now be a fresh look at how new funds can be generated for Tecs from the employer community, as well as the exchequer. One option would be for parliament to grant Tecs the public law status enjoyed by continental chambers of commerce - and, at the same time, encourage them to join forces with their local chamber, as a number are now planning to do. The Dutch system, which involves businesses registering with their local chamber, and paying a compulsory subscription, could readily be adapted to the needs of Tecs. Where Mrs Shephard could take an important new initiative is in launching a public review of the different policy options for funding Tecs. This would take the debate away from its narrow focus on Treasury funding for Tecs - which, even if granted, can always be cut. Of course, the government should continue to fund training for young people and unemployed adults. But let Tec support for in-work training, and IiP, be funded through new statutory arrangements for employer membership of Tecs. The Pounds 20m grant from the exchequer for IiP could then become a one-off 'kick-start' to get the ball rolling. Peter Ashby, Full Employment UK, 79 Prince George Road, London N16 8DL</p>

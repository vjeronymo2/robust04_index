			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Brent appoints new chief Brent Walker yesterday announced the appointment of Mr John Leach as chief executive of the bookmaking and public house group which is laden with Pounds 1.4bn of bank debt. Mr Leach, the former finance director, takes the helm almost two years after Mr Ken Scobie resigned as chief executive. The board has since been led by Sir Keith Bright, who resigned as chairman in September. Mr Leach was appointed finance director in 1991 after the resignation of Mr Wilfred Aquilina. Formerly managing director of the LEP freight forwarding group, Mr Leach has overseen the refinancing package which allowed Brent Walker to keep control of the William Hill betting chain.</p>

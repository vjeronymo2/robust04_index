			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Barclaycard to shed 400 jobs BARCLAYCARD yesterday announced the loss of 400 jobs, representing 8 per cent of its workforce. About 350 jobs will be lost at the credit card company's headquarters in Northampton and the remaining 50 will be cut from regional offices. The job losses will be among staff in personnel, finance, marketing and administration and result from a review of the company's overheads cost structure undertaken in April. Barclaycard said it aimed to make the cuts through voluntary redundancies, but it could not rule out compulsory measures. Mr Richard Reay-Smith, chief executive, said that costs had to be reduced 'to secure the future of Barclaycard and preserve jobs in the long term'. The company said its operating costs were higher than those of some competitors. Mr Rob MacGregor of Bifu, the finance union, said: 'There can be no justification for these job losses whatsoever.' He added that 1993 looked likely to produce record-breaking profits for the company. Barclays Bank, which does not break down the accounts of its credit card arm, reported a doubling of profits from Pounds 55m to Pounds 112m in the UK banking division's central retail services business - which includes Barclaycard - for last year, amid pre-tax losses of Pounds 242m. In August this year, Barclays reported interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 335m and said that Barclaycard had improved 'substantially'.</p>

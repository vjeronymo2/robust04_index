			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / UN launches South Africa peace drive THE United Nations last night prepared to send an envoy to South Africa to try to help end violence and bring about resumption of talks on the country's constitutional future. The Security Council gave the go-ahead to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary general, to send a special representative there on a fact-finding mission. The decision was taken unanimously by the 15-member body after a two-day debate. Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress (ANC), urged the UN to take such a step as an initial measure in a speech during the debate. He said the special envoy should help the UN to decide on subsequent action which, he said, should include 'continuous monitoring' of the situation in South Africa. The UN resolution condemned 'escalating violence' in black townships, in particular the massacre of 43 people at Boipatong last month. But it sought to find some middle ground between the ANC and President FW de Klerk's government. It urged South African authorities to take immediate steps to end the violence and bring those responsible to justice, while at the same time appealing to all factions to avoid violence. The resolution underlined the importance of all parties resuming talks on a new constitution as soon as possible. The secretary general's emissary to South Africa would recommend measures to help bring an end to the country's violence and create conditions under which negotiations towards a non-racial government can be resumed. Earlier, Mr Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, renewed his government's call to the ANC to take part in talks aimed at ending political violence. He also left the way open for a future UN observer mission to South Africa. Mr Botha, in an address broadcast live on South African television, told the UN security council that the government was 'prepared to consider' a role for the international community 'in an observer or other acceptable capacity', working alongside a monitoring group which would include the ANC and Chief Mangosuthtu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). Mr Botha did not elaborate on this proposal, hinted at earlier by President de Klerk. It seemed clear that the government would raise no objection to despatch at this stage of a UN envoy on a fact-finding visit. But political observers last night doubted that the stalemate on the country's constitutional talks had yet been broken. Most observers doubt that a formal resumption of negotiations can begin before a UN envoy has reported back to the security council. Mr Botha told the UN the government had nothing to gain from the violence that led to last month's decision by the ANC to suspend talks.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A ZEV (e.g., an electric vehicle) is defined as a vehicle that complies with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable ZEV standards (40 CFR 88.101). Like CARB, EPA will determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the ZEV standard through engineering analysis rather than by testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As per section 244 of the CAA, the federal ZEV standards will be administered and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforced in accordance with applicable CARB procedures for LDVs and LDTs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with the CARB, EPA is establishing ZEV standards which require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zero emissions of the following pollutants: NMOG, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , CO, particulates, and HCHO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Emissions from non-fuel sources, like tires, seats, paint, etc., will likely exist as they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do for conventional vehicles and other CFVs.) Compliance with this requirement may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be assessed through engineering analysis. This analysis will include a description and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis of all primary or auxiliary equipment and engines which concludes that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions of the stated pollutants is possible. The engineering analysis will determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the vehicle fuel system(s) does not contain either carbon or nitrogen compounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (including air) which, when burned, form the above regulated exhaust emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such criteria will also assure that evaporative emissions will not occur. Emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing will not be necessary. When applicable, compliance testing on ZEVs may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed according to the testing requirements of CFR Part 86 and 88 (Federal Test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedure) at EPA's discretion. As with other CFVs, ZEVs will be subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards of part 88 which will be administered per CARB's procedures for LDVs and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LDTs and which are incorporated by reference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Like CARB, EPA will consider a vehicle with an auxiliary heater to be a ZEV if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the heater will not operate at ambient temperatures above 40 degrees Fahrenheit and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the heater's power and/or fuel source does not have any evaporative emissions in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use. Commenters responding to this issue supported this definition, on which EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requrested comment in the NPRM. This auxiliary heater will not be subject to the cold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CO standard (contained in 40 CFR Part 86.201&hyph;94) because the cold CO regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do not require the testing of heaters. In addition, CARB has provided a specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemption for ZEVs from the CARB cold CO requirements (whether or not the vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is equipped with an auxiliary heater); thus EPA's action on this issue is consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CARB's approach. EPA may reconsider subjecting ZEV auxiliary heaters to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal cold CO requirement through regulation if circumstances warrant in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any vehicle with additional power system(s) or auxiliary engine(s) that might produce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated pollutants (e.g., a hybrid vehicle or electric vehicle with an auxiliary power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source to run other vehicle systems) will be subject to the standards of 40 CFR Part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 88 (administered per CARB procedures, which are incorporated by reference) or future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable regulations and might not qualify as a ZEV. One respondent requested that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA establish ZEV exhaust emission standards above zero such that hybrid electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles may qualify as ZEVs. EPA has not promulgated a test procedure for such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles and therefore standards have not been established.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Administration and Enforcement Per California Practice.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As proposed in the NPRM, EPA will administer and enforce the numerical CFV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhaust emission standards in the same manner as does the state of California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 244 of the Act directs EPA to administer and enforce the numerical CFV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards in the same manner as CARB does for vehicles less than 8,500  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lbs. GVWR. Specifically, section 244 states that when the applicable CAA and CARB numerical standards are the same,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Such standards shall be administered and enforced by the Administrator (1) in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same manner and with the same flexibility as the State of California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administers and enforces corresponding standards *&blank;*&blank;*; and (2) subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same requirements, and utilizing the same interpretations and policy judgments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as are applicable in the case of such CARB standards, including, but not limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to, requirements regarding certification, production-line testing, and in-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The application of California administration and enforcement procedures does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not depend on whether EPA has replaced federal CFV standards with California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards under section 243(e). Section 246(f)(4) provides that the credit generating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards are to be administered and enforced in the same manner as the other CFV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. Therefore, EPA will administer and enforce the ULEV and ZEV standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the same manner as does CARB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

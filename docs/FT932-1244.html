			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Fenner offer talks terminated Fenner, the Hull-based industrial group, said yesterday that discussions on a possible offer for the company had been terminated. The shares fell 9p to 73p. The board said on April 29 it received 'indications of interest which might or might not lead to an offer being made for the group'. That was a response to a sharp rise in the share price, caused by City speculation that Wassall, the mini-conglomerate, might be preparing a bid. Wassall again refused to comment yesterday. The termination comes a few months after Fenner had held merger talks with another undisclosed group. The talks were aborted at a late stage, leading to Pounds 1.2m of professional fees in Fenner's interim accounts. Mr Colin Cooke, who takes over today as Fenner's non-executive chairman, said: 'We want to remain independent.' See People</p>

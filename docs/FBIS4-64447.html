			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland announced  today they will not be sending more troops to swell the Nordic  UN battalion already in Bosnia. The British UN commander in  Bosnia, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, made an appeal for  more soldiers at a meeting in Denmark yesterday of Nordic  defense ministers. The ministers also say today they would like  strong decisive leadership of the UN military operations in  Bosnia. Radio Sweden's Toni Rafidi has more:    [Rafidi] The Nordic defense ministers said better leadership  is needed in UN military operations. However, they supported  last Friday's incident when Danish tanks responded to a Bosnian  Serb artillery attack near the Nordic battalion headquarters in  Tuzla in northern Bosnia. [passage omitted]    Commander Rose indicated at a news conference on 2 May that  peace would come quicker if the UN had more soldiers, and said  he believes the earlier Gorazde disaster could have been avoided  if they had had more ground troops.    [Begin Rose recording] And by not having enough troops we  take enormous risks and sometimes we have disasters, as we saw  with Gorazde. Had we had troops in Gorazde, the 800 troops that  I'd been promised for Gorazde, then I do not believe that the  Bosnian Serb Army would have attacked that safe area. Well, we  need about another 10,000 troops in all to sustain the level of  activity that we are sustaining at the moment. [end recording]    [Rafidi] But today the defense ministers announced the  Nordic  countries will not be sending more troops. Sweden says that the  close to 1,600 soldiers already there makes it one of the  biggest per capita contributors of troops in the former  Yugoslavia.    Sweden's Defense Minister Anders Bjoerck mentioned the  United  States as one country that should contribute more and, while at  a news conference in Washington on Monday after having informal  talks with top White House officials, Swedish Prime Minister  Carl Bildt took the opportunity to criticize the U.S. policy of  not sending ground troops to Bosnia. He said he thought it was  totally natural for the Americans to take part in ground  defense, adding that he thought it could become askew [as heard]  when a leading nation only helps out while being 2,000 meters in  the air.</p>

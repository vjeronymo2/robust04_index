			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family: Gloom for 200 Tessa holders TESSA holders at Birmingham Capital Trust, a banking institution, must feel disappointed that a promise made to them has not been honoured. Those who opened tax-exempt special savings accounts when the scheme was launched in January 1991, were offered a fixed rate of 12 per cent over fiveyears by Birmingham Capital Trust. Last week, however, the bank wrote to its 200 Tessa holders to inform them that due to 'a major erosion of the capital base of the company,' the Tessa scheme will be shut down on December 31. The bank is recommending that its customers transfer their Tessas to Dudley building society, also in the West Midlands. But it only has a variable Tessa offering a much lower rate - 8.5 per cent - than that being paid by Birmingham Capital Trust. The Bank of England said it could not be responsible for banks promising high fixed rates but being unable to maintain them. 'The rates banks choose to offer are a commercial decision and we have no influence over that,' said the Bank. 'If the circumstances of a bank changes, that becomes part of general banking business and we would look at it in the context of our overall supervision.' It said that the ability to transfer Tessas meant that customers were not stuck with one institution and would not lose the tax benefit were a bank to decide to close its Tessa. However, Chris Eadie, deputy Banking Ombudsman, said he would be concerned to ensure that that the customer had been treated fairly. 'If an institution has made a promise and is still in business, it should honour its promise and arrange the same terms for its customers.' Tessas pay interest gross so long as the capital is left in the scheme for five years. The maximum investment allowed over the five year period is Pounds 9,000. Birmingham Capital Trust is waiving its usual transfer fee of Pounds 25 to those transferring either to the Dudley or any other banks or building society. The Dudley, which has about 500 Tessa-holders, said it was processing transfers within a day, so that those transferring their Tessa should not losemore than one day's interest. Although the Dudley launched its Tessa scheme on April 1 1991, those transferring will be deemed to have opened their Tessa on the date they opened the scheme at Birmingham Capital Trust. This is not the first time a bank experiencing financial difficulties has been offering a high Tessa rate. Deacon Hoare, a small licensed banking institution in Bristol, went into liquidation in June. It had offered one of the highest variable interest rates on the market to its Tessa holders. However, those who chose Birmingham Trust would have been attracted more by the stability of the Tessa rate than its size. Many banks and building societies were offering rates of 14 per cent at the beginning of last year, so the fixed rate of 12 per cent would not have looked particularly alluring. But the promise to guarantee that rate for five years would have made it a good deal.</p>

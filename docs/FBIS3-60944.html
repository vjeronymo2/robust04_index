The island is  controlled by the al-Hamami family, which has a strong grip on  this region. The commander of the military wing of the  terrorist organization in Upper Egypt is terrorist Salah  Muhammad 'Atiyah al-Hamami.    In view of the large area of the island--about 4,500  feddans--and its rough topography, in addition to it being  surrounded by the Nile, a full and comprehensive plan was  prepared after two months of monitoring and scouting the island  to determine all roads leading to and from it.    Forces of the highest level of combat training prepared for  the raid. They were joined by international antiterrorism  forces and armored and amphibious central security forces.  These groups planned to storm the island and arrest all the  individuals hiding there and using it as a headquarters to  mastermind their operations.    The forces were aided by units from the Asyut Security  Department, the Criminal Investigations Department, and various  investigations groups because of the amount of information they  have about this island.    At 0330 Wednesday, the forces stormed the island in extreme  secrecy and conducted a thorough search. The forces entered the  island according to plan and tightened their control over all  the island's inlets and outlets.    The operation resulted in the death of the terrorist group's  leader and commander of its military wing, Salah Muhammad  'Atiyah al-Hamami, who was wanted in many terrorist cases,  including Case 542/1993 of Markaz Sidfa. This case involves the  assassination of Lieutenant Colonel Mahran 'Abd-al-Rahim, head  of the State Security branch in (?Dayrut), and his son Muhammad.    This terrorist was regarded as the leader of the  organization's military wing. He supervised the training,  planning, and financing of the group's recent terrorist  operations in Asyut, Qina, and Aswan Governorates.    An automatic rifle and a large quantity of ammunition were  found in his possession.    Afterward, 57 active members of the terrorist organization  surrendered to the raiding force. It turned out that some of  them had carried out these operations, some had been in charge  of training, and others were responsible for provisions,  financial support, and conveying orders. All of them (?were)  arrested.    The forces also seized papers, (?letters), and documents  referring to operations that were being planned, including  operations against some public figures and installations. The  forces also seized other documents containing addresses of some  of the organization's fugitive members in various governorates  and providing important clues that will help the authorities  arrest other fugitive terrorists.    Citizen Mustafa Kamil Ahmad 'Uthman was wounded in the  clashes. He was hospitalized, and his current condition is  positive. A Central Security Forces conscript, Rikabi Nur 'Ali,  was killed.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, April 5 (AFP) -- The co-chairmen of the  Geneva conference trying to restore peace in the former  Yugoslavia are planning to reduce its staff as mediation bids  are being undertaken elsewhere, diplomats said here Tuesday [5  April].    Lord Owen of the European Union and Thorvald Stoltenberg of  the United Nations will axe the posts of two Swedish military  advisers. It is also unlikely that spokesman John Mills will  still be in his job after the end of the month.    Diplomats said two United Nations Protection Force  [UNPROFOR]  liaison officers may soon be recalled from Geneva. A decision  will ultimately have to be made by French General Bertrand de  Lapresle, UNPROFOR chief commander in Croatia.    "There is no political determination to do away with the  conference," said a European diplomat who declined to be  identified, but peace mediators are aware of the fact that the  Geneva talks are suspended for the time being.    Parties to the conference -- Bosnian Serbs, Croats and  Moslem  government officials -- last broke up on February 12 after no  progress was made in three days of talks on the makeup of three  ethnic states in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    But since that date negotiations held under the auspices of  the United States and Russia have ended Serb shelling of  Sarajevo, settled the territorial dispute between Bosnian Croats  and Moslems, and yielded a ceasefire accord between Croatia and  Croat Serb separatists.    Geneva conference working groups on ethnic minorities and on  economic issues have not met for some time.</p>

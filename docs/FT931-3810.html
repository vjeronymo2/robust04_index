			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Out of the Getty, into the ghetto I AM glad that Turner's Van Tromp Going About to Please His Masters is on its way from London to the Getty Museum in Malibu at a price of Pounds 11m. Britain is up to its ears in Turners. We should chuck a few more out. Other stuff, too. We can hardly move in London for paintings, pots and rocks Part of the reason for my equanimity is my admiration for the Getty Museum. I was never a snob about it. I liked it at first sight. It opened in 1974. Joan Didion called it 'rather giddily splendid . . . a commemoration of high culture so immediately productive of crowds and jammed traffic that it can . . . be approached by appointment only.' It also seemed, she said, to stir up social discomforts at levels not easily plumbed. The museum was thought to be vulgar. In 1986, at a lunch at the Getty Trust in Santa Monica, I sat next to one of the Getty scholars, a short-skirted professor of memorable loveliness who was happy to gossip. 'It was kind of weird when it first opened,' she said. 'Here you were in this supposedly Roman villa gazing into room after room of gorgeous French furniture. It seemed the tackiest idea, but not any more. Now it's OK, even studied and admired.' I tried to visit the museum the other morning, but it was closed because of a storm. Instead, I called at the Getty Trust to pick up its latest report, which covers the period to June 1990. It shows how the Getty Trust, which is run by clever people, is enlarging the kitty left by John Paul Getty. This has set me thinking about the habits of the rich. It does not surprise me that rich people collect art. It is often a form of aggression: a parading of competitive wealth and taste. Conspicuous consumption. What does surprise, now that I think about it, is the way in which the rich, at death, entomb their pots and daubs in yet more museums instead of selling them so as to endow charitable trusts whose specified mission was to help combat the wretchedness in which the planet is plunged. Take John Paul Getty. In 1982, after lengthy legal wrangling, the Getty Trust received Dollars 1.2bn in assets from Getty's estate. The money grew and grew. By March 1986, when I met the trust's president, Harold M. Williams, the value of its endowment trust had reached Dollars 2.8bn. Today it must be close to Dollars 4bn. The money is managed by experts. Its minimum investment objective is a return of inflation-plus-5-per-cent. In the years to June 1989 and June 1990, these investment returns were 14.3 and 11.6 per cent respectively. Result: the Getty is sucking up tons of art and stashing it in California. In the year to June 1990 the trust's total expenditure, including operating outlays of Dollars 81m, was Dollars 250m, of which Dollars 140m was spent on 'developing its collections.' The trust is doing its job; doing what Getty wanted. 'The mission of the J. Paul Getty Museum is to inspire and educate the public by acquiring, conserving, studying, exhibiting and interpreting works of art of the highest quality within (its) fields,' says its director, John Walsh. It aims to provide visitors with 'an experience that will make them want to return again and again.' In this it is succeeding. But what was Getty thinking of? If southern California has a surfeit of anything, it is a surfeit of fancy art. It is lousy with Old Masters. Why didn't Getty donate his money to a hands-on war on poverty? For example, the Los Angeles school system was described recently by The New York Times as a stricken giant, hobbled by financial problems and hurting from racial and ethnic strife. Many schoolchildren in Los Angeles, said the Times, are impoverished, illiterate immigrants who have never read a book or worn a pair of shoes and whose special needs are taxing the (mostly white) teaching corps. Why didn't Getty aim his billions directly at the ghettos? Rich people are still drooling over private art collections. I think that they should stop it. If they cannot, they should stipulate, at their deaths, that their pots and pans, their Turners and Cranachs, be auctioned to help finance the war on want. Compared with that, nailing up Van Tromp Going About to Please His Masters in a gallery in Malibu is both provocative and decadent.</p>

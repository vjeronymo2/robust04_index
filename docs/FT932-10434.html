			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: House prices rose 1.6 per cent in April - At a Glance House prices in the UK rose by a seasonally-adjusted 1.6 per cent in April, the largest monthly increase for more than four years, according to Halifax building society this week. This follows a 1.4 per cent rise reported by the society in March. The average price of a home at the end of April was Pounds 63,144, which was still 2.3 per cent lower than during April last year. Halifax said the figures 'could be a sign that house prices may well start to increase earlier than most analysts have anticipated'. But Nationwide, the second largest building society, found only a modest rise in prices of 0.1 per cent in April, following a 1 per cent increase in March.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Killer cottonplants target bollworms Killer cotton is the latest genetically-engineered plant to emerge from scientists in Australia. Researchers at Csiro Plant Industry, in Canberra, have developed a cotton plant which has an in-built capacity to destroy predators such as the bollworm or caterpillar. The plant carries a gene from the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis which enables it to produce a lethal toxin. The plant was developed in conjunction with the Australian company Cotton Seed Distributors and the US multinational Monsanto. Csiro Plant Industry: Australia, 62 465470.</p>

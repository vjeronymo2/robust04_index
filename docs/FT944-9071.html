			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Major moves to reassure unionists on Ulster talks Mr John Major yesterday tried to reassure unionists about the direction of talks on Northern Ireland's future, telling MPs that a joint authority to handle relations between Ulster and Dublin had been rejected by the British and Irish governments. Speaking on the eve of the first visit to parliament for more than a decade by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, the prime minister said the government would begin talks next month with both the IRA's political wing and loyalist representatives - 'so long as the ceasefire is maintained'. It is understood that the talks with Sinn Fein will probably begin first. The prime minister assured MPs that Northern Ireland remained at the top of the government's priorities, but said there was still 'a long way to go' before peace in the province was secure. He said good progress had been made in discussions with the Irish government on the joint framework document that will form the basis of talks involving Ulster's main political parties. The document would contain proposals for a locally elected Ulster assembly and suggest a framework for cross-border structures to handle north-south relations. But he emphasised that the framework document would not be 'a straitjacket'. It was not a 'London-Dublin deal' that was set to be imposed, he said. Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, expressed 'cautious optimism' on the province's future and promised that Labour would continue to support the peace process. Mr Major's remarks came as leading unionists made clear they would not be sorry to see the departure of Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, if he fails to hold on to his premiership. Mr David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist party's legal spokesman, said: 'In a sense almost anyone would be better than Albert Reynolds.' Mr Trimble added: 'As we see it Mr Reynolds . . . has been trying to get quick results. He has been trying to force the pace of peace negotiations and creating an air of crisis.' He rejected the idea that Fine Gael, the main opposition party in Dublin, is more pro-unionist than Mr Reynolds' Fianna Fail. Mr Ian Paisley Jnr, of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, said the peace process would continue whatever government was in power in Dublin. Mr David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist party, which speaks for some loyalist paramilitaries, said a change of government in the republic would not damage the peace process. He added: 'This is a bigger issue than any individual or any group of individuals.'</p>

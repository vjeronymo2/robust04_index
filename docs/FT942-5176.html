			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Finance director leaves Wellcome The surprise announcement by Wellcome that Mr John Precious, its 51-year-old finance director, is leaving 'to pursue other opportunities' has again focused market attention on the pharmaceuticals group. Wellcome's shares fell 13p to 543p on Friday after the announcement which added that Mr Precious would, 'continue with his current responsibilities for the time being while a successor is sought.' The company said his departure was amicable, but analysts noted that this was the latest in a string of management and boardroom changes and it comes at a critical time for the group whose fortunes have ebbed over the last few years. Wellcome has gone through a series of senior management changes since the company sold 270m shares at 800p in 1992. Mr John Robb, chief executive since 1990, took over the chairman's post last August from the unwell Sir Alastair Frame and was confirmed in this additional role this year. In April, the director of research and development outside the US, Mr Trevor Jones, moved 'to become an adviser to John Robb.' His job was absorbed by the US director of research development, Mr David Berry. Now the departure of Mr Precious adds another discontinuity to Wellcome's management strategy.</p>

			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Letter: Simple answers to restraining wage growth Sir, Two cheers for Professors Layard and Bean for correctly identifying, first, inflationary wage awards as the basic problem of the British economy and, second, employers as the guilty party. However, their solution is neither far-reaching nor effective enough. Quite apart from the public sector, the services sector - now the dominant sector in the economy - is notorious for no productivity improvement. In industry, cutting out profligate excess manning hardly justifies pay increases for the remainder. Nowhere in the economy does labour have much, if any, impact on productivity. Instead, R&amp;D, good design and new investment make the difference. So, nipping wage inflation in the bud is critical. A way would be for the chancellor to announce that tax rates will be indexed to wage inflation, per cent for per cent, above achieved national productivity improvement. A crude penalty, perhaps, for that small minority who achieve above-average productivity, but then drastic action is needed if I am not to see the pound worth a dollar or a D-mark in my lifetime. John Woodthorpe, 54 Eaton Place, London SW1</p>

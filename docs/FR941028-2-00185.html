			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Supplement 2: Diagnosis and Treatment of Latent TB Infection and Active TB <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> I. Diagnostic Procedures for TB Infection and Disease <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A diagnosis of TB may be considered for any patient who has a persistent cough (i.e., a cough lasting "3 weeks) or other signs or symptoms compatible with TB (e.g., bloody sputum, night sweats, weight loss, anorexia, or fever). However, the index of suspicion for TB will vary in different geographic areas and will depend on the prevalence of TB and other characteristics of the population served by the facility. The index of suspicion for TB should be very high in areas or among groups of patients in which the prevalence of TB is high (Section I.B). Persons for whom a diagnosis of TB is being considered should receive appropriate diagnostic tests, which may include PPD skin testing, chest radiography, and bacteriologic studies (e.g., sputum microscopy and culture). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. PPD Skin Testing and Anergy Testing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Application and Reading of PPD Skin Tests <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PPD skin test is the only method available for demonstrating infection with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although currently available PPD tests are &lt;100% sensitive and specific for detection of infection with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> no better diagnostic methods have yet been devised. Interpretation of PPD test results requires knowledge of the antigen used, the immunologic basis for the reaction to this antigen, the technique used to administer and read the test, and the results of epidemiologic and clinical experience with the test ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2,5,6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The PPD test, like all medical tests, is subject to variability, but many of the variations in administering and reading PPD tests can be avoided by proper training and careful attention to details. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The intracutaneous (Mantoux) administration of a measured amount of PPD-tuberculin is currently the preferred method for doing the test. One-tenth milliliter of PPD (5 TU) is injected just beneath the surface of the skin on either the volar or dorsal surface of the forearm. A discrete, pale elevation of the skin (i.e., a wheal) that is 6&hyph;10 mm in diameter should be produced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PPD test results should be read by designated, trained personnel between 48 and 72 hours after injection. Patient or HCW self-reading of PPD test results should not be accepted ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 68 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The result of the test is based on the presence or absence of an induration at the injection site. Redness or erythema should not be measured. The transverse diameter of induration should be recorded in millimeters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Interpretation of PPD Skin Tests <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a. General. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interpretation of a PPD reaction should be influenced by the purpose for which the test was given (e.g., epidemiologic versus diagnostic purposes), by the prevalence of TB infection in the population being tested, and by the consequences of false classification. Errors in classification can be minimized by establishing an appropriate definition of a positive reaction (Table S2&hyph;1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The positive-predictive value of PPD tests (i.e, the probability that a person with a positive PPD test is actually infected with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) is dependent on the prevalence of TB infection in the population being tested and the specificity of the test ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 69,70 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). In populations with a low prevalence of TB infection, the probability that a positive PPD test represents true infection with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is very low if the cut-point is set too low (i.e., the test is not adequately specific). In populations with a high prevalence of TB infection, the probability that a positive PPD test using the same cut-point represents true infection with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is much higher. To ensure that few persons infected with tubercle bacilli will be misclassified as having negative reactions and few persons not infected with tubercle bacilli will be misclassified as having positive reactions, different cut-points are used to separate positive reactions from negative reactions for different populations, depending on the risk for TB infection in that population. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A lower cut-point (i.e., 5 mm) is used for persons in the highest risk groups, which include HIV-infected persons, recent close contacts of persons with TB (e.g., in the household or in an unprotected occupational exposure similar in intensity and duration to household contact), and persons who have abnormal chest radiographs with fibrotic changes consistent with inactive TB. A higher cut-point (i.e., 10 mm) is used for persons who are not in the highest risk group but who have other risk factors (e.g., injecting-drug users known to be HIV seronegative; persons with certain medical conditions that increase the risk for progression from latent TB infection to active TB [Table S2&hyph;1]); medically underserved, low-income populations; persons born in foreign countries that have a high prevalence of TB; and residents of correctional institutions and nursing homes). An even higher cut-point (i.e., 15 mm) is used for all other persons who have none of the above risk factors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recent PPD converters are considered members of a high-risk group. A "10 mm increase in the size of the induration within a 2-year period is classified as a conversion from a negative to a positive test result for persons &lt;35 years of age. An increase of induration of "15 mm within a 2-year period is classified as a conversion for persons "35 years of age (5). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. HCWs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, HCWs should have their skin-test results interpreted according to the recommendations in this supplement and in sections 1, 2, 3, and 5 of Table S2&hyph;1. However, the prevalence of TB in the facility should be considered when choosing the appropriate cut-point for defining a positive PPD reaction. In facilities where there is essentially no risk for exposure to TB patients (i.e., minimal- or very low-risk facilities [Section II.B]), an induration "15 mm may be an appropriate cut-point for HCWs who have no other risk factors. In other facilities where TB patients receive care, the appropriate cut-point for HCWs who have no other risk factors may be "10 mm. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A recent PPD test conversion in an HCW should be defined generally as an increase of "10 mm in the size of induration within a 2-year period. For HCWs in facilities where exposure to TB is very unlikely (e.g., minimal-risk facilities), an increase of "15 mm within a 2-year period may be more appropriate for defining a recent conversion because of the lower positive-predictive value of the test in such groups. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Anergy Testing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HIV-infected persons may have suppressed reactions to PPD skin tests because of anergy, particularly if their CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts decline ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 71 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Persons with anergy will have a negative PPD test regardless of infection with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HIV-infected persons should be evaluated for anergy in conjunction with PPD testing ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 72 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Two companion antigens (e.g., Candida antigen and tetanus toxoid) should be administered in addition to PPD. Persons with "3 mm of induration to any of the skin tests (including tuberculin) are considered not anergic. Reactions of "5 mm to PPD are considered to be evidence of TB infection in HIV-infected persons regardless of the reactions to the companion antigens. If there is no reaction (i.e., &lt;3 mm induration) to any of the antigens, the person being tested is considered anergic. Determination of whether such persons are likely to be infected with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> must be based on other epidemiologic factors (e.g., the proportion of other persons with the same level of exposure who have positive PPD test results and the intensity or duration of exposure to infectious TB patients that the anergic person experienced). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Pregnancy and PPD Skin Testing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although thousands (perhaps millions) of pregnant women have been PPD skin tested since the test was devised, thus far no documented episodes of fetal harm have resulted from use of the tuberculin test ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 73 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Pregnancy should not exclude a female HCW from being skin tested as part of a contact investigation or as part of a regular skin-testing program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish carries on  page A2 of its 11 March issue a 300-word unattributed report  covering reactions to the economic aid the U.S. Government will  reportedly grant to Peru in fiscal year 1995.    The report quotes New Majority-Change 90 lawmaker Ricardo  Marcenaro Frers as saying: "Peru will receive the largest  amount in Latin America, and this shows that the United States  recognizes the Peruvian Government's efforts to move forward and  reverse, in only three years, the crisis we were experiencing."    The report then quotes PPC, Popular Christian Party,  lawmaker  Mario Ocharan as saying that the U.S. decision was made because  Peru "is putting its economy in order."    Finally, PPC lawmaker Alexander Kouri says the U.S. decision  is very positive for Peru because the country received the  largest amount in all of Latin America.    In its 12 March issue, the same newspaper carries on page A6  a 500-word editorial entitled "Support for the Peruvian  Government and People" on the same subject.    After reporting the aid announced for Peru by the U.S.  assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs,  Alexander Watson, the editorial says: "If we go by Watson's  statement, this is not only an economic benefit that will  certainly be decisive in the antinarcotics effort and the fight  against poverty, but also a clear expression of political  support for the Peruvian people and government. The visit to  Peru by the commission headed by Alexander Watson himself has  served to make the real Peruvian situation known to the higher  U.S. decisionmaking levels."    After elaborating on the results of the U.S. mission's  visit,  the editorial concludes: "Therefore, we welcome the scheduled  aid, but above all, we welcome the example of democracy and  effort by the Peruvian people, the majority of whom support  their government."</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Donna Karan suspends initial public offering DONNA KARAN, the New York fashion house, has poured cold water on the over-heated market for initial public offerings (IPOs) by suspending its plans to go public. The company, known for its upmarket collections of clothing and accessories, blamed the delay on disappointing sales and operating earnings in the third quarter, due to 'a soft retail environment'. Ms Donna Karan, the designer who founded the company in 1986, said: 'We don't feel that a public offering at this time would reflect the potential value of the company.' The decision to delay the offering comes as investors are especially keen to invest in IPOs by companies with high-profile businesses. Last week, Boston Chicken soared 143 per cent higher than its offering price of Dollars 20 a share on the issue's first day of trading on the Nasdaq over-the-counter market. The Donna Karan issue of 11m shares, or 57 per cent of the company, had been expected on the market this month. However, in an amended registration statement filed in October with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the company hinted that a snag might develop.</p>

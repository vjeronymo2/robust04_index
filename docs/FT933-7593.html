			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Israel strikes back after eight die in Lebanon bomb attacks ISRAELI warplanes blasted targets in eastern Lebanon yesterday in retaliation for a bomb attack by pro-Iranian guerrillas which killed at least seven Israeli soldiers and wounded two others. It was the deadliest guerrilla attack in five years. Last night, a second bomb attack on Israeli forces in the security zone in southern Lebanon killed another soldier and wounded two. The US said it deplored the attack on the Israelis and described it as a 'calculated attempt by extremists to derail the (Arab-Israeli) peace process'. Hundreds of Lebanese civilians, fearing another Israeli shelling offensive, fled their homes in the south, and the Lebanese army was placed on maximum alert. Eight Israeli aircraft struck at positions of the Islamic fundamentalist Hizbollah (Party of God) militia in Lebanon's Bekaa valley killing two Hizbollah fighters. The Israeli raid came hours after Hizbollah claimed responsibility for the dawn attack on Israeli soldiers in the zone Israel occupies in southern Lebanon. Observers in Jerusalem said the Israeli strike on targets 3km west of the Syrian border was also meant as a warning to Damascus, which has thousands of troops stationed in the Bekaa valley, and which Israel blames for allowing the Hizbollah attack. Israeli and Lebanese security officials issued conflicting accounts on the attack. Israel said seven soldiers had been killed and two wounded from the Golani brigade in a single bomb blast. The Lebanese version claimed that Hizbollah had exploded three bombs and fired machine guns against an Israeli foot patrol near the village of Shinin, killing eight soldiers and wounding four. The Hizbollah raid was the most deadly since a 1988 suicide car bomb attack and it brought Israeli casualties in the zone this year to at least 16 dead and 29 wounded. Yesterday's resurgence of violence came less than three weeks after a US-arranged ceasefire ended a devastating seven-day Israeli air and artillery bombardment of villages in southern Lebanon. For years, Syria has allowed Hizbollah to mount attacks on Israeli forces inside Lebanon. Israel had hoped that the ceasefire agreement laid the ground for improved relations with Damascus and progress in peace talks. Israel writhes under Hizbollah goad, Page 3</p>

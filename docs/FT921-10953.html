			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Arts: London piano recitals - St John's, Smith Square/Queen Elizabeth Hall Just under a year ago at the Wigmore Hall, French-Canadian pianist Marc-Andre Hamelin was Sophie Rolland's partner in Beethoven's cello sonatas. He offered a striking complement to her gentler muse: confident, big-boned, imaginative playing, perfectly apt for the young Beethoven, and yet always solicitous for the cello's softer voice. On Friday, his dazzling solo recital in St. John's showed just how remarkable a pianist he is. It consisted merely (merely]) of Schumanns's Carnaval and the concerto for Piano Sola by Charles-Valentin Alkan, that obscure, obsessive composer-pianist whose works took virtuoso writing almost beyond any performer's limits. Just getting through the Concerto with a decent proportion of the right notes, especially in public, is a trial so fearsome that hardly anyone tries. Even with a seasoned Alkan champion like Ronald Smith, the sense of reckless courage in the face of ever-present danger is a constant feature of the performance. Hamelin's account of Carnaval was rich and satisfying, marked out with bold contrasts, interpretatively on sound, cultivated lines. His fingers were more than equal to all Schumann's demands (his 'Paganini' was uncommonly brilliant), and he also scaled down beautifully for the small, intimate confessions. There were many things to admire and enjoy; but one was never actually surprised, never made to hear something in a radically unexpected way. Hamelin isn't that kind of virtuoso - and so much the better, some would say. With Alkan's Concerto, he demonstrated what kind of virtuoso he is. It is a rare kind indeed: viz the kind for whom Alkan's mounting, torrential challenges are so completely, even comfortably in hand that he can give his full attention to expounding the music - lyrically, structurally, intellectually - as if it were just as serious as Beethoven. Nothing sounded 'grotesque': rampant and slightly mad, yes, but cogent enough to justify its monstrous scale. After such a performance, a swift collapse in the green-room would be natural. In fact Hamelin plunged at once, superbly, into encores of the same order, like Godowsky's left-hand version of Chopin's E-flat minor Etude. Extraordinary. ***** On Sunday the Queen Elizabeth Hall played host to Janina Fialkowska, latest participant in the South Bank's current 'International Piano Series'. Her programme choice was, among other things, a reminder that she has been an Artur Rubinstein competition prizewinner in the early 1970s, and that Rubinstein was her mentor in the last years of his life. A large selection of Chopin in the second half and the choice of Szymanowski's Variations on a Polish Folk Theme in the first - both of these were composers to whom Rubinstein showed particular devotion - also served to highlight her special strengths: crystalline articulation, absolute control in layering textures and varying colours, formidable strength and speed in bravura passages. Fialkowska is such a superbly gifted and musicianly pianist that her intermittent failure to hold a listener's attention seemed puzzling. At this stage in her career, strangely fluctuating tendencies can be sensed in musical commitment - sometimes her performances come across as fully 'personal', mature and richly absorbed, sometimes merely facile (and, odder still, sometimes unpredictably both). The opener, Liszt's piano transcription of his BACH Prelude and Fugue for organ, was flashy, not interesting. In the Mozart A minor Sonata, K310, the approach was miniaturised, brittle, detached from any sparking engagement with Classical discourse - and this in spite of numerous slow-movement felicities. A piece called In the Stillness of the Seventh Autumn by the pianist's fellow Canadian Brian Cherney proved a dispiriting combination of eclectic modernism and droopy sensitivity. My overall impression was of a remarkable technician who has yet to come fully into her own as an artist. Throughout the recital there were tantalising hints of how exciting it will be when she does.</p>

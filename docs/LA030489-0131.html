			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: MEDICAL;  </P> <P> IRVINE'S T/I PHARMACEUTICALS USES 'LETHAL WEAPON II' TO BOOST TI-SCREEN  </P> <P> When moviegoers see "Lethal Weapon II" this summer, they may notice in one  pool-side scene that actor Mel Gibson is rubbing a handful of TI-Screen on a  woman's back.  </P> <P> And if they are especially attentive, they may notice bottles of TI-Screen  strategically dispersed among 150 extras milling about the pool and three beach  bags advertising the product of T/I Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Irvine.  </P> <P> But in case viewers missed the message, drugstores around the country will be  running special promotions and the sun screen will sport a new slogan: "TI  Screen, the lethal weapon against the sun."  </P> <P> T/I Pharmaceuticals' marketing drive is being led by Lou Silverman, formerly  vice president of major sales accounts for Revlon's fragrances and cosmetics.  Silverman took over the job of general manager of T/I Pharmaceuticals in  February of 1988.  </P> <P> Silverman declined to say how much he is paying Warner Bros. for the screen  exposure. The movie promotion is only a portion of a $1.2-million advertising  and marketing campaign that T/I Pharmaceuticals has budgeted for 1989. That  compares to just $314,000 budgeted last year.  </P> <P> The company also has begun to advertise its over-the-counter cold sore medicine  and skin moisturizer on radio stations and cable television stations.  </P> <P> Previously the company built a following for its products by relying almost  entirely upon the recommendations of dermatologists.  </P> <P> High-profile marketing already has proven its worth, Silverman said, noting  that the company's sales more than doubled to $3.4 million in 1988 from $1.5  million the year before. "This year we are shooting for $6 million," he said.  </P></p>

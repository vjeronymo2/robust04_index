			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, March 17 (CTK) -- The coalition Christian  Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) insists  on the necessity of conducting government coalition talks on  fundamental political laws, including election legislation,  KDU-CSL Chairman Josef Lux said on Thursday [17 March].    He stressed that along with Jan Kalvoda, chairman of the  coalition Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) and head of the  government's Legislative Office, he had asked that the  government not discuss election bills before they were dealt  with by the coalition. In spite of this the government dealt  with the bills because Lux and Kalvoda had been outvoted by 11  votes in the "coalition thirteen."    The coalition thirteen consists of the parliament chairman  and deputy chairmen, the chairmen of the four coalition parties  -- the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the ODA, the KDU-CSL and  the Christian Democratic Party (KDS) -- and the chairmen of the  parliamentary deputies' groups.    In February the government approved a bill on parliamentary  elections. It has met with sharp criticism particularly from  the ODA. It said that the ODS, the strongest government party,  wanted to create one-mandate constituencies to ensure its  dominance of the Senate, which is to be elected under the law.    Lux said today his party did not feel bound by the  government's decision. He also dismissed the opinion of KDS  Chairman Vaclav Benda, who said on Tuesday [15 March] that he  would vote in favor of bad election bills rather than to be left  without the laws. The failure to pass legislation would be a  tragedy, he added.    "We are not voting for bad laws," Lux said today.    He also addressed the security situation in the Czech  Republic, saying that the development of society, including  economic transformation, was threatened by rising crime.    The KDU-CSL resolutely rejects the re-introduction of the  death penalty, Lux stressed. He said the solution rested in  prevention, in which a great role is played by a well  functioning family. The party will seek ways of curbing the  publicity given to brutality in the media, he added.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Isakov under the "Parliamentary Diary" </F> rubric: "Chubays' Grandmother (Article One)"]    [Text]  <H5>  Devoted to the End of Voucher Privatization... </H5>   A restaurant was opened on the Arbat recently. There was the  usual noise, fuss, shouting, and free refreshments. Frenzied  crowds of people -- it was nearly a job for the mounted police.  A launch!    Privatization itself, unlike an individual restaurant,  entered our lives quietly and unnoticed. Three versions of the  law on privatization were submitted for discussion. The Supreme  Soviet voted for the draft submitted by S. Krasavchenko -- the  then chairman of the committee for economic reform and  ownership. And that was that -- no noise, no shouting, no  applause. The big launches started later.    Was a blueprint for privatization in Russia formulated? I  can testify that it was, I have kept in my archives a copy that  was prepared for the press. But Krasavchenko himself persuaded  the leadership that wide public discussion would be detrimental  to the cause, so the "blueprint" never saw the light of day.  Russia was pushed into privatization without a rudder, without  sails, and blindfold.    The privatization check -- the voucher -- made an even more  modest and unassuming entrance. When parliament was on its  summer recess, the president brought forth the voucher by means  of a presidential edict, dispatching to oblivion the Law "On  Nominal Privatization Accounts and Investments." The deputies,  on returning from their vacations, naturally made a fuss, got  indignant, and instigated an investigation. But it was too late  -- the voucher privatization machinery had already begun to turn.    This summer the voucher celebrates its birthday -- it is two  years old. Its time is up, voucher privatization is ending, and  monetary privatization is beginning. A good time to sum up the  results and survey the prospects.  <H5>  Fond Memories of the Central Statistical Administration... </H5>   The results, in brief, are as follows. By 1 January 1994  88,577 enterprises had been privatized, or 56.5 percent of  autonomous enterprises. The proportion of privatized  enterprises in ferrous metallurgy and chemical and petrochemical  industry was in excess of 50 percent, in light industry -- 98  percent, and in trade -- 70 percent. Of 71 million people  employed in the national economy, 29.5 million work in the  nonstate sector of the economy.    Mr. Chubays and some of his supporters draw a hasty  conclusion from these figures: Privatization has taken place in  Russia and its results are irreversible. And the formal  quantitative results appear to confirm this. But the situation  is by no means so unequivocal, if you look at how ownership  "works" and what proportion of the volume of industrial  production it accounts for (Table 1).    As you can see, the real results of privatization are by no  means as impressive as "Messrs. Privatizers" would wish. State  enterprises still hold a leading position in the economy, and it  is they that produce the vast bulk of gross domestic product.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

Here are some  results of economic activity in the countryside by enterprises  under various forms of ownership -- Table 2.    [In the following table, column A represents "Number of  farms  (thousands)"; column B: "Gross output (billion rubles)"; column  C: "Proportion of production (percentage)"; and column D:  "Proportion of land occupied"]    Table 2.

The only sphere in which privatization can be considered  more  or less to have worked is the trade sphere and retailing. You  can see from Table 3 what the proportion of various forms of  trade looks like in terms of the total volume of trade turnover.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 3.

As you can see, neither fundamental changes in ownership  relations nor major structural changes have yet taken place.  Nor have new incentives to labor emerged. That is why it has  not been possible to halt the decline in production, which in  recent months has become disastrous. But what does  privatization look like in its "social aspect"? What are its  social parameters? Have the "architects of privatization"  achieved the much-publicized goals enshrined in the  privatization program?  <H5>  "Formation of a Class of Private Property-Owners..." </H5>   The formation of a class of private property-owners was seen  in the privatization program as the main priority objective of  reform and the guarantee of its irreversibility. According to  the country's chief "privatizer," A. Chubays, this task has been  successfully resolved. "Nobody has disputed, not even our  fiercest opponents, that there are at least 40 million private  property-owners in Russia today," he stated proudly at the  parliamentary hearings in the State Duma. Is it really 40  million? Nearly one-third of the country's population and  almost half its working citizens! Where do these figures come  from?    On closer examination it emerges that all those who have  taken part in the process of conversion to share ownership are  classed as "private property-owners." If you have just one  share you are a property-owner, a capitalist, an active  supporter and champion of "market reforms."    But that, if you will forgive me, is...cheating. The facts  about the rapidly progressing property stratification of Russian  society are well known. According to State Committee for  Statistics reports, in January 1994 52.6 million people were  living below the minimum survival wage level and 26.3 million  below the poverty line. (Incidentally, the government  immediately "drew its conclusions": The State Committee for  Statistics was given a dressing down, and by February the  unseemly picture had changed strikingly: The number of those  below the minimum survival wage level had fallen to 24.8 million  and those below the poverty line to 8.5 million. What success  -- and for virtually no effort!)    The country's internal market is shrinking rapidly.  Television sets, refrigerators, and sophisticated household  equipment is gathering dust in the warehouses -- not because  people do not want to buy them. They would be happy to buy  them! They would snap them up! But they do not have the money.  Consumption of basic food products has fallen below all limits,  by virtually 50 percent.    The Chubays privatization has not created, but destroyed,  the  middle class -- the natural bulwark of democracy, ownership, the  rule-of-law state, and the centrist policy. Cultural figures  (with the exception of those who serve the regime), doctors,  teachers, scientists, and workers and employees at state  enterprises have sunk into an abyss of poverty. The Chubays  privatization has not created, but destroyed, the  property-owner. The role of the rank-and-file share-owner in  the management of production is even less today than at the  earlier "socialist" enterprise. The distance between the worker  and the product of his labor has not lessened, but increased.    The famous "grandmother" for whom Chubays shows such  touching  concern has certainly discovered what a "dividend" is -- the  word is on everyone's lips. What a great discovery! Why should  she have known, before, that 3 percent annual interest on her  savings bank investment was a dividend too? But how was she, an  old woman, supposed to guess, when she went off to vote for  Yeltsin and Chubays, that they would deceive her so shamelessly?    The predatory privatization casts an entirely different  light  on the universally slandered and despised Soviet "bureaucrat" --  the manager. Why? As a rule he knew his job, he was afraid of  the boss, and he strove to forge a career. He received a wage  "no higher than the wage of a skilled worker" and he took bribes  in moderation (if at all). Nowadays they know nothing, do  nothing, and are afraid of nobody. I say nothing about bribes.    Despite the dense curtain of lies and "market" demagoguery,  it is gradually getting through to people that they were robbed.  True, under socialism they were not called "shareholders," but  everyone, if you think about it, was a share-owner in that giant  enterprise called the "Soviet Union." Everyone received a  guaranteed wage of not less than the minimum established by the  state, he was guaranteed free education, health care, travel  passes, benefits.... Just imagine for a moment that back then,  "under stagnation," an entire enterprise's wages had been held  back for three or four months.    Unfortunately, our giant enterprise was not always well  managed and it lost out in the worldwide competition with the  West in the sphere of technical progress. Infringements of  human rights occurred in it, and the press trumpeted them across  the world. Today it is silent. Because you could hardly find  another country where human rights are infringed the way they  are in Russia today.    In order to rectify matters, it was certainly not necessary  to knock the "enterprise" down to its foundations and leave it  to the four winds. First of all the traitors and sons of  bitches wrecked the Soviet Union, contrary to the people's will,  and now, like squirrels, they are dragging into their holes  whatever remains from the wreckage. The onlookers who were  present were rewarded with a piece of paper -- the voucher -- so  as to maintain as long as possible the illusion that in the  shareout of the stolen goods, you too will receive some little  crumb.</p>

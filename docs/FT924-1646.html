			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / OECD Economic Outlook: Budget deficits show significant worsening THE world's developed nations should take sterner measures to put their finances in order and reduce budget deficits, the OECD says. Across the 24 nations in the organisation, a 'significant deterioration' in budget balances has taken place in the past three years, with net state borrowing having increased by about three percentage points of the region's gross domestic product. Some nations have markedly increased spending on social security and other transfer payments while growth in tax income has been held back because of weak economic activity. The OECD says individual governments should do more to classify how much they spend on 'productive' investment that boosts economic activity - covering areas such as training and infrastructure projects  - as opposed to social security payments which do little more than place a floor under people's living standards. According to OECD calculations, high government borrowing would not be a worry if the cash gained in this way was spent largely on investment. However this year only four OECD nations - Japan, Denmark, Finland and Austria - are expected to spend more on investment than the total they raise through borrowing on capital markets. In the other countries, a significant fraction of borrowing is channelled instead to transfers, such as social security and interest payments. To cut borrowing, governments should examine whether to charge consumers for using some state services, while greater competition in services should also be introduced to increase efficiency. In the longer term, governments will have to investigate the funding implications of the rise in numbers of elderly people, which is likely to push up social security bills.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marianne Curphey: "Big Rise in Couriers Arrested </F> in France"]    [Text] Although arrests in Thailand attract the most  publicity, the big increase in Britons jailed overseas is in  France, according to the charity Prisoners Abroad.    The number of people held in France has risen by almost 70  per cent since the start of the year, and the London-based  charity now has 300 cases on its books out of a worldwide total  of 1,000.    Almost 90 per cent of arrests in France are for  drugs-related  offences and traffickers face up to 30 years in jail under still  sentencing laws introduced two months ago.    In Thailand last week, another name was added to the list of  British detainees when Jonathan Wheeler, 34, from Hythe, Kent,  was arrested on heroin smuggling charges at Bangkok Airport.    The Foreign Office says 3,000 Britons are locked up or have  been charged across the world. Prisoners Abroad estimates that  five years ago the number was about 1,500.    A spokesman said: "The death penalty exists for smuggling  drugs in Mauritius, China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand, and  India has a mandatory sentence of ten years in jail for  possessing anything over half a gram of hashish."    However, France has seen such a big increase that a case  worker, Duro Olowu, has been appointed solely to handle cases  there for the charity. He said: "Under the new sentencing  guidelines, anyone caught with 25 kilos of cannabis could be  jailed for six years. Drug conviction also earns prisoners a  fine of up to &pound;120,000 which can add two years to a  sentence  if unpaid.    "The relaxation of border controls had been followed by more  vigilance among the police, so that people are not just being  caught at the borders but throughout the country.    "Arrests in Thailand always grab the headlines because those  found guilty face the death sentence and the prisons are  perceived as hell-holes. But even in Europe prison is not an  enviable experience. Families are split up and women are left in  Britain trying to bring up children on income support."    Mr Olowu added: "Many of the people caught are small-time  couriers with little real idea of what they are doing."</p>

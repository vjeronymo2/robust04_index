			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Barclays to offer new form of finance BARCLAYS Bank will this week become the first European bank to provide companies with a new form of short-term financing which will allow them to build up their order books without borrowing directly from banks. Barclays has set up a special-purpose company which buys from companies the right to money owed on export sales (known as trade receivables) then sells short-dated debt (commercial paper) backed by the receivables in the international market. The structure provides an alternative to overdrafts, bank facilities or credit lines and may help ease the credit squeeze suffered by mid-sized companies. 'As we come out of recession, companies will need money quickly and the banks will not be able to provide it,' said Mr James France, director of Barclays de Zoete Wedd's asset securitisation group. The Barclays vehicle is poised to issue Dollars 80m-Dollars 90m-worth (Pounds 51m-Pounds 58m) of US commercial paper, backed by Dollars 100m of trade receivables. But subsequent offerings under the Dollars 1bn multi-currency programme will be made in the Euro-commercial paper market, where regulations allow. In the US, the asset-backed commercial paper market, mostly involving trade receivables, has grown swiftly to around Dollars 50bn. This type of repackaging of assets, known as securitisation, has already been widely applied to mortgages, car and personal loans, which are sold to investors as asset-backed bonds. Several US banks, including Citibank, have also become active in Europe, mainly securitising US companies' European receivables. The business is typically dominated by clearing banks, which already lend to the companies involved, and so are well positioned to offer alternative financing. Most of the companies involved in the Barclays' structure so far are from Sweden, Italy and Spain. The crisis in the Swedish banking industry has forced Swedish companies to seek alternative sources of funds.</p>

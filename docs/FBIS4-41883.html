			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at  1245 GMT on 27 June carries a telephone interview with Andrey  Olegov, a spokesman for Russian President Boris Yeltsin's  security service, by Mayak Panorama correspondent Anatoliy  Fedorov. In the interview, Olegov denies a report published  over the weekend in MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS under the title of  "Assassination Attempt on Yeltsin?" The article says that on 24  June, about an hour before Yeltsin visited the Greek parliament  building in Athens, an unidentified device exploded in the  parliament building. The security service's information on the  incident indicates that an explosive device was planted near the  entrance to the European parliament building a few hours before  the EU summit meeting on Corfu. The blast caused panic but no  injuries. President Yeltsin was attending the Corfu meeting at  the time. The Athens police links this terrorist act with the  Revolutionary Popular Struggle organization, which is opposed to  Greek membership of the EU.    Olegov says: "In this case, then, this should primarily be  regarded as a demonstrative act aimed against the Greek  membership of the European Union, not as an act directed  specifically against the representatives of heads of state who  were present at the European summit on Corfu." He adds that the  Greek police are investigating the incident.</p>

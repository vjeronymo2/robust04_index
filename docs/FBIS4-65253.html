			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Guy Daloze report: "Europe: A Dehaene-Lubbers Duel"] </F>   [Text] If they do not have the same silhouette, then at  least they have the same political profile. They are both  Christian Democrats, both leaders of a small European Union [EU]  country, and both prime ministers (incoming or outgoing). In  addition, the European Community headhunters are definitely at a  loss six weeks before the Corfu Summit on 24 and 25 June, at  which the name of the future president of the European  Commission will be made known -- unless it is postponed.  <H5>  British Veto </H5>   So, will it be the Belgian Dehaene, or the Netherlander  Lubbers? A reliable source has confirmed that the current  occupant of 16 rue de la Loi [Belgian prime minister's office]  is unofficially the official candidate of the French and  Germans, who saluted his performance as a "problem solver"  during the Belgian presidency and see in him a voluntarist and  pragmatic leader for the Europe of tomorrow.    However, there is a hitch: Jean-Luc Dehaene, the European  federalist, is running up against the British veto. In London  they would be happy with a last-ditch stand in favor of Sir Leon  Brittan, but there is already discreet support for Mr. Lubbers  in political circles. Mr. Major greatly appreciated the support  of the Netherlands outgoing prime minister, who is just as much  a free- trader as himself, during the Netherlands EU presidency  and the Maastricht Treaty.  <H5>  Back To The Belgians </H5>   The confrontation will also have to take national  contingencies into account. Ruud Lubbers has officially  announced his candidacy and is available since the Netherlands  voters showed him the way out two weeks ago. As for Jean-Luc  Dehaene, he is keeping his silence and having a lot more trouble  freeing himself from his national career. He knows that he is  the federalizing cement in the government. Moreover, his  partners, while they do not want to deprive him of a prestigious  European career, are nevertheless drawing his attention --  especially in the CVP [Flemish People's Party] and the PS  [Flemish Socialist Party] -- to the risks which his departure  could have for the coalition, if not the country. As a result,  Wilfried Martens said his former chief of staff's accession to  the EU presidency would be "problematic."    The same discreet contacts between social christians and  socialists these past few weeks have, however, confirmed the  common desire to go all the way to the end of the legislative  session (end of 1995), and to do so even if the "affairs"  [reference to scandals involving the SP] lead to new  disturbances. So, the search is on for a successor to Jean-Luc  Dehaene -- just in case. Melchior Wathelet does not much feel  like being used as a repair patch and Leo Delcroix cannot  command unanimity within his own party. Under these conditions,  Herman van Rompuy [budget minister] would be the most likely  candidate, although he does not generate a great deal of  enthusiasm.    Account must also be taken of Karel van Miert, the current  Belgian European commissioner, who was promised the post during  the government negotiations in 1992 and who will have to find a  landing place: either in the Belgian Government (as deputy  prime minister) or at the head of an SP which is ready to  recover!</p>

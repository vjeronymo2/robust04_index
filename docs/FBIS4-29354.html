			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Yohei Kono, president of the  main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said Thursday  [16 June] his party will submit a no-confidence motion against  the minority government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata.    "We will submit a no-confidence motion against Hata  cabinet,"  Kono told a faction meeting of LDP legislators at a Tokyo  restaurant. "We cannot overlook this cabinet in silence."    Kono, however, did not state clearly when the LDP will take  the action.    As the current Diet session approaches its final day June  29,  the LDP is intensifying its pressure on the government,  threatening to submit a no-confidence motion at any time.    If the LDP secures enough support from the second largest  opposition party, the Social Democratic Party, the passage of  the motion is likely, resulting in either the cabinet's  resignation en masse or Hata's calling a general election.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: MGN buy-out team hold talks THE MANAGEMENT buy-out team at Mirror Group Newspapers met yesterday for the second time in a week, at the offices of Electra, the venture capital group, to plan a Pounds 250m refinancing as part of its bid to take over the group. MGN, which includes the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror, and Scottish Daily Record, used to be one of the most soundly-financed parts of the empire of the late Mr Robert Maxwell. However, after his death in November it emerged that he had siphoned Pounds 97m out of MGN's bank accounts, and several hundred million pounds from its pension fund, leaving some of its staff and pensioners facing poverty. Sir Peter Parker, chairman of the buy-out group, which also includes Mr Richard Stott, editor of the Daily Mirror, told a meeting of the team and Mirror editorial heads of department on March 25 that the team was proposing a Pounds 250m refinancing 'right now'. The team has written to the Mirror's board to tell them this. However, one participant in yesterday's meeting emphasised that the Pounds 250m figure should be regarded as provisional. The administrators, Arthur Andersen, who now control MGN, have not yet released financial figures for 1991 or projections of future trading. The administrators have appointed Rothschilds, the merchant bank, to handle the sale. The two obstacles delaying a sale are understood to be the poor advertising climate, which could allow a higher price to be achieved by waiting, and the uncertainty about the group's legal responsibility to make good the deficit in its pension funds. Sir Peter made clear to the meeting that 'I would not touch this buy-out unless we could honour the pension commitment'. Electra, which has received several expressions of interest from potential investors, has identified a potential chief executive currently working in the media industry. However, it declined to give the person's name to the meeting.</p>

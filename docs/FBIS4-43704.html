			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "MF/RP": "World Trade Organization Headquarters: </F> Switzerland Submits Improved Proposal to GATT"]    [Text] Geneva, 15 Jun (ATS) -- On Wednesday afternoon [15  June], Switzerland submitted a second, improved proposal to GATT  with a view to attracting the headquarters of the future World  Trade Organization (WTO) to Geneva. The Swiss Confederation  intends to donate the William Rappart Center building, which  houses GATT, to the WTO. This offer by Switzerland comes right  after the official application by Bonn.    Bern is also ready to build a new conference hall with a  seating capacity of 725 and to make it available at no cost to  the WTO. This hall, with a parking lot for 400 cars, would be  built near the WTO. Moreover, Geneva has agreed to provide the  40 less-favored nations with rooms to house their permanent  mission. As far as the value of the real property is concerned,  the Swiss proposals amount to about 100 million Swiss francs.    If they wish to do so, countries could have three permanent  missions in Switzerland: one to the United Nations, one to the  WTO, and one to the Disarmament Conference. Today, the various  countries only have one mission to the United Nations.  <H5>  Privileges </H5>   The WTO and its officials will benefit from privileges and  immunities enjoyed by the intergovernmental organizations in  Switzerland. High-ranking officials will have diplomatic  status. Bern also intends to take various measures to improve  the standard of living of those employed by all the  international organizations in Switzerland.    Geneva and Bonn are the only two cities that have applied to  accommodate the headquarters of the WTO. The two bids will be  submitted to the preparatory committee of the WTO on 23 and 24  June. The final choice should be made by 15 July.  <H5>  Confidence </H5>   Diplomatic sources say Switzerland is in a good position.  The  offers made by Germany and Switzerland are almost equivalent.  However, the fact that the GATT secretariat has been established  in Geneva since it was created pleads in favor of Geneva. The  need for close cooperation between the WTO and other  international organizations in Geneva is another asset.    William Rossier, Swiss ambassador to GATT, thinks  Switzerland  has made an "excellent offer." In his opinion, Switzerland has  shown that it wants to remain an attractive and important  international center.</p>

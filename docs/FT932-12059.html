			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Britain keeps its counsel after HK talks BRITAIN will wait until after the third round of Anglo-Chinese talks on Hong Kong political development in three weeks' time to make its assessment of whether negotiations are worth pursuing. The second round of talks in Beijing yesterday failed to produce any proposals from China about the colony's 1994 and 1995 electoral arrangements. Britain had hoped that Beijing would have moved on from talking about 'principles' to the substance of the negotiation. Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, last October put forward a seven-point plan for broadening democratic participation in the colony's future elections. China condemned the governor for deviating from past agreements and understandings and refused to talk to the UK for six months. It was understood last night that in the second round of talks, which started on Wednesday and finished yesterday, the Chinese side was still talking about 'principles' as they had done in talks a week ago. British officials believe after the third round, which will be held on May 21-23, they will be in a better position to assess whether China is sincere in its desire to reach agreement, or if it is just simply filibustering. In the event of the latter, they believe that they have the necessary time to present Mr Patten's proposals to the Legislative Council, the colony's law-making body, and have the requisite laws on the statute books by the end of July. Some observers suspect that Beijing is using the Sino-British talks to slow moves towards arrangements for elections in 1994 and 1995. They also believe that China may seek to use the Beijing discussions to marginalise Mr Patten. The joint statement gave no indication of progress or otherwise in discussions conducted in a secluded diplomatic compound in the western suburbs of the Chinese capital. Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador to Beijing and head of its negotiating team, said he hoped the talks would help to 'restore co-operation' between the two sides. These remarks mirrored those of his counterpart, vice foreign minister Mr Jiang Enzhu who said the talks were aimed at restoring good working relations.</p>

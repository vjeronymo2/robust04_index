			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Counting on results On one level the recent weakness of UK equities looks like a straightforward correction after the rise during August, a pattern repeated in New York, Paris and Frankfurt. All the more so since the weakest sectors - such as food retailing and food manufacturing - are precisely those which showed the strongest gains on the upswing. Whether the correction develops into a more sustained period of doubt turns crucially on corporate earnings living up to expectations. So far the evidence has been mixed. Interim figures from cyclical bellwethers such as BTR must be counted as disappointing. Yet companies ranging from Cadbury Schweppes to Blue Circle turned in creditable results, albeit accompanied by a rights issue in the case of the former. Equally importantly for a market transfixed by yield, surprisingly generous dividend increases from Glaxo and Prudential suggest the outlook for dividend growth may be brighter than hitherto expected in some sectors. In the case of pharmaceuticals and life assurance, additional yield might be seen as compensation for an increasingly uncertain trading outlook. In other sectors, the flurry of companies offering enhanced scrip dividends - effectively small rights issues in place of cash dividends - is a reminder that companies have overpaid during recession. While inflation is weak and bond yields are falling these concerns are unlikely to matter much. Where the market will find inspiration for another great leap forward is less clear.</p>

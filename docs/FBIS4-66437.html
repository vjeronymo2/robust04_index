			<p>Oil   <F P=102>   94FE0326D Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 23 Dec 93 p  10 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0326D </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] Kiire Base (Kiire Borough, Ibusuki Gun, Kagoshima  Prefecture), a base of Nippon Oil Co., Ltd. (Nippon Oil), in the  Nippon Oil Group, has constructed a co-generator that burns slop  oil recovered from ballast water and has begun operation of it.  The base had previously been using slop oil for a boiler to heat  tanks and pipes. This was the first time for the Nippon Oil  Group to use slop oil as a fuel for power generation. In  November 1993, the in-house power generator (1,000 kW),  completed with an investment of &yen;370 million, began  operation, and there has been no problem thus far.    Slop oil is recovered from sludge from ballast water and the  bottom of oil tanks. At Kiire Base, 20,000 kl per year of  treated slop oil are recovered. The oil had previously been used  as boiler fuel to heat tanks and pipes for crude oil from South  Asia that had solidified at a low temperature as a result of its  high wax content.    Now the slop oil is going to be used as fuel for in-house  power generation. The newly installed co-generator is designed  to supply one-third of the base's power requirement and is said  to consume 2,000 kl of slop oil. This generator will reduce the  base's power consumption by approximately &yen;2 per kWh from  the cost of purchased power (contracted as a large consumer).  The application of slop oil for power generation is expected to  be used by other oil refineries within the Nippon Oil Group.</p>

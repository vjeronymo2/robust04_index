			<p>BFN     [Text] A soldier in an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] outpost  in Jabalyah in the Gaza Strip was wounded in the knee by  terrorists' gunfire. The soldier was taken to Soroka Hospital  in Beersheba. Our Army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe  reports that several shots were fired at the outpost. The  soldiers returned fire, and then another salvo was fired at  them. A man suffering gunshot wounds was later found in  al-Shifa' Hospital in Gaza, and the possibility that he may have  been one of the terrorists is currently being examined.    A truck driver was wounded by gunfire near the settlement of  Morag in the Qatif Bloc. He was moderately wounded and was  evacuated to Soroka Hospital in Beersheba.</p>

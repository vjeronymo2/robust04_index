			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin by Zafer Kiraz </F> in the TRT studio -- live]    [Text] [Kiraz] As the foreign minister of a NATO member  country what information have you received? What is the latest  situation in NATO regarding Gorazde and Bosnia-Herzegovina in  general?    [Cetin] As you know the attacks on Gorazde, which started at  the end of March, have gradually been directed against the  civilian population despite all efforts to put an end to the  aggression. I had a conversation with the Bosnian prime  minister today. It is reported that over 90 persons, including  women and children, were killed yesterday. Naturally, we, from  the very beginning have taken initiatives involving the UN  Security Council and NATO. At long last a few days ago, on 18  April, the UN secretary general asked NATO to take action just  as had been the case regarding Sarajevo. The meetings have been  continuing for the last few days. The issue was again discussed  in Brussels today. We have stressed that the issue of Gorazde  is most urgent. There are four other safe havens. We thought  that it was necessary to take an urgent decision concerning  Gorazde. A decision was reached earlier this evening regarding  Gorazde. Since all other efforts have not yielded any results  it has become necessary to use force again. NATO is issuing an  ultimatum regarding Gorazde. The ultimatum is as follows: All  Serbian weapons and forces in Gorazde will be withdrawn three  kilometers by tomorrow midnight, that is 0300 Turkish time. All  humanitarian aid will be able to get into the city easily. The  NATO decision also specified the borders of the Gorazde safe  haven in order to avoid any confusion. The region within a 20  kilometer radius from the city center is defined as the Gorazde  safe haven. Heavy weapons or military positions within this 20  kilometer radius will be bombed through coordination to be  established between the UN forces and NATO.    This is an important decision. A new phase has thus been  reached in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I hope that the Serbian  officials will realize the significance of this decision and  abide by the ultimatum without further fighting. Otherwise, it  is clear that NATO will carry out its ultimatum because Gorazde  is being attacked for the last 20-25 days. These attacks are  directed against the civilian population. This decision also  constitutes a significant step towards a lasting peace and  cooperation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The UN secretary general was informed of this decision and  it  has gone into effect. If any shots are fired within the next 24  hours in specified regions, if the civilian population of  Gorazde is attacked within that 20 kilometer radius then NATO  forces will be to take action. The NATO meeting will resume in  a while to discuss the remaining four safe havens. A decision  will be reached regarding those regions as well. In other  words, there is a draft decision concerning Zepa, Srebrenica,  Tuzla and Bihac. NATO will discuss that tonight and a decision  is expected.    [Kiraz] We sincerely share your wishes. As you have  stressed, NATO is, this time, decided and serious about its  ultimatum. There is no turning back.    [Cetin] This decision was adopted unanimously by 16  countries. Among them the United States, Turkey and other  significant European countries. This is a serious decision.  NATO has a credibility and a prestige to maintain. NATO has  been patient. The United Nations has been patient. The Serbs  have tried to gain time. They used this time not to attain  peace but to move into Gorazde and to increase their attacks  against the civilian population. I hope that they will abide by  this serious and significant NATO decision without any further  bloodshed.    [Kiraz] We also share you hope.</p>

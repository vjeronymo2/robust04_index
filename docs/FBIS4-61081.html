			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mikhail Shmakov, chairman of the Federation </F> of Independent Trade Unions of Russia, by Fedor Yemchenko; date  and place not given: "Few Reasons for Rejoicing" -- first four  paragraphs are introduction]    [Text] The chairman of the Federation of Independent Trade  Unions of Russia [FITUR] was one of the first to put his  signature to the Treaty on Social Accord. It is worth noting  that this took place on the eve of the holiday celebrating  solidarity among working people.    The desire to change anything and everything in Russia has  not bypassed May Day either. It has been proposed that  henceforth it be called the spring labor holiday. A fine name,  of course, but it does not reflect this date's historical  essence. As we know, it was not at all because joy filled their  hearts that workers first went out onto the streets on 1 May.    Russian working people have few reasons for rejoicing now  either. That is why columns of working people will be carrying  not flowers and leaders' portraits (as was the case at  festivities full of false cheer) but demands and appeals to  those who are in power.    On the eve of May Day TRUD's correspondent met with FITUR  Chairman Mikhail Shmakov.    [Yemchenko] Mikhail Viktorovich, you recently had a meeting  with the Russian president. What prompted it and what problems  were discussed?    [Shmakov] The meeting was organized at our request. The  economic situation in the country has hit labor collectives  above all. The mutual nonpayments crisis has led to a situation  whereby wages have stopped being paid to people. Social tension  in certain regions and sectors of production has reached a  critical level. Therefore the need for a direct meeting with the  head of state arose, in order to make him aware of the full  seriousness of the current situation and to state the Russian  trade unions' position without using intermediaries.    [Yemchenko] What were the results of the talk with the  president?    [Shmakov] I must observe that Boris Nikolayevich reacted to  our alarm with understanding. After our meeting, incidentally,  he instructed Premier V. Chernomyrdin to solve the problems  which caused the closure of Zil's [I.A. Likhachev Motor Vehicle  Plant] main production line.    Questions of reorganizing industrial enterprises were  discussed at the meeting with Yeltsin. Putting it simply,  problems of bankruptcy. Our position is quite definite here:  Every enterprise must be dealt with individually. Plants and  factories are often being shut down not because there is no  demand for their output but because consumers do not have the  means to purchase it. It became apparent from the conversation  with the president that some of his advisers are urging the head  of state and government to take what is in their view an easier  path: Declaring bankrupt all enterprises which are currently  unable to settle accounts for raw materials, energy, and  transportation services. But this measure will lead to one-half  of the country's being unemployed.    We favor the preservation of jobs. If an enterprise's output  is really not needed by the market, that means its specialty  must be changed and new technology introduced. People must have  work and earn their keep. Unfortunately, there are many people  in power structures who support Russia's conversion into a  retail market for foreign firms' output. They say that this way  the population's demand can be satisfied faster and more  reliably. But we will thereby be encouraging the development of  foreign producers, and we will ruin our own industry once and  for all.    I want to stress that our position and the president's  views on this question completely coincide.    [Yemchenko] It is understandable that society's social  problems were the main topic of your conversation. I would like  to know whether you broached the equally pressing question of  the attack on trade union rights? As far as I know it is being  actively discussed at virtually all trade union aktiv meetings  and conferences. I am referring to the transfer of control of  the social insurance fund to the state, attempts to lay hands on  trade union property, and the draft of the new Labor Code which  gives trade union organizations a secondary role.    [Shmakov] As regards the draft Labor Code prepared by Labor  Ministry staffers, I can say one thing: We will never agree to  such a version of this document. It is not only that it demeans  the role of trade unions in regulating labor relations. This  draft envisages a sharp reduction in social guarantees for hired  workers. In other words, it is a rejection of all that has been  won by working people in the long years of struggle. I think  that even now, during discussion of the draft, its authors can  see that this version of it will not be accepted.    As regards control of the social insurance fund. The State  Duma is now preparing a law on social insurance. We have made  our own proposals in it. This fund should operate under trade  union control, otherwise it is unimaginable.    [Yemchenko] I suppose that at the meeting with the president  you could not have failed to broach a document such as the  Treaty on Social Accord.    [Shmakov] Quite so. Say what you like, today the problem of  civic peace in society worries the country's entire population  equally. The squabbles on the political Olympus are costing our  state too dear. That is why the trade unions support the  president's idea of achieving a solution based on civic accord  to the crisis which has engulfed all aspects of our life.    In deciding to join the Treaty on Social Accord, the FITUR  General Council Executive Committee noted that the draft  document includes the main critical comments made by sector  trade unions, regional trade union associations, and primary  trade union organizations. Thus, for example, it recognizes the  importance of implementing the general agreement for 1994  between all-Russia trade union associations, all-Russia  employers' associations, and the government, as well as sector  wages agreements. In short, the treaty envisages the use of  levers of social partnership, and beyond this, we know, lies the  solution of specific questions associated with the payment of  wages, pensions, benefits and with creating a decent living  standard for people.    At the same time the text of the document does not take  account of a number of important proposals, therefore we will  sign the treaty not unconditionally but taking account of the  trade unions' dissenting opinion. This is that there can be no  question of a "moratorium on strikes:" If through the fault of  the authorities the collective treaty and the agreement on  questions of wages, labor conditions, employment, and preserving  established social guarantees are not implemented -- in this  case the trade unions reserve the right to take collective  action.    We are also insisting that the existing budget debt as  regards the payment of wages must be cleared not within one year  but as early as in the first half of the year.    In our dissenting opinion we demand that Federation  components' organs of state power solve a nationwide problem:  Preserving the system of free general secondary (full) and  primary vocational education.    Finally, the document must provide for an efficient  mechanism  of responsibility for all parties which have signed it.    [Yemchenko] A very important condition. But I am afraid  that few people know the structure of the "mechanism." How can  influence be exerted on the power structures if they contravene  the signed document's provisions?    [Shmakov] As you know, the country's president is a  guarantor ensuring that the commitments assumed will be met. He  has sufficient powers. In this context I would like to say that  not so long ago we signed a tripartite general agreement between  entrepreneurs, the government, and trade unions. It envisages  the prompt payment of wages, guaranteed labor safety, and the  preservation of jobs.    [Yemchenko] Mikhail Viktorovich, the May Day holidays are  almost here. This year they coincide with Easter. Because of  this there have been calls to scrap any demonstrations and  processions. What is the trade unions' position regarding this?    [Shmakov] For us May Day has been and will remain a day of  solidarity among working people in the struggle for their  rights. That is why trade unions are organizing demonstrations  and rallies, at which demands defending the interests of hired  workers will once again be heard.    [Yemchenko] In that case what do you understand by the word  solidarity and how can it be expressed now?    [Shmakov] I will guess the subtext of your question. Yes,  every sector has its own specific interests. And sector trade  unions endeavor to protect them above all. But modern  production development is such that all sectors within it are  closely linked to each other. Therefore working people,  wherever they work, have common interests, and that means common  objectives of struggle. That is the whetstone on which  solidarity is sharpened.    [Yemchenko] I think that solidarity among working people is  also demonstrated by the extent to which trade unions are  united. Unfortunately the reverse process can now be observed.  What is your view of the future of the Russian trade union  movement?    [Shmakov] Trade unions, like all of our society, are now  experiencing a period of renewal. This process is never easy.  At the moment it is too hard to say how they will emerge from  it. But the fact that the trade union movement will in time  become strong and united goes without saying. Hired workers  have no other way of standing up for and protecting their social  interests.</p>

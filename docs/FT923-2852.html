			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / UK troops face uncertain role BRITISH troops have been preparing for the past three weeks to form the largest contingent of new UN forces for Bosnia, but remain in considerable uncertainty about how and where they will operate. Reconnaissance and planning teams are to fly out this week to investigate convoy routes and establish areas of responsibility. The other main new contingents will be from France and Canada, with smaller forces from Spain, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark. 'A hell of a lot of detailed planning is still to be done,' said one UK official. The 1,800 UK troops, with some 450 vehicles, are not expected to be in place in much less than six weeks. Crucial questions still hang over the rules of engagement - the confidential conditions governing a commander's leeway to use military force. The force's mandate to protect food and medical aid convoys for Bosnia has been extended to cover possible convoys of released detainees. But it has no brief to monitor the sites where heavy weapons are concentrated, and the question remains open how these weapons will be controlled. UN forces are empowered to defend both themselves and the convoys. This means they may return fire and in some circumstances fire first. But it is unclear what further action they might take against ambushers, and unlikely that their powers would extend to pre-emptive firing at an ambush site. 'The name of the game is protection, not forcing convoys through,' said one army officer. He accepted problems were likely to arise, but warned that looser rules of engagement could 'open the door too far to a variety of interpretations'. Currents plans are based on the assumption that any attack on convoys would probably involve direct fire - for instance from heavy machine guns or anti-tank weapons - rather than artillery. British forces, although they will have some mortars, include no artillery or radars to locate heavy guns. The UK force is designed as a self-sufficient 'battle group', drawn mainly from units based in Germany and built around a reinforced infantry battalion, equipped with 40 Warrior armoured combat vehicles and backed up by a squadron of Scimitar armoured reconnaissance vehicles and logistics support. Troops in Germany began painting their vehicles white last week. The relatively heavy equipment was chosen to operate along difficult mountain roads in winter, and both the Warrior and the Scimitar are equipped with powerful 30mm cannon. The cost to the UK is reckoned at Pounds 80m-Pounds 90m in the first year. Britain, which currently has 300 medical personnel in Croatia, has up to now been among the most cautious about sending combat troops to former Yugoslavia. The Bosnian deployment has increased concern that the army, in the process of being reduced by 25 per cent, may be overstretched. Troop strengths in Northern Ireland have already been increased since last year by two battalions. 'The pips will squeak a bit, but it's still tenable,' said an army source. However, if significant further deployments became necessary, the government might have to rethink its plans for army cutbacks.</p>

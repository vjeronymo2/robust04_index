			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DR. WELSING IS THE FIRST SCIENTIST TO PSYCHOANALYZE WHITE RACISM. . . .'  </P> <P> Beyond the scientific information on color dominance, whites also emulate black  people in terms of what we do and say and how we look.  </P> <P> For instance, the bustle worn by whites was inspired by the prominent buttocks  of black women (i.e., Hottentot sculpture and other images in the 17th and 18th  Centuries in Europe); dances and phases and gestures invented by blacks are  immediately snatched and adopted by whites.  </P> <P> I believe melanin has a great deal to do with the association of blacks with  having more soul, rhythm and coordination.  </P> <P> If I were white and read the Cress Theory and the other scientific information  on melanin (such as "Melanin: The Chemical Key to Black Greatness" by Carol  Barnes, chemist), I'd not only want to look, act and sound black as many whites  already try to do -- I'd want to be black.  </P> <P> SUESAN COLEMAN  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

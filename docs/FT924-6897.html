			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Thai trader accused of manipulation THAILAND'S six-month-old Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday accused a leading stock market trader of manipulating share prices and ordered the suspension of trading in Bangkok Bank of Commerce shares. The SEC said it had filed a case with the police against Mr Song Watcharasriroj, better known as Sia Song, and his associates for 'alleged breach of securities law on price manipulation and the takeover code.' Mr Song has announced a 10.66 per cent personal holding in the bank, but he and his associates are reported to hold more than 25 per cent, which would oblige them to make an offer for the rest of the bank, Thailand's ninth largest. They have not done so. The SEC's move yesterday follows a concerted effort by the central bank and the finance ministry to restrict speculation on the stock exchange and reduce the amount of credit extended by stockbrokers to their clients for buying shares. Thai share prices rose sharply after May, when troops killed about 50 pro-democracy demonstrators in Bangkok, and continued to rise following the election of a civilian coalition government in September, but they have started to fall back in response to the credit squeeze. Yesterday the SET index fell 23.45 points, or 2.6 per cent, to 868.04 on news of the proposed prosecution of Mr Song. An SEC statement said: 'This action is carried out by the SEC board to protect the interest and stability of the country's financial system and of the majority of stock investors. 'The SEC board hopes that (the action) will not have a serious impact on the stock market or the work of finance and securities firms as a whole.' Mr Reg Clough, a spokesman for the bank, was quoted as saying that 11 arrest warrants had been issued for Mr Song and his associates. World Stockmarkets, Page 41</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vladimir Shumeyko, president of the Federation  Council of the Russian Congress, has said Russia needs a stable  government to grow economically. For this reason the government  promoted a consensus pact with the political sectors that was  joined by main enterprises a few weeks ago.    Shumeyko, with a delegation of businessmen and deputies,  began yesterday a three-day visit to Chile. Among other  activities, he is scheduled to meet today with President Eduardo  Frei, to whom he will deliver a personal message from Russian  President Boris Yeltsin.    Shumeyko arrived on the morning of 22 May, accompanied by  his  wife. He expressed optimism over the future of his country  despite the economic and social problems it is currently facing.    Shumeyko referred to the prospects of the Treaty to Attain  Social Harmony [Tratado para el Alcance de la Concordia Social],  signed on 28 April by the Russian president and 200 other  politicians.    He asserted: "The less fighting there is among politicians,  the better it is for the economy."    He added that on Friday [not further specified] the  directors  of the most important Russian enterprises signed the treaty. He  explained the purpose of the pact, saying: "Our greatest concern  now is to enjoy peace in the political arena, to establish a  consensus in the political field, and to give the Russian  Federation a chance to work in stability."    The Russian delegation was met by Russian Ambassador to  Chile  Vasiliy Gromov and Mariano Fontecilla, the diplomatic  coordinator of Congress, who represented Senate President  Gabriel Valdes at the airport.    Valdes held a private luncheon for Shumeyko and his wife at  the Concha y Toro vineyards.    Shumeyko said he hoped to make "important achievements"  during his brief visit to Chile and to learn as much as possible  about the political process and the country's economic situation.    The Russian visitor said Russia and Chile have "a lot in  common."    He explained: "The Russian Federation is still going from a  totalitarian phase to the construction of a democratic state, an  open civil society."    He added that Russia and Chile share celebration dates  because "President Eduardo Frei was elected on 11 December while  the Russian Federation's new Congress, with its two chambers,  was elected and the new Russian Constitution was implemented on  12 December."    Shumeyko announced that he will meet with Chilean senators  and deputies with whom he hopes to tighten interparliamentary  relations.    He added that he hopes to increase intragovernment visits  between the two countries, and to establish direct contact  between Russian and Chilean businessmen.    For this reason, he added, he is accompanied by Russian  deputies, businessmen, and representatives of Russian  corporations and banks.    Shumeyko will meet tomorrow with Senate President Gabriel  Valdes and acting Chamber of Deputies President Juan Carlos  Latorre. In the afternoon he will meet with Finance Minister  Eduardo Aninat and Planning and Coordination under Secretary  Pedro Goic.    Tomorrow he will meet with Santiago Mayor Jaime Ravinet;  Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa, and the president of the  Supreme Court Marcos Aburto. He is scheduled to lunch with  businessmen at the Union Club. On Friday he will leave for  Buenos Aires on a special flight.    Shumeyko said he is optimistic over the future of his  country  although he admitted that Russia is facing difficulties in  transforming a centralized economy into a free market economy.    Shumeyko commented that the military industry faces  difficulties because orders placed by the government have been  cut to just 10 percent. He added that there are also serious  problems in the agricultural sector, especially the kolkhoz and  sovkhoz, the old socialist peasant organizations.    Shumeyko added: "We now place emphasis on the business  sector, on the private entrepreneur," adding that 40 million of  the 150 million inhabitants work for enterprises that no longer  belong to the state.    He believes the lack of private sector statistics  contributes  to the somber panorama with which the Russian economy is  described.    He said that official data currently shows that 11 percent  of  the population lives under the minimum poverty level compared  with 37 percent last year.    "This is why we can state that currently nobody dies of  hunger in Russia," he said.    Shumeyko ruled out the possibility that Congress agree to  bring forward the presidential elections, scheduled for June  1995, as Vice President Alexandr Rutskoy requested.    "There is no room for this request. I do not think the  Senate, which sets the date and calls presidential elections,  will listen to Rutskoy's request to contradict the Constitution."    Shumeyko said Congress and government authorities abide by  the Constitution, which was amended almost six months ago. He  denied that President Yeltsin grants less importance to the  legislative branch which, in his opinion, plays a very important  role in Russian politics.    He explained that the Senate, over which he presides, has  important tasks, among them approving decrees issued by the  president regarding emergency issues, the use of Russian troops  in foreign territory, and border problems.    The Senate also approves the appointment of the attorney  general and the members of the Constitutional Court and the  Supreme Court. It also acts if the president resigns and is in  charge of calling elections.</p>

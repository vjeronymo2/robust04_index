			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / 'No Croats, Albanians or dogs': In Kosovo 93 per cent of the population is Albanian and 6 per cent Serbian. But the Serbs wield all the power THE COMMONEST sight on the streets of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, is urchins selling cigarettes. As I passed the street market the other night, a couple of them offered me a box. Then, suddenly, they bolted. I looked round and saw why. An armed policeman was running after one of them. He brought his truncheon down on the boy and the last I saw of him was his white face under the policeman's arm as he was dragged off. 'What'll happen to him?' I said to an Albanian who was with me. 'He'll be taken off to the barracks and beaten,' he said. 'Then after a day or two his father will be sent for. It's nothing abnormal here. It's abnormal when it doesn't happen.' Indeed, it is unusual to come across a group of Albanians in Kosovo where no-one has had trouble with the police, been beaten by the police or spent time in prison. The police underpin the status quo in Kosovo. In a republic where 93 per cent of the population is Albanian and six per cent is Serbian, the Serbs have the power, the jobs, the institutions. And, since Slobodan Milosevic came here in 1988 to claim that Kosovo would always be Serb and certainly since the constitution of Kosovo was suspended two years ago, the place has been run from Belgrade for Serbs. You see it in all sorts of ways. If you go to the discos in Prishtia - there are four of them - you have got to be a Serb, or at least under the protection of a Serb. The one I went to was dark and cavernous. There was a notice on the door showing the things you were not meant to bring in: a gun, a grenade, a knuckleduster. The young men listening to the band had the spaced-out look of drug-takers. But the striking thing about it was the space. I had been to the mall where the young Albanians go the night before and there was not room to move. You squashed people with the door whenever you tried to get into a bar - there are no Albanian places to go dancing. Young men joke as you sidle your way past them to the drinks. There are no ostensible differences between them and the young Serbs - both groups are trendily dressed, educated. But I asked one Albanian, a medical student, what would happen to him if he went into the Serbian disco. 'I'd be beaten', he said simply. It is the same in the Grand Hotel in Pristina. If you cannot speak good Serbian and pass as a Serb - and the Albanian I was with had spent four years in Sarajevo - you will not get past the rat-faced flunkey on the door who questions you about your movements. It is celebrated, the Grand. It is the place where you get arms dealing late at night, and you can spot the odd Serbian political bigwig, like one notorious politician who once threatened to shoot student demonstrators in Belgrade. Until lately it was also infamous for the notice on the 13th floor: 'No Croats, Albanians or dogs'. It is hard to find any sort of common ground between Serbian and Albanian explanations for the situation. I talked to one liberal young Serb, whose father had been demoted from his job for refusing to sack Albanians and whose good friend was an Albanian. Yet even he was convinced that Serbs were a people under threat. 'During the 1980s, Albanians in the villages raped Serbian women, beat Serbian children and desecrated Serbian graves,' he told me earnestly. 'That's why the police came here a couple of years ago. I know they beat Albanians, but since then the Serbs have felt safer.' His Albanian friend shook his head. 'There's just no truth in the stories about Albanians attacking Serbs. On the television during the eighties you never saw anything else but beaten Serbian children. But they were not attacked by Albanians. It was Serbian propaganda. They accused us of doing things - desecrating graves - that we had never done in our whole history.' I could believe anything of Belgrade propaganda. One night I heard the announcer say on television news that the reason Albanian children were not in schools was that they simply did not want to go. The Albanians I was with shook their heads resignedly. Albanians schools, using the Albanian language and teaching an Albanian curriculum, had been banned two years ago. That afternoon I had visited a primary school, which is used by about 20 Serbian children during official hours. When they have gone home, the Albanian children arrive. I saw one music class for the eight year-olds where it was standing-room only for half the 50 children. The teacher was not paid, because she was not officially employed. There are two systems of government at work in health, in education, in social security. There is the official regime, which has the buildings and the money. Then there is the underground system run by Albanians. About 25,000 students go to the underground university. It is staffed by the same professors as in the old days - they are just not paid. I visited one biology class. A teacher and five students sat around in their coats on battered garden furniture in a freezing conservatory. There was no equipment. If the police find them, they are arrested. That is why they move from house to house. Each week a man comes round to tell them where to go next time. 'They're good students,' said the professor drily. 'Very disciplined.' He had been dismissed last year. So, in the last two years, had 100,000 other Albanians. He showed me his letter of dismissal, signed by his Serbian colleague. 'He had to do it. He had no choice,' he said. Earlier, he said his office had been smashed and his books burned. We went and looked at the offices. The windows were smashed and the bookshelves empty. Next day, I met Dr Ibrahim Rugova, president of the unacknowledged parliament of Kosovo. With his scarf permanently wound round his neck and his lugubrious expression, he looks remarkably like Woody Allen. 'I'm pessimistic', he said. 'They're trying to make us leave. Hundreds of thousands of our young people have already left. This is silent ethnic cleansing.'</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CARDS TIP CUBS, RUIN DICKSON'S DEBUT  </P> <P> Former Grossmont High pitcher Lance Dickson said he was a little nervous about  his major league debut Thursday. Understandable, since a little over two months  ago, Dickson, a 20-year-old left-hander, was a student at Arizona.  </P> <P> Dickson said he didn't pitch that well in a 3-1 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals  at Wrigley Field in Chicago. Not entirely so, Cubs Manager Don Zimmer said.  </P> <P> "It was a decent outing," Zimmer said. "We're talking about a kid who was  pitching in college two months ago."  </P> <P> In his debut after an accelerated two-month climb through the minors, Dickson  (0-1) yielded eight hits and three runs over six innings, striking out three  and walking one. He got off to an interesting start, yielding a leadoff single  to Rex Hudler, then picking Hudler off first and making the putout himself in a  rundown.  </P> <P> "I wasn't happy," Dickson said. "I made some bad pitches. I didn't make key  pitches in key spots."  </P> <P> The Cubs' No. 1 draft choice out of Arizona, where he led the NCAA in  strikeouts in with 141 in 119 2/3 innings, Dickson was sent to Class A Geneva,  N.Y., then promoted to Class A Peoria, Ill., then to double-A Charlotte, N.C.  </P> <P> During those brief stays, Dickson was a combined 7-3 with a 0.94 earned run  average and 111 strikeouts and 18 walks in 69 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> He was called up Tuesday for pitcher Shawn Boskie, who was placed on the 15-day  disabled list.  </P> <P> The Cubs, who lost for the first time in six games and just the sixth in 23,  didn't offer Dickson much offensive support. The Cardinals' Kent Hill, who was  re-called from triple-A Louisville July 26, did not allow a hit until the sixth  inning and had a two-hit shutout working until Jerome Walton's leadoff home run  in the ninth. It was Walton's first homer since Aug. 8, 1989.  </P></p>

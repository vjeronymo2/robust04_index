			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLOODY SUNDAY  </P> <P> Marcel Montecino's debut novel, "The Crosskiller," was a harsh, grittily  atmospheric and hard-to-set-aside thriller. His second novel, Big Time (William  Morrow: $19.95; 493 pp.), is no less harsh and violent and not a bit easier to  set aside once you've entered upon Montecino's long, picaresque cat-and-rat  chase. Even after nearly 500 pages fecund with character and event, the story  seems not so much to have concluded as to have paused for breath.  </P> <P> Sal D'Amore is a New Orleans lounge pianist-songwriter-compulsive gambler, a  self-made loser. As we meet him he is vamping until ready as bartender and  transcriber of phone bets in a Family-owned saloon. He gets caught out betting  wrong on a fixed race and has to go on the lam, remorselessly pursued all over  the Western Hemisphere by killers who aim to settle the bet with a long goodby.  </P> <P> Montecino is with all else a funny writer with what you might call a specialty  in violent farce. Sal's progress is a Saturday serial succession of  hairsbreadth 'scapes, beatings, shootings, rescues and rebirths, usually  attended by ladies of uncommon pliancy. Worse luck: He becomes a musical  celebrity with his picture in Time and Newsweek, and thus the easier to locate.  He also becomes a man deeply in love with the wrong woman.  </P> <P> All his couplings are explicit to a degree even now still not common in crime  fiction, and readers who prefer the wink to biological precision are  forewarned.  </P> <P> The author clearly has strong feelings for music, and Sal's thoughts about the  piano and the making of songs are the nicest things about him. About the only  nice things about him, in fact. Yet long before he is fished naked as a cod out  of the sea for what may or may not be the last time, you are rooting for him  for reasons that defy logic. It is a tribute to Montecino's ability to make  this improbable rake's progress so visually and viscerally compelling.  </P> <P> Another gambler, obsessive but not compulsive, is William Murray's Shifty Lou  Anderson, a professional sleight-of-hand magician when he isn't haunting Santa  Anita or Del Mar. He is back again in The Getaway Blues (Bantam: $17.95; 218  pp.).  </P> <P> Languishing amid a shortage of both gigs and winners, Shifty becomes part-time  chauffeur to an eccentric millionaire horse owner who is also designing an  elaborate private mausoleum to receive him once he has bumped himself off,  which he plans to do momentarily.  </P> <P> Complications arise in the lithe form of a beautiful woman his ex-wife says is  the eccentric's own daughter. She isn't, but the eccentric -- no longer quite  so eager to bid the world adieu -- doesn't care. There is a back story, dark  and evil, as Shifty Lou discovers soon enough, although not before murder has  been multiply done.  </P> <P> Handicapping races, Shifty says, is a kind of sleuthing. "Ferreting out secrets  and solving puzzles is what I do at the race track," he says, "which is a great  training ground for life." You might get an argument about that, but the  strength of this likable series is Murray's affectionate familiarity with the  tracks, the trainers and owners, the running of a races and above all the  bettors whose hopes never quite die. In the new book, Murray's eccentric is an  interesting creation, and so is a beautiful but luckless vegetarian lady.  </P> <P> Like Scott Turow, Jay Brandon is a practicing lawyer and a former assistant  district attorney, his venue being San Antonio. Brandon's fourth novel, Fade  the Heat (Pocket Books: $18.95; 342 pp.), bears very favorable comparison with  "Presumed Innocent" in its intimate familiarity with the justice system, and in  its depiction of a man of law for whom the law becomes an enemy.  </P> <P> Mark Blackwell is the new district attorney of San Antonio. His son, a computer  whiz working late at night in his office, is entrapped in a rape charge. The  ploy is to maneuver Blackwell into dismissing a case against a local crime  boss.  </P> <P> The son is convicted anyway, and Blackwell is left to try to prove he was sent  up on perjured testimony. Brandon's plotting is intricate and proceeds by  crackingly dramatic scenes and some surprising turns. But beyond its  excitements, the novel also is a sensitive portrait of a man in anguish over  his son's fate and facing hard moral choices. The courtroom scenes, always  sure-fire, are sure-fire once again. Steven Spielberg has optioned the book.  </P> <P> Freeze Frame (William Morrow: $18.95; 320 pp.) by Marjorie Dorner is an  expertly suspenseful story about a young American scholar on sabbatical at  Cambridge University. On a Sunday stroll she takes a snapshot that may show in  the background a serial killer and the young woman who was to be his next  victim. The killer knows, although Beth Conroy doesn't, what a damning truth  the camera may hold, and he begins to stalk her.  </P> <P> Donner compounds the suspense by leaving it unclear until a last mad pursuit  through the dark English night just which of three or four men Conroy has met  is actually the killer. A tidy, almost understated thriller with a strong sense  of place and circumstance.  </P> <P> Elizabeth George of Huntington Beach, whose first mystery, "A Great  Deliverance," won some major awards, is back with her third, Well-Schooled in  Murder (Bantam: $17.95; 356 pp.), which is again set in Britain and again  features the high-born Inspector Thomas Lynley of the Yard.  </P> <P> The inspiration of P. D. James can be imagined, whether she was indeed a role  model for Howard or not. There is the same care for elegant and eloquent  language, the same patient accruing of detail, the same subtle delineation of  character and interplay, and there is the meticulous and complex plotting.  </P> <P> The setting is a public school, several ranks down from Eton but with  desperately held pretentions to grandeur. A schoolboy is murdered; one of the  masters shares an old-school tie with Lynley, who looks in with his impatient,  unimpressed, working-class aide, Sgt. Havers.  </P> <P> The school is a dreadful mess of kinky cliques, incompetent staff, o'erweening  alumni and a pervasive wish to deny that anything is wrong. The tragic victim  was simply in the wrong school for the wrong reasons. The author's scorn for  the school and the kind of classism it reflects is evident, if too cool to be  called outrage. But the story is both startling and saddening.  </P> <P> The veteran mystery writer Thomas Chastain has been authorized by the estate of  Erle Stanley Gardner, who died in 1970, to extend the life of Perry Mason.  Gardner wrote 83 Mason mysteries, which have sold a reported 300 million copies  and led to one of television's most predictable series.  </P> <P> The Case of the Burning Bequest (William Morrow: $15.95; 240 pp.) is Chastain's  second go-round, and it is so faithful to the crisp, primer-simple and  superficial style of the originals that no one can accuse Chastain of departing  an inch from tradition. John Leland is accused of murdering his stepmother, who  disapproved of his marriage to her daughter.  </P> <P> There's plenty of back story, and something odd about the fireplace, and as  usual Della Street and Paul Drake Jr. (son of the original investigator) seem  capable of digging up information during a court recess that would take an  ordinary researcher weeks. They are a great comfort to a lawyer, or an author.  </P> <P> The revivals are an amusing curiosity for the faithful, but they measure the  strides forward detective fiction has made in mirroring reality with no loss in  entertainment value.  </P> <P> Sisters in Crime III, edited by Marilyn Wallace, (Berkley: $3.95, paper; 336  pp.) is the third anthology of short stories by women, most although not all of  whom are members of the Sisters in Crime organization. Like most anthologies,  this one is erratic in quality, but it is an instructive introduction to some  of the brightest new voices in the mystery field. Prime items include "The  Maltese Cat" by Sara Paretsky, "Wow Finish" by Gabrielle Kraft and a grim  little item called "Say You're Sorry" by Sarah Shankman.  </P></p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / BAe set to sign joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace BRITISH Aerospace is on the verge of finalising a Pounds 240m joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace to manufacture and develop regional jets. The agreement, which is fundamental to the restructuring and recovery strategy of BAe's loss-making civil aircraft business, is expected to be signed at the end of this week or next week at the latest. BAe confirmed that its talks with Taiwan Aerospace were making 'good progress', while Mr George Liu, Taiwan Aerospace's vice-president, was quoted by the Taiwan Economic Daily News as saying a final agreement with BAe would be signed on Friday. The deal is particularly important for BAe because it will secure the future of its regional jet activities and unlock the next stage of the company's civil aircraft restructuring. BAe has also decided to keep its Space Systems division which the company had earlier planned to shed as part of its overall restructuring. The decision follows BAe's rejection of a bid from Matra Marconi Space, the space partnership between the UK General Electric Company and Matra of France. BAe and Matra Marconi failed to agree on a valuation for the BAe space business. Aerospace analysts yesterday said the Taiwan deal would enable BAe to release a large amount of provisions to help accelerate this reorganisation. Taiwan Aerospace is expected to pay BAe about Pounds 120m for its 50 per cent share in the joint venture. The deal will also help preserve the residual value of existing BAe-146 regional jet aircraft. About 200 BAe-146 aircraft are in service of which many are leased by BAe to airline customers. The value of these aircraft would have collapsed if BAe had been forced to close down 146 production. Under the agreement, BAe's new Regional Jet (RJ) range of aircraft will be jointly produced at BAe's Woodford plant, near Manchester, and in Taiwan. The first RJ aircraft partly assembled in Taiwan is expected to be delivered in the next 12 months. Once the Taiwan deal has been finalised, BAe is likely to seek an international partner to invest in its turbopropeller commuter aircraft business to mirror the Taiwan joint venture.</p>

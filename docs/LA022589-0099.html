			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WESTERN HEALTH PLANS MAY GET NEEDED CASH  </P> <P> An affiliate of Mercy Hospital has agreed to invest as much as $15 million in  financially troubled Western Health Plans, company officials said Friday.  </P> <P> The proposed cash infusion would give Western, which operates the Greater San  Diego Health Plan, enough capital to meet minimum requirements set by the state  Department of Corporations, Western Vice Chairman Jack W. Savidge said Friday.  </P> <P> Western and Mercy Hospital's Mercy Services subsidiary hope to complete the  proposed cash infusion within 45 days. However, "there is no certainty as to  when or if the transaction will be accomplished, Savidge said.  </P> <P> In return for its investment, Mercy Services would receive promissory notes and  warrants for Western stock that, if exercised, would give Mercy Services 45% of  Western shares. Mercy Services also will appoint five members of Western's  10-member board of directors.  </P> <P> Western, a publicly traded company that is owned mainly by the 1,500 doctors  who provide health care for the company's 140,000 members, has reported $24  million in net losses during recent years. Western on Wednesday closed a  Pomona-based health-care plan that covered 16,000 members. It previously  withdrew from the highly competitive Nevada health-care market and discontinued  a money-losing management company.  </P> <P> In a recent filing with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, Western  acknowledged "substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going  concern" without a sizable cash infusion. Western's capital shortfall had  jeopardized the company's state license to operate health maintenance  organizations such as the Greater San Diego Health Plan.  </P> <P> Western's 140,000 San Diego members should not notice any changes if Mercy  completes its cash infusion, Keyser said. Those members will continue to be  treated by the doctors who have contracted to provide primary care under the  Greater San Diego Health Plan. Members of the HMO will continue to enjoy their  "choice of hospitals throughout the community," Keyser said.  </P> <P> "What this agreement really does is keep Western Health Plans, which is a very  important (health-care) plan in this community to survive," Keyser said.  "That's important to hospitals like ours and other private hospitals."  </P> <P> Mercy's investment "will give us the capital strength and the marketing  momentum to move ahead aggressively," Savidge said.  </P> <P> Cash to be invested in Western will not be generated by Mercy Hospital's  revenues, Keyser said.  </P> <P> Mercy Services, a "sister corporation," will invest funds to be provided by San  Francisco-based Catholic Healthcare West, the parent company of Mercy Hospital  and 11 other Catholic hospitals in California, Arizona and Nevada.  </P> <P> Mercy's proposed investment in Western marked the second time in recent months  that a local group has expressed interest in acquiring all or some of Western's  outstanding stock.  </P> <P> Late last year, a consortium of San Diego-based hospitals that included Sharp  HealthCare, Scripps Memorial, Palomar-Pomerado, Grossmont and Children's  hospitals made a $21-million bid for Western. Western on Nov. 18 rejected that  bid, but subsequently acknowledged that it was discussing a cash infusion or  sale with nearly a dozen companies.  </P> <P> Health-care observers suggested that Mercy's parent company agreed to make the  investment in order to bolster Mercy's share of San Diego County's patient  population.  </P> <P> "Mercy might want to try and capture the patients that Western now sends to  other hospitals," said Charles Ewell, a San Diego-based health-care consultant.  "It might try to develop contracts (with other health-care providers) to serve  patients who are geographically scattered."  </P> <P> Another health-care expert suggested that Catholic Healthcare West agreed to  make the investment in order to keep Mercy competitive with other hospitals  that have been striking up strategic alliances with other health-care outfits.  </P> <P> "Mercy lost out when Community Hospital of Chula Vista paired up with Sharp  HealthCare, and they would have lost (more patients) had the local consortium  led by Sharp acquired Western," the observer said.  </P> <P> Mercy Services is Mercy Hospital and Medical Center's development arm, Keyser  said.  </P></p>

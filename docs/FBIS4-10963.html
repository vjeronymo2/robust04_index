			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ernesto de Paola] </F>   [Text] The search for private risk capital for the nuclear  sector is one the biggest challenges of the process that began  with the transformation of the power sector.    Energy Secretary Carlos Bastos has said that the leading  guidelines for the transformation are basically the following  principles:    -- The state, as such, has decided to no longer engage in  the  production of power, on the grounds that it is not a strategic  activity.    -- Within this context, the privatization of the sector as a  whole (electric, gas, and oil areas) has basically sought to  reorient the entrepreneurial role. This topic has been the  focus of the reorganization that has been implemented over the  past four years.    The first attempts to privatize the nuclear area caused  distrust in the National Commission for Atomic Energy (CNEA),  which, according to what Bastos told LA NACION, has now  disappeared, giving rise to a stage of mutual cooperation.  <H5>  The Rules of the Game </H5>   The CNEA, Bastos said, must adapt itself to the new rules of  the game.    One of the main obstacles that specialists mention in  referring to the search for risk capital for the nuclear sector  has to do with the appropriate insurance and policies for  operations, and the economic provisions for the future  dismantling of those power centrals.    Specialized technicians note that a plant like Embalse might  produce 8,000 tons of highly contaminated residue that should be  dumped in a grave or appropriate deposit. The total cost of the  deactivation operation may not be less than $200 million.    In the opinion of Bastos, this might not be a serious  problem. The state has never accumulated reserve funds for this  purpose, for example by increasing part of the cost of that  power, simply because it has always been expected that, whenever  necessary, the Treasury would provide the funds.    The CNEA, Bastos went on, should reorganize itself into an  enterprise ruled by private commercial regulations, which does  not mean that in the future the Treasury will not provide funds  for pure and applied research in the nuclear area, or for the  completion of the third plant (Atucha-2), construction of which  should have ended in 1987 according to the original project  timetable.  <H5>  The Next Steps </H5>   Concerning the reformulation of the CNEA role, Bastos  mentioned that work is being done to restructure the laws that  will regulate the participation and role of private capital. To  this end it will be necessary to create a new organization with  the same CNEA people, who will be in charge of regulating the  sector. This is to some extent what is happening to Calin  (Advisory Council for Licensing Nuclear Facilities) with respect  to CNEA, although in this case there will be more autonomy.    In sum, there will be a power generation enterprise with  security legislation for its operation.    Furthermore, attached entrepreneurial activities, like the  extraction of uranium, will be reorganized into one or more  enterprises whose shares will be, in principle, owned by the  state.</p>

Interior Minister Ramon  Escovar Salom said the government should wait for the proposal  to mature and be presented before making any official  announcement. He said, however, that the government will not  shy away from any responsibility handed down by the Legislative  Branch. He stressed that the country's problems are not  exclusively economic or financial.    [Begin recording] [Escovar] We would first have to see what  exactly the scope of these powers will be. It would make more  sense for these powers to allow the Executive Branch to deal  with all aspects of the crisis, and to attack them with the  swiftness and timeliness the nation demands. [end recording]    Ramon Escovar Salom pointed out that the proposal came from  the Congress and not from Executive Branch. Nevertheless, he  said the government cannot refuse to study the idea.</p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Europe's time may finally have arrived: An attempt to shift Britain further away from GMT NEARLY a quarter of a century after public opinion forced parliament to abandon an experimental period of permanent summer time, the government is on the verge of trying again. There now seems little likelihood that opponents will be able to mobilise the sort of public backlash which frightened MPs into submission in 1970 - just two years into a three-year experiment. Opinion polls carried out this year by Gallup for the pressure group Daylight Extra Action suggest that Mr John Major's accident-prone government may finally have hit on a policy which commands widespread public support. The catalyst for change is the European Commission, which is expected to produce a draft directive next month calling for the harmonisation of EC countries' annual time changes. The commission wants Britain and the Irish Republic, which move from summer to winter time in October, to come into line with the rest of the Community, which changes in September. That would put an end to the awkward autumn period when time in the British Isles is briefly synchronised with the rest of Europe, only to move out of line again a few weeks later. However, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, wants to go further. His plan, which has Mr Major's support, is to move Britain an hour ahead of Greenwich mean time in the winter, and two hours in the summer. That would put Britain on central European time, along with all other Community nations except Greece. The Republic of Ireland would face the awkward choice of going along with Britain or remaining the sole member of Europe's GMT zone. Most of the pressure for change has been applied by the Confederation of British Industry, which argues that industry is unnecessarily hampered by the existing time difference. Ministers have also been influenced by a campaign run by Mr Angus Crichton-Miller, the London businessman who chairs Daylight Extra. He argues that an extra hour of evening daylight would be popular with millions of people who would no longer have to travel home from work in the dark in winter. The crucial argument, however, is provided by recent research by the government's Transport and Road Research Laboratory into the 1968-70 experiment which suggests that a time switch would reduce road accident deaths by 160 a year and serious injuries by more than 2,000. Until recently ministers believed that any proposal to move on to European time would be torpedoed by the groups which proved so powerful in 1970. The key opponents were farmers and construction companies, which claimed that the extra hour of morning darkness made winter working more difficult and dangerous. The experiment was also unpopular in Scotland, where dawn arrives later than in England. However, the National Farmers' Union of England and Wales says that it now accepts the road safety argument and is willing to accept change as long as farmers are given time to adjust. Even in Scotland opinion is less hostile than it used to be, partly because the accident forecasts suggest that Scotland would benefit from one of the largest falls in road casualties. So far the only implacable opposition seems to be coming from the scientific community. Ms Kristen Lippincott, curator of astronomy at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, historic home of GMT, argues that a switch would in effect mean abandoning GMT after more than 100 years as the anchor of the world's time system.</p>

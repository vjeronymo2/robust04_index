			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FIRM HOPES CLEAN-AIR LAWS WILL BOOST SALES;  </P> <P> GLENDALE: STRUGGLING POLLUTION RESEARCH AND CONTROL CORP. EXPECTS LEGISLATION  TO INCREASE DEMAND FOR ITS EMISSIONS MONITORING DEVICES.  </P> <P> Pollution Research and Control Corp. is a tiny Glendale company that makes  devices for monitoring air pollution. Since it was founded in 1971, its success  in the U.S. market had been limited, so in 1988 Pollution Research turned to  overseas markets -- particularly South Korea -- which recently have accounted  for more than half of its sales.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the Korean market has proved an unsteady one for Pollution  Research, and in the year that ended June 30, the company lost $1.45 million on  $5.4 million in revenues. Not only were South Korean sales slipping, the same  was true for domestic sales.  </P> <P> But with President Bush expected to sign the new federal clean-air legislation,  which aims to free the nation's skies of smog and other harmful forms of  pollution by early in the next century, Pollution Research stands to  participate in what could be a bonanza for companies that make pollution  control and measurement products. These products will be needed by government  agencies and factories to measure emissions of sulfur dioxide and other  pollutants from smokestacks and in the surrounding air.  </P> <P> "We see a very positive impact," said Albert E. Gosselin Jr., Pollution  Research's president and chief executive. Gosselin estimated that the  legislation could result over the next year in a more than $2-million jump in  the company's sales.  </P> <P> Gosselin said specific provisions in the legislation that will most directly  help his company are those concerning acid rain. Pollution Research's monitors  measure sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen -- two of the key components of  acid rain. Most of the electronic devices are about the size and shape of  stereo receivers, cost $4,000 to $18,000, and analyze gases using ultraviolet  light.  </P> <P> Pollution Research hopes to sell more products to its traditional customers --  mostly utilities and government agencies such as the California Air Resources  Board -- which will need the devices to monitor compliance with the new  emissions standards. Orders may also come from consulting companies that buy  the equipment on behalf of manufacturers, Gosselin said.  </P> <P> Industry analysts agree that the clean-air legislation could be a boon for  companies in the $50 million-a-year domestic air pollution monitoring business.  "We're not just talking 20% or 30% growth here," said Stephen Schweich of Alex  Brown &amp; Sons in Baltimore. "The market for emissions monitoring systems is  going to expand geometrically," Schweich said.  </P> <P> Analysts say Pollution Research also stands to benefit if Proposition 128 --  the "Big Green" initiative -- is passed by California voters next month. Big  Green's clean-air provisions are even more stringent than those contained in  the federal legislation.  </P> <P> But John G. Taylor, an analyst at L.H. Alton &amp; Co. in San Francisco,  cautioned that the clean-air legislation is still no guarantee that Pollution  Research will manage a turnaround.  </P> <P> "Just because the stage is set doesn't mean business is going to start walking  in the door," Taylor said. "It's a question of executing a marketing plan and  getting in front of enough people. I think the jury is still out as to whether  they can do that."  </P> <P> Pollution Research's track record has been spotty. Founded in 1971 by Gosselin,  a mechanical engineer, Pollution Research (formerly named Dasibi Environmental  Corp.) made a disastrous 1973 investment in a Colorado cattle ranch, from which  it took the company several years to recover. The company has also fought an  uphill, mostly losing, battle against its two biggest competitors.  </P> <P> That's partly because the two competitors have the resources of large  corporations to draw from. Massachusetts-based Thermo Instrument Systems is a  division of Thermo Electron, which has annual sales of $400 million. Lear  Siegler, a $2.5-billion concern, has a Colorado division that makes pollution  monitoring equipment.  </P> <P> To compete for contracts against its big rivals, Pollution Research more than  doubled its staff to 86 workers from June to December of last year. But  Gosselin said the increased overhead came at a time when domestic orders for  pollution monitoring equipment started to slow as companies waited to see what  the final clean-air legislation would contain.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, orders from South Korea's equivalent of the Environmental Protection  Agency, a big Pollution Research customer, also started to dry up.  </P> <P> Pollution Research entered the Korean market when it won a contract to monitor  pollution at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. Several orders worth about  $400,000 apiece followed.  </P> <P> But during the past year, Gosselin said, Korea stopped ordering pollution  monitoring equipment, a result of various political changes. Gosselin said the  Korean market is now opening up again, and he expects to land a contract soon  that's worth more than $500,000.  </P> <P> Gosselin also blamed Pollution Research's losses on "unethical" practices by  Thermo Electron and Lear Siegler, including predatory pricing tactics.  </P> <P> Arvin Smith, president of Thermo Instrument Systems, denied that his company  had undercut Pollution Research's prices in hopes of driving it out of  business. "We have the highest prices in the business," Smith said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Pollution Research's troubles have been reflected in its stock,  which traded as high as $2.375 a share in June, 1989, but closed Monday at  18.75 cents a share. Gosselin said he has considered buyout offers from parties  he declined to identify. But those talks have since broken off, and Gosselin  said no other discussions are under way to sell the company.  </P> <P> Gosselin said he has taken steps to try to turn the company around, including  cutting the staff by more than half to 33 workers. He is also hoping to team up  with larger partners, such as Brown Boveri, a big Swiss-Swedish concern with  whom Pollution Research recently bid for a contract in Taiwan. Gosselin said he  is also increasing marketing efforts in Europe, where he believes demand for  pollution control products will soon take off.  </P> <P> But Pollution Research's biggest hope is for the domestic market. By early next  year, Gosselin said, government agencies and companies will start having plans  and funding in place to comply with the new law, and "they're going to need our  instruments."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pollution Research and Control At A Glance  </P> <P> Pollution Research and Control is a Glendale company that makes equipment for  monitoring air pollution from smokestacks and in the surrounding air. Founded  in 1971 by Albert E. Gosselin Jr., a mechanical engineer, the company has 33  employees.  </P> <P> For Fiscal years ended June 30; in millions  </P></p>

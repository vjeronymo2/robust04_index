Guo said China had studied Britain's latest  funding proposals and would seek a meeting with the British side  after the lunar new year. "A meeting of the (JLG's) Airport  Committee is inevitable," he said.    "After the new year, I suppose the experts on the two sides  can meet and exchange views to pave the way and set the  conditions for a meeting of the Airport Committee." He said  China would contact British representatives to arrange the date  and details of the meeting.    This was the first time Beijing had officially responded to  Britain's fourth and latest package, which proposes pumping more  than $60bn into the Provisional Airport Authority and Mass  Transit Railway Corporation to finance the airport and railway  projects. Britain's earlier proposal which was rejected by China  involved injecting only $45bn. Beijing has yet to make an  formal counter- proposal to meet its aim of lowering debts and  increasing government equity.    Guo would not give Beijing's view of the British proposal,  but said an in-depth study was continuing.    Meanwhile, Zhou Nan, the Hong Kong chief of the NEW CHINA  NEWS AGENCY (XINHUA), last night reiterated the importance of  sticking to the Memorandum of Understanding on the new airport.</p>

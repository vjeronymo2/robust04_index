			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STILL DRAGGING OUR FEET  </P> <P> The election of Municipal Judge Rand Schrader as chairman of the County AIDS  Commission holds the promise of continuing the vigorous and constructive  leadership that Rabbi Allen I. Freehling has brought the commission in its  first two years. However, the task will not be easy,because of continuing  resistance on the part of some of the county supervisors to the policies  required to stem the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic, and the  shortage of public health funds.  </P> <P> There is a sense of frustration among many, if not all of the commission  members. They have not been involved in crucial budget negotiations by the AIDS  Program Office of the Department of Health Services. And their advice has been  frequently ignored by the Board of Supervisors, at whose pleasure they serve.  </P> <P> But they have played a useful role, nevertheless. The monthly meetings serve as  a sounding board for community groups involved in the AIDS effort. The  commission was helpful in winning the support of the supervisors for the county  anti-discrimination ordinance. And the commission has been able to serve as a  voice of reason in the face of extremism. The commissioners helped defeat  misguided initiatives on mandatory AIDS testing in two state elections. Only  last week they set the record straight, appropriately disagreeing with  Supervisor Pete Schabarum after he had asserted that "the vast majority of  people would not have any interest in AIDS or AIDS funding."  </P> <P> Schabarum and Mike Antonovich had opposed the anti-discrimination ordinance and  had been part of a board majority that, over the years, has slowed the response  of the county. Valuable time has been lost in mounting effective education and  prevention programs. The commission, which includes some of the county's most  distinguished public health and AIDS experts, has encouraged progress in  expanding and diversifying county efforts. The county has almost doubled its  financial commitment to fighting AIDS in the last two years. It is moving ahead  appropriately in establishing a special AIDS ward and creating an enlarged  out-patient AIDS facility at the County-USC Medical Center.  </P> <P> Much remains to be done, however. Development of residential care and other  alternatives to hospitalization is lagging. So are prevention programs directed  where the risk of new infection is greatest, among adolescents and drug users.  There is a critical need for expanded programs among blacks and Latinos, who  have disproportionately high infection rates.  </P></p>

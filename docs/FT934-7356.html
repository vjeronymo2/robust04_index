			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (12): Southampton sails ahead - But Portsmouth has been hit by cuts in the Royal Navy and the defence industry / The South THE OPENING of the controversial M3 link through Twyford Down, scheduled for the end of next year, will integrate the south coast towns with the national motorway network. Principal beneficiary is likely to be Southampton, possibly at the expense of Basingstoke and Winchester to the north. Southampton exhibits as clear a case as any of the two-tier office market present in most UK cities. There is a limited supply of high specification new space which is letting at up to Pounds 18.50 a sq ft, compared with Pounds 14 two years ago. There is also plenty of empty space in second-hand buildings, of which some 250,000 sq ft is within 1960s and 1970s tower blocks. Most of this older accommodation is poorly specified, without air-conditioning or acceptable on-site parking provision. Rents are as low as Pounds 5 a sq ft, rising to Pounds 13 for good refurbishments. The only two new buildings in the city centre are the 36,500 sq ft Skandia House, in Portland Place, where Eagle Star has recently taken 22,000 sq ft at a rent believed to be in the region of Pounds 18 a sq ft, and Timberlaine's 16,250 sq ft Mountbatten House in Grosvenor Square. A further two new office buildings are under construction, both in Commercial Road. Scottish Amicable is putting up 65,000 sq ft for completion at the end of this year, and Timberlaine has made a start on 40,000 sq ft to be known as Thorneycroft House. A number of proposals are in the pipeline. But most are unlikely to go ahead without pre-lets in place, according to Andrew Wood, of Chestertons. Prospective developments include: Brunswick Gate, Brunswick Place, where Bryant Developments has planning permission for 46,000 sq ft of offices; Queens Quay, where Associated British Ports has a 28-acre site with consent for up to 375,000 sq ft of offices; the Pirelli site, on Western Esplanade, where the city council and Pirelli have outline consent for a mixed development. Martin Tice, of surveyor Vail Williams, considers, however, that the gradual increase in demand, apparent since the beginning of this year, could lead developers and funds to take another look at opportunities dismissed through lack of confidence no more than 18 months ago. Several out-of-town sites could also provide new office space. Arlington has consent for a further 500,000 sq ft on its Solent Business Park at junction 9 on the M27; and at junction 7 there is potential for up to 200,000 sq ft at the Botleigh Grange office campus. London &amp; Edinburgh Trust has been granted planning for up to 1.5m sq ft of business space on its site at junction 5 - at Eastleigh Airport, which is being upgraded regularly and now offers a comprehensive European service. Neighbouring Portsmouth has been hard hit by cutbacks in the Royal Navy, the defence industry and problems at IBM and other major computer companies. And it looks set for further suffering with more local jobs under threat. However, while the Isle of Wight has successfully achieved Assisted Area status, Portsmouth's bid was turned down. There has been a dearth of new office building in the city over the past few years, notes Mr Tice. However, two recent lettings have given confidence to a sluggish office market. Insurance broker Rossborough UK has taken 9,614 sq ft on two floors at the Swedish Slaget's (part of the Lundberg Group) 68,500 sq ft, 10-storey Baltic House on the northern fringe of the city centre. It is Portsmouth's only air-conditioned office building. The other significant letting is to the department for the environment, which has taken the 13,666 sq ft Wynnstay House office building in Cosham. The building will be occupied as the Cosham job centre and offices, on a 20-year lease with a 15-year break clause. There has been a slow but steady revival in industrial demand in the Portsmouth area this year, after three years of decline. The market is still unsettled, however. Little new industrial/warehouse space has been built around Portsmouth over the past four years. Vail Williams estimates that current supply - excluding Gosport, Fareham, Havant and Waterlooville - is around 635,000 sq ft; with only 10 per cent in new buildings. So here, too, there is a marked two-tier market, and occupiers looking for good modern space face limited options. Of these, one is Blueprint Portsmouth, a 34-acre development by British Gas Properties on the eastern outskirts of the city. Two recent lettings of 8,600 sq ft and 13,150 sq ft have achieved rents rising to Pounds 6 a sq ft. Nearby, close to the junction of the A27 and Eastern Road, John Menzies has taken a pre-let of a new 17,150 sq ft warehouse and office building at Pounds 6.26 a sq ft. At the site of the former airport, Percy Bilton has 10 acres of land available for pre-lettings at its Bilton Business Park and Gatcombe House Properties, and Portsmouth city council is soon to make a start on an eight-acre site at North Harbour. On a larger scale, Stand Harbour Securities, a joint venture between Portsmouth-based Warings Group and businessman Bob Merrick, is busy with a 143,225 sq ft business park at the environmentally sensitive Cams Hall estate close to junction 11 on the M27 at Fareham. Centrepiece of the park will be the restored listed hall itself, built in 1620 by Hampshire high sheriff Emmanuel Badd and rebuilt in 1767. As part of the agreement with the council, the estate's parkland and surrounding woods will be restored and there will be an extension to the coastal footpath around the whole Cams Hall Peninsula, completing the missing link from Fareham to Porchester. There are also two new 18-hole golf courses. Bournemouth has, over the years, attracted finance companies and insurance companies, including Abbey Life, Zurich Assurance and Lloyds Bowmaker. There has been very little speculative development. The one exception is Slough Estates' Wessex Fields, which offers two buildings, one air-conditioned of some 50,000 sq ft and the other 20,000 sq ft. Completed two years ago and marketed at Pounds 17 and Pounds 15 a sq ft respectively, both are still vacant except for part of one floor in the smaller building. Asking rent is now down to Pounds 13.</p>

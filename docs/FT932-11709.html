			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Clark chairman rebuts dissidents' circular THE CHAIRMAN of C&amp;J Clark, the privately-owned shoe group facing a proposed Pounds 184m bid from Berisford International, has written to shareholders with a point-by-point rebuttal of a circular from a group of shareholders opposed to the sale. Mr Walter Dickson, chairman, and six other directors of Clark have recommended the offer to shareholders. The entire board of 11 has said the terms are fair and reasonable, but three directors have advised shareholders not to accept. The dissident group, known by the acronym Shoes, wrote to shareholders on Wednesday saying the offer failed to reflect Clark's future potential, and attacking the board over its role in the bid being made. Shoes' letter put forward an alternative board structure - which it said would end the disputes between family shareholders which have plagued Clark for years - and supported a flotation of Clark within five years. Mr Dickson said 'there is no certainty in Shoes' proposals'. He said a two-tier board, suggested by Shoes, was 'virtually unknown in this country' and Clark had been advised not to adopt it. The proposals 'cannot disguise the deep rooted differences of opinion which have disrupted your company over the years'. He said the suggestion of a flotation was 'uncertain as to value, as to deliverability and as to timing'. Mr Dickson also said that the price negotiated with Berisford 'takes into account Clark's recovery plans'. Shoes argued that the price was low because Clark is expecting a profit recovery. Directors of Clark and Berisford have addressed meetings of Clark shareholders in London and Somerset in recent days. The issue of selling to Berisford will be put to an extraordinary meeting next Friday, May 7.</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): From 'must have' to 'nice to have' - One man's way of reinvigorating sales You have developed a business on the back of one niche product. The business has taken off but large competitors are catching up and sales growth is levelling off. How do you reinvigorate sales? The answer is, with difficulty. One approach is to work with the existing product - push it into different markets or develop it further. Another is to launch a new product for the same customer base. Martin Yates, managing director of Saladin, an information technology company, had this problem and adopted the second approach but found it threw up all sorts of unexpected challenges. Saladin's original product was directed at the global oil trading markets and provided traders with data consultancy services and software to manipulate information. If you wanted to know the value of products that could be refined from a Nigerian crude oil at any refinery - the so-called net-back calculation - Saladin's service provided it. Yates and his partners bought an early prototype and some software from the Guinness Peat group where he was working as the ailing banking group cut back its peripheral operations in 1986. With backing from a Gulf investor, his team developed the product, launched it at the 1987 Institute of Petroleum oil conference and soon after won an order from Exxon in New Jersey. From a standing start, Saladin found its Petroleum Analysis Work Station took off, and before the company was walking it was setting up international offices near its customers. Then the momentum began to flag. 'Three years ago we realised we had penetrated pretty deeply and we had to do something else,' says Yates. 'Each incremental sale was getting more difficult. As competition was increasing, the challenge was how to get sales from Pounds 3m to Pounds 5m and Pounds 15m.' Yates recognised what dealers wanted was the same information in a Windows environment and a way of pulling together on one screen different feeds from diverse sources such as Reuters, Platts and Knight Ridder. But most of all they wanted the manipulated historical data integrated with real-time information. The first problem was getting additional backing. The business was only breaking even and Yates anticipated development costs could be as high as Pounds 2m. Yates's original backer was not interested in growing the company. Finally the investor was persuaded to sell to venture capitalists including Advent UK and Geocapital. Another problem was the development project itself. In order to bring in fresh ideas - and to avoid taxing the management team's time - Yates brought in an external information consultant on contract. But while he knew his subject backwards, he trod on toes and put noses out of joint. 'He challenged the status quo, which was good,' says Yates. 'If we were going to compete with Reuters and Telerate we needed something different.' Taking on an outsider was 'a real flyer', Yates says. 'It created tremendous turmoil. I did not realise the organisational and human problems that would be caused by it.' Saladin spent an amount equal to a quarter of its 1992 turnover developing the new product. But inevitably, it was not able to develop the new Crusader product without additional backing and further dilution for the founder shareholders. But Saladin did get its new product. Yates says the company will be profitable this year and next year sales should rise to Pounds 7m, although leads are only slowly turning into firm orders. 'The first product was certainly easier because there was a gap in the market,' he says. 'The new product is not a 'must have' but a 'nice to have'.' Was there an alternative strategy, like not developing a new product? Yates says no. Quite apart from technological change, which meant traders wanted real-time information on Windows, Yates had no intention of managing a small business that was not growing.</p>

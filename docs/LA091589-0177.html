			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> WINFIELD A NO-SHOW; LAWYER FINED  </P> <P> A judge fined an attorney $10,000 for failing to produce New York Yankees  outfielder Dave Winfield for a deposition concerning his divorce case.  </P> <P> State District Judge Allen J. Daggett also fined Houston attorney Tom Alexander  $1,000 Thursday for not paying a $250 fine after Winfield's failure to appear  for a deposition Sept. 7.  </P> <P> A jury ruled in June that Winfield had a common-law marriage with Houston  flight attendant Sandra Renfro from 1982 to 1985. Winfield maintained that he  never intended to marry Renfro. The couple's divorce trial was scheduled to  begin in Daggett's court Sept. 2, but it has been delayed.  </P> <P> Renfro's attorney, Earle Lilly, said Winfield failed to appear for the  deposition to avoid being served contempt papers for not paying his client  $10,000 a month in temporary alimony.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent S. Matczak, including recorded </F> remarks by Marek Borowski, deputy prime minister and finance  minister]    [Text] The government has prepared a diary of this year's  price rises. It has done this to ensure budget revenues and to  avoid springing surprises on the public. According to [Deputy]  Prime Minister [and Finance Minister] Marek Borowski, the  planned rises are lower than assumed in the agreement with the  World Bank.    [Matczak] According to the authors of the official inflation  index, there are few countries which have a totally free market.  For instance, in Germany six years ago the state controlled  more prices than in Poland at present, but no one used to deny  there was a free market in Germany. [video shows cash tills;  street scenes]    We are going to get the first round of price increases in  February. After electric power and gas, fuel prices will go up  in March, while those of central heating, hot water and  medicines will go up in April.

An  increase in housing rents, which have been postponed since last  September, will be introduced in July. Also power and gas  prices will go up again.

If we were to say: Let the prices be whatever the  producers want them to be, then it is very likely that with our  state of the market we would have greater price increases than  the ones we prescribe, if I may put it thus.    [Matczak] According to the budget, next year prices will go  up by 27 percent. The biggest rises will apply to housing  rents, central heating and hot water, gas, power, and medicines.  Excise tax will be increased, which will affect the prices of  fuels, alcohol and cigarettes. But it is not known when the  latter two commodities will go up.

[Matczak] The zloty [Z] will be devalued by 1.6 percent a  month and by the end of the year we will be paying Z26,300 for  one dollar. But at the end of 1993 the dollar cost Z1,000 more  than planned.    [Video shows following]    Dollar Exchange Rate -- 1.6 percent a month    December 1994 -- 26,300</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 28 (BTA) -- Albanian President Sali  Berisha, who arrived on an official visit here yesterday,  conferred with Aleksandur Yordanov, chairman of the Bulgarian  National Assembly, for about half an hour. After addressing the  National Assembly, he departed for Bulgaria's second largest  city Plovdiv (southern Bulgaria).    "I commend highly Mr. Berisha's address to parliament as it  spelled out clearly, without using diplomatic language, the key  problems threatening our region: a communist legacy, imperial  ambitions and rampant nationalism," Mr. Yordanov told reporters.  According to him, it is not by accident that a number of Balkan  heads of state are interested in expressing their countries'  stands in the Bulgarian National Assembly, of all places. In  his view, this is due to the key role which Bulgaria is playing  in the Balkans now. On Tuesday [26 April] the Bulgarian  National Assembly was also addressed by Macedonian [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] President Kiro Gligorov.    Mr. Berisha told the Bulgarian Parliament that "history  confirmed on a number of occasions that Greater Serbia has  always been a transitional, unstable structure and a source of  war, conflicts, destabilization and aggression." Asked if he  shared Mr. Berisha's stand on the war in former Yugoslavia, the  National Assembly chairman said that sometimes "Bulgaria really  forgets who started the war, while the whole is clear that this  was the Serbs' aspiration to territorial aggrandizement."  According to Mr. Yordanov, the war in former Yugoslavia was a  natural result of the traditional nationalism in the Balkans,  the xenophobia and ethnic intolerance which were catalyzed by  the post-communist situation. "We should not forget that  democratic changes in Yugoslavia are too slow and that the  communist structures and leaders are still predominating," Mr.  Yordanov said.    Asked if he expected that the closeness in the positions of  Sofia, Skopje and Tirana would arouse fears in Belgrade and  Athens, Mr. Yordanov said that he was convinced that Mr.  Berisha's speech would be read very carefully both in the Greek  and in the Serbian capitals. "No matter how other countries  will react to Mr. Berisha's address to the Bulgarian National  Assembly, its frankness and sincerity cannot be denied," Mr.  Yordanov said.    Asked whether Bulgarian-Greek relations had soured over  Macedonia, Mr. Yordanov said that "the Greek policy is clearly  oriented towards Europe and that the Greeks are justified in  certain respects to express concern over some texts in the  Constitution of Macedonia which are inconsistent with the  principles of the European Union member countries." Mr.  Yordanov added that "contacts between Bulgaria and Greece are  built on principles which matter far more than historical  memories like, for example, integration into the European  structures. And it is a fact that we consider Greece a country  through which Bulgaria could practically integrate into these  structures," the National Assembly Chairman said.    Mr. Yordanov said that the positions of Bulgaria and Albania  on the inclusion of Turkish blue helmets in the UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] forces in Macedonia had not been discussed.  "I do not differentiate between Turkish, Bulgarian, American,  Finnish, Russian or other blue helmets. I would rather prefer  blue helmets crossing Bulgaria than green ones," Mr. Yordanov  said. According to him, it is another matter that the presence  of Turkish blue helmets in particular could play a destructive  role in the territories of Bosnia-Herzegovina, where nationalism  is extreme.</p>

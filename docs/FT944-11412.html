			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Abiola's detention continues Nigeria's opposition leader, Mr Moshood Abiola, remained in detention over the weekend despite winning an appeal for bail at court on Friday. The military regime gave no explanation for not releasing him in Abuja. Mr Abiola was arrested and charged with treason in June for proclaiming himself president on the anniversary of his victory in a presidential election which was annulled by the army regime. Mrs Kudirat Abiola, his wife, said yesterday she was still confident that he would be released today. According to his doctors, Mr Abiola needs medical treatment only available abroad. 'The head of state, Gen Abacha, has said several times that the issue will be decided by the courts and I am sure he will respect the decision,' Mrs Abiola said.</p>

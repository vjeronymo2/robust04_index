			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] A two-day session of the main committee of the  Party of Democratic Action [SDA] opened in Sarajevo today. In  addition to the president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency,  Alija Izetbegovic, and presidency members, the session was  attended by Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, government members,  Reis-ul-Ulema Mustafa Efendija Ceric, our ambassadors in foreign  countries, commanders of the Bosnia-Herzegovina army corps, and  other eminent guests and members of the SDA's main committee.  Alija Izetbegovic announced at the session that he was  returning to lead the Party of Democratic Action. [passage  omitted]    At the extended session of the SDA's main committee, which  is  some kind of convention, Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic spoke  about another important topic: Bosnia-Herzegovina today and  tomorrow and Bosniak Muslims in it.    [Begin Silajdzic recording] I would like to stress that the  [Washington] agreement is not the result only of the  negotiations held in the past two months in Frankfurt, Vienna,  and Washington, but primarily of the readiness of our people to  persist on the path which demands great sacrifices -- that is it  is a result of the sacrifices of our people -- of the army's  readiness to respond to the aggression successfully, and, of  course, of the principled policy implemented by the state  leaders throughout that period, including intensive diplomatic  activity, which was, for understandable reasons, not always  publicly announced.    I would like to stress that the agreement does not suspend,  and does not even bring into the question, the existing  international and legal status of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina within its internationally recognized  borders. The adoption of the constitution of the federation,  which was drafted as part of the (?conclusive) agreements, will  have no impact on this. The Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina  remains -- as an internationally recognized state -- the only  legal and legitimate entity in the peace process on this area.    Of course, if the so-called Serb side joins the agreement,  the federation will be established throughout the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and its international status will be  indisputable because this is an internal transformation of the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. If the Serb side does not  accept the agreement, the process of searching for a peaceful  solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina will continue, and in that  process the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its bodies retain  the status which they have had so far.    Consequently, the establishment of the federation in the  areas inhabited by a majority Bosniak and Croat population does  not automatically mean that the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina  ceases to exist. I am stressing this because many people  wondered whether the establishment of the federation abolishes  the international status of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [end recording]    At the end of the lengthy explanation of the Washington  agreement, Silajdzic talked about a number of important goals to  which this document will open the way for the Bosniak people.    [Begin Silajdzic recording] First, the agreement means the  defeat of the strategy of Serb aggressors who counted on a split  between Bosniaks and Croats, and who benefited most from the  conflict.    The agreement also means the defeat of the exponents of  extreme Croat nationalism, i.e., the victory of those political  forces among the Croatian people who realized that the conflict  was detrimental to the interests of both Croats and Bosniaks.    Third, by overcoming the conflict and reaching an agreement,  we have struck a very important strategic balance which  considerably restricts the activities of aggressive Serb  nationalism, turning it into a [word indistinct] political  project without a future.    Fourth, the agreement is an important step toward removing  the consequences of ethnic cleansing. It creates legal and  political prerequisites for the return of all refugees in the  territory of the federation and the implementation of this  agreement will create realistic conditions for this to be  achieved.    Fifth, the agreement is also important from the point of  view  of prospects for the fastest possible return of refugees and  this is exceptionally important for Bosniaks.    Sixth, the constitutional principles contained in the  agreement and decisions in principle regarding the political and  territorial organization of the federation do not allow for the  fragmentation of natural and economic entities which is of  far-reaching economic and political importance.    Eighth [as heard], the agreement contains solutions which  allow for the effective and economically purposeful exploitation  of major natural resources, not restricting them within a narrow  regional framework.    Ninth, the access to the sea is being resolved in a way  which  is acceptable to both sides, which is of vital importance for us.    Tenth, the agreement considerably strengthens our position  in  a future peace process, i.e., it strengthens our ability to  later resolve the issue of the occupied territories, as well as  the issue of the Bosniaks living outside the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Eleventh, the agreement above all means the reaffirmation of  a positive attitude toward the Bosniaks and it means accepting  the Bosniaks as a nation which belongs to the European community  of nations and which has its place in global relations.    Twelfth, taken as a whole, the agreement opens up realistic  prospects for the survival and development of the Bosniak  people, instead of the destruction and extermination which had  been intended for us.

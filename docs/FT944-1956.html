			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bizarre airport charge formula Sir, Des Wilson is right (Letters, December 14) that BAA's landing charges are low compared with those at airports in other countries. This is the result of a bizarre policy by BAA's regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, whose response to BAA's monopoly has been to force it to cut its charges over the past two years (the retail price index minus 8 formula). We have a situation at Heathrow where the demand for slots far exceeds supply and where the airport is the largest single source of noise and air pollution in London - yet charges are going down] The correct regulatory solution is to allow market clearing prices and tax BAA's excess profits. This special treatment of the air transport industry is also seen in the exemption of airlines from paying any duty or tax on the fuel they use - contrast the government's determination to put VAT on domestic power and the massive levy on petrol and diesel. Dermot Cox, Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise, c/o 22 Ruskin Avenue, Kew, Richmond TW9 4DJ</p>

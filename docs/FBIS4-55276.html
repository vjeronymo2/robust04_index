			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by B.C., B.I.W., PAD, and P.W.R.: "Nocturnal </F> Negotiations of Solidarity and Industry Ministry; To Continue or  To Suspend?"]    [Excerpts] Approximately 400 miners of the Jastrzebie Coal  Partnership began occupying the State Agency for Hard Coal in  Katowice; the miners are waiting for the results of the talks  that started between the miners' trade unions and the Ministry  of Industry and Trade [MPiH] late in the afternoon . Before  this, the ministry received information from the Office of State  Protection that the Solidarity ["S"] delegation would be  accompanied by a large group of miners, who were to arrive on  several buses. For fear of occupation of the government's  premises, the ministry placed barriers manned with policemen  around the building. "S" arrived alone. After five hours,  decisions were made concerning three out of the four demands of  "S" upon which the miners determine the suspension of the  strike. As this issue of the daily was being closed,  discussions were under way on the main demand--compensation for  lost remuneration for the period of the strike.    On Wednesday [11 May], the "S" National Committee [KK] will  decide on the further course of the protest action of the trade  union. In the KK Presidium, three options are becoming  noticeable.    The strike action may be suspended, and it is also possible  that it will be continued. The third possibility is the staging  of a one-day nationwide strike following which we will suspend  the protests, RZECZPOSPOLITA was told by KK Spokesman Piotr Zak.  <H5>  Ministry Half Open </H5>   It was agreed that next week the ministry will present the  trade unions with the economic results of the coal partnerships.  Afterward, the demand for the liquidation of wage disproportions  among the individual hard-coal mines will be discussed. As was  stated by Deputy Minister Herbert Gabrys, concluded were also  "far-reaching agreements" concerning the annulment of the  resolution blocking wage moves in the mines and the employment  policy. According to "S," the resolution conditioned an increase  in productivity. Agreement was reached concerning the  introduction into the statute of the coal partnerships a  provision, in line with which the managements of the  partnerships will obligatorily consult with trade unions on all  issues that, in line with the Law on Trade Unions and the Labor  Code, can be dealt with by them. So far the partnerships have  only been operating on the basis of the Commercial Code.  Guarantees were to be given and a provision was to be made,  whereby employers, as a party, will join the labor collective  agreements (so far the parties concerned were the unions and  MPiH).    Talks on compensation for the wages lost for the period of  the strike continued late into the night. The miners condition  the suspension of the strike on their results. Negotiations  with the directors of the coal partnerships on the previous day  did not yield any satisfactory results. According to "S,"  strikers might make up for the protest by "increasing their  productivity." The government stated that such compensation  would be a violation of regulations. Despite that, both parties  were close to circumventing them and reaching an agreement, but,  according to unofficial information, resistance was put up by  the representatives of one of the partnerships that had already  signed the protocol stating that the miners would not get any  money for the period of the strike. However, if an agreement in  this area were reached, the Trade Union of Miners in Poland was  going to submit a demand concerning higher wages.    Of the "S" demands, seven were intact, including the one  concerning the exclusion of any repressions toward the  participants of the strike.    Apart from "S," participating in the talks were also  employers and the Confederation of Trade Unions of Miners in  Poland, "Cadre," and "S '80." Contrary to the fears of the  MPiH, the "S" delegation came to Warsaw without buses full of  miners. They were surprised to find barriers and policemen  around the ministerial building. However, "S" did not deny that  the miners would not come; it would be a joke rather than  anything else. The buses went to the occupied agency to replace  the miners of the Jastrzebie Coal Partnership with the employees  of other partnerships. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Three Options of KK </H5>   The option of continuing the "S" action is backed by the  fact  that other regions are declaring a strike alert. On Thursday,  the Podkarpacie Region, among others, is supposed to go on  strike, as well as the Cegielski Factory in Poznan. "Our  protest has been going on for months now. Employees may feel  tired already. The government adopted the tactics of ignoring  the protests. It pretends that nothing is happening.  Therefore, it is possible that a decision will be made  suspending the strikes until September. Sooner or later, because  of nonimplementation of our demands, there will be social  unrest. Then the union will resume the protest," stated Zak.  The union's spokesman also did not rule out the possibility  that "S" may suspend the protest action only after a one-day  nationwide strike and a several-thousand-people demonstration in  Warsaw.    Zak also stated that most of the KK Presidium members  believe  that representatives of "S" should not participate in the work  of the Trilateral Commission--"These talks will not yield  anything, and the government may say that it is trying to  implement demands."    Perhaps the Sixth National Congress of Delegates, scheduled  for late June, will be put off until the end of August and the  beginning of September. Zak explains that this is because the  protest action has decelerated organizational work. According  to other sources, "in the nearest months, the leadership of the  union wants to work out a strategy for fighting with the present  political configuration. Krzaklewski has often pointed out that  this fight is planned for months and years. Such important  decisions as those concerning a ruthless fight with the leftist  configuration must be made by the congress, not by the KK."    "S" decided to sue the government in the International Labor  Organization for violating convention No. 122. According to  "S," it is not effectively combating unemployment. A similar  complaint was filed by the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement in  1993; however, the union suspended it in January of this year.</p>

			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Justice Department filed its first housing discrimination suit on behalf of  the handicapped, accusing a Chicago suburb of illegally blocking construction  of a home for the mentally retarded. The suit, filed in federal court in  Chicago, charges the city of Chicago Heights, Ill., discriminated against the  handicapped and seeks to allow the construction of a home for 15 mentally  retarded adults. Last September, Congress amended the Fair Housing Act of 1968  to bar discrimination against the handicapped and families, and to allow the  government to collect damages for housing infractions. The Chicago Heights  dispute began in May when the City Council rejected a special permit  application from RFMS Inc., a Galesburg, Ill., company that specializes in  developing homes for the retarded.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Since March 1989, Haiphong municipality has helped  to resettle more than 20,000 Vietnamese repatriated from abroad.  Various international organizations have provided aid in kind  and cash to help these people. Thus far, more than $7 million  given by these organizations have been used to help them engage  in some type of trade.    The province has also used more than $4.5 million to carry  out more than 100 projects to help stabilize their daily life.  These include projects in vocational training, improving public  health, building schools, roads, bridges, and power stations;  and promoting fishery and handicraft production and so forth.    During the past five years, Haiphong has launched programs  to  provide jobs for local workers, including 4,000 repatriated  Vietnamese. The province's 25 vocational training centers have  trained more than 7,800 repatriatees or 90 percent of those in  the working age group. Many have been granted loans to set up  their own businesses and they are doing well.    Haiphong has also closely coordinated with international  organizations abroad and echelons and sectors at home to prevent  and finally stop illegal departures by Vietnamese. It has made  preparations to receive more repatriated Vietnamese and mapped  out plans to help them quickly stabilize their daily life and to  settle in with the local community.</p>

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Leading Article: A timorous Old Lady THE BANK of England, as portrayed in the Bingham report, has spent the last decade as the financial equivalent of the Wizard of Oz. Behind an impressive facade of masonry, tradition and legal powers lurks a cowering midget, uncertain of its strength and anxious, at all costs, to avoid putting it to the test. The history of the Bank's relationship with BCCI divides into three periods. First comes a phase when BCCI is newly established in the UK and the Bank is feeling its way as a newly-empowered banking supervisor. This period is characterised by a failure by the Bank to grasp that it has the duty to supervise BCCI directly under the 1979 banking act, rather than merely treating it as a UK branch of a foreign bank. Just as seriously, it fails to react to early signs of problems at BCCI, particularly the decision by Bank of America to withdraw as a shareholder. Until this point, the Bank has been placing great store in Bank of America's role. At around this time, also, the Bank learns of the scale of BCCI's exposure to the Gokal shipping empire. And it is aware of suspicions that BCCI has been financing the purchase of 'a considerable tranche of its own shares'. Yet it allows BCCI to obtain a deposit-taking licence in the UK. The second period is one of drift. Throughout the 1980s, the Bank is repeatedly told that there is something seriously wrong at BCCI and that the group's principal supervisor, the Luxembourg central bank, is unable to guarantee adequate supervision. There is a long internal debate inside the Bank about what to do. Papers are drafted, redrafted, submitted, discussed. Initiatives are started, falter, fail. Little of substance results. Real crisis Meanwhile, at BCCI there has been a real crisis: the treasury operation, which has been trading actively in financial instruments and commodities, has lost hundreds of millions of dollars. Some Bank officials think BCCI's managers are reckless (and therefore presumably not 'fit and proper persons' to be entrusted with the stewardship of a deposit-taking institution). Others think this is a bit strong - but, says Bingham, 'none thought the BCCI management had been other than seriously imprudent'. Yet they fail to seize the moment, tending 'to lose sight of their primary duty to protect the bank's UK depositors'. The third period - from the late 1980s to the bank's closure in the summer of 1991 - is the most frenzied. Price Waterhouse, by now BCCI's sole auditors, discovers bad banking on a breathtaking scale, and clear signs pointing towards management malpractice. At the same time, the Bank is receiving a number of other warnings, from people who should have been listened to. Throughout this period, information does not flow as it should within the Bank and between it and the outside world. At the last, revelation of the scale of BCCI's fraud comes as a terrible shock to officials within the Bank who should have been aware of it months before. Problem of culture The weaknesses Bingham describes are mainly a problem of culture. The report describes the Bank's officials as 'rather easily deterred'; they shy away from the risk of public criticism; they repeatedly make an 'inadequate supervisory response'; they are apparently more concerned about preserving the convention that 'the world attends on the Bank' than in visiting Abu Dhabi to meet BCCI's shareholders. The Bank, as an institution, on several occasions fails 'to measure up to the task'. Middle-level supervisors fail to pass information on to their seniors; their seniors fail to tell the Board of Banking Supervision - the apex of the Bank's supervisory structure - of vital warnings. The board itself asks the right questions, and at times tries to kick the machinery into more forceful action; yet because it is starved of information, it fails to enforce a change of course. One solution to a cultural problem is to change the people who embody the culture. The Bank's most senior executives have decided against personnel changes, which increases the need for a cultural transformation. Without it, the Bank's new legal and investigative units may well prove ineffective. The next governor, who will succeed Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton sometime next year, must be someone prepared to seize the Bank with both hands, and shake it soundly.</p>

Clinton had had quite a fruitful trip, yet naturally it  was not without unaccomplished tasks.    The further establishment of the loose relations between the  United States and its West European allies was the U.S.  President's first achievement. Since the cold war ended, with  the disbandment of the Warsaw Pact, the disintegration of the  the Soviet Union, and the changes in the balance of strength on  the European continent, West European nations' wish to run their  own business independently has been rising with each passing  day. At the NATO summit in Brussels on 10-11 January, the  United States "delegated power" and the summit approved that the  West European Union may, when necessary, use NATO's armaments to  execute actions without participation of the United States.  This decision suits the reality of West Europe today, so all  the member nations were very happy about it. To the United  States, this decision stabilizes relations across the Atlantic  Ocean and also safeguards U.S. interests.    The second achievement was the signing with Russia and  Ukraine a treaty on the destruction of all nuclear weapons in  Ukrainian territory. According to the treaty, Ukraine is to  destroy 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles and 1,500  nuclear heads deployed in its territory. Clinton felt relieved.  One should know that this was a thorn in the side of the United  States that it had always wanted to remove. Now they have done  it, at last.    The third achievement was the meeting with Syrian President  al- Asad in Geneva, Switzerland, in which he urged Syria to  reach an agreement with Israel on the Golan Heights. This  gesture was meant to show the world that the United States has  played a role in the peace process in the Middle East. Clinton  scored on diplomacy.    Of all the unaccomplished tasks, the most conspicuous one  was  how the "peaceful partnership" plan could be implemented. This  plan was put forward by the United States and approved at the  NATO summit. It was designed to slow down the pace of four  Central European nations, namely, Poland, Hungary, Czech, and  Slovakia, joining NATO and not to cause Russia to feel insecure  about the NATO's eastward expansion. The four Central European  nations thought the United States was not friendly enough and  was quite unhappy about it, though there was hardly anything  they could do. But ironically, there have been criticisms on  this plan from among NATO member states. German Chancellor Kohl  hinted that the future European Union may consider accepting  Central European countries first. French President Mitterrand  put it point-blank by emphasizing that the "peaceful  partnership" plan had not been put forward by France and France  rementioned the concept of a "Federation of European States,"  which is to include Central and East Europe nations. That this  plan has already caused such controversy since it was set forth  just a few days ago seems to indicate that greater fun is yet to  come!</p>

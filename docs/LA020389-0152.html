			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAWYER TO BE ANCHOR SUBSTITUTE FOR ABC  </P> <P> As part of her deal to come to ABC from CBS, Diane Sawyer will get to  substitute-anchor both "World News Tonight" and "Nightline," ABC News President  Roone Arledge said Thursday.  </P> <P> He emphasized, however, that she'll be concentrating on the main reason ABC  hired her -- co-anchoring with Sam Donaldson a new prime-time news series that  Arledge said probably will debut at the end of July or in early August.  </P> <P> "For the first couple of years, her interest is almost totally going to be on  this program," he said of the as-yet untitled series, to originate live from  New York. Plans call for it to air at 10 p.m. Thursdays.  </P> <P> "But yes, I've told her that we would love to have her substitute for Peter,"  he said, referring to anchor Peter Jennings of "World News Tonight," although  others also will fill in for Jennings. The same goes for her fill-in  appearances for Ted Koppel on "Nightline," he said.  </P> <P> Asked if she wanted to fill in on both programs, he replied, "yes, very much  so."  </P> <P> Arledge spoke in an interview a day after Sawyer, who had been with CBS News  since 1978 and with the high-rated "60 Minutes" for more than four years,  signed a five-year ABC contract that reportedly will pay her close to $1.5  million annually.  </P> <P> Sawyer, 43, remained unavailable for comment. She was said to be finishing work  Thursday on a "60 Minutes" story.  </P> <P> Sawyer's defection was one of the most publicized correspondent shifts in  network news since Barbara Walters left NBC and the "Today" show in 1976 to  join ABC. In that deal, Walters got to break into the formerly men-only club of  network evening news anchors when teamed with Harry Reasoner, who had left CBS,  on ABC's weeknight newscasts.  </P> <P> That union, put together before Arledge took the helm at ABC News, never caught  on. Reasoner returned to CBS, where he is now a "60 Minutes" regular; Walters  now co-anchors ABC's successful "20/20" newsmagazine.  </P> <P> The idea of Sawyer becoming a permanent evening news co-anchor on ABC "has  never been a topic of discussion" during negotiations, according to a source  close to the deal.  </P> <P> The talks finally concluded Wednesday afternoon when Sawyer respectfully  rebuffed CBS' high-level pleas to stay and signed with ABC.  </P> <P> On the same day, Donaldson signed his own new contract with ABC News.  </P> <P> The former White House correspondent said from Washington Thursday that the new  prime-time program's format hasn't been fully hammered out.  </P> <P> But Donaldson said he anticipates that he and Sawyer will co-anchor it together  from the same locale, whether in New York or on those occasions the program  originates from other cities in the United States and overseas.  </P> <P> According to Arledge, the new series has a commitment of at least two years  from the brass at Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., no matter what its ratings are.  </P> <P> CBS has not said whether Sawyer will be replaced at "60 Minutes." There has  been speculation, however, that Jane Wallace, the blunt, salty former "West  57th" correspondent, may be asked to give it a shot.  </P> <P> Wallace, who left CBS News last year, last Friday hosted a CBS Entertainment  special, "People Magazine on TV." Her contract with Current Trends, the company  that produced it, has expired, a spokeswoman for the company said.  </P> <P> Wallace, who now lives in Miami, according to the spokeswoman, was not  available for comment.  </P></p>

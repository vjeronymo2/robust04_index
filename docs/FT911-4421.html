			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Tie Rack throttled by US side TIE RACK, the specialist retailer, is moving to tighten its grip on its loss-making US operations in the face of a plunge in pre-tax profits. In the 53 weeks to February 3, profits tumbled to Pounds 51,000 compared with Pounds 1.76m for the previous 52 weeks. Turnover was down 8 per cent to Pounds 53.8m (Pounds 58.6m) while operating profits fell 36 per cent to Pounds 2.06m (Pounds 3.22m). The reorganisation of the US operations, where operating losses increased to Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 1.19m), is aimed at bringing it directly under UK supervision in the hope that this will help stem the losses there and improve overall profitability. Commenting on the results, Mr Roy Bishko, the chairman who led Tie Rack's rapid expansion in the late 1980s, admitted that the group had over-extended itself after going public. In most of its main markets it was faced with sluggish consumer activity. The difficulties of its US operations, which have been in loss for the three years that the group has been in that market, were exacerbated by local management problems and the weak dollar. The group is closing its US warehouse, handling distribution directly from the UK and bringing the US shops under direct UK control. Administration is being merged with the Canadian operation. UK business was also hurt by the economic downturn and the impact of the Gulf war, which reduced sales volume at airport shops by 20 per cent in the first months of this year. Turnover in the UK declined to Pounds 33.69m (Pounds 36.37m) and operating profits fell to Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 4.24m). In the UK the company was further plagued by problems with certain franchisees. The lower profits figure included an exceptional item of Pounds 444,000 relating to debts of its franchisees. The group has had to terminate its contracts with eight franchisees where trading had deteriorated to the extent that payments for stocks were not being made. Buoyant business in France helped European turnover rise to Pounds 4.72m (Pounds 4.5m). Operating profit, however, fell to Pounds 1.22m (Pounds 1.26m). The group has made efforts to control costs and cash by reducing borrowings by 23 per cent to Pounds 6.3m, capital expenditure by 77 per cent to Pounds 900,000 and stock holdings by 17 per cent to Pounds 10.8m. Losses per share were 1.88p (2.42p earnings). The final dividend is passed (0.285p), making nil (0.75p) for the year.</p>

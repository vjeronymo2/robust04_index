			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON DIETITIANS  </P> <P> I agreed with all but one word of Lee Dembart's review of the Ralph W. Moss  book, "The Cancer Industry: Unravelling the Politics" (June 5). That single,  inaccurate word was "dietitians," being used so out of context in association  with Laetrilists, vitamin advocates and believers in the power of positive  thinking.  </P> <P> Perhaps Dembart meant "nutritionists," a word that has no legal meaning.  Anyone, including health food store clerks, Nutri-System counselors, sports  trainers, Herbalife distributors or even your grandmother, can call themselves  a nutritionist.  </P> <P> The word "dietitian" is protected by the Title Act under the California  Business and Professions Code to refer only to Registered Dietitians (R.D.).  R.D.'s are recognized by the medical profession as the legitimate providers of  nutrition care. We have a minimum of four years of specialized study, including  a bachelor's degree at an accredited college or university, extensive work  experience, a national board exam and continuing education requirements.  </P> <P> Registered dietitians work in settings such as hospitals, wellness centers,  corporate food management systems and health departments, and many are in  private practice. If you, as a cancer patient, were referred to a R.D., you  would get a practical, scientifically sound, individualized plan for how to  deal with such common cancer treatment-related problems as loss of appetite and  weight, nausea, taste abnormalities, malabsorption, diarrhea, difficulty  swallowing and so on. You would not be sold vitamin megadoses or Laetrile.  </P> <P> TERESA HILLEARY  </P> <P> Registered Dietitian  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

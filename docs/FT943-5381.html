			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Kohl under fire as SPD tries to close poll gap: German election battle intensifies Germany's Social Democratic party opposition leaders yesterday launched a direct assault on the central pillar of the ruling coalition's election campaign - Chancellor Helmut Kohl himself. Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD leader, and Mr Helmut Schmidt, the party's elder statesman, denounced Mr Kohl as the chancellor of missed opportunities and a destroyer of jobs. Mr Scharping characterised him as an insecure autocrat who listened neither to the electorate nor to his own party. As a result, there was nothing behind Mr Kohl but 'a giant black hole', he told an SPD campaign gathering in Dortmund. 'You can see the insecurity in his eyes,' he said. Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union was 'burnt out' and he was trying in vain to conceal the fact. In the four years since unification he had frittered away the opportunities for economic, social and cultural unity in Germany, Mr Scharping added. Mr Schmidt, who was displaced as Chancellor by Mr Kohl in 1982, blamed him directly for the 'unconsidered actions' which had led to the loss of almost half the jobs in the former East Germany. This was not a consequence of mismanagement by the former communist authorities, but a personal failure by Mr Kohl himself and his lack of economic judgment, Mr Schmidt claimed. The SPD, which currently lags behind the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, in the opinion polls, last week started its campaign to undermine Mr Kohl's personal standing with the unveiling of a three-man electioneering vanguard. The tactical intention to persuade voters to weigh the alleged failings of one man - Mr Kohl is still seen as an unsatisfactory chancellor by half the population - against the strength in depth of the SPD emerged clearly yesterday in Mr Scharping's unusually vigorous and confident presentation. He brushed aside charges, central to the CDU's opening attack, that the SPD was prepared to govern in an unwritten alliance with the Party of Social Democracy (PDS) and so allow the former east German communists a say in running the country. This was an insult to the intelligence of the people, he said, and he attempted to turn Mr Kohl's weapon on himself with accusations that the CDU had former communists in its own ranks. However, weekend comments by Mr Jens Reich, one of Mr Scharping's advisers on east Germany, to the effect that he could imagine a minority coalition of SPD and Greens ruling with alternating support from the CDU and the PDS seem to ensure further exploitation of the issue by Mr Kohl and his allies. With promises of economic and social justice and warnings that the electorate should not be intimidated by the 'German Berlusconis' among television and newspaper proprietors supporting Mr Kohl, Mr Scharping's speech concluded the rituals preceding the campaign-proper leading to the election, on October 16. All the major parties have now set up their stalls, and as the so-called 'hot phase' of the campaign gets under way, personal attacks and a sharp focus on almost exclusively internal issues seem certain to dominate the early stages. Foreign policy - especially the future of the European Union - has played little role so far. Mr Scharping's speech yesterday, for example, contained no direct references to foreign affairs, where the SPD lacks experience and convincing ministerial candidates. However, possible strife within the current coalition's ranks may present opportunities to be exploited by the SPD. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the Free Democrat foreign minister, is understood to have been angered by a CDU/CSU discussion paper published last week, which proposed a Europe of 'variable geometry' built around a core comprising Germany, France and the Benelux countries. Mr Kinkel is concerned that the paper could upset the ratification procedures in countries applying for EU membership, notably Austria.</p>

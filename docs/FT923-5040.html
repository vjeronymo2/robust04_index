			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Nalgo request on strike refused NALGO, the local government union, yesterday failed in an effort to suspend a High Court judge's order to call off a strike involving 1,100 staff at Newham council in London, Lisa Wood writes. The Court of Appeal refused the union's plea for a stay pending the hearing of its appeal against a court order that the strike must end immediately. The court rejected Nalgo's argument that the industrial action in response to redundancies in the Labour council's poll-tax collection department should be allowed to continue because calling it off now would make the union's appeal pointless. The appeal is due to be heard next week.</p>

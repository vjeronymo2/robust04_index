			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> A PERSONAL APPROACH PAYS OFF AS CANDIDATES TAKE TO THE STREETS  </P> <P> In the day of catchy television ads and slick campaign mailers, successful  candidates in Ventura County have returned to the age-old technique of knocking  on doors to woo voters.  </P> <P> In last week's election, candidates discovered, and in some cases rediscovered,  that their personal commitment to present themselves on the voters' doorsteps  provided the winning margin.  </P> <P> Going door-to-door "was absolutely the critical edge," said Maria VanderKolk, a  political novice who defeated Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer in an astounding  upset.  </P> <P> VanderKolk and about 75 volunteers mostly from the environmental group Save  Open Space knocked on thousands of doors in neighborhoods concerned about the  impact of large developments proposed nearby.  </P> <P> Schaefer, a veteran officeholder, said she underestimated her competition. She  stayed home and lost by 102 votes.  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) faced the toughest challenge of her  political career on Tuesday. Her opponent, Hunt Braly, hammered her with  charges that she misused her office by trying to get authorities to fix her  daughter's driving tickets.  </P> <P> But Wright spent the last six weekends leading teams of volunteers canvassing  neighborhoods in her district of 210,000 registered voters that stretches from  Santa Clarita to Lompoc. She handily won reelection in a race she could have  easily lost.  </P> <P> "There's nothing quite like it," Wright said. "I think people want to know you  are a person, not just a name they read in the newspaper."  </P> <P> To be sure, door-to-door campaigning is nothing new. But political consultants  see a resurgence of shoe-leather campaigning, particularly in areas such as  Ventura County that have no television station of their own and no dominant  radio station, newspaper or other central way to broadcast a candidate's  message.  </P> <P> "There definitely is a return to knocking on doors," said John Davies, a Santa  Barbara political consultant who has run several campaigns in Ventura County.  "More and more candidates are seeing that the most effective way to campaign is  face to face."  </P> <P> Two years ago, Davies persuaded Oxnard Mayor Nao Takasugi to hit the streets.  Takasugi lost 15 pounds walking precincts four hours every day for four months.  "That was the most vigorous workout I've had," Takasugi said. "And it paid off  well."  </P> <P> In the evolution of political campaigns, many candidates have grown to rely on  letters and brochures designed and mailed to narrowly targeted groups of  voters. But direct-mail campaigns have become less effective in recent years,  consultants say.  </P> <P> One reason is that campaign brochures are getting lost in a sea of other junk  mail. Another is that voters have become jaded to accusations in hit mail and  flyers that try to exploit emotional issues.  </P> <P> "When a fresh face knocks on your door and hands you a brochure, that is a  tremendously positive statement about a campaign," said Kevin Sweeney, public  affairs director for Patagonia, the outdoor clothing manufacturer in Ventura.  "If someone with a friendly voice says, 'Please read this,' you read it."  </P> <P> Sweeney got his start in politics by helping former U.S. Sen. Gary Hart of  Colorado organize volunteers to walk the precincts of every major city in Iowa  just before the 1984 Democratic presidential contest. It was the first time a  presidential campaign attempted such a feat.  </P> <P> Last fall, he drew on that experience to assist a slow-growth citizens group  assemble 80 volunteers to go to the homes of 18,000 voters who were likely to  vote in Ventura's municipal election. Three of the group's four candidates were  swept into office in an election that became a referendum on the city's growth  patterns.  </P> <P> "Walking works," Sweeney said. "If I was running a campaign and had absolute  assurance I could raise $35,000, or have only $3,000 and 100 volunteers for  three consecutive Saturdays, I would choose the latter and win by a landslide."  </P> <P> On his own time, Sweeney advised VanderKolk and Save Open Space how to mount a  door-to-door effort. "I talked a lot with them about canvassing," he said. "It  looks like it paid off."  </P> <P> Some neighborhoods, particularly those in Simi Valley, saw many candidates and  volunteers roaming the streets close to the election.  </P> <P> Making the rounds in one precinct last weekend, Wright crossed paths with a  volunteer working for her opponent. "Hi, Cathie," said Sheila Holt, a Braly  volunteer, walking down a driveway as Wright was walking up.  </P> <P> "I'm sure glad I was one step ahead of her," Holt told a reporter.  </P> <P> "No," Wright said later. "She should want to come behind me, so I can't turn  the voter around. People are more impressed when candidates themselves go to  their door."  </P> <P> Bill Davis and Vicky Howard, the top vote-getters in another county supervisor  seat, also went door-to-door in Simi Valley, the hub of the 4th Supervisorial  District.  </P> <P> "I wish there had been more time to go out and walk," said Davis, who faces  Howard in a runoff election in November. He said he knocked on 600 doors before  the June 5 primary and plans to personally visit 20,000 houses in the five  months before the November runoff.  </P> <P> That may be a bit ambitious for one person. But with today's computerized  voting lists, candidates are able to canvass much larger districts.  </P> <P> For example, candidate Mike McConnell, a construction manager from Ventura,  spent every spare moment since Feb. 18 walking precincts in the 19th  Congressional District that straddles Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. He  figures he knocked on more than 6,600 doors.  </P> <P> For a political unknown with virtually no money and no endorsements, he made an  impressive showing, winning 35% of the vote in the Democratic primary. He lost  to Anita Perez Ferguson, a former aide to state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa  Barbara) who will challenge Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) in the  November election.  </P> <P> "He learned that 6,500 doors was not enough," Davies said. "But he was on the  right track."  </P> <P> Political campaigns now use computers to pre-sort voters, eliminating the need  to knock on every door. Most campaigns only target "high-propensity" voters who  are likely to vote in the upcoming election and those who can be won over by  the particular candidate -- saving a great deal of legwork.  </P> <P> Campaigns can purchase computerized lists of voters from the county registrar  of voters and from a whole industry of voter-contact services.  </P> <P> "They seem to be quite sophisticated," said Ruth Schepler, the county's  assistant registrar of voters. A few years ago, she said, "they didn't speak  our language or the computer's language. Now they ask for specific computer  batch jobs."  </P> <P> Mark Q. Thompson, Wright's campaign manager, is one of those political  consultants who has learned to skillfully develop voter lists.  </P> <P> He said he purchased a computerized list from the county and then added  information about each high-propensity voter from interviews with voters over  the phone. Before the election, he said, the campaign had reached Wright  supporters and undecided Republican voters at least four times.  </P> <P> Drawing on longtime Wright loyalists, party regulars and a Simi Valley gun  owners' rights group, he brought together a hard-core group of about 40  volunteers with occasional help from an additional 150 people to canvass  precincts in person. "It is an essential ingredient to go door-to-door," he  said. "Cathie was on her way out."  </P> <P> Davies said going door-to-door doesn't always work. "Sometimes it can hurt you,  if you have a lousy personality," Davies said. "If you have a caustic  personality, you can come across better on TV or slick-looking mailers."  </P> <P> Nor does everyone believe in walking precincts. Schaefer said she isn't so sure  it helped her win the supervisor's job four years ago. She said she often found  nobody at home when she knocked on doors in 1986. Sometimes, she said, voters  grew irritated when she disturbed them at dinner time.  </P> <P> "I just wanted to run on my record," Schaefer said. "Maybe that was a mistake."  </P></p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Letter: Economic objective admirable, but argument is faulty Sir, I agreed with your editorial 'Filling in the policy gaps' (October 9). You rightly criticised the chancellor's speech at the Conservative party conference for being economically thin. But I must accuse you of the same fault in one vital respect. You said and I paraphrase slightly in the interest of brevity - 'the competitive gains for devaluation will only be maintained if pay settlements average no more than 2 per cent'. I agree completely. You go on to say that, if they do, the authorities may need to tighten policy. But how, how, how do we do this effectively? As you say, after two years of recession and tight monetary policy, average earnings are still rising at 6 per cent per annum. This tight policy may well have terminally and disastrously ruined Britain's productive capability and yet still wages go on rising. And I bet that if prosperity by some miracle returned tomorrow, vastly inflationary wage claims would leap into place the day after. Please, therefore, tell me what we should do to fulfil your admirable first criterion without entailing the ruination of British productive capacity.

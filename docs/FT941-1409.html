			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Trainmaker to cut 700 jobs Nearly 700 jobs are to go at ABB Transportation, the Derby-based manufacturer of railway rolling stock, the company said yesterday. It warned that a further 600 job cuts may be necessary. The first round of redundancies follows completion of a contract to modify diesel trains for British Rail Regional Railways and the running down of work on an order for London Underground's Central Line. A second round will be necessary if ABB fails to win an order for 100 Northern Line trains. London Underground, along with Conservative and Labour MPs and a consortium of London businesses, have urged the Treasury to allow the Pounds 740m Northern Line contract to go ahead as part of the government's private finance initiative. The Treasury has said that the project does not meet its requirements for the transfer of risk to the private sector. Mr Bo Sodersten, ABB chief executive, said: 'It is desperately disappointing for the company to be in this position. We are doing everything we can to secure orders.' ABB, formerly British Rail Engineering, is part of the Swiss/Swedish Asea Brown Boveri Group. It employs 5,400 people in Derby, Crewe and York. A total of 2,500 work at Derby - the works which will be hit by the 700 redundancies and the 600 possible job losses. ABB yesterday announced a 1993 pre-tax loss of Pounds 9.8m on turnover of Pounds 518m from UK business. The losses include Pounds 12.4m to meet redundancy and other restructuring costs. Mr Wilf Proudfoot of the RMT transport union, said: 'It takes a special kind of incompetence to eliminate skilled manufacturing jobs when years of work rebuilding our railways is available.' Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, said the redundancies were 'a direct result of rail privatisation'.</p>

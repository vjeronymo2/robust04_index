			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / 'The economy, stupid' Britain seems set for a return to its customary grade B level of peacetime government, since the chances are that Mr John Major's administration will make a recovery of sorts. We can therefore look forward to the prime minister sitting in Number 10 Downing Street, the puppet of events, taking what comes as he serves out the five-year term of office to which the Conservatives were elected in April. This is not an especially gloomy view. Mr Major displayed grade A toughness during the Gulf war, the Maastricht negotiations and the election campaign. He still has it in him to resume the role of a popular prime minister, possibly by design, but perhaps by accident. The government's management of the economy is so fumble-fingered that it might inadvertently ignite the spark that leads to an explosive boom and dishes Labour for a fifth time. That would turn Lady Thatcher's successor into a second Tory hero. The unfortunate little difficulties of September and October 1992 would be forgotten. We could worry about the consequent recession some years later. Any prognostication, even the conventional one outlined above, is risky when what is actually taking place in the world of politics is so far outside the range of a decent fiction writer's invention. When a chancellor can stay in office after changing interest rates three times in a day and then insulting the president of the Bundesbank while trying to apologise to him, anything can happen. Mr Major could be turfed out quite suddenly, perhaps as a knock-on consequence of an eruption of ill-feeling at this week's Conservative conference in Brighton, or possibly at the hands of the backbenchers' 1922 committee, or maybe following a shamingly large rebels' vote (if there is one) when he brings the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty back before the House of Commons. The odds are, however, against any such nightmare coming true. The ability of Tory managers to anaesthetise those who show the slightest sign of revolt is well-known. There will be bile at this conference, to be sure - but will there be arsenic? Again, when parliament resumes, backbenchers will not want to barrack a prime minister who led their party to victory against such seemingly high odds so short a while ago, especially when they know they are unlikely to unite behind any conceivable successor. They might get Mr Michael Heseltine, or Mr Kenneth Clarke. Both are more solidly pro-Europe than Mr Major. The Maastricht vote is hard to call, but it would be in character for most of the so-called rebels to come to heel and march through the 'yes' lobby on the whips' orders. If not, a quick vote of confidence could set the government on its feet again. I would be more certain of this line of argument, so reassuring for those who want to stay in office, were it not for the absence of an economic policy. Getting one in place must now be the priority. As the Clinton managers have it, on a poster on their office wall, the answer to all questions about what is important in the US election campaign is 'the economy, stupid'. The same applies to Mr Major's resurrection campaign. True, he did himself some good last Thursday. He intimated that he will face out the rebels within his party and fight to get the Maastricht bill through. He thus began to pick up the pieces of his policy for Europe. Sadly, that display of political courage had nothing to tell us about 'the economy, stupid'. By yesterday the hopes of last week had been submerged by the sinking pound. This has been accompanied by a sinking feeling in the markets, and the country at large - a perception that the government does not know which economic policy to adopt and, worse, that when it does make up its mind it may be as wrong as ever. Should interest rates be slashed, or kept close to 9 per cent in what would probably be a vain attempt to prevent further devaluation? Would it make any difference, either way? Will public spending be controlled, or taxes increased, or neither, or both? What difference will any of these moves make to the growth rate? As always, economists differ on these points. It is the government's job to hire the best economists and look to their advice. The verdict of public opinion is that it is not doing either part of that job. Mr Major has evidently been more concerned to protect himself from the political dangers inherent in reshuffling his chancellor than he is to restore confidence in the government's management of the economy. Anyway, it is not possible to place much faith in the promise of any particular minister. The prime minister's simple pronouncement that bearing down on inflation is still the government's policy is meaningless. It does not in itself answer any of the questions listed above. He, or his chancellor, must do better. For it is hard to recall a time when, according to what people are saying about it, the public has had less confidence in the government than it does today.</p>

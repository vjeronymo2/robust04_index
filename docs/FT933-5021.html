			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Arts: Today's Television With television it never rains but it pours. You can go months without any sort of experimental programmes and then, within 24 hours, find three new series starting. Screenplay Firsts is BBC2's slot for new short dramas 'united by a commitment to innovation, topicality and the development of new television talent'. This year eight new films are being shown, from Britain, the US and Germany, starting today with a double bill. 'Schwarzfahrer' (Fare Dodger) is about a racist old lady sitting next to a black youth on a bus, and 'The Burden' portrays an exiled Polish musician who finds himself back with bureaucracy when he befriends a young child in a park. Channel 4 begins Midnight Underground (12.20), a season of 'classic experimental' films, which sounds like an oxymoron, but as the series includes work by people such as Bunuel and Man Ray you see what they mean. There are four films tonight, all on alternative spirit worlds, including Kenneth Anger's 'Inauguration Of The Pleasure Dome'. Tomorrow BBC2 begins a new series of 10 x 10, a showcase for short programmes by new directors.</p>

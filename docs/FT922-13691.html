			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Arts: Reflected Glory If you dislike the election result or are simply looking for a pleasant evening, here is a fine diversion. Ronald Harwood's Reflected Glory is the definition of a middlebrow play: not unduly demanding, but clever enough to make you laugh, admire the invention and even be puzzled by the ending. It also has Albert Finney back on the West End stage, where he last appeared, in another play by Harwood, in 1989. Finney plays Alfred, elder brother to Michael (Stephen Moore). Alfred is a restaurant owner, Michael a playwright. When young, they often quarrelled, not least when playing tennis, but usually made it up with a joint rendering of 'Me and My Shadow', with a kind of Fred Astaire dancing to go with it. Their estrangement began when their father divided his will unequally: Pounds 40,000 to Michael because he would need it as an artist, and only Pounds 20,000 to Alfred because his restaurant would be expected to pay for itself. The real trouble between the brothers, however, is that Michael keeps writing plays about the family, which Alfred regards as an intrusion on his private life. Sometimes he takes out an injunction to stop them. After 10 years of not seeing each other, Michael is seeking a reconciliation because his latest play Brother Mine, as distinct from his earlier Family Matters, is not about the family in general, but about the relationship between the brothers. That is the essence of it. Alfred is tempted automatically to injunct: his lawyer is conveniently at hand, being the lover of Michael's theatrical agent. He agrees to see a private viewing before the play is launched. The performance leads to a stream of pleasing theatrical in-jokes. This not a huge part for Finney. For about quarter of an hour in the second act, he simply sits at the side watching the rehearsal, consulting his lawyer and taking notes. From time to time he interrupts, objecting for instance that the actor playing him is left-handed with insufficient swing to his backhand. All that is very jolly. Alfred, however, is not a complete philistine. He rather takes to the actors, especially when he recognises one of them as the man who plays the pirate in the Planters' Rum in the commercial. The action takes place in a fringe theatre known as the Acropolis, which Alfred says reminds him of a Greek taverna. The direction is by Elijah Moshinsky and you would have to be in a grim mood not to like it. At the Vaudeville Theatre Box Office 071 836 9987</p>

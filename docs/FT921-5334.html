			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Thought for paws as Lib Dems enter election dogfight LET'S HOPE it is April 9. Conclusive evidence emerged yesterday that Britain's political parties have run out of things to say in their long pre-election phoney war. As Messrs Kinnock and Major engaged in their twice-weekly Commons dogfight, the Liberal Democrats solemnly unveiled 'A Pet is for Life', a policy document which crowed that they were 'the first party to formulate a policy for pets'. This bid for the potentially crucial canine and feline vote includes a 'pets' equivalent to the MOT certificate', to be free at the point of sale, and an Animal Protection Commission to enforce and recommend changes to legislation. Mr Simon Hughes, the party's fresh-faced proponent of good causes, has high hopes of getting such a commission on to the agenda if the Liberal Democrats become involved in post-election coalition talks. Yesterday's policy document covered 'an extremely important subject indeed', Mr Hughes said, struggling in vain to keep a straight face and fooling nobody. The Protection of Animals Act of 1911, on which much of the law is still based, was, after all, 'a piece of Liberal legislation'. As he proceeded with his supporting address to a thinly attended press conference, we learnt among other fascinating tit-bits that the Liberal Democrat environment spokesman used to prosecute on behalf of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. He also 'came from a home that had dogs, pigeons and mice', once owning a rodent named Priscilla. Disappointingly bereft of furry or feathered props, the honourable member for Southwark and Bermondsey went on to pledge stringent Liberal Democrat restrictions on 'tail-docking, ear-cropping and other cosmetic mutilations'. Nobody under the age of 16 should be able to buy animals from pet shops, he proposed. Compulsory registration of dogs and their owners should be introduced. As he rabbited on, a dog-eared poster of party leader Mr Paddy Ashdown gazed down approvingly on the proceedings. I took my leave as an earnest discussion of the 'microchip method' of dog identification started with a doggy trade journalist. Lib Dems call for poll tax 'loan', Page 9</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Bank chief backs move to cut EC currency role: Governor rejects exchange rate controls MR Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, yesterday threw his weight behind UK government efforts to scale down the European Community's ambitions in economic and monetary co-operation. Europe, he said, could return to currency stability through relatively modest arrangements organised by individual countries aimed at keeping inflation low. Mr George also rejected suggestions by Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission's president, that the continent should reintroduce exchange rate controls to curb the huge currency flows that precipitated a succession of ERM crises in the past year. The governor's comments in a speech in London mark an attempt to fill the policy vacuum in European monetary affairs after last month's virtual collapse of the exchange rate mechanism. Addressing the American Chamber of Commerce, Mr George indicated that other European nations could emulate Britain by introducing domestic inflation targets in place of fixed exchange-rate linkages. He was speaking as news emerged of a big narrowing of the UK's trade deficit with non-EC countries since Britain left the ERM a year ago. Mr George said any new monetary arrangements devised in the wake of last month's ERM debacle would have to allow 'each country to pursue (its) stability objective in its own way, taking account of its national circumstances'. The governor's remarks reflect the widespread scepticism across Europe that the continent is ready for any imminent return to the old 'hard' version of the ERM based on keeping currencies closely tied to the D-Mark. While national inflation targets would provide clear benchmarks for national policy, he suggested Europe could retain a semblance of monetary co-operation by monitoring these targets across the continent. Mr George appears to think that the European Monetary Institute - a body to be set up next year in place of the existing committee of EC central bank governors - could take on this job. He said 'an explicit commitment to achieve price stability in the medium term' across Europe would gradually help in the important goal of reducing big exchange rate movements among European currencies. Currency stability was vital in the long term since without this free trade would be impeded. However it was important to bring down inflation across the continent well before any effort to reintroduce the original form of the ERM, which was dramatically modified last month by allowing currencies to fluctuate by wide 15 per cent margins, rather than the old 2.25 per cent limits.</p>

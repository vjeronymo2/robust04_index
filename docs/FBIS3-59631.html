			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by IBO: "Billions for Large Projects"] </F>   [Text] In the new laender and Berlin (East) 66,909 areas  suspected of being polluted have been found so far (as of August  1993). Then there are another 4,394 areas suspected of military  and weapon pollution. These figures have been reported by the  Federal Environment Agency in Berlin.    With the "Administrative Agreement on the Regulation of  Ecological Pollution" (Administrative Act on Pollution  Financing, Federal Gazette No 58, 25 March 1993, p 2842), the  Federal Government and the new laender have agreed to share the  costs. This agreement ties in with the exemption clause in the  Environment Law. According to it, the responsible land  authorities in eastern Germany may exempt investors from  liability for already existing pollution. In all, more than  60,000 such exemption applications have been submitted, but  until now only a fraction of them have been decided.    For the exemptions which receive a favorable decision the  administrative agreement provides that the Trust Agency and the  land, with commensurate participation by the buyer (at least 10  percent), share the costs at a ratio of 60:40. This regulation  applies to existing Trust Agency businesses or those privatized  after 1 January 1992.    For the so-called large projects, the cost sharing is 75:25.  For the Large Brown Coal Cleanup Project the financial basis was  set at DM 1.5 billion annually until 1998. For the Large  Chemical Project, with the individual projects Buna AG,  Leuna-Werke, Filmfabrik Wolfen, Chemie AG Bitterfeld and  Hydrierwerk Zeitz, about DM 2.3 billion must be anticipated,  according to present estimates.    For another 14 large projects agreed on by the Trust Agency  and the laender, a funding requirement of about DM 100 million,  respectively, is assumed. These projects are:        -  Berlin: The region of the Spree Industrial Area  (Adlershof, Rummelsburg, Ober- and Niederschoeneweide,  Johannisthal sectors)    -  Brandenburg: The Kreis Oranienburg region (Hennigsdorf,  Velten,  Birkenwerder, Oranienburg, Hennigsdorf Business Park sectors)    -  Mecklenburg-West Pomerania: Neptun-Warnow-Werft Rostock, MTW  Schiffswerft Wismar    -  Saxony: Saxonia AG Freiberg, Olefinwerke AG  Boehlen-Lippendorf,  Lautawerk GmbH    -  Saxony-Anhalt: Erdoel/Erdgas-Gommern GmbH  (Salzwedel/Peckensen  development region), Mansfeld AG (Rohuette Helbra, copper-silver  mine), Magdeburg Rothensee region)    -  Thuringia: Kali-Werra AG (Merkers), Kali-Suedharz AG  (Sondershausen, Bleicherode, Sollstedt, Bischofferode), Rositz  Administration and Third-Party Rights Exploitation  Association.       In addition to these billion-mark sums, the federal  government is providing another DM 13 billion for accident  prevention measures in the region of the Wismut enterprises.</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLIPPERS CAN'T SHAKE PAST IN LOSS TO WARRIORS  </P> <P> The inverted Pacific Division flipped Tuesday night when the teams seemed to  return to their rightful places.  </P> <P> The Golden State Warriors, shooting 39.4% through two dreadful performances,  were revived in time to appease some anxious fans and a stressed-out coach. The  Clippers, who seemed so full of life opening the season, went flat.  </P> <P> The result was a 118-94 victory for the Warriors in front of 15,025 at the  Oakland Coliseum Arena.  </P> <P> Playing without injured Charles Smith and with Joe Wolf again getting three  fouls in the first quarter, the Clippers went much of the way without two  starters. That might explain why they had trouble inside against a team  suddenly deep in 7-footers -- Uwe Blab and Alton Lister being off-season  additions to complement Manute Bol. But that does nothing to explain 27  turnovers or 40% shooting.  </P> <P> The Warriors, who built a big lead and cruised for most of the second half, did  everything they were unable to do on the season's first weekend. The Clippers,  who never got into much of an offensive flow, served as outlets to Golden  State's frustration.  </P> <P> "They defensed us very well," Clipper Coach Don Casey said. "They took us out  of a lot of stuff, and we're not very good at improvising right now."  </P> <P> The Warriors, who lost Lister for at least six weeks, and perhaps the season,  with a torn right Achilles' tendon in the third quarter, also made it tough for  the Clippers with solid shooting. A 58.7% performance from the field turned out  to be a good defense.  </P> <P> "We couldn't run," guard Gary Grant said. "We're never going to run if we  always have to take the ball out of the net."  </P> <P> The Golden State reputation, shaky after blowout losses to open the season,  regained its footing, as Chris Mullin made 12 of 18 shots for 32 points and  Mitch Richmond added 21. The highest-scoring tandem in the league of 1988-89  made like old times.  </P> <P> So, too, did Michael Young. The 1984 first-round draft choice of the Boston  Celtics who floated around the NBA and Continental Basketball Assn. since, has  been a surprise so far. He had 19 points off the bench in the opener and 24  points and 14 rebounds as a starter Tuesday.  </P> <P> At least for appearances, this was an important game for the Warriors. A  similar showing against the Clippers could have sent a few people reaching for  the life rafts.  </P> <P> Golden State, after all, gave up 136 points in a season-opening loss to Phoenix  and 132 in the home opener against Houston. To put that start in perspective,  the Clippers, the league's third-worst defensive team team last season, gave up  132 points or more six times in regulation games in all 1988-89.  </P> <P> "It was awful," Warrior Coach Don Nelson said after beating the Clippers for  the sixth consecutive time at home. "I got into a mood like when I was at  Milwaukee that now we've arrived and we could automatically add five or eight  more wins and, 'Wouldn't it be wonderful to play like this all the time?' But  that's not fair to this team. We've got a lot of good pieces, but they're not  together yet."  </P> <P> This was no time to panic, however. Not with the Clippers in town.  </P> <P> The same team that had an emotional victory in its season opener showed little  carry-over. Then again, the Clippers showed little of anything, particularly in  the first half.  </P> <P> The Golden State lead reached double figures with 10:52 to play in the half,  34-24. After a 14-2 run over 4:04 of the second quarter, it was 18, 44-26 and,  finally, 21 points, 55-34, on Richmond's layup with 3:13 remaining. By  halftime, the Clippers trailed, 57-38.  </P> <P> The Clippers shot only 38.6% in the first half; the Warriors, 58.3%. Los  Angeles shot 40% for the game.  </P> <P> The Clippers' early offense, came from Ken Norman, a likely source, and Young.  Norman, who plays some of his best games against Golden State, had 14 points,  and Young had 13. The other nine who played combined for 11 first-half points.  </P> <P> Things continued at that pace the rest of the way. The Warriors had passed an  unexpectedly critical test, but how much had they improved?  </P> <P> Nelson saw great improvement.  </P> <P> Casey saw lots of problems.  </P> <P> "If we dig ourselves a hole, it's not easy to dig back out . . . particularly  against a team like this who has five little guys who are difficult to trap,"  Casey said. "It had all the markings of a 30-, 40-, 50-point game."  </P> <P> In that sense, at least, they got off easy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clipper Notes  </P> <P> Just when his left wrist was finally healing, Ken Norman injured his right hand  during a fall in the second half of the season opener against Houston. The  Clippers' leading scorer last season said the second injury hasn't bothered him  much in practices, even though it is his shooting hand. "I'm just thankful  there was no game from Friday until now," he said. . . . Golden State's Marques  Johnson, who made his first regular-season appearance against his former team,  said there is no special motivation playing the Clippers. He had a drawn-out  legal battle with the Clippers over compensation from a neck injury suffered  when he bumped into Benoit Benjamin. "It was more so in the first exhibition  game," said Johnson, who made the Warriors as a free agent. "Getting there (the  Sports Arena) and rehashing that collision when I ran into Benoit. But now it's  just a matter of going out to try and win."  </P> <P> Tim Hardaway, the Warriors' first-round pick who struggled in the first two  games, was hospitalized with tonsillitis. Winston Garland started in his place.  . . . The Clippers' victory Friday was their first in a season opener since  1985, when the team won five in a row.  </P></p>

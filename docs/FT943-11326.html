			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Key to a cheap M-reg - Bethan Hutton explains that you save money if you do not own your car This August, record numbers of new cars are expected to be driven away from showrooms by people who do not own them. Britain is not about to suffer an upsurge of car crime. Many of this year's M-reg cars will be acquired by consumers using personal contract purchase (PCP) schemes, which allow you to drive off in a new car every two or three years, without ever paying the entire cost. PCP is the fastest-growing way of buying a new car. Ford introduced its Options plan in 1990, and says it expects Options purchases to account for more than half its sales within two years. All the big manufacturers have their own versions, together with some finance houses which run schemes for dealerships. From September, Midland plans to operate the first independent PCP scheme aimed at consumers. It will offer holders of Midland credit cards a telephone-based scheme operated by its car finance subsidiary, Swan National, which can be used to finance any make of car. All PCP schemes work in roughly the same way: Dealer and customer agree a price - for example, Pounds 13,581 for a Vauxhall Cavalier 1.8 GLS. Customer pays a deposit or trades in another car - eg 30 per cent deposit on the Cavalier (Pounds 4,074) leaves a balance of Pounds 9,507. Dealer works out a 'future value' - what the car is expected to be worth second-hand at the end of the agreement, which can last between one and four years. The Cavalier should have a residual value of Pounds 5,839 after two years. Customer makes monthly payments composed of interest on the whole balance, plus repayments of the difference between the car's price (less deposit) and the future value - Pounds 3,668 in the Cavalier's case. Payments are Pounds 214 a month for two years, at an APR of 9.7 per cent. At the end of the agreement, the customer can choose to: pay the balance (the 'future value'), and own the car outright; hand back the keys and walk away, having, in effect, hired the car for a few years; or swap the car for a new one, using any excess over the predicted future value as a deposit. Most drivers take the last option. The attraction of PCP is that monthly payments are lower than with a straight loan or hire purchase, where you repay the entire cost of the car over the term of the agreement. If you want to use PCP to roll over to a new car every few years, it is important to pick a car with a high resale value. With PCP, you pay for the depreciation plus interest, never the residual value. Monthly payments could be lower with a more expensive car which keeps its value well, rather than a cheaper car which depreciates rapidly. Midland says it will be able to give independent advice on precisely that. The most important factor in the amount you pay is probably not the car's price or its future value, but the interest rate. Take the example of an identical Ford Mondeo GLX 1.8, bought using Ford's own Options scheme, or Midland's new Carchoice. Ford estimates the on-the-road price at Pounds 14,160, and the future value at Pounds 6,385 after two years. Midland's figures are a similar, Pounds 14,084 and Pounds 6,636 respectively. But based on a 30 per cent deposit and mileage of 12,000 a year, the monthly repayments work out very different, at Pounds 250 with the Options plan, and Pounds 175 with Midland. This is mainly due to the different APRs: 15.8 per cent with Ford, and 5.8 per cent with Midland. All the savings you bargain so hard for can be wiped out by an extra few percentage points on the APR. As the table illustrates, even among six of the best car loans available from high-street names, the total repaid on a Pounds 5,000 loan can vary by as much as Pounds 242. So finding the right finance deal can save you even more money than finding the lowest-priced car. PCP is not the right choice for everyone. It is usually available only on new cars, or sometimes those up to two or three years old. If you want to buy a car outright, it may not be convenient to have to pay a large lump sum after two or three years. Agreed future values only apply if the car is in good condition, and has kept within certain mileage limits - usually 6,000 to 12,000 miles a year. At this time of year, banks and building societies trumpet their discounts and offers on personal loans to attract car buyers. Do not ignore the finance offered by car dealers. There are 0 per cent finance offers around, though you usually need to make a 50 per cent deposit and pay the balance over 12 months. Neil Tomkin of Lombard North Central, a large finance house, says it is a myth that buyers with cash from a personal loan have more bargaining power to push down the price of a new car. Dealers' margins have shrunk, leaving them less room for manoeuvre, but Tomkin argues that buyers may actually get a better deal on a car if they take the dealer's own credit. The dealer earns commission on the finance as well as the car, and could possibly afford to trim the car's price a little more.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- BEST OF THE HIGH STREET CAR LOANS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Monthly         Total                               payment       payable Lender                        (Pounds)      (Pounds)      APR    Notes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Abbey National                 170.60       6141.60     14.8%        A Alliance &amp; Leicester           170.60       6141.60     14.8%      A B Bank of Scotland               168.85       6178.60     14.6%        C Halifax                        177.32       6383.52     17.9%        D Midland                        172.96       6226.56     15.9%        E TSB                            172.97       6226.92     15.9%        F  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Moneyfacts (for details see page VI).

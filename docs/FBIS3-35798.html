			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Shinkin report under "Nearby Foreign Countries" </F> rubric: "The Crimea. An Expected Victory"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Yuriy Aleksandrovich Meshkov  was born in 1945. His mother is Ukrainian. His father is  Russian -- a Don Cossack. After finishing secondary school in  Simferopol he served in the Border Troops. He then studied at  Moscow State University Law Faculty. After defending his  diploma he was an investigator in the Crimea Prosecutor's Office  and an attorney. Meshkov is a deputy of the Crimean Supreme  Soviet, in which he heads the "Republic" deputies' group. He is  chairman of the Crimean Republican Movement and Crimean  Republican Party.    By all accounts Meshkov's victory does not suit Kiev's  politicians. Primarily because in his election program he  advocated the lifting of the moratorium on a referendum on the  Crimea's status. Its results, should it take place, are not  hard to predict. But this carries the risk that the Crimean  precedent could "detonate" Ukraine's eastern and southern  regions. According to sociologists' data, pro-Russian  sentiments are becoming increasingly strong in them. Moreover,  a political force capable of consolidating them has appeared in  Ukraine -- the Interregional Bloc for Reforms, which is headed  by Vladimir Grinev and Leonid Kuchma, who advocate close  cooperation with Russia.    The first threats that the most resolute measures will be  taken in relation to the Crimea, even including the introduction  of troops there, have already been uttered in Kiev. It is no  accident that anxious Kiev parliamentarians have granted the  president additional powers -- to rescind decisions of local  organs of power, including Crimean organs, if they do not accord  with the Ukrainian Constitution.    But Leonid Kravchuk has remained true to himself. So far he  has not openly expressed his attitude toward the Crimean  elections and is patiently enduring the accusations of radical  national-patriots. The president once again finds himself in a  difficult situation. On the one hand he gave his personal  blessing to the election venture ("If the people want to elect a  president they have the right to do so"), but on the other hand  the demands to declare them invalid are altogether too insistent.    It must be assumed that for now Kravchuk will confine  himself  to removing Ivan Yermakov from the post of his representative in  Sevastopol and will wait and see how events in the Crimea  develop further. After all, judging by his last television  debate, Meshkov came across as a reasonable and flexible  politician, dispelling the myth created about him that he is an  extremist.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Poles entice foreign bond investors A NEW general licence permitting automatic repatriation of interest earnings by foreigners which comes into force in Poland on July 15 aims to generate demand abroad for three-year treasury bonds as well as treasury bills. The three-year bonds as well as the 26, 39 and 52-week treasury bills available to foreign investors since the middle of last year have met with minimal success since repatriation of earnings has required special central bank permits for each tranche. The government has sought to place 7,000bn zlotys (Dollars 407m) worth of three-year treasury bonds since last August but so far only 2,500bn zlotys worth have been taken up by domestic investors. In the first quarter of this year the annual yield on the three-year treasury bonds was 43 per cent while the country's current 'crawling peg' mechanism is devaluing the zloty at a rate of 25 per cent a year. Year-on-year inflation is running at 36 per cent. Poland's first cement sector privatisation has taken place with the sale of the Odra works in Opole to Miebach Projektgesellschaft of Germany for DM6m (Dollars 3.38m). Miebach plans to invest a further DM31m to modernise the Polish plant.</p>

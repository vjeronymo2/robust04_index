			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Merrill to issue warrants on commodities index Amid growing investor interest in commodities, Merrill Lynch is due to issue 5m call warrants this week on its new Energy and Metals Index (ENMET), which it launched in late July. The pricing for the European-style warrants will be decided on Thursday, but under current conditions the strike price would be Dollars 83.60, the index's spot value yesterday, with an issue price of Dollars 5.62 per warrant. The warrants are targeted at both fixed-income and equity fund managers seeking a diversification tool or a way to hedge their real rate of returns, said Merrill Lynch. Commodities have become increasingly popular, due in part to improved fundamentals in key commodity markets, the poor performance of other asset classes - especially fixed income, their positive correlation to broad inflation indices and their negative correlation to stocks and bonds. ENMET includes six commodities grouped in three sectors: energy (West Texas Intermediate crude oil, natural gas), precious metals (gold, silver) and base metals (aluminium, copper), and is based on the nearest traded futures contracts. In two weeks, Merrill Lynch also plans to issue two short-term structured notes linked to the index.</p>

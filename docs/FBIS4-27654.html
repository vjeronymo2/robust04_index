			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Estela B. De La Paz] </F>   [Text] Shell Phils. [Philippines] Exploration (SPEX),  operator of the Camago-Malampaya fields in offshore northwest  Palawan, yesterday successfully completed its short production  tests or drill stem tests (DST).    SPEX's second DST on the gas zone of the well recorded a  final flow rate of 24.8 million cubic feet of gas per day and  1,252 barrels per day of condensate.    Dre Boon, SPEX vice-president, earlier told BUSINESS WORLD  Shell needs a flow rate of about 20 million cubic feet of gas  per day for the well to be considered of commercial value.    The bottom portion of the well, which contains the oil, also  yielded good flow rates. Shell is satisfied with the stabilized  flow rate recorded in the oil zone at about 5,627 barrels of oil  per day, more than what was expected, Mr. Boon said.    SPEX will drill its second appraisal well, Malampaya-4, by  mid-June to confirm the extent of the reserves of the Malampaya  structure.    Mr. Boon said the Malampaya 4 well will be halfway between  the Malampaya 1 and 2 wells in the north and Malampaya 3 in the  south.    The theory behind this drilling strategy is if Malampaya 4  shows the same characteristics as the other wells and shows  positive oil and gas flow rates, then it is possible that  Malampaya is one big structure. As such, the extent of the oil  and gas reserves can be estimated.    However, while these developments confirm the presence of  substantial oil and gas deposits in the area, harnessing these  deposits for commercial quantity may not be easy due to the  costs involved, as these are in very deep waters.    Shell is still negotiating with National Power Corp., its  main market, to commit 3,000 megawatts to run on natural gas by  1998.    However, because of the costs involved not only in  production  but also in transporting the gas from the well-head to Luzon  shores, the power firm and Shell have not inked any gas supply  contract.    One contention against the use of natural gas by 1998 is the  additional cost of retrofitting the thermal plants. Moreover,  natural gas-fed plants must also be competitively priced in  order to compete for a slot in the power development program  (PDP). The PDP will be using various fuel resources such as  coal and geothermal to come up with an efficient generation mix  between 1998 and 2005.</p>

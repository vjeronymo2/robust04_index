			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Technology: Packaging with flexibility - Worth Watching Researchers at Cambridge Consultants have developed an alternative to vacuum-formed plastic trays which relies more on origami than traditional packaging. Vacuum-formed trays are widely used in the food industry - to separate the biscuits in a packet, for example. The CCL method folds paper or paperboard on the production line from a single reel of paper. The technique enables companies to change their packaging quickly if a new product line is introduced. As plastic trays are rarely made on the packing site, stocks have to be held and separating the trays often has to be done manually. CCL: UK, 0223 420024.</p>

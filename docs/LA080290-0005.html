			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> GAIN STUDENTS, STAFF REPLY TO ARTICLE  </P> <P> Your article was appalling. I found it to be inaccurate and misleading. You  based your information on facts from one class and only a few others spoken to.  </P> <P> First, not everyone who attends GAIN falls under the categories written about.  I volunteered to participate in this program. I am neither illiterate nor  uneducated to the point of not knowing how to add or subtract.  </P> <P> I do not use drugs. I have not been to jail or have any type of record or  history of violence or an attitude problem.  </P> <P> Our school is not a school of last resort. It is a second chance for us to  better ourselves and our life situations. I sincerely suggest you recheck your  facts and stop prejudging others. This prejudging causes prejudice, which can  hurt this valuable program.  </P> <P> TINA HAWN  </P> <P> Oxnard  </P></p>

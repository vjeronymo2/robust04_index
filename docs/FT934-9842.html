			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Dependent on the overdraft - Companies must rethink long-term financing Owner-managed businesses in the UK are still 'depressingly dependent' on the overdraft as a means of financing their long-term development, according to a survey* carried out by the accountancy firm Touche Ross. This reliance increases with the size of the business, the survey of 264 companies with sales of Pounds 5m to Pounds 150m shows. The report, however, suggests that banks are becoming more interested in taking an active lending stance. It also shows them becoming more professional in their assessment of risk, increasingly using computer models to test profit projections and demanding more evidence of sound planning. On the whole, owner-managed businesses appear to be reducing their external borrowing but they remain constrained by high gearing. Peter Morgan, Touche Ross partner responsible for owner-managed businesses in London, says he is pessimistic about the chances of many raising money as the economy recovers. 'Banks are often criticised,' he says. 'But many businesses are being run by people who lack management skills. Someone with a reasonable proposition, decent management and good advice will get a hearing from banks.' During the year under review - most of the companies in the survey had March 1993 or December year-ends - all but the largest owner-managed businesses reduced their gearing ratios. The smallest companies remained most heavily dependent on external finance and also found new funds harder to raise. All sizes of companies increased their level of trade creditors - on average by 10 per cent - but not because they were growing. While squeezing creditors provided some cashflow relief, interest costs were still eating on average a hefty 44 per cent of operating profits. Perhaps the most revealing section of the report is the list of the methods companies least like to choose to raise money. Businesses most want to avoid factoring, followed by venture and development capital. Leasing and hire purchase came next, with the sale of equity and commercial mortgages 'least disliked' apart from the bank overdraft. Equally alarming for Touche Ross is the apparent lack of professionalism it found. Only a third of companies said they planned to raise new money over the next two years. Yet nearly half expected to grow at between 6 and 15 per cent over three years. Touche Ross believes this is unrealistic. For every Pounds 100 increase in sales, it says, an average manufacturing company will need Pounds 25 of extra working capital (stock and debtors less creditors), even before increases in capital spending. *Finance for owner-managed businesses.</p>

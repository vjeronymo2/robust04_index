			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / German groups to double purchases from the east MORE than 30 of Germany's top companies agreed yesterday to double their purchases of goods from the former East Germany by 1995, in a new move to revive the collapsed economy. The 'purchasing offensive' was announced by Mr Carl Hahn, supervisory board chairman of Volkswagen, in the name of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), and is backed by all the country's main motor manufacturers, as well as by the biggest retail and mail-order chains. It amounts to a new attempt by the business sector to bolster Chancellor Helmut Kohl's efforts to negotiate a 'solidarity pact' for east Germany, at a time when parallel efforts to agree on wage restraint are running into difficulty. Official arbitration in the state of Saxony between IG Metall, the giant engineering workers' union, and east German employers, in an effort to agree on a slowdown in the process of wage equalisation with west Germany, broke down on Monday night. Union officials said arbitration will continue in the other four east German states, but the chances of compromise appear slim. The employers are seeking to renegotiate a 26 per cent wage rise due to be paid on April 1, to bring the eastern engineering workers up to 82 per cent of western wages, although most of their industries are facing imminent closure. Chancellor Kohl told a meeting of leaders of both sides of industry in Bonn that agreement in the wage talks remained a key element in efforts to revive the eastern economy, but he insisted that the partners in the wage talks must reach an agreement independently. He persuaded the parties in his ruling coalition yesterday to pay civil servants a 3 per cent rise this year - the same as that agreed for blue collar public sector workers - but to delay it until May 1, as their contribution to the solidarity pact. At the same time the coalition partners rejected a plan proposed by the opposition Social Democrats for a 10 per cent tax surcharge on the better paid to be levied from July 1. They agreed, nonetheless, to negotiate with the opposition on possible compromises. Mr Kohl is anxious to demonstrate that his planned solidarity pact is more than simply a package of budget cuts in the west, and modest spending increases in the east. To that end the business sector initiative is another helpful boost. Mr Hahn said that current purchases from the east totalled just DM24bn (Pounds 10bn), against eastern purchases from the west running at DM174bn. The aim was to raise western purchases to DM50bn by 1995, he said. At the same time he warned that east German manufacturers had to make major improvements in the quality and quantity of their output, and this depended on wage rises in the east slowing down to the rate of productivity growth. Gesamtmetall, the engineering employers' organisation, yesterday said it was prepared to offer a maximum 9 per cent rise to its east German employees, in view of the fact that productivity levels are about 30 per cent below west German levels. 'Nine per cent is all we can afford,' said a spokesman.</p>

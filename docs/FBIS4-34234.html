			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 16 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Cuban  President Fidel Castro said here today that people who enter  embassies in Cuba violently lose their right to obtain a visa to  leave the country. "Anyone who wants to leave Cuba can obtain a  departure visa but anyone who enters an embassy violently loses  that right," Castro said in a statement for the Colombian  station Radio Cadena Nacional (RCN).    Castro said Cubans who are of age can request visas to leave  the country, but they cannot always obtain visas from the  corresponding embassies and therefore decide to occupy the  installations.    On Wednesday, nine persons forcefully entered the Chilean  Consulate in Havana while 20 others are currently at the German  Embassy and 118 at the Belgian ambassador's residence demanding  authorization to leave the island. Castro said the Cuban  government has the obligation of protecting the embassies. He  added, however, that force should not be used.    Yesterday, Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban National  Assembly of the People's Government, noted the need to "prevent  in a civilized manner" the violation and vulnerability of  diplomatic missions. He stressed that Cuban authorities will  refrain from dislodging the several civilians who occupied the  embassies by force, adding that no reprisals will be taken  against them if they change their attitude. "It is necessary to  prevent in a civilized manner" the forceful occupation of  embassies "if we do not want the law of the jungle to prevail or  even prevent the disappearance of diplomatic service," Alarcon  stressed.    He said that so far the countries affected by those  incidents  have cooperated with Cuban authorities in trying to persuade the  occupants to voluntarily and peacefully leave the installations.  Alarcon, a former foreign minister, said the occupation of  embassies is the result of U.S. immigration policy, which denies  visas to Cubans who want to emigrate to that country.    In his statement to RCN -- one of the most important radio  networks in Colombia -- Castro also referred to Cuba's relations  with the United States, denying the possibility for "direct  contact" at this time. He stressed that U.S. President William  Clinton is very interested in obtaining his reelection and  therefore power groups, which he did not identify, are  pressuring him to maintain the sanctions against Cuba.    Castro said he is pleased with the election of Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria as OAS secretary general, but ruled out  the possibility that he can promote Cuba's return to the  regional organization in the very near future. For Cuba, its  return to the OAS is not a priority; what we view as a priority  is the end of the economic blockade the United States has  maintained against the island for more than 30 years, Castro  stressed. Castro described the blockade as "inhuman and  criminal." He added that it is not justified because the Cold  War is over and said it has hurt Cuba more due to changes in its  trade activities, 80 percent of which were carried out with the  socialist bloc.    Consulted about the situation in Colombia -- a country  facing  guerrilla groups comprised of several million armed men --  Castro denied his country interferes in the internal affairs of  other countries. He recognized that for some time, Cuba  actively supported revolutionary movements in Latin America  because they supported the [Cuban] policy toward the United  States, but he explained that that situation has changed. He  said his country's relations with Latin America are based on  mutual respect and nonintervention in the internal affairs of  each nation.    Castro refused to comment on the possible results of  Sunday's  presidential elections in Colombia. He only said he hopes the  elected president will continue working to further improve the  electoral process.    Castro recognized that he does not have the same energy as  when he was 20 or 30 years old. He added that he will retire  when the right time comes, after overcoming the current  difficult moments because he does not want to look like a  deserter. He said he would like to have "a small piece" of land  in Cuba to rest and dedicate his time to reading. He noted,  however, that he still works 15, 16, or 17 hours daily.</p>

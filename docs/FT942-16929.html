			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Colonial Mutual Life soars to ADollars 701.3m Colonial Mutual Life Assurance, the Australian financial services group, has raised the likelihood of de-mutualising following a strong result in calendar 1993. The group announced a 260 per cent jump in net earnings to ADollars 701.3m (USDollars 501m) from ADollars 194.5m and a 31 per cent increase in reserves to ADollars 2.13bn from ADollars 1.62bn. Mr Peter Smedley, managing director, said the improved performance was helped by last year's bull share market, a restructuring of the business, and a focus on cost reduction, cutting group expenses by more than 18 per cent. Mr Smedley said the group had appointed an internal review team to examine future capital needs, advised by S. G. Warburg. He said the review would examine growth options, including changing the group's mutual structure through which it is owned by policyholders. Mr Smedley indicated that the group was unlikely to remain a mutual, raising the possibility of a capital raising and the introduction of conventional equity.</p>

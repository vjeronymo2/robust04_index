The main subject of  the conversation was the parliamentary elections in Ukraine  scheduled for 22 March.    Zlenko expressed his concern regarding the large number of  candidates--as many as 12--for each parliamentary seat; 60  percent of them are independent. Both Oleksy and Zlenko  wondered whether cooperation between Ukrainian political parties  would still be possible after the elections.</p>

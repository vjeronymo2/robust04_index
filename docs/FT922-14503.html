			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Law firms turn to litigation LITIGATION overtook conveyancing as the chief source of revenue for provincial law firms last year for the first time, according to figures from the Centre for Interfirm Comparison. The shift reflects the depressed state of the housing market. The centre, which carries out an annual comparative performance project among 260 law firms nationally, found that overall, law firms' revenues in England and Wales continued to grow. The average revenue growth rate was 15.9 per cent for provincial firms and 17.7 per cent for London firms. Litigation grew steadily in all regions of the country - by more than 35 per cent on average in the provinces and by almost 30 per cent in London. Traditionally, the profession derived about 45 per cent of its revenue from conveyancing. Last year it accounted for only 32 per cent on average. The profitability of most firms fell last year. Median net profit per partner in the north fell from Pounds 33,500 in 1990 to Pounds 21,500 in 1991 and from Pounds 98,000 to Pounds 97,400 in London. In the south-east profit per partner rose from Pounds 29,000 to Pounds 30,100. Profits were calculated after deducting a notional salary for partners of Pounds 45,000 in London and Pounds 30,000 elsewhere. Paragon '91 - the National Interfirm Comparison for Solicitors.

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Russia may flood aluminium market RUSSIA's desperate need for hard currency will drive it to maximise exports of aluminium this year, adding to the turmoil in the already depressed world industry. Russian officials have indicated that they hope to sell 1m tonnes of the metal, the same as last year when a sudden flood of Russian aluminium caused extensive production cuts in the west and drove prices down to their lowest-ever level in real terms. Russia's plan is bound to increase pressure from aluminium companies in North America and Europe for import quotas on Russian sales. Already nearly 1m tonnes of western aluminium smelting capacity has been or is about to shut down, representing more than 5 per cent of available capacity. Aluminium is used for a wide variety of products, but mainly goes to the construction and packaging industries. Prices have fallen by 60 per cent from the peak in 1988 and for some months have been near 50 cents a pound, at which level 75 per cent of western world smelters are operating at or below cost. Concernalumini (Aluminium Company), set up recently in the Russian Republic, has told western industry representatives that it understands problems are being created in the west but that Mr Boris Yeltsin's government wants it to maintain exports at a high level to earn as much foreign currency as possible. The new company, which has taken over most of the aluminium production assets in the former Soviet Union, confirmed that it achieved last year's export objective of 1m tonnes, more than three times the net exports of 300,000 tonnes in 1990. The information was given to a team from VAW aluminium of Germany, the first delegation from the western industry to visit their Russian counterparts this year. Mr Karl Wobbe, VAW's management board member responsible for aluminium production, said at the weekend that he doubted the Russian industry could meet its export target this year because of raw material and spare parts shortages. 'My personal impression from visiting smelters is that production will probably go down by another 20 per cent this year after falling 10 per cent last year,' said Mr Wobbe at the weekend. The Russian industry has between 3.5m and 3.6m tonnes of annual aluminium capacity, he pointed out. 'We estimate production will be down to 2.5m to 2.8m tonnes this year.' Mr Yeltsin was worried that the domestic aluminium fabricating industry would be starved of material and decreed that smelters in the first quarter of 1992 must supply the domestic market with at least 70 per cent of the tonnage supplied in the same months last year. Mr Wobbe said smelter managers would be unlikely to comply fully with this decree. 'They need foreign currency to pay for food for their employees and their families and for spare parts to keep the plants going,' he said.

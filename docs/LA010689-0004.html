The Andrew Lloyd Webber show -- about the Little Engine That Could --  opened March 15, 1987, and will have chugged through 761 regular performances  and 22 previews by the time Sunday's curtain comes down. It's been playing to  50% capacity, according to Weekly Variety's legitimate theater chart. ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Hungarian Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky has  said that Hungary sincerely supports the Croatian-Muslim  reconciliation because these two nations are dependent on each  other more than other countries of the region. The Hungarian  foreign minister, who is currently holding talks in Washington,  is of the opinion that, if the canton system enabling the  coexistence of Croats and Muslims comes into prominence again in  the case of Bosnia, the example, in a wider sense, will probably  be followed elsewhere as well.</p>

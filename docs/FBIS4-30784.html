			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["E.G."-initialed report: "Waves of Albanian </F> Radio-Television Jammed"]    [Text] Dibra e Madhe [Debar], the historic city of the  Diber region that remained under Serbia (today's Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]) in 1913, has  for some years been watching the programs of Albanian  Radio-Television [RTSh] via the television booster at Homesh,  which sends out a signal to all Diber.    Albanian Television's many viewers in the city of Dibra e  Madhe point out the fact that RTSh is being jammed. The jamming  stations installed on the border with Albania many years ago are  still being kept in action throughout RTSh's broadcasting time.    In the past, when barbed wire divided the two Dibers and  during the "ideologic war" between Albania and Yugoslavia,  television-jamming was part of the systems that ruled in both  countries, although Skopje Television was never jammed in  Peshkopi. Now, with freedom of the press and information,  freedom of movement, and advancing democratic processes, the  attitude and action of the Macedonian side in jamming RTSh is  totally anachronistic and incomprehensible.    It is also impossible to understand why Macedonia is  pursuing  the old-style politics and practice of isolating the Albanians  by jamming RTSh on purpose, at a time when Albania has opened  all its doors and windows to Macedonia. Let us not go into the  extremely cold response to the introduction of the Albanian  press and literature in the Albanian regions of Macedonia.    Our government is aware of these problems, because they have  been raised in public on other occasions. It is regrettable  that, where they are concerned, it still pretends to be blind,  deaf, and dumb.</p>

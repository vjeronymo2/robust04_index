			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Syed Konain Haider] </F>   [Text] Quetta, May 30 -- Pakistan security forces have  launched an attack inside Afghanistan to get its ten captives  released.    They are being kept hostage by an Afghan gun-runner Mullah  Bockeri, reliable sources said here Monday.    The attack coincided with the recent two-day visit of  Federal  Interior Minister General (Retd) Naseerullah Babar to Noshki, a  north-western bordering town, 140 kilometres off here.    The sources said that assault at Tazai Rabat (a sub-tehsil)  in District Shahjoi of Zabul Province -- the stronghold of  Mullah Salam Rocketi, has sofar been unsuccessful because  Sulemankhail and Tarak tribesmen from the neighbouring Ghazni  Province have dispatched reinforcements to repulse the Frontier  Corps' (FC) offensive.    Sources said that the heavy exchange of fire had been  continuing for the last two days but there was no report of any  casualty from either side.    Mullah Salam is holding two Chinese engineers, five  employees  of Balochistan development Authority (BDA), Deputy Commissioner  Ziarat, his driver and gunman as hostages for the last several  months seeking ransom and return of his "two Stinger missiles"  captured by the FC from his residence inside Pakistan in January  last year.    In retaliation Mullah Salam's armed men abducted 30 FC  personnel including a major after exchange of fire and taken  them to Zabul. The soldiers were released after payment of  ransom and a promise for returning his Stinger missiles.    Last month Salam released two BDA employees on the pursuance  of a spiritual leader but had set conditions for release of  other hostages.    Sources said the FC's attack could provoke the Afghan  gun-runner who might harm the hostages.</p>

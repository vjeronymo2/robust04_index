			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Army General Viktor Yerin, Russian minister </F> of internal affairs, by ARGUMENTY I FAKTY Editor in Chief  Vladimir Starkov; place and date not given: "Not Just a  Detective..."]    [Text] The Russian minister of internal affairs, Army  General Viktor Yerin, visited our editorial offices a few days  ago. Below is an interview with him.    [Starkov] Viktor Fedorovich, I want to start our  conversation  with a possibly unexpected question. How do you feel about art?    [Yerin] There probably has not been a single great writer  who  has not tried his hand at the mystery genre. There are also very  interesting works by our contemporaries. Take Astafyev's "The  Sad Detective." I keep telling my personnel department: Before  you hire a candidate to work for the militia, give him this book  to read, because it describes quite objectively the dirty,  thankless side of the militia's everyday work. And at the same  time the book shows a man who is sincerely devoted to his  profession, who does not spare himself in the goal of protecting  the people. At the time, "The Sad Detective" made a very deep  impression on me. Unfortunately, as soon as we filled the  screens with criminal elements' "heroics," this tremendously  affected our youth.    [Starkov] You do not believe in the theory that, seeing a  crime on the screen, a person undergoes a sort of self-cleansing?    [Yerin] I do not believe this. Western statistics show that  scenes of violence, scenes of the "romantic" side of the  criminal underworld, stimulate a rise in crime. There are known  cases of crimes committed precisely according to the scenario of  the film shown. Any phenomenon may be presented in a different  way. You can show the disgusting side of crime, or you may  package it like candy: See, these are also heroics of sorts.  When I was just starting my career I had encounters with  old-school criminals. At the time the process of "crime bosses"  establishing themselves was underway. They also had their own  criminal "romantics." And it was this "romantic side" that they  used to recruit a certain stratum of youth into their ranks.    [Starkov] Clinton delivered his State of the Union address a  few days ago. Before it he polled 50 senators and state  governors regarding the most serious problem facing the country.  All 50 said: crime. Is this a universal problem? Have we entered  some different stage of civilization?    [Yerin] Crime is indeed on the rise all over the world; a  sort of criminal boom is underway. The Israeli minister of  police, power engineering, and infrastructure visited me  recently. He did not even want to talk about his problems after  he heard me speak of ours. What is Israel, with its 5-5.5  million population and 19,000 policemen? And Russia, with 150  million people and 3 million crimes a year?    [Starkov] I was in Seattle at the Goodwill Games. I spent a  whole day riding around the city with police. The police car  itself was like a monster, stuffed full of equipment. The  computer display continuously flashed messages of new incidents.  It turned out that in addition to uniformed police they also  have undercover police. And in addition to undercover police  also mounted police. And in addition to mounted police also  patrols on bicycles. That is, the entire city is covered by a  net of police investigation. Of course, we currently cannot  afford this either physically or financially. Are we making any  progress, however?    [Yerin] We are. For two years the internal affairs organs  have led a semi-pauper existence. Our highest achievement is  that in these conditions we have preserved the system of organs  at all, not allowing it to disintegrate.    [Starkov] What is the average pay in the militia these days?    [Yerin] About 200,000-250,000 [rubles]. For the second year  now we are also providing a food allowance, that is, once a  month an employee is issued a certain parcel of foodstuffs or  the monetary equivalent. I also get it once in a while: It  consists a can of fish, cereal, and so on.    [Starkov] But the situation in Moscow is better in this  respect, is it not?    [Yerin] On the contrary, it is quite often better in the  provinces. Over there, people more often ask for this allowance  to be issued in cash equivalent, especially those who live in  rural areas. In the countryside, even if they themselves do not,  their relatives do some farming, have a cow, and will always  send some milk and meat their way.    [Starkov] How many people does the MVD [Ministry of Internal  Affairs] have on payroll these days?    [Yerin] The personnel of purely militia units now numbers  570,000 across the entire Russia. Of course, in terms of the  militia-to-population ratio we are behind the West. Our ratio is  now 3,000-4,000 population per precinct militia officer, and  they constitute the bulk of the force.    [Starkov] Do you often get woken up in the middle of the  night?    [Yerin] When I worked as a criminal investigations division  chief, it happened much more often. Back then I was counting the  nights I was not woken up.    [Starkov] How do you make the decision on whether to contact  the president regarding a specific incident or not?    [Yerin] The criteria are the gravity of the incident and the  number of victims. For instance, hostages are taken and the  lives of a group of children are in danger. Or it is a major  traffic accident with tens of people dead; or a rail disaster.  Even if I am woken up in the middle of the night, I will find a  way to report to the president immediately because I know that  there is no other way. In addition, there is a system of weekly  reports. It has been set up by the president himself.    [Starkov] Which day of the week do you report to him?    [Yerin] Enforcement ministers report on Mondays. My domain  is  the sociopolitical situation: rallies, mass manifestations that  have taken place over the week, their dynamics, comparisons, to  what extent law and order was maintained in the course of their  conduct, their social thrust and the pretext for holding them.    [Starkov] I heard that when a minister goes in to report, he  decides for himself whether to alarm the president or not.    [Yerin] The president and I had an agreement from the very  beginning that I would give him honest information. I think this  is also in the president's interests. I know, of course, how to  manipulate statistics; how to influence the president; how to  make it so that crime rate in our country will begin to  "drop"--only on paper, though. But this will be a lie,  self-deception. I report very unpleasant things to the  president, including things that do not look good for me  personally. I believe that we have to take the blows of fate as  they come, and be honest.    [Starkov] Do you exercise?    [Yerin] No. All my life I have not been able force myself to  exercise. But I get a workout on the tennis court. I will try to  play some even today.    [Starkov] Readers will not understand if I fail to ask you  about the events of 3-4 October. How do you assess your actions  at the time?    [Yerin] My conscience is clear, because I did everything I  was supposed to do as the minister of internal affairs. That we  have been able to deal with this problem with minimal human and  political losses is to a certain extent not my achievement as  minister as it is of the system itself. I do not want to hurt  journalists' feelings, because they were writing in the heat of  the moment. But paradoxical things resulted from it. For  instance, there was a report that "an MVD unit went over to the  White House side, and what kind of unit does the minister have  that has betrayed the president?" I, on the other hand, wanted  to commend the commander of this unit. His company found itself  under fire from the White House; he saw that one soldier was  wounded, another killed. A commander at any level has to think  about minimizing losses. He was able to move the unit into a  covered area, and ensured the safety of his personnel. I had a  clear picture of it within 10 minutes--it was reported to me  through the chain.    [Starkov] Were you actually there?    [Yerin] I visited the militia chains regularly, went there  both at night and during the day.    Or, for instance, journalists asked me: "Why did you stand  by  and watch the commandos ride to Ostankino and not stop them, not  open fire on them?" Just imagine for a moment what this would  involve--to start shooting at a bus on Mir Prospect. And a bus  with innocent people in it at that.    Of course, I understand perfectly well all the damage that  resulted from the tanks shelling the White House. But talk to  specialists. Using this method of bombardment produced minimum  casualties and demoralized two-thirds of the people in the White  House while at the same time not inflicting any wounds or  contusions--they simply could not stand it and went to the  ground floor for shelter.    [Starkov] I remember the time when people who went to work  for the militia were mostly uneducated.    [Yerin] Yes. The people who taught me had four years of  grade  school. They were detectives by intuition.    [Starkov] Do you remember your first assignment in the  militia?    [Yerin] I remember the first case I solved. It was in Kazan.  There was an October cinema there--it no longer exists, it has  been razed. In the yard of the cinema was a public outhouse made  of wood boards; a woman was raped there. She ran to the theater  and told them what had happened. We combed the area of the city  and caught the bastard by description.    [Starkov] A new amnesty is being readied. How many convicts  will be released?    [Yerin] A very insignificant number. Less than 10 percent.  We  now have about 500,000 people being kept in correctional  institutions, and about 300,000 in preliminary investigation  facilities. The amnesty draft includes mostly elderly people  whom it is simply inhumane to keep in detention (people over 60,  disabled people, World War II participants), juveniles, and  people who committed a crime for the first time--either through  carelessness or those who do not represent undue social threat.  Those who have committed grave offenses will not be amnestied.    [Starkov] We get letters in which convicts tell of the  horrible conditions in which they are kept.    [Yerin] I do not like it either that we keep people in  conditions more fit for cattle. Literally a few days ago a  government decree was signed containing concrete figures in  terms of how much the government can allocate today for repairs  and construction of new prisons. We are now building several  preliminary investigation facilities to a design that has been  approved by an international expert commission. It is a very  original system--a "daisy": First the main block is built, and  then you can add wings to it--one, two, or even five, depending  on the need.    [Starkov] We have seen prisons in American films: bars upon  bars; prisoners sit there like animals in a zoo. Is this the  system you consider modern?    [Yerin] I do not see anything wrong with having both bars  and  strong locks. When we get richer, I will gladly order the  installation of the most modern electronic locks that can only  be opened by a magnetic card. And I will be very glad when we  get to the level of Denmark, where we were asked to wait five  minutes before entering the corridor because the prisoners were  finishing their lunch and were not to be disturbed. They have  two locks on each cell. I asked why. It turned out that one lock  is secured by a warden after bedtime, and the other one is for  the prisoner: He can lock it from the inside if he does not want  to be disturbed. The Danes told me about a Russian who had  committed a crime there, and wrote to his mother that he had  been detained by the police and was doing time in prison. She  should not worry, the letter said, because this was not prison  but a very good hotel; he was well fed, and had very nice living  conditions.    [Starkov] You shovel human dirt. To do this one must  probably  have special psychological traits?    [Yerin] Of course. Do you think it is a great pleasure to be  present at an autopsy when the forensic pathologist is  dissecting a corpse? He tells you: "Look, there is a smell of  alcohol from the stomach. Look, he ate beet salad and a tomato  an hour before he was killed." This is our work. What keeps us  going is the enthusiasm of a detective following the scent of a  trail.    I will remember this case for the rest of my life. We were  dealing with an aggravated murder and rape case. We arrested a  suspect--a huge, aggressive bull of a guy. He turned out to be  impotent. We could not get his sperm for analysis. We brought in  the medics and finally squeezed this "product" out of him. The  blood type was identical. The murder case was apparently solved.  A month passed. Late one evening the department chief stops by  my office and says: "I have a nagging feeling about it. I do not  think it is him. Let's let him go." We let him go, and a month  later we found the real murderer. Do you know how much effort  you have to make not to harden, professionally and as a human  being, in this stream of daily calls to murder scenes? We had to  handle 29,000 murders last year!    At the beginning of the conversation we touched on the topic  of how important it is for literary and cultural figures, for  artists not to forget about the people of our profession--we  need an escape valve more than anyone else. I constantly work on  myself, keep telling myself: "Remember, the absolute majority of  people live a normal human life; they are honest and decent  people; the criminals are a small minority." Otherwise, I would  have to suspect everyone.    And the nerves you need for this work. For instance, a  militia officer receives information that a person is in illegal  possession of a weapon (perhaps committing robberies and  muggings with it). The officer detains this person, risking his  life in the process since he does not know whether he will be  shot at or not. A criminal proceeding is initiated. Then the  court decides: two years of suspended sentence. The man leaves  the courtroom, walks over to this militia officer, and says: "I  will buy a submachine gun tomorrow, and then we will talk." This  is not just a Russian problem.    [Starkov] But in other countries, the police are feared.    [Yerin] And why? The point is the level of the general legal  culture of the population. A respectful attitude towards the  police has been instilled over decades. In America, for  instance, there are two "sacred cows"--journalists and police  officers. Nobody wants to tangle with journalists because the  journalistic brotherhood will come out on top in the end anyway.  And nobody wants to tangle with a policeman. If God forbid a  policeman is killed or wounded, tens of criminals will get shot  while this crime is being investigated. And everybody knows that  the police will go on a rampage, shooting right and left.  Frequently it is better for the criminals themselves to hand  over the perpetrator in order to stop the police terror. The  police are respected and feared.    [Starkov] Why would you not ask for the help of the military  to fight crime?    [Yerin] I have always been against the military  participating  in the maintenance of law and order. The president, too, said to  me several times: "Look, why do you resist it?" And I keep  replying that we should not do this, it is wrong. First,  bringing the military out into the streets is always politically  damaging for us. Second, each should do his own job, and bear  his own share of responsibility. You say we do not have enough  militia? Let us beef up the force.    Tell me, what can I ask of a 19-year-old kid-soldier who has  only been taught how to shoot a submachine gun? He does not know  how to work with the public, how to work with individual  citizens.    I remember myself in that young age. Senior Sergeant  Kuznetsov was explaining to me how to walk like a militiaman. I  have always moved fast, but he kept telling me that a militiaman  should walk slowly, with a measured step, looking left and  right, evaluating the situation. You see a group of  youngsters--walk over, start a semi-lighthearted conversation.  With younger ones, be more gentle; with older kids--a degree of  sternness. This sergeant was a psychologist. I would like to see  at least 90 percent of MVD personnel be like that Sergeant  Kuznetsov.    As a minister and a member of the government, I believe that  my priority task is to use all possible means to instill a more  respectful attitude toward our system, to raise its status. And  I have enough powers vested in me, enough of everything to do my  job.</p>

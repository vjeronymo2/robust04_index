			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Company News: GE and Hitachi expand joint venture activities GENERAL Electric of the US and Hitachi of Japan have announced an expansion of their long-standing co-operative agreements, opening up new opportunities for GE to export power transmission and distribution technology to Japan. The two companies said yesterday they had entered into long-term co-operative agreements designed to strengthen their competitive position in the utility transmission and distribution market. The agreements extend for another 10 years the companies' joint venture, launched in 1977, to market high-voltage breakers in the US. The venture will change its name from High Voltage Breakers to GE-Hitachi HVB. The new agreement also allows GE to access the Japanese market with its transmission and distribution equipment, and provides for the sharing of technology. Obtaining access to the Japanese transmission and distribution market is a significant boost for GE, complementing the position it has already established in power generating equipment. GE is prime contractor on Tokyo Electric Power's 2,800MW combined cycle plant, the largest in the world, which is due for completion in the mid-1990s.</p>

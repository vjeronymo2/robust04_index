			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Wetherspoon advances to Pounds 6.5m JD Wetherspoon, the pubs operator floated two years ago, raised pre-tax profits in the year to July 31 by 55 per cent from Pounds 4.17m to Pounds 6.48m, thanks mainly to its brisk rate of pub openings and a revival in drinks sales. Heavy price promotion in January and February helped turn round like-for-like drink sales from a first-half decline of 5 per cent to a second-half rise of 6 per cent. One of Wetherspoon's regular promotions is to offer one brand of beer at 99p a pint, but the cost was cut further to 79p at one point in the winter. Having reasserted itself as price competitive, it gradually raised prices again. Mr Tim Martin, chairman, said second-half drink sales had also benefited from two months of good summer weather. Like-for-like catering sales rose 14 per cent in the year. Margins benefited from cost savings now that food was being delivered to the pubs by a third-party distributor. Wetherspoon's shares, which were floated at 160p, fell by 14p to 406p yesterday. Analysts attributed the dip to profit-taking after a strong recent rise. Forecasts are for pre-tax profits of about Pounds 9.5m this year, earnings per share of 24.4p and 7.9p for the dividend. Turnover in the period under review rose 51 per cent to Pounds 46.6m (30.8m). The recommended final dividend of 4.4p makes a payout of 6.6p (5.4p) for the full-year. Earnings per share rose 29 per cent to 18.2p (14.1p), reflecting a one-for-four rights issue in March. The rights issue and retained profits cut year-end debt to Pounds 16.1m (Pounds 21.8m) and gearing to 22 per cent (50 per cent). Capital expenditure totalled Pounds 23.2m, financed by the rights issue and Pounds 11m of net cash from operations after Pounds 4.4m in interest, tax and divi dends. Wetherspoon opened 16 pubs within the M25 area and four outside in the year, at a typical cost of about Pounds 780,000 each. It plans to open another 14 this year, split evenly between inside and outside the M25. Mr Martin said the company was aiming for about 130 pubs within two years. Its newer, larger pubs were typically selling about 1,500 barrels of beer a year and turning over Pounds 750,000, compared with an average of about Pounds 300,000 for a typical brewer's tied pub.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since 1984, courts in a number of jurisdictions have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ruled that section 1902(a)(17)(D) of the Act, which limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whose income and resources can be counted (unless actually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made available), overrides section 1902(a)(10) of the Act,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which requires that the AFDC methods be used to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid eligibility for AFDC-related non-cash assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases. These rulings left open the issue of what method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be used uniformly among States. Currently, States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are using a variety of methods for determining income for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid eligibility purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to our request for public comments on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1993 rule, we received many objections to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> budgeting method set forth in the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, we set forth in the January 1993 rule a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prorating method of determining eligibility for AFDC-related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-cash assistance individuals. Under this method,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual members of the Medicaid budgetary unit would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their income and resource eligibility determined using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate standards that are calculated based on proration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing standards. Parents' countable income and resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be prorated equally among their dependents living in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the home, including non-Supplemental Security Income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dependents who may not be members of the budgetary unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proration would also take into account the needs of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parents. We also addressed how certain types of income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be counted and how certain types of disregards would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be calculated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We received comments from 13 States and 7 special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest groups. With one exception, all of the commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objected to the budgeting method in these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These commenters stated that the new procedure was error  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prone and unnecessarily complex. In addition, they believed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the required system and manual changes and personnel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retraining would result in significant administrative costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We considered these comments, especially in the light  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of health care reform legislation. We also worked with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid Eligibility Technical Advisory Group (ETAG) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop an acceptable policy. The ETAG prefers a policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that minimizes the disruption of current approaches. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also met with recipient advocates who endorse allowing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States a choice of several options, but strongly oppose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowing the budgeting method in the referenced regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be one of these options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, we are withdrawing the regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing the mandatory budgetary method for determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial eligibility for AFDC-related non-cash assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals. By doing this, we are allowing States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility, within any constraints imposed by court orders  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or agreements with recipient advocate groups, to interpret  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current provisions in the law. That is, at this time,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the absence of specific regulatory guidance on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodologies for establishing income and resource  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility for AFDC-related non-cash assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals, States will be required to use methodologies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that comply with the statute and any applicable court  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> orders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Provisions of the Final Regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of our decision to withdraw the regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that require States to use a mandatory budgetary method for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining financial eligibility for AFDC-related non-cash  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance individuals, we are making the following changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the January 1993 rule:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We have withdrawn &sect;&sect;435.604, 435.606, 436.604, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 436.606. These sections contained the procedures for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining income and resource eligibility for AFDC-related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-cash assistance groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We have removed and reserved &sect;435.113(b) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;436.111(b)(2). These paragraphs required States to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide Medicaid to individuals denied AFDC because of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involuntary inclusion of all eligible siblings living in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> home as members of AFDC filing units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We have removed and reserved &sect;435.600(b) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;436.600(b). These sections referred respectively to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;435.604 and &sect;436.604, which have been removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We have revised &sect;435.601 and &sect;436.601 by removing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (e) in each section. These paragraphs contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria for exceptions to financial application eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodologies and State plan requirements that are no longer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable. We also have corrected related cross-references  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in paragraph (b) and (f)(l) of each section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We have revised &sect;435.602 by removing and reserving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (d) and &sect;436.602 by removing and reserving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (c). These paragraphs contain requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining financial responsibility of relatives and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals for AFDC-related non-cash assistance groups. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also have corrected related cross-references in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;435.602(a), 436.602(a), and 436.602(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

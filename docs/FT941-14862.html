			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Record gold output at Aztec mine Aztec Mining Company, the Australian mining house facing an unwanted ADollars 261m (USDollars 174m) bid from Mr Robert de Crespigny's PosGold Investments, yesterday said record gold output of almost 40,000 ounces was achieved by its Bounty Gold Mine in Western Australia in the three months ended December 25, a 32 per cent increase over the previous quarter, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. The company said the increased production contributed to a 28 per cent reduction in operating cost per ounce of gold compared with the previous quarter. It reported that its Woodcutters Zinc Mine yielded 22,268 tonnes of zinc and lead concentrates but would be 'well-positioned to double production in the event of sustained metal price increases'.</p>

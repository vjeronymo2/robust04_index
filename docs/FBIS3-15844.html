			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Hold the Front Page!" </F> rubric: "`Lefortovo' Goes to Yerin"]    [Text] The Lefortovo remand unit has remained in joint  possession the Federal Counterintelligence Service and the  General Prosecutor's Office for only one week.    MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS reported earlier that as of 22  February, Lefortovo prison had been placed under the  jurisdiction of the General Prosecutor's Office while remaining  on the Federal Counterintelligence Service's books. Now  Yeltsin's secret directive hands over Lefortovo remand unit, as  of 1 March, to the financial care of the Ministry of Internal  Affairs. From now on, the Ministry of Internal Affairs owns all  Lefortovo property -- the building, weapons, and vehicles used  in the remand unit. Simultaneously, all Lefortovo personnel  have been transferred to serve in the Ministry of Internal  Affairs system.    This decision was of course called for by the recent scandal  around the release of the October revolt leaders from the  prison. Yeltsin seems to want the prison to be controlled in the  future by people he trusts explicitly -- that is, [Internal  Affairs Minister Viktor] Yerin and his team.</p>

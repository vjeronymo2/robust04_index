			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom penh, June 16 (XINHUA) -- The two-day round  table talks of the working group on peace and national  reconciliation in Cambodia broke down here today without  reaching any agreement.    After today's closed-door meeting, a spokeman of the  Cambodian Royal Government and the National Assembly told  reporters that the meeting is over without any result. However,  he did not want to say "the meeting has failed."    The spokesman said today's meeting discussed the cease-fire  issue only and did not deal with the minimun political platform  proposed by the Democratic Kampuchea Party (DKP).    The government side insisted on reaching an agreement on the  timetable of the cease-fire first, but the DKP wanted to discuss  details of setting up a cease-fire committee.    The government side noted that there is no need to meet  again  as the two round-table talks ended fruitlessly while the DKP  suggested continuation of the talks.    Nhiek Tioulong, representative of King Norodom Sihanouk,  said  he will report to the king about the talks and Sihanouk would  decide whether or not to continue the talks.</p>

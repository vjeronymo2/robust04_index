			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREMATURE QUADRUPLETS ALL IN FAIR CONDITION;  </P> <P> NEWBORNS: O.C.'S NEWEST MOTHER OF QUADS GETS SOME HELPFUL HINTS FROM ANOTHER  RECENT PARENT, KAREN MINER.  </P> <P> Quadruplets -- three girls and a boy -- born to a Santa Ana couple Wednesday  night were all in fair condition Thursday at UCI Medical Center.  </P> <P> Doctors said the boy, Jeremy Stewart Amante, who has been receiving oxygen,  will require medication to help close an opening between his heart and lungs  that is common in premature infants.  </P> <P> But at 3 pounds, 9 1/2 ounces, Jeremy is the largest of the quads and is  expected to do fine, said Dr. James Banks, the neonatologist on duty at the  intensive care unit. The babies, small enough to be cradled together in two  palms, arrived 11 weeks early and were all delivered by Cesarean section within  two minutes.  </P> <P> "These babies are big, healthy 29-weekers," said Banks. "They are doing  absolutely wonderfully, which is unusual in itself."  </P> <P> Meanwhile their mother, 28-year-old Consolacion (Solly) Amante, has already  received flowers, reassurances and how-to tips from Orange County's other  recent veteran of quadruplets.  </P> <P> "It hasn't been bad at all," said Karen Miner, an Orange schoolteacher who gave  birth to two boys and two girls seven months ago, and now has "one crawler and  three scooters."  </P> <P> "I kept waiting for the bomb to drop, for it to get unbearable and terrible,  but it hasn't," Miner said Thursday. "I only hope Solly has it as easy."  </P> <P> What the new mother will need most, Miner said, is full-time help. Other  essential tools for quad-rearing, she said, include baby swings.  </P> <P> "Battery-run, definitely, because she's never going to have time to go wind up  those swings. And she needs a battery recharger, because she's not going to be  able to afford to keep buying batteries," Miner said.  </P> <P> The three Amante girls -- Jeraldine Elaine and Jessamine Eileen, both 2 pounds  14 1/2 ounces, and Jacqueline Elise, 2 pounds 12 ounces -- were being fed for  the first time Thursday afternoon with a half-strength formula specially  blended for premature infants.  </P> <P> Because of their virtually identical features, which include matching dimples  on their left cheeks, doctors and nurses suspect the three girls are identical,  meaning they developed from the same egg. They won't know for sure, however,  until tests have been completed on blood samples and the four placentas.  </P> <P> "The girls are beautiful. They look just like their mother," said Mari Jo  Craft, head nurse of the Infant Special Care Unit.  </P> <P> All four babies have shocks of jet-black curly hair covered by tiny ski caps --  pink and white for the girls, blue and white for Jeremy.  </P> <P> "He's got a forehead just like his father," Craft said.  </P> <P> At least three other sets of quadruplets have been born in Orange County. In  1969, Mrs. Robert Curtin of Garden Grove gave birth to four boys, three of whom  survived. Janet and Scott Lederhaus, formerly of Santa Ana and now of  Claremont, had three boys and a girl in 1983, and they helped prepare Al and  Karen Miner before their quads were born on Feb. 12.  </P> <P> Unlike the previous two sets of quadruplets, the Amante babies are natural and  not the result of fertility drugs, doctors said. The chances of such a  spontaneous birth are about one in 512,000, said Manuel Porto, who delivered  both the Miner and the Amante quadruplets.  </P> <P> However, Solly Amante, also the mother of 4-year-old Jonathan and 1-year-old  Jane Amante, did receive special prenatal care.  </P> <P> The 5-foot-1, small-boned Filipino mother learned that she was having  quadruplets only when she had an ultrasound late this summer. She spent most of  the last two months in bed.  </P> <P> "They were packed in there very tightly," reported head nurse Craft. "It was  probably like popcorn popping when they moved."  </P> <P> Solly Amante was hospitalized with premature contractions on Aug. 20. Doctors  gave her steroids to accelerate the growth of the fetuses and sought to delay  delivery so that the babies would be more fully developed at birth, Banks said.  </P> <P> That strategy seemed to have paid off, Banks said, noting that the babies were  unusually hardy for quadruplets born nearly three months early.  </P> <P> Amante was not up to an interview Thursday, but nurses said she would be seeing  the babies for the first time since their birth.  </P> <P> "I'm excited," said their father, Oscar Amante, 30, who works for an Irvine  computer printer manufacturer and was on his way to visit the newborns Thursday  afternoon. "I was in shock, but I'm excited."  </P> <P> Doctors said the mother may be well enough to go home within three to four  days, but the quadruplets will not be able to follow until each has reached 5  pounds.  </P> <P> When they do come home, Miner said, organization is key. Every day, she  prepares 20 bottles for the following day, keeps records of each baby's feeding  and changing to prevent slip-ups and has mastered the art of feeding two quads  in her lap while sticking a bottle in the mouth of a third.  </P> <P> Six weeks ago, the Miners even went away for the weekend and left the quads  with their grandparents. "I said to Al, the key is not how they did this time,  but will they ever do it again?" she said about their baby-sitters.  </P> <P> Among her other advice for the Amantes: "Remember that babies do cry. Take one  day at a time. And accept the help. Say yes, yes, yes, yes."  </P></p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Leyland Daf set for Pounds 4.8m boost: Government body ready to supply part of finance needed for management buy-out A GOVERNMENT body is ready to provide a crucial part of the finance needed for the proposed management buy-out of Leyland Daf's Birmingham van plant from the receivers. The cash injection, worth up to Pounds 4.8m, would come through a purchase by Birmingham Heartlands Development Corporation of land occupied by Leyland Daf and on top of equity from 3i, the venture capital group, bank loans and investment assistance from the government. Mr Jim Beeston, the corporation's chief executive, refused to confirm the purchase, but noted that the corporation had powers 'to buy land, to grant development aid, to improve land and to support training initiatives'. The corporation is a statutory body charged with the economic regeneration of the east Birmingham area where Leyland Daf's Washwood Heath plant is situated. Mr Beeston said its board had concluded that it could not afford to spend a large part of its Pounds 5m annual budget, which it receives from the Environment Department, on Leyland Daf. However, he said he expected an announcement 'at the end of next week or the following week', implying that the corporation would receive government funds to buy the land over the next few days. Mr Ken Ogilvy, of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountant assembling finance for the buy-out team, said he was expecting a formal offer to purchase land. The buy-out team is expected to take control on April 19. Whitehall funding is one of three main elements in the financial package put together for the buy-out team, led by Mr Allan Amey, to purchase the Washwood Heath plant from Arthur Andersen, the Leyland Daf receiver. The other two are equity from a consortium led by 3i and borrowings provided by an undisclosed UK bank. A further element of the official funding is to be an unknown amount of regional selective assistance from the Department of Trade and Industry. This assistance, under the terms of the Industrial Development Act 1982, has to be used for capital projects and is normally drawn down in instalments dependent on the progress of the project. Although readiness to provide cash for Leyland Daf demonstrates the government's expressed desire to support manufacturing industry, such funding is rare from a government which has preferred to allow market forces to settle the destiny of failed companies. In February, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, ruled out government finance to meet losses at the plant, but said assistance would be available for capital projects. The land in question covers about 40 acres of the 105 acres occupied by Leyland Daf at Washwood Heath, said Mr Ogilvy. It was originally intended for the company's Excel van joint venture with Renault, the French vehicle manufacturer, which was scrapped after Leyland Daf called in receivers. The corporation had had the land independently valued and would not be paying more than the receiver would have been able to obtain, Mr Ogilvy said. He would not disclose the size of the deal, but property analysts believe the land, given the contamination likely after 70 years of industrial use, is not worth more than Pounds 120,000 an acre. This points to an overall purchase price of up to Pounds 4.8m. The van plant has enough orders to keep production going for the next six weeks. Mr Ogilvy said many companies had been holding off placing orders. 'They won't sanction the orders until they know they are not buying an obsolete vehicle,' he added. Production has been scaled down by the receivers to 200 vehicles a week and the workforce cut by over half to 1,000. 'There are no more planned redundancies,' said Mr Ogilvy. The immediate future is clouded by Automotive Products' suspension of clutch and brake systems deliveries to the plant. The company has been in dispute with the receiver about the non-payment of bills. The van plant has enough components for only three days of production next week. However, a willingness to resolve the issue has been evident in talks between Automotive Products and the receiver and between the management buy-out team and Automotive Products. David Owen adds: The expected cash injection will add to suspicions that Mr Heseltine, fresh from securing Commons' approval for his coal white paper, may be ready to give his interventionist instincts freer rein. Earlier this week, Mr Richard Needham, a trade and industry minister, unveiled plans to encourage British companies to work closer together in bidding for large projects in foreign markets, as part of a wide-ranging effort to boost UK exports. The Labour party, which this week published its own detailed proposals for reversing the UK's manufacturing decline, has repeatedly used the Leyland Daf collapse and the government's reaction to it to taunt Mr Heseltine over his promise to last year's Conservative party conference to help British industry. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, last month called on the government to demonstrate its commitment to British manufacturing by ensuring a future for Leyland Daf. John Griffiths adds: The UK receivers and Daf Trucks NV, the new company running Leyland Daf's former parent in Holland, said yesterday they had jointly established a sales company, Leyland Daf Trucks, to market trucks built by both the Dutch operation and Leyland Daf's trucks plant in Lancashire. Leyland Daf Vans has already been established for the Birmingham vans operation. Truck sales recovery peters out, Page 5</p>

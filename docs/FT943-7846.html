			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Dollar wobbles The US dollar yesterday lost further ground on the foreign exchanges as negative sentiment towards the US currency persisted, writes Philip Gawith. Despite repeated Bank of Japan intervention during Asian trading, the dollar ebbed lower to close in London at Y98.475 from Y99.025. Against the D-Mark, it finished at DM1.5396 from DM1.5456. Elsewhere attention was focused on the Swedish krona, as the market awaited details of the opposition social democratic party's budget savings plan. The figure of a SKr61bn cut over four years was well received by the market, and the krona closed in London at SKr5.008 from SKr5.048. After losing a pfennig during early trade, sterling firmed slightly to close at DM2.3836 from DM2.3889. There was no fresh data for the dollar to respond to, but Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan (Europe), said its renewed weakness 'was a reminder that it is the level of rates that matters, rather than the process of raising them, so long as the level is seen as inappropriate.' He noted also that the incentives currently for Japanese investors to buy dollar assets was low. The rate differential between US and Japan is currently only 300 basis points, historically the minimum level required to get Japanese investors into the dollar. This is insufficient when set against the risks of further trade tensions, with the September 30 deadline in procurement talks looming. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at the Bank of America in London, said the dollar, like various European currencies, was reflecting political issues. Whereas President Clinton's authority is under assault, Chancellor Kohl in Germany has seen his ratings improve considerably since the turn of the year. 'Politics are now almost as big an issue as the numbers and interest rates,' said Mr Hawkins. Sterling failed to profit from a better than expected set of trade figures. The July deficit with non-EU states was Pounds 418m, compared to a market expectation of about Pounds 600m. Mr Hawkins noted that current sterling weakness was overwhelmingly a residual effect of movements in dollar/D-Mark, rather than a case of independent currency weakness. Recent good inflation data, however, which have probably delayed the prospect of higher rates in the UK, could have contributed to market disappointment in the pound. The average rate of discount at the weekly treasury bill tender fell to 5.254 per cent from 5.375 per cent. In the cash market sterling three month LIBOR slipped to 5 7/16 from 5 1/2 . Mr Ross Jones, a director at Gerrard and National, said the current difference between cash and futures market rates was 'staggering'. The December short sterling contract finished at 93.38, seven basis points up on the day, but still discounting 135 basis point rise in rates by the end of the year. Mr Jones commented: 'I don't think there is a need for a rise in rates this year on any grounds.' In its daily operations, the Bank of England provided Pounds 425m assistance at established rates compared to a forecast shortage of Pounds 600m. Overnight money traded between 4 and 5 per cent.</p>

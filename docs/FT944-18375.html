			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Lift veil to reveal insider dealers Sir, In common with similar inquiries, the investigation into insider dealing in Consgold shares ran into the inevitable brick wall that it is not always possible to identify the ultimate beneficiary of the organisation buying the shares ('S African leak in Consgold bid run-up - DTI says majority of dealings in call options were 'wholly abnormal' ', September 30). There seems to be a simple solution to this: make it a requirement upon all intermediaries through which financial instruments are bought/sold that they can only do so if they are aware of the true owner of the investment and that they are empowered to reveal his identity, if required. There is a reasonable parallel to this approach in the procedures which now have to be undertaken by banks in order to prevent money laundering. If the veil of secrecy could be lifted from all shareholdings, the incidence of insider dealing would fall dramatically. Anthony Woodward, 93 Ashbury Road, London SW11</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 3:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statement in the preamble to the proposed rule that each sector has the capacity to take a substantial portion, if not all, of the harvest guideline is inconsistent with the statement in the preamble to the proposed rule that the shore-based sector will have the opportunity to take more than double its historical catch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statements in the proposed rule preamble are not inconsistent. They acknowledge that the historical shoreside catch has not reached what is believed to be existing shoreside capacity. As explained in the response to comment 1, the 1994 shoreside reserve is higher than past performance in part due to the large increase in the whiting harvest guideline and the application of a fixed percentage to that harvest guideline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 4:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The analysis accompanying the rule assumes that the at-sea fleet is not a participant in the fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS disagrees. The EA/RIR contains substantial information regarding recent operations by the at-sea processing fleet. However, the level of participation by that fleet under the limited entry program, which was implemented on January 1, 1994, and under various allocation options, still is not known with certainty. The limited entry fishery established a window period and certain requirements that must be met for a vessel to receive an initial limited entry permit. Most, if not all, catcher/processors did not meet the qualifications. They are treated the same as other non-qualifying vessels that operated in the groundfish fishery after the window period. The number and types of vessels that would attempt to acquire limited entry permits were unknown at the time the analytical documents were prepared. However, reasonable assumptions were made and catcher/processor participation was considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 5:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenter disagreed with the statement that ``the Council is concerned about the impacts on traditional fishermen and the rural coastal communities where they reside, focusing on those displaced by Americanization of joint venture fisheries.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This statement in the proposed rule reflects the Council's position as it appears in the EA/RIR. NMFS acknowledges that Americanization of the whiting fishery, as contemplated under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act), provided additional employment in the domestic processing sector. It also resulted in displacement of those whiting catcher vessels that had delivered to foreign processing vessels but could not find alternative domestic markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 6: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters, one representing the majority of at-sea processing vessels, stated that any release of surplus shoreside reserve should not be made until October 15, after the end of the pollock ``B'' season in Alaska.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS has not changed the August 15 release date that was part of the negotiated agreement by the industry subcommittee and recommended by the Council. This date was selected because it provided an equal opportunity for participation by vessels in the at-sea processing fleet, particularly smaller catcher vessels delivering to motherships, to operate before weather deteriorates or whiting migrate north to Canadian waters. A later release could disproportionately benefit catcher/processors that are larger and more capable of fishing successfully in rough weather. With an August 15 release, both mothership and catcher/processor operations would have an opportunity to participate, but may have to choose between the pollock ``B'' season or the whiting fishery. With some vessels choosing to fish in Alaska, effort in the whiting fishery in August would be lower than in the spring, which, given the lower amount of whiting that may be available, would support an orderly fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments Supporting the Proposed Rule:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eight letters from the shore-based fishing and processing sector were received in favor of the proposed rule. The letters supported the negotiated agreement that recognizes the differences in shore-based and at-sea operations, allows each sector to operate at its maximum efficiency levels, and provides increased stability to coastal communities and the fishing industry. A comment also was received from an organization representing at-sea processors that supported the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40-percent reserve for the shore-based sector. However, as summarized above, this organization did not agree with the release date or with some of the statements in the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Clarification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule also revises an incorrect cross-reference at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;663.7, which should read &sect;663.23(b)(4)(iv). This revision was stated correctly in the regulatory text of the proposed rule, but incorrectly in the preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Classification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule is published under the authority of the Magnuson Act, 16 U.S.C. 1801  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), has determined that it is necessary for management of the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery and that it is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AA finds good cause under section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act to make this rule effective upon filing at the Office of the Federal Register. If this rule is not effective on April 15, 1994, the date that the at-sea processing fleet may begin operations, or shortly thereafter, preemption of the shoreside processing sector by the at-sea sector would be a real possibility. Therefore, delaying the effective date of this rule for 30 days is contrary to the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 663 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fisheries, Fishing, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

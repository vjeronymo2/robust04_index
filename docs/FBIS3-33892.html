			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Describing the continued gross human rights  violations against innocent and unarmed Kashmiris as reminiscent  of the darkest days of the holocaust and the situation in Bosnia  as grave and appalling, Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto urged  the comity of nations to uphold the universal declaration of  human rights which is often extensively violated with impunity.  She was addressing the 50th session of the commission on human  rights in Geneva today.    [Begin Bhutto recording] Two-thirds of Kashmir has remained  under Indian occupation for the past 45 years. India first  accepted but then refused to implement the UN Security Council  resolution calling for a plebiscite under UN auspices. Over  40,000 -- 40,000 -- Kashmiri men, women, and children have died.  The martyrs' graves in Srinagar are flowing over as are the  tears of the Kashmiri mothers, wives, and daughters. Despite  its repression, India has failed to impose its will on the  indomitable people of Jammu and Kashmir. The intensity of the  resistance has grown. The Kashmiri political leadership  representing over 30 parties and groups has unanimously declared  that it will not contemplate any solution which implies the  continuation of Indian rule. Their demand is simple -- Azadi,  freedom. People cannot be suppressed indefinitely, tyranny  cannot long endure. That is the lesson of history. The  situation in Kashmir is as intolerable as is the world silent.    It is time for the world community to prevail upon India to  remove the additional forces it has put into Kashmir to conduct  its campaign of repression. It is time for the world community  to demand that India leaves its draconian emergency laws which  allow its Army to commit atrocities in Kashmir without being  answerable to anyone.    The settlement of the Kashmir dispute based on the wishes of  its people is the key to peace and progress in South Asia, South  Asia which is home to one-fifth of humanity. We cannot  celebrate the triumph of the universal declaration on rights.  These rights are being violated extensively often with impunity  without compunction, or conscience or remorse in almost every  part of the world. [end recording]    About Bosnia, the prime minister urged the world community  to  help preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of  Bosnia. The consequences of ethnic cleansing must be reversed,  she stressed.</p>

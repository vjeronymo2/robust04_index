			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Brussels faces hurdles on enlargement Norway's No to membership of the European Union means that the EU will have to act quickly if it is to meet its target of January 1 1995 for entry of its three other new members - Austria, Finland, and Sweden. The immediate threat is Spain's insistence that it receive improved fishing rights won during accession negotiations with Norway last March, specifically entry into the Common Fisheries Policy with Portugal by January 1 1996. The negative result of the Norwegian referendum will also mean less money for the EU budget. Preliminary calculations in Brussels yesterday suggested that the EU coffers faces a shortfall of Ecu378m (Pounds 297.5m) next year, rising to more than Ecu1bn by 1998. Norway's No also leaves a question mark over the future of the European Economic Area - the halfway house which links the EU and the European Free Trade Association. With Austria, Finland and Sweden about to join the EU club, the EEA looks a lot less robust with the remaining membership trio of Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. In Brussels yesterday, the public mood was one of disappointment. But most diplomats said they had already discounted a No vote, mindful of the Norwegian public's negative response in an earlier referendum in 1972. 'Enlargement can still be considered a success,' said one Commission official, 'because we got three out of four countries to join.' EU ambassadors will start work later this week in making technical amendments to the accession treaties including fisheries, voting rights in the Council of Ministers, and the budgets. The goal is to reach agreement at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on December 19, so that all 12 member states can deposit ratification instruments in Rome by midnight on December 31. The most serious obstacle concerns Spain's insistence that the EU integrate the Spanish and Portuguese fleets into the common fisheries policy in 1996. The concession was part of a deal to allow fish-rich Norway to preserve its own conservation rights in its own waters. Spain's demands have run into opposition from the UK and Ireland which are reluctant to allow the Iberian fleets into the 'Western Waters' around the 'Irish box' in the Irish sea. But the Spanish parliament is refusing to vote on the accession treaty unless there is a legal guarantee on entry to the CFP. A Commission official said yesterday that the issue may have to be settled at the European Council summit in Essen on December 9 and 10.</p>

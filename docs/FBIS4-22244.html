			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kirill Varov: "Did Kashpirovskiy Send </F> Zhirinovskiy?"]    [Text] In the style of recent days, psychotherapist  A. Kashpirovskiy, who has been abroad across the ocean for many  months, addressed the State Duma with his own message, informing  it from far-off America of his intention to leave the membership  of the parliamentary faction of the LDPR [Liberal-Democratic  Party of Russia].    During the pre-electoral campaign, much ink was spilled over  the somewhat strange alliance between the first Russian liberal,  V. V. Zhirinovskiy, and the television hypnotist who  successfully rid progressive mankind of enuresis [incontinency].  There was even some talk that Kashpirovskiy either secretly  hypnotized voters or, at least, taught V. V. Zhirinovskiy the  art of giving a post-hypnotic suggestion from the television  screen.    Now, however, the correspondence-deputy A. Kashpirovskiy, as  they affirm, has seen the light, seeing, in his words, the  contrast between the pre-electoral program of the LDPR which was  humane in its essenceand the provocational position of its  leader, V. V. Zhirinovskiy. He, Kashpirovskiy, they say, was  always totally in favor of respect for national and religious  rights, of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of foreign  states, and of free education and medical care. Zhirinovskiy,  however, having reneged on his former promises, preaches  national intolerance, sows dissention and provokes military  conflicts. In short, Kashpirovskiy has decided to divorce  himself not so much from the LDPR as from V. V. Zhirinovskiy,  since the latter has betrayed the declared ideals. However,  today one does not exist without the other, and that, evidently,  is why Kashpirovskiy is leaving the liberal-democratic faction.  As it became clear, if the psychotherapist had known that  departure from the faction does not mean automatic expulsion  from the State Duma, he would have taken this step long ago. It  turns out that even prophets are not given everything to know.    Then again, we cannot exclude the possibility that  Kashpirovskiy simply wants to call attention to himself once  again, in the style of that very same Zhirinovskiy.</p>

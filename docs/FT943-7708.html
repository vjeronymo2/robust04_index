			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Boots reaches for gas mask defence: The chemist is being sued by staff over its wartime use of asbestos Boots, the chemist, retailing and pharmaceutical group, will receive within the next month High Court writs from up to 20 women claiming compensation for injuries allegedly caused by their working with asbestos in a Nottingham factory making gas masks during the second world war. The cases follow an out-of-court settlement in the US last week which could lead to the compensation of 100,000 Americans who contracted diseases after being exposed to asbestos. The settlement, costing Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 830m) involves 20 asbestos companies, including T&amp;N, which was the major supplier in the UK. The writs against Boots will claim negligence. Mr Richard Meeran of Leigh Day, the London solicitors acting for the women, said the writs would say to Boots: 'You ought to have been aware, probably were aware, of the risks at the factory. You should have provided adequate protection. As a result of this omission, they (the women employed at the factory) developed asbestos-related diseases.' Mrs Doris Roe, 77, and Mrs Florence Sewell, 83, both of Nottingham, have had applications accepted for the legal aid necessary to pursue the case. A further 18 applications are outstanding, said Mr Mike Ward, secretary of the Asbestos Related Diseases Association, which is shepherding the cases to court. The Boots factory in Nottingham employed 1,200 people. It was one of four in the UK making gas masks during the war. The others were in Birmingham, Blackburn and Leyland. Mr Ward claimed the inhalation of asbestos fibres led eventually to the deaths of 200 former employees of the plant between 1965 and 1992. Such inhalation can lead to respiratory diseases under the general heading of asbestosis and mesothelioma, the growth of tumours on the lining of the lung. The incidence of asbestos-related diseases and the cost of compensating those who contracted them has led to a sharp decline in the production and use of asbestos. But in the 1940s one of its uses was as a filter in gas masks. The Asbestos Related Diseases Association has taken up the question of compensation for the Nottingham employees directly with Boots and wants a Pounds 5m fund established. The Boots legal department met Mr Ward and Mr Meeran on July 21. The two sides agreed to meet again but no date has yet been set. Mr Meeran said work to establish a compensation fund and the pursuit of the legal cases against Boots would run concurrently. Mr Mike Gates, head of pharmaceuticals public relations at Boots, said of the compensation fund: 'We don't essentially have any problem with that. But this is not just a problem for Boots.' He noted that the gas masks were made to government specifications: 'We didn't want to make them, we were told to.' Boots had no past experience of making asbestos-related products and it has not made any since the war. 'Resolution of the problem has to involve all the gas-mask manufacturers and the government,' Mr Gates said. Mr Ward claimed that the working conditions at the Boots factory did not comply with the Factories Act 1937. But Mr Gates said 'the Boots plant was considered to be state-of-the-art at the time' and its design was duplicated elsewhere. The original Boots gas-mask plant was bombed and destroyed, forcing the move of production elsewhere. The present Boots management has no knowledge of the technology used in the gas mask manufacture. However, Mr Meeran said: 'All the women we've spoken to had the same story: they had no protection.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aslak Bonde: "Government: Withdrawal From EU </F> Possible"]    [Text] In its report on the European Union [EU] to the  Storting, the government plays down the significance of the  Maastricht Treaty. The report also states that Norway can  withdraw from the EU.    "It is natural to see the introduction of economic and  monetary union with a common currency as a further development  within the framework of the Single Internal Market and the  gradual convergence of member states' economic policies that  have been the goals of the EC since the Treaty of Rome was  adopted in 1957."    This quotation from the report to the Storting on EU  membership is not perhaps so very controversial for most people,  but it will give rise to reactions. It is an illustration of  how the government now views the Union treaty.    After the treaty came into existence -- at the Maastricht  summit in December 1991 -- there was general agreement that the  EC had taken a big step in the direction of integration.  Economic and monetary union (EMU) was seen as something  qualitatively different from the existing community. In  addition there were formulations in the treaty that could pave  the way for foreign and security policy union. The treaty also  provided for citizenship of the union and opened the way for  coordination in the fields of justice and policing. The EC also  changed its name to the European Union.    The government does not view these changes as fundamental.  In a discussion of the Constitution's paragraph 93 (the  so-called EU paragraph) reference is made to legal evaluations  made in 1967, and it is stated that the changes that have  happened since then are not so great as to indicate that new  conclusions should be reached.    This could be of great significance. If it happens at some  point in the future that the Storting has to decide whether the  krone is to be replaced by a common EU currency, it will not  necessarily have to do so with a three-quarters majority. Trade  Minister Grete Knudsen confirmed this at Friday's [3 June] news  conference on the EU report.    On the other hand the further development of cooperation in  the justice sector or in the foreign and security policy area  will need a three-quarters majority in the Storting.    An important point in the report to the Storting is that the  Maastricht Treaty's stipulations in these areas only have the  status of international law. Norwegian membership now will not  give the various EU bodies any direct authority over Norwegian  citizens or companies in the field of justice or in the security  field.    We are not relinquishing any sovereignty in the traditional  sense of the word.    The government is also discussing what will happen if  conflicts arise between EC law and Norwegian law. Initially  membership means that EC law takes precedence -- particularly in  the economic field.    The Storting report states that it is a Norwegian court that  will have the job of reaching a judgment if there is a conflict  between the EU's rules and Norwegian legislation. The  government does not think that such conflicts will arise. If  they do, the report asserts that the EU Court has little scope  for action. It could declare that the Norwegian legislation  conflicts with EC law, but it cannot declare decisions made by  national authorities to be invalid.    Both the Treaty of Rome and the Maastricht Treaty state that  they are valid for an unlimited period of time, and they contain  no rules covering withdrawal from them. This has led many EU  opponents and lawyers to claim that Norway's decision this fall  is irrevocable.    The government makes use of legal and political  counterarguments.    In the legal context the government refers to the Vienna  Convention on treaty law and concludes that the EU treaties are  of a type that can be terminated. It also points out that  Greenland actually withdrew from the EC and that Britain had a  referendum in 1975 in which the question asked was about a  possible withdrawal.    "A `no' would naturally have led to withdrawal," the report  argues.    However, this presupposes that Norway and the EU negotiate  the terms of a withdrawal, if this were to happen.</p>

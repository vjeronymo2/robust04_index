			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE IN ENTERTAINMENT  </P> <P> Gloria Estefan's recent traffic accident brought an outpouring of concern from  fans and friends. The New York hospital where Miami Sound Machine's vivacious  32-year-old singer underwent surgery for a broken back was flooded with  flowers, balloons and phone calls from around the world. Well-wishers included  fellow performers Elton John, Diana Ross, Madonna, Bruce Springsteen and Jon  Bon Jovi, as well as President Bush who, only hours before the accident, had  met with the Estefans at the White House to discuss their anti-drug work.  Gloria's husband, 37-year-old Emilio Estefan Jr., thanked doctors and fans for  their support. "I don't care if she never danced again," he said. "I'm just  happy she's alive." Later, when Gloria left the hospital in April to continue  her recuperation in Miami, her doctor said she should be back at full strength  in six months, and might even be able to dance the conga again.  </P> <P> Good news about Anthony Quinn, so well recovered from his recent bypass surgery  that he has returned to work on "A Star for Two," in which the veteran actor,  75, plays a doctor. The film also stars Lauren Bacall.  </P> <P> Placido Domingo and Julio Iglesias have melodiously joined voices on Manuel  Alejandro's haunting composition "Sonadores de Espana" ("Dreamers of Spain").  Domingo, who insists he is not turning his back on opera, nonetheless admits he  would like Mexican composer Armando Manzanero to open him to some "pop" songs.  And when he recently guested on Joan Rivers' TV show, the tenor confessed he  keeps his voice in top condition by not talking much the day before a  performance.  </P> <P> Hollywood's latest "discovery," Trini Alvarado, the young actress who garnered  superb reviews as Bette Midler's daughter in the movie "Stella," is the  real-life daughter of Flamenco singer Domingo Alvarado, a Spaniard who settled  in New York many years ago while touring with the late great Carmen Amaya. The  New-York born Trini (whose mother is Puerto Rican) made her screen debut at age  12 in the movie "Rich Kids." ELENA KELLNER  </P></p>

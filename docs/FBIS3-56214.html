Cherry Orchard-94"]    [Text] In 18 months or so Kutuzovskiy Prospekt will be  transformed from a government highway into a sort of Capitol  Hill. Yesterday, a government commission decided at its meeting  on where to build a new State Duma building.    Apparently, this is the final decision. It turned out that  the question has been under discussion, without too much  publicity, for as long as two months. From the outset there  have been two proposals. The first option was to split the  government complex into two parts. The residential part was to  be built on the outskirts of the White House, and the office  building at the "Krasnaya Presnya" stadium. Apart from the fact  that the area is cramped for space, which embarrasses both the  customers and the builders, the Duma's proximity to the U.S.  Embassy does not suit the special services. They were not  embarrassed, though, when the White House was built, nor did  they have any doubts about moving the government there.    The second option, however, suited everyone -- it gives room  for frolicking. Over 20 hectares between Kutuzovskiy Prospekt  and the Belarusian railway line will turn into a construction  site for the future parliamentary center. The complex of  buildings itself will be erected right in front of the Arch of  Triumph. Deputies will also be able to run to the Borodino  Panorama [exhibition of war against Napoleon] during breaks  between meetings.    Four years ago, a Foreign Ministry complex, nicknamed  Shevardnadze's congress center, was nearly built on that same  spot. A competition of blueprints was even conducted. But it  fell through.... This time, the commission will be very  meticulous in studying new blueprints. The thirst for  civilization is so great that there are already plans to send  messengers to Brussels, Strasbourg, and Bonn soon to study  Europe's best parliamentary architecture.</p>

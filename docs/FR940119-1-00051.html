			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS proposes to take the 13-mt reduction in the U.S. quota from the 31 mt reserve, thereby continuing or slightly modifying the 1992/1993 quota allocations. The following quota allocations would be established for 1994: General category_531 mt; Harpoon Boat category_53 mt; Purse Seine category_301 mt; Incidental Catch category_southern longline subcategory quota of 86 mt, northern longline subcategory quota of 23 mt, and ``other'' subcategory quota of 4 mt; Angling category_219 mt (no more than 99 mt of this quota may be school bluefin of which 47 mt may be landed south of 38 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;47 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; N. latitude and 52 mt may be landed north of 38 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;47 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; N. latitude). The Angling category quota for school bluefin is reduced from 100 mt to 99 mt because it is based, per ICCAT recommendation, on 8 percent of the total U.S. quota (including reserve), which is lower for 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also at the November 1993 meeting, ICCAT recommended a quota of 1,200 mt for the western Atlantic for 1995 (of which U.S. fishermen would receive 743 mt). This reduction of over 50 percent from the 1991 western Atlantic quota is based upon scientific assessments that indicate that present harvest levels are resulting in a decrease in the size of the western Atlantic bluefin stock. The relatively higher 1994 allocation resulted from a 1-year provision to allow additional time for scientific research, a review of data and methodologies used in the western Atlantic bluefin stock assessment, and to reduce the short-term economic impact on fishermen. As a member of ICCAT, the United States is obligated to adopt domestic regulations to comply with these recommendations. This proposed rule would establish quota allocations by fishing categories for 1994 only. The quota reduction for 1995, being of greater magnitude and likely to have significant impacts on the human environment, will be addressed in future rulemaking, which will include preparation and public review of an environmental impact statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Change in Bycatch Conditions for Southern Longline Subcategory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1982, ICCAT recommended a ban on a directed bluefin tuna fishery in the Gulf of Mexico spawning area out of concern for protection of the spawning stock. NMFS examination of available longline fishery data regarding discarded bluefin in the Gulf of Mexico revealed that more than 80 percent of those bluefin released were dead. Thus, in the interest of reducing waste, NMFS allowed landing of bluefin tuna but implemented longline fishery restrictions to preclude directed harvest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a final rule dated January 26, 1981 (46 FR 8012), NMFS implemented an incidental catch limit of two giant bluefin per trip in the area south of 36 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; N. latitude and 2 percent by weight of all other fish on board per trip in the area north of that latitude. The reason for the disparity in the catch limits between the two regions was that the 2 percent by weight limit was believed to be unenforceable in southern ports due to the lack of weighing facilities in many areas where bluefin were landed. On January 6, 1992 (57 FR 365), NMFS determined that the incidental catch limit of two giant bluefin per trip in the southern area was not effective at reducing bluefin bycatch and changed the restriction for this area to one bluefin per trip, provided the vessel landed, offloaded, and sold at least 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg) of other species. NMFS believed that the majority of trips directed at other species met or exceeded the threshold, making accurate weighing unnecessary in most cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS has received several comments indicating that the current bycatch restriction in the southern area is causing an increase in bluefin discard and waste. Fishermen have reported that when a bluefin is caught early in a trip, they are forced to continue fishing at the risk of deteriorating quality and price and at the risk of having to discard additional bluefin in order to meet the target catch requirement of 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg). Examination of 1993 domestic observer data indicates that of 15 bluefin caught during observed trips, only four were retained (27 percent). Thus, reducing the target catch requirement could lead to a reduction in bluefin mortality.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS examined several options, none of which would change the allocation for the total longline bycatch. The options that were discussed at the scoping meetings were: (1) Require special gear; (2) set a requirement of a minimum number of days between a vessel's landings; and (3) revise the minimum target catch requirement of 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg). Recommendations also included prohibiting bluefin catches in the spawning grounds in the Gulf of Mexico or, conversely, to work through ICCAT to rescind the prohibition and establish a limited directed fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Special gear restrictions, such as breakaway leaders and circle hooks, are a management option, but further study is required to define exact specifications and enforcement methods. NMFS considered setting a minimum number of days between allowable landing of a bluefin by individual vessels but rejected this option because it could foster a periodic directed fishery for bluefin while not necessarily eliminating the problems of bluefin bycatch on longline trips directed at yellowfin tuna, swordfish, or sharks. NMFS also considered prohibiting the landing of bluefin by longliners during the spawning season in the Gulf of Mexico but rejected this option because it would have precluded retention of unavoidable bycatch that in many cases could not be released alive. NMFS also rejected a limited directed fishery, which would be inconsistent with the ICCAT recommendation. Given the depleted status of the bluefin resource and the significance of the Gulf of Mexico spawning grounds, NMFS does not consider a directed fishery to be warranted at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS believes that requiring threshold amounts to be landed ensures that bluefin are harvested only as bycatch incidental to fishing for other species. NMFS examined landings of Gulf of Mexico longline trips where no bluefin were taken to determine if the current target catch requirement of 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg) is appropriate. The data indicate that for years 1989 through 1991, the median values of landings for trips where no bluefin were sold were slightly above 1,500 lbs (680 kg) for the months of January through April, and about 3,500 lbs (1,588 kg) for the months of May through December. Therefore, NMFS proposes to amend the minimum poundage requirement so that for the southern management area for the Incidental Catch category one bluefin tuna may be landed per vessel per fishing trip, provided that for the months of January through April at least 1,500 lbs (680 kg) and for the months of May through December at least 3,500 lbs (1,588 kg), either dressed or round weight, of species other than Atlantic bluefin tuna are legally caught, retained, and offloaded from the same trip and are recorded on the dealer weighout as sold. This change should reduce waste and mortality of bluefin tuna, while preserving the quality and value of legitimate bluefin bycatch that is landed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

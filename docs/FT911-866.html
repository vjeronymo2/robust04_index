			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Tories in 'band' criticism: Council Tax TORY backbenchers joined with Labour MPs yesterday in criticising the narrow base of the new council tax which the government is proposing to introduce as a replacement for the poll tax. Mr Steven Norris (C Epping Forest) called for the number of property valuation bands to be increased from seven to nine, with Pounds 20,000 introduced as the new base, and Pounds 250,000 and over as the top range. Changes were also advocated by Mr Roger Sims (C Chislehurst) who complained that retention of the seven bands would result in people in his constituency with modest properties being placed in the same category as those in 'millionaires row'. Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, said the government had looked at 'various permutations' and had concluded that the seven-band arrangement (with Pounds 160,000 at the top of the range) was the most appropriate. He promised that if the consultation process being undertaken by the government indicated that there were specific areas in which the capital value process needed modification 'we will look at that'. Mr Heseltine said as the tax was designed for local authorities to administer and collect, it was appropriate for the government to proceed by consultation and not imposition. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, argued that the seven-band range reflected the government's determination to retain the poll tax principle by ensuring that the rich be protected from paying their 'full whack'. Mr Michael Portillo, local government minister, stressed that those in the most expensive properties would pay 2 1/2 times as much as those in the least expensive properties. He said this was 'a very fair apportionment of the burden'.</p>

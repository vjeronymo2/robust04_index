			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Carlton confidence Television and video company Carlton Communications maintained its strong market outperformance as some analysts took a close look at the latest data for video sales. Statistics in the trade press reveal that fourth-quarter sales of pre-recorded films and programmes in the US rocketed from Dollars 177m in 1988 to Dollars 520.5m last year. Carlton has the manufacturing and distribution rights for Disney and Warner which last year accounted for 40 per cent of sales and will this year take in sales of Snow White. The forecast for this year's pre-Christmas sales is Dollars 934m, almost double the 1993 figure. Carlton's slice of the cake might be reduced because of competition from Jurassic Park, distributed by Rank, but it is a larger cake. Carlton shares have outperformed the broad market by 16 per cent over the past year and 4 per cent over the past month. Yesterday the shares were relatively strong against the market, closing only 5 off at 891p. Rank shed 5 to 412p.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Hot under the collar over the dollar - A flood of cheap imports may result from falling US currency BRITISH TEXTILE and garment makers are facing another surge in competition from imports made cheaper by the falling dollar. It comes just when they were hoping that their heavy restructuring programmes were paying off. The message will be driven home in the next few weeks as the UK companies report their interim results. The figures should show that the cost-cutting of 1991 is bearing fruit. But unless there is a sharp recovery in the dollar, they will be accompanied by warnings that Far Eastern countries with currencies tied to the dollar, such as South Korea and Hong Kong, are pricing Europeans out of the market. At stake are more than just the remnants of a once great Old World industry. In recent years, manufacturers in the UK and elsewhere in Europe have been implementing a strategy to fight the drift of production to low cost countries. They cut a more expensive cloth and designed a more distinctive look. They automated distribution to fill shelves with their well-made, high margin goods. They invested to put fashions on the street sooner than Far Eastern competitors that are six weeks removed by ship. EC employment in clothing manufacture last year was more than 750,000 and output passed Dollars 65bn. The strategy is now at risk. The fall in the dollar has given rivals in the Far East a price advantage that allows them to sell to recession-hit customers at apparently unbeatable prices and quality. 'At two dollars to the pound, it is hard to see how anyone could have a profitable European base for clothing manufacture,' says Mr Neville Bain, chief executive of Coats Viyella, the world's biggest textiles manufacturing company. 'Even beyond Dollars 1.75, the UK and European industry has got some restructuring to do.' His views are shared by Mr Klaus Steilmann, whose eponymous company is Germany's biggest clothing manufacturer. 'The low dollar causes extreme pressure on German and European textile and clothing industries. Retailers are very cautious and are cutting back (orders) for spring 1993.' The currency question comes at a particularly sensitive time for the European industry as its strategy to move up market has just begun to bear fruit. Take men's shirts. Management consultancy Kurt Salmon Associates estimates the cost of manufacturing a man's shirt in the UK as Pounds 3 and in Germany Pounds 4.70. With productivity differences taken into account, a similar shirt in South Korea costs Pounds 2.16. In Hong Kong, the figure is Pounds 1.86. Not surprisingly, most men's shirts sold in the UK are imported. Over the past five years alone, import penetration has risen from 75 per cent to 85 per cent in volume terms. But the rise was because UK manufacturers concentrated on expensive shirts. Import penetration of men's shirts by value rather than volume has been steady over the five years at about 50 per cent. It may even have fallen slightly, according to the British Clothing Industry Association. There is evidence to suggest that the strategy has worked on a grander scale too. Total import penetration by volume in the UK apparel market has steadied at about 50 per cent over the last 18 months, having risen from 30 per cent over the previous five years, according to BZW, the stockbroker. At the same time, the trade deficit in clothing has begun to shrink in real terms, although it still stood at Pounds 1.8bn for the first half of 1992. Now clothing industry executives fear that the dollar's fall will make it hard not to lose ground once again. Already the the shirt manufacturing cost comparisons are out of date. Since Kurt Salmon Associates made its estimates, the dollar has fallen 16 per cent against sterling and 19 per cent against the D-Mark. 'The European currency bloc is ridiculously overvalued,' says Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, the UK's second biggest textiles company. 'Imports come in from countries with a dollar cost base like the Far East and you can't hedge against economic disadvantage. It's costing millions of pounds ' Unfortunately for textiles and clothing, a weak dollar has other effects that are also damaging. Earnings from sales in the US, the world's biggest single market, shrink when translated back into European currencies. Dawson International, known for its Pringle and Ballantyne cashmere clothes, earns 60 per cent of group operating profits in the US. 'Unless one is lowing margins it's very difficult to do business there. We will have to take it on the chin,' says Mr Ronald Miller, chairman. At Dollars 1.99 to the pound, he says, 'there is no money in it.' European companies are not entirely defenceless. They know that clothing and textiles are more vulnerable than most industries to the vagaries of currencies because so much of its output is traded internationally. Only oil and agriculture are more important in international trade. This means that most companies are international enough to survive. Many already have production in Asia or other low-cost centres; more than half Coats Viyella's sales, and 70 per cent of its profits, are generated by overseas subsidiaries. European manufacturers can also look to protection from import quotas set by the multi-fibre arrangement (MFA), a catalogue of detailed bilateral deals that specify ceilings on trade in named garments. For example, last year Hong Kong was allowed to send to Germany a maximum of 9.3m 'shirts, T-shirts, lightweight fineknot roll, polo or turtle necked jumpers and pullovers (other than of wool or fine animal hair), undervests and the like, knitted or crocheted'. A bureaucrat's employment scheme perhaps, but useful protection for European manufacturers. European suppliers also have retailers on their side, at least for the moment. Relationships between retailers and manufacturers have taken years to build-up and the inertia to keep them together is strong. 'For us to change our source of supply, we have to have the quality and design guarantees,' says Ms Liz Braun, buying director of men's and women's clothes at retailer BhS. And Marks and Spencer, the UK's biggest clothes retailer, insists: 'There is no way we are going to change our policy as a result of the fall in the dollar. If people want to buy cheaper they can always go somewhere else.' Retailers may not be able to hold on to these view for long. Sales are hard enough to come by in a recession, and now even fashion is swinging against the European way of manufacture. According to Ms Braun: 'During the late 80s, paying a premium price was a cool thing to do. Now it's a cool thing to have value.'  -----------------------------------------------       MAN'S STANDARD SHIRT PRODUCTION COST              (Pounds March 1992)  ----------------------------------------------- Germany                            4.71 Italy (grey economy)**             3.81 rest                               4.77 UK                                 3 South Korea                        2.16 Taiwan                             2.04 Mexico                             1.95 Hong Kong                          1.86 India                              1.50 Czechoslovakia                     1.26 Vietnam                            1.32  ----------------------------------------------- **Accounts for at least two thirds of production  ----------------------------------------------- Source: Kurt Salmon Associates  -----------------------------------------------</p>

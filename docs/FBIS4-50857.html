			<p>BFN     [Text] On the afternoon of 9 May, Governor Ruan Chongwu  was interviewed by Wen Chang-tao and two other producers of the  Taiwan Public Television Station. The three reporters of the  Taiwan Public Television Station arrived in Haikou on 7 May.  The aim of their visit was to shoot and produce a special  television film reflecting the scenery and investment  environment of Hainan in a bid to help Taiwan businessmen invest  in Hainan.    At the request of the guests, Ruan Chongwu gave an account  of  Taiwan businessmen investing in Hainan. He said that at  present, the volume of investment by Taiwan businessmen ranks  second among that from outside the border, and the actual  investment volume is about $400 million. Talking about the idea  of jointly developing Hainan Island in cooperation with  Singapore recently put forward by the Taiwan side, Ruan Chongwu  said: We welcome Taiwan's manufacturers to come to run  enterprises in Hainan at present and in the future, as we did in  the past. Talking about trades which most urgently need large  amounts of investment by Taiwan businessmen at present, Ruan  Chongwu said: Hainan welcomes Taiwan businessmen to invest in  any trade, but it is easiest to invest in agriculture at present  because Hainan and Taiwan have similar conditions and  environment in agriculture. With their technology, products,  experience in management, and methods for promoting sales,  Taiwan farm owners will find it very convenient to invest in  Hainan, and the amount of investment required is relatively  less. As a matter of fact, Taiwan businessmen who have already  invested in agriculture in Hainan have obtained handsome  profits. Also, we are willing to cooperate with the Taiwan side  in industry, industries which use new and high technology, and  the construction of infrastructure. We have also worked out  comprehensive compensation methods to ensure more preferential  treatment will be given to enterprises which have invested in  basic construction projects. Ruan Chongwu also answered  questions on Hainan's planning and development prospects raised  by the Taiwan reporters.</p>

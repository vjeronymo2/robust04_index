			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> NEW PROPOSAL FOR UAL REPORTED  </P> <P> The unions at United Airlines plan to meet with banks this week to discuss a  new offer of as much as $3.92 billion for United's parent, UAL Corp., according  to a published report today.  </P> <P> The Wall Street Journal said the new offer, the latest in a series of on-again,  off-again deals for one of the nation's biggest airlines, could amount to $175  a share to $180 a share, or $3.82 billion to $3.92 billion.  </P> <P> That would be well below the $201 a share, or $4.38 billion, offer from a labor  group that UAL's board accepted last April. That pact has been scuttled by the  financial uncertainty created by the crisis in the Middle East.  </P> <P> Citing unidentified officials close to the proposed deal, the newspaper said  the new offer probably would include participation by a foreign airline. The  story said a logical possibility would be British Airways PLC, which was a  principal equity investor in a $300-a-share labor-management bid that collapsed  last October.  </P></p>

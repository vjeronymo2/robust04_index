			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KILLER WHALE DIES OF INFECTION AT SEA WORLD  </P> <P> Knootka, one of Sea World's three adult killer whales, died Tuesday after a  four-month battle with a rare fungous infection, Sea World officials said.  </P> <P> "It appears Knootka was overwhelmed with the infections," said Dr. Jim McBain,  Sea World staff veterinarian.  </P> <P> Knootka, who weighed 8,500 pounds, is the third killer whale to die at the  private marine park in 18 months. In August, 1988, just three days after the  birth of Baby Shamu, the baby's father, Orky, died of old age, park officials  said. At about 30, Orky was the oldest killer whale in captivity at the time.  </P> <P> Then, in August, 1989, Baby Shamu's mother, 14-year-old Kandu, died in a freak  injury caused when she attempted to dominate another female whale, Corky,  during a performance. Since then, Corky has become a surrogate mother to Baby  Shamu, also known as Orkid.  </P> <P> Knootka was in her mid- to late-20s and Sea World officials blamed her age for  much of her frailty.  </P></p>

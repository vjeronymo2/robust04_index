			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anon: "Israeli Arabs Urinate on the 1947 </F> Borders"]    [Text] It is as if a hidden hand drew this time the lines  of the disturbances by the Arab citizens of Israel. As if  someone gave the order to display violent rage on the line of  the western Galilee, Nazareth, Wadi 'Ara, Tayybe, Yaffo (!),  Ramle (a failed attempt), and, of course: the region of  Be'er-Sheva. The known and recognized map of November 1947, and,  to tell the absolute truth: it is also derived with not  inconsiderable logic from the slogan "two states for two peoples  in western Eretz-Yisra'el--if the reference is to complete  equality after the completion of Stage 1, within the 1949  borders.    "We are an inseparable part of the Muslim people and of the  Palestinian people," said the mayor of Um-al-Faham, Ri'ad Salah,  in eulogizing the "holy martyr" Abu-Gum'ah, who was killed in  the rioting near Be'er-Sheva, and his bed was decorated with a  Palestinian flag and the participants in the funeral (like all  of the demonstrators in the disturbances throughout Israel)  shouted: "With blood and fire we will liberate Palestine, with  spirit and blood we will redeem the holy martyr."    There is no doubt that the rage and the pain of the Arabs of  Israel over the slaughter of the members of their religion and  their people in Hebron are authentic and independent of  rebellious political motives, but the nature of "the popular  uprising," which features demonstrations like this more and more  (like several of those that preceded them), indicates in this  manner that the event of Hebron was not the reason but the  pretext, and that there is a guiding hand and that there are  organized cells in the field, that are activating the masses.  This is not yet an intifadah in the full sense of the word, only  early rehearsals for what those who are staging it know to be  careful not to do prematurely--but the time will yet come.    The spearhead of the liberation of Palestine is now located,  from the political viewpoint and in accordance with reality, in  "the West Bank." There is an early and a late stage in  "process." But the seed of the Palestinian intifadah in Israel  has already sprouted and is poking up from the ground, and who  knows how many and which Israelis will yet participate in it,  for 'Aziz and Haziz from "My Michael" of 'Amos 'Oz and "The  Guardian of the Forests" of A.B. Yehoshu'a were created before  the Six-Day War (and Hirbet Hiz'ah of S. Yizhar was born with  the War of Independence). And the "new historians" are only  recently publishing their researches and Mittelpunkt has only  reached Gorodish, and "Second View" of the television has not  yet finished with Jerusalem, and the demographers have not even  begun yet to warn about the demographic weight that awaits the  people of Israel, and "Peace Now" is only beginning to  demonstrate for the evacuation now of the settlements.    So why should we complain about the organizers of the  disturbances in Israel who satisfy themselves with urinating on  the 1947 borders and go back to their lairs?</p>

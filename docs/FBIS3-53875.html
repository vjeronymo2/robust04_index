			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] A former peace negotiator of the  Palestine Liberation Organization calls for international  pressure so that Israel will dismantle its settlements in the  occupied territories. In the view of Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi,  who is visiting Finland, Israel is not displaying a true spirit  of negotiation when it--at the same time--increases its  settlements, continues military operations in Lebanon, and does  not free political prisoners. The PLO and Israel are currently  negotiating in Taba, Egypt about border control in the self-rule  areas, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, and the borders of  Jericho. These issues are important in themselves, but the PLO  leadership knows that peace cannot be achieved if the settlement  issue is not solved, 'Abd-al-Shafi says.    [Begin 'Abd-al-Shafi recording, in English] Now these are  important, we concede they are important issues, and I certainly  do not condone the position of Israel with respect to this. But  all the same, we look at these issues as being irrelevant in the  face of the ongoing settlement process and I think Chairman  'Arafat is aware of it. [end recording]    [Announcer] Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi resigned from the PLO's  negotiation delegation in the summer after the secret  negotiations in Oslo between Yasir 'Arafat and Israel became  public. 'Abd-al-Shafi is paying an unofficial visit to Finland.</p>

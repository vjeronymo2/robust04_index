			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THIS JUST IN. . .  </P> <P> It's not enough to see Hal Fishman, Pat Lalama and Warren Olney et al during  almost every commercial break; we must also put up with a recap of a recap for  a recap via those obtrusive boxes during the credits of movies shown on KTLA,  KTTV and KCOP.  </P> <P> Why? I don't know. It's the same news we heard 20 minutes earlier, most of  which we're already aware of anyway. It's unfortunate enough that most films  are cut. If that can't be helped, the stations at least can show their film  libraries a little respect by giving the 10 o'clock newscasts a rest until 10  o'clock.  </P> <P> R.A. Allen, Inglewood  </P></p>

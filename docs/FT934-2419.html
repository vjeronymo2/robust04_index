			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Fisons' bitter pill Fisons' ability to shock knows no bounds. Poor relationships with regulators and inadequate manufacturing standards in pharmaceuticals were the cause of its pre-Christmas profits warning two years ago. Now it transpires that profits have been massaged by selling cut-priced drugs to wholesalers shortly before the year end. Setting the accounts straight will cost Pounds 28m this year. The swing into loss in scientific instruments is more worrying. Even if management grip can be restored, the business looks poorly positioned in weak markets. The broader lesson is that Fisons' top management has not undergone the necessary transformation since Mr John Kerridge resigned as chairman and chief executive in 1991. Instead of introducing a tough outsider at that stage, Mr Cedric Scroggs was elevated from within. His departure doubtless owes much to his role as architect of the apparently unsound instruments division. But other directors must bear their share of opprobrium for not tackling the problems sooner. It must now be doubtful whether Fisons can attract a figure of sufficient stature to restore investors' confidence. While cutting the dividend will help conserve cash at a time of rising capital expenditure, it is by no means clear that the company has the resources to flourish as an independent force in pharmaceuticals. There is always the hope that a drug industry giant will step in to provide both cash and management muscle. A market valuation of around Pounds 750m at yesterday's closing share price might start to arouse interest. While the price is falling and the surprises keep coming, though, potential bidders have every incentive to wait.</p>

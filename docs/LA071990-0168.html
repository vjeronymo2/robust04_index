			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ;  </P> <P> TEDDY: STILL READY  </P> <P> Teddy Edwards and his saxophone arrived in Los Angeles at just the right time,  1944: The city was flush with activity, and there was an almost never-ending  club scene along Central Avenue south of downtown. Before long, the 20-year-old  kid who had worked his way here from Jackson, Miss., via Detroit and Tampa had  joined the band of trumpeter Howard McGhee, who persuaded him to trade his alto  for the tenor.  </P> <P> Before much longer, Edwards -- who plays Friday, July 20at the Hyatt Newporter  in Newport Beach -- was working with such bop-minded musicians as Charlie  Parker, Hampton Hawes and Wardell Gray. In 1947, he matched chops with Dexter  Gordon on a Dial recording-sax battle called "The Duel." By 1954, he had  replaced Sonny Stitt in the groundbreaking quintet of drummer Max Roach and  trumpeter Clifford Brown.  </P> <P> Edwards still lives in Los Angeles but says the scene today lacks a focal point  like the one it had in the late '40s and early '50s. "Los Angeles is so spread  out now," he said recently from Portland, where he was appearing at the Hobbitt  Club with his longtime associate, bassist Leroy Vinnegar. "You don't really  have one location any more like in the Central Avenue days with clubs all up  and down the street. That's one thing that's missing. I had a feeling that  Melrose Avenue might turn into that, but it only developed so far."  </P> <P> Nowadays, Edwards appears around the area with his Brass/String Ensemble, an  ambitious mix of rhythm section and five each brass and string players  (including a harpist), as well as in smaller combo settings. A frequent visitor  to Europe, he's just back from the International Jazz Festival in Amsterdam  where, in a tribute to the late Sarah Vaughan, he played with the likes of  Clark Terry, Kenny Drew, Harry (Sweets) Edison and Ed Thigpen. He records  infrequently, but his "Teddy's Ready," an up-tempo 1960 date that includes  bassist Vinnegar, has been reissued by the Original Jazz Classics label.  </P> <P> He promises that he'll perform such signature originals as "Good Gravy" and "No  Name No. 1" in Newport where he'll be backed by keyboardist Ron Kalina, bassist  Henry Franklin and drummer Roy McCurdy. He'll also feature singer Lisa  Nobumoto, who's been studying voice with him for the last couple of years.  "She's really grown and has a great, great future ahead of her," the instructor  said of his student. "People are amazed at the progress she's made."  </P> <P> Who: Teddy Edwards.  </P> <P> When: Friday, July 20, 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Where: Hyatt Newporter, 1107 Jamboree Road, Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Whereabouts: The Hyatt is two blocks east of Coast Highway.  </P> <P> Wherewithal: $5.  </P> <P> Where to Call: (714) 729-1234.  </P></p>

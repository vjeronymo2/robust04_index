			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> EMBATTLED ATTORNEY WINS U.S. JUDGE SEAT  </P> <P> San Francisco attorney Vaughn R. Walker, whose nomination as a U.S. district  judge was delayed for two years because of controversy surrounding his  membership in a club with a record of discrimination, has won Senate  confirmation. Walker was a 15-year member in the Olympic Club of San Francisco,  which had no black members until last year and still excludes women. He  resigned Feb. 15, but critics said the move came too late and questioned his  claim to have opposed the exclusion of women.  </P></p>

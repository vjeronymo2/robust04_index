			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> FIREFIGHTERS LIVE HIGH TO AID INJURED  </P> <P> Joe Cucinotti and Dave Valles say they never dreamed of doing anything as novel  as sitting for four days atop a 150-foot-high snorkel platform attached to a  fire truck. But when the idea was suggested for the sake of charity, both men  volunteered.  </P> <P> The two firefighters began their elevated vigil over the Orange County  Fairgrounds on Wednesday and will stay there until Saturday in an effort to  raise more than $50,000 for the Orange County Burn Assn.  </P> <P> "When you see the pain and suffering those burn victims must deal with daily,  you'll do anything to to help them out," said Fountain Valley firefighter  Cucinotti.  </P> <P> Valles is a Costa Mesa firefighter.  </P> <P> A board member for the association suggested the idea after traveling to Europe  and seeing the same thing done to raise money for homeless people.  </P> <P> "One of our members was very enthused and convinced that the same idea could  work in this country," said Caryl Modrinski, executive director of the  association. "At first we weren't sure how we'd get volunteers, but we had no  problem."  </P> <P> The association, which was formed in 1979, provides assistance to burn  survivors and their families, and sponsors research related to burn care. This  year, the organization hopes to raise enough money to continue providing  various programs, including a summer camp for teen-agers and children who have  suffered burns.  </P> <P> Equipped with a television, stereo, electronic golf game and sleeping bags,  Cucinotti and Valles will leave their platform basket only for five-minute  breaks between now and Saturday.  </P> <P> Firefighters on the ground will take turns standing guard and will also take  donations from passers-by.  </P> <P> "The problem I had was cramming all my Christmas shopping in before I got up  here," Valles said. "But who knows? At 3 o'clock in the morning I may wake up  and question why I am sleeping this high off the ground." ALLISON SAMUELS  </P></p>

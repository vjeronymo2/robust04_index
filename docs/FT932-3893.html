			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: Petro-Canada to open up Terra Nova field PETRO-CANADA wants to start developing the Terra Nova oilfield off Newfoundland without delay once the CDollars 5.2bn (USDollars 4.09bn) Hibernia project comes on stream in 1997, according to Mr James Stanford, president. Petro-Canada, now privatised and the country's second biggest integrated oil company, owns 44 per cent of Terra Nova, whose recoverable oil reserves are estimated at 350m barrels. Development would cost CDollars 2.5bn using a floating production system, rather than Hibernia's massive concrete production and storage rig modelled on the North Sea experience. Both fields are about 200 miles off St John's. Petro-Canada has 25 per cent of Hibernia with Mobil as an operator. Construction of the rig is under way in Newfoundland and Hibernia starts up in 1997 at 25,000 barrels daily, rising to 125,000 barrels daily in 1999. Petro Canada's partners in Terra Nova include Mobil, Husky Oil, Gulf Canada and Shell Canada. As operator it is doing preliminary work on a production plan. Mr Stanford explained that following up Hibernia with Terra Nova development would maximise the benefits of the construction workforce in the Maritimes. Total Canada and partner Husky Oil plan a second CDollars 3m exploration well on a property near Calgary where a large oil discovery has been rumoured. Mr Donald West, Total president, called some of the rumours outrageous, and said that drilling crews could only return in October. The first well early this year reached 9,000ft but tests could not be completed. Total of France sold its 53 per cent stake in the company earlier this year. Total Canada has changed its name to Rigel Energy. Amoco Canada is selling 14 per cent of its Canadian oil and gas properties, accounting for 8 per cent of total production, in Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan as part of a restructuring to reduce debt. Among the probable buyers are Canadian Natural Resources and Penn West Petroleum. China National Petroleum plans an investment in a Saskatchewan heavy oil property and may invest in Syncrude, Alberta's biggest oil sands producer, said Mr Naija Wang, chairman of its Canadian subsidiary.</p>

			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISPARITY IN DISORDERS  </P> <P> Question: When it comes to eating disorders, I don't see why the patients are  almost always women and seldom men. What can there possibly be about food that  would make women more likely to have a problem with it than men?  </P> <P> Answer: A number of men may undergo strenuous dieting for sports-related  reasons, but this unusual concern does not bring them to the attention of a  physician in the same fashion that women would be if they also were extremely  concerned about their weight. For example, young men who participate in  wrestling often show a yo-yo pattern of dieting, alternating weight loss with  weight gain. This can have harmful effects, but the individual involved does  not seek medical attention.  </P> <P> Another reason for the apparent disparity in the incidence of eating disorders  between men and women is that symptoms that may identify women as having an  eating disorder do not apply to men. For example, cessation of menstruation,  which helps diagnose an eating disorder in women, cannot be used to diagnose an  eating disorder in men.  </P></p>

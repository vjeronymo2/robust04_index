The basis of the application is that compliance would cause substantial economic hardship to a manufacturer that has tried to comply with the standard in good faith.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of receipt of the application is published in accordance with agency regulations on the subject (49 CFR Part 555) and does not represent any judgment of the agency on the merits of the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Autokraft was granted NHTSA Exemption No. 92&hyph;6 on December 21, 1992 (57 FR 60563). The reader is referred to that notice for further information about the company and its initial compliance efforts. The exemption from S4.1.4 of Standard No. 208 will expire on January 1, 1995. Because the application for renewal of the exemption was filed ``not later than 60 days before the termination date'' (in this instance, October 27, 1994), the termination date is stayed until the Administrator has acted upon the application (49 CFR 555.8(e)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicant seeks a further two-year exemption for its AC Mark IV passenger car, of which it has produced 15 in the year preceding the filing of its application. Although the company had projected sales of 150 units in the United States in the years 1992&hyph;94, in fact, there have been only seven sales. According to its application, Autokraft ``has continued the process of researching and developing the installation of a driver and passenger side airbag system'' but ``we have been unable to achieve the fitting of a suitable system mainly due to the chassis design being based upon a classic 1960's design and not easily adaptable to suit air bag installation.'' The delay is also due to ``the project having insufficient funds generated by sales and available for completing the development.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Autokraft has concluded that the adaptation of an existing automatic restraint system is the only viable alternative. Its continuation of compliance efforts has given it ``significant knowledge into the areas of vehicle modification, computer simulation, design rough road testing and low, medium and high speed crash testing.'' Complicating its efforts is the need to use a different engine and transmission after October 1, 1995, and the possible effect that this will have upon compliance. It estimates the cost to achieve conformance would be $550,000, achievable by spreading these costs during the exemption period. Autokraft reports losses totalling 3,308,243 Pounds Sterling (approximately $5,624,000 at a rate of $1.70/1) for the years 1992&hyph;93, and projects a further loss for 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The company argues that an exemption would be in the public interest and consistent with the objectives of motor vehicle safety because it meets all applicable EEC standards, and all U.S. Federal motor vehicle safety standards with the exception of the automatic restraint requirements of Standard No. 208 (its 3-point driver and passenger restraints meet the previous requirements). The production of the car makes available to the public ``at a realistic price'' a replica of the original AC Cobra vehicle produced from the original AC Cobra tooling, manufactured during the 1960's predominantly for the American market. Autokraft is in the process of finalizing a U.S. distribution agreement and will show the car at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in January 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicant believes that it will comply with Standard No. 208 six months before January 1, 1997, when the 2-year extension of its exemption that it has requested would expire.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the application described above. Comments should refer to Docket No. 92&hyph;50; Notice 3, and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, room 5109, 400 Seventh St. SW, Washington, DC 20590. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated below will be considered, and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after that date. To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered.

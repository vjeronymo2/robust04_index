			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Barclays Any bank chairman who announces a bad debt charge of more than Pounds 1bn and then suggests the UK recession could last for another two years is courting extreme unpopularity with the stock market. But yesterday's 3 per cent rise in Barclays Bank shares in the wake of such pronouncements from Sir John Quinton is less perverse than it looks. The dividend was maintained. Perhaps even more important, operating profit before provisions rose 16 per cent, which is in striking contrast to the 4 per cent fall at Lloyds. This is not to say, however, that Barclays is now set firmly on a recovery trend. On past experience, the bank may not find it so easy to hold costs down in the second half. It must be nearing the limit of its ability to squeeze commission income out of its reluctant customers, even though this made an important contribution to the first half advance. Crucial to the chance of maintaining the dividend for the full year will thus be the speed with which bad debt provisions fall. Here the outlook is murky and the forecasters' record abysmal. One argument is that Barclays was slow to make provisions during the recession and has now caught up with its competitors. But its lending also grew particularly fast in the late 1980s and it retains a heavy exposure to property. Assuming no repeat of the large hits which cost Pounds 200m in the first half, a maintained final should be affordable. Thereafter investors might yet have cause to remember Sir John's warning about the duration of the recession.</p>

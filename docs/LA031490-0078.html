			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH TELLS OF BUSH-IRAN PARLEY PLAN;  </P> <P> CONTRAS: THE FORMER MARINE COLONEL TESTIFIES AT THE POINDEXTER TRIAL THAT HE  DOES NOT KNOW IF THE THEN-VICE PRESIDENT WAS AWARE OF THE DISCUSSION.  </P> <P> Oliver L. North testified Tuesday that his hapless and hazardous flight into  Tehran at the height of the Iran-Contra affair was originally conceived as an  advance trip to prepare the way for "a senior Administration official --  perhaps even the vice president -- to meet with the leaders of Tehran."  </P> <P> The testimony in the trial of retired Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter in U.S.  District Court was the first mention that anyone considered such a role for  then-Vice President George Bush.  </P> <P> But, when asked if Bush, as vice president, had been aware of North's  activities, the former Marine lieutenant colonel replied: "Counsel, I don't  know which of the documents that I sent to Mr. Poindexter and Mr. McFarlane  were sent to the vice president's office." Robert C. McFarlane was Poindexter's  predecessor as national security adviser.  </P> <P> North did acknowledge, as has been reported often, that Bush sent him a  congratulatory note on Thanksgiving Day in 1985 that praised North's work as  "one of the many things I have to be thankful for."  </P> <P> Poindexter, who resigned as President Ronald Reagan's national security adviser  in 1986, is charged with five counts involving a conspiracy to destroy  documents, obstruct investigations and lie to Congress in the worst scandal of  the Reagan Administration.  </P> <P> Adding a touch of derring-do to his testimony about the May, 1986, Tehran trip,  North also revealed that he had carried "a covert listening device" to  "tape-record all of the meetings that I had with the Iranians and other  intermediaries." North made the trip with McFarlane, who at the time was no  longer a government official.  </P> <P> The testimony about the Tehran flight was drawn out by Richard W. Beckler,  Poindexter's defense attorney, who spent most of the day trying to coax the  former national security officer into disassociating Poindexter from  responsibility for most of the shadowy intrigue during those days in the White  House. It was North's third day on the stand.  </P> <P> But, although he agreed that Poindexter did not work hand-in-hand with him or  telephone him every day, North insisted: "I did keep the admiral apprised of  what I was doing."  </P> <P> North, who was convicted last year of destroying documents and obstructing  Congress, organized a complex operation in which the profits from the sale of  arms to Iran were used to arm the Contras fighting in Nicaragua.  </P> <P> Recalling the Tehran flight served Beckler's purpose because North, in the  early stages of planning, had circumvented Poindexter by enlisting the support  of McFarlane. Beckler's questioning has made it clear that he is trying to put  much of the responsibility for the events on McFarlane, who pleaded guilty in  1988 to withholding information from Congress.  </P> <P> North testified that he had proposed a flight to Tehran with an advance party  to prepare the way for high-level negotiations with the Iranians that could  lead to freedom for the American hostages held by Iran-influenced Islamic  fundamentalists in Lebanon.  </P> <P> But "the admiral was very opposed to an advance trip," North testified. "He  believed the risk was too great. I believed the risk was worth it."  </P> <P> Without informing Poindexter, North testified, he sent a message to McFarlane  in February, 1986, asking him "to importune with the admiral to make the trip."  Although McFarlane was no longer a government official, he still kept a  National Security Council computer terminal at home, and North could  communicate with him through its secret channels.  </P> <P> Explaining this odd arrangement, North told Judge Harold H. Greene: "Mr.  McFarlane had started the (Iran) initiative; he had been involved in it from  the beginning, and it is my understanding that he stayed involved in it."  </P> <P> The White House decided to allow the trip by North and McFarlane, who would try  to negotiate the release of hostages. By the time the trip was approved it was  no longer being considered as preparation for a visit by higher-level  officials.  </P> <P> Although no high Administration official was aboard the plane, McFarlane was  authorized to negotiate on behalf of the U.S. government. The May, 1986, trip,  however, was a disaster. McFarlane failed to obtain the release of any  hostages, and the flight itself inspired rumors that spread throughout the  Middle East and eventually led to public disclosures about the Iran-Contra  affair.  </P> <P> Although North, in his testimony, noted that the original planners thought of  the possibility of using the vice president in the negotiations, he did not  elaborate and was not questioned further about it. President Bush has  continually denied any involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.  </P> <P> Beckler was so circuitous in his attempts to induce North to relieve Poindexter  of responsibility in the scandal that his questioning seemed to trouble Greene  and lose the attention of the jury.  </P> <P> At first, Greene showed his patience. "I have a lifetime appointment," he said,  "and, if necessary, I can listen to Col. North until my term runs out."  </P> <P> Later, he snapped: "If it wasn't this kind of case with this much visibility, I  would have struck half of your questions." He then warned Beckler that his  patience could not hold indefinitely. True to his threat, he then cut the  lawyer's questions off several times, pronouncing them irrelevant.  </P></p>

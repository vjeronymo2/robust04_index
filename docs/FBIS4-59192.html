			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] In an article today under the headline "Yemen's  Unity First," the newspaper AL-THAWRAH stresses that the Yemeni  people have no interest in the shedding of brothers' blood and  the destruction of civil and military installations.    It says: Certainly, it is not the Yemeni people who ordered  aircraft and tanks to bombard and shell military units and  airports in the south and the north. The Yemenis, who restored  unity to both parts of their country, did so without firing one  single bullet, and without fighting between military units from  the northern or southern parts. They have restored the  confidence of the Arab masses in the possibility of achieving  comprehensive Arab unity.    AL-THAWRAH wonders: Why has the language of violence and  blood become the only language between parties in the coalition  government in Yemen? Why has Yemen quickly slipped into a  comprehensive war, in which the air force, tanks, and other  weapons were used? This war has claimed the lives of hundreds  of peoples and inflicted grave losses on the country.    The paper says: What is taking place in fraternal Yemen  confirms that the bloodshed is not in the interest of the  country. The blood of the homeland's sons is the possession of  this homeland. Safeguarding Yemen's unity cannot take place by  escalating the crisis and expanding battlefields. The Yemenis  have restored their unity. So, why are they forced to separate  and partition their country with guns and aircraft? Who will be  responsible for the bleeding from the arteries of both the  southern and northern Yemeni people?    AL-THAWRAH stresses: The Yemeni leadership had better take  into account the difficult situation the Arab nation is  experiencing in its battle with Israel, which adheres to the  ideology of expansion and of fragmenting the Arab nation. This  is especially true since the bloody Yemeni events will further  weaken the Arab position, when the nation is seeing cases of  capitulation to the Israeli enemy, and the reception of its  civil and military delegations in some Arab capitals.    Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: In the same way that Yemen's  unity is the possession of the Yemeni people, it is also the  possession of the entire Arab nation. The Yemeni leadership is  responsible for safeguarding and reinforcing it through the  adoption of principles and the establishment of the state of  institutions and law. Arabs, through the Arab League, are also  called upon to stand on the side of their Yemeni brothers and to  assist them so they can overcome threats to their unity and to  stop the shedding of their blood. The interest of Yemen and the  Yemenis must be placed above all other considerations.    In its editorial today under the headline "Yemeni Unity Is  More Important Than People", the newspaper TISHRIN writes on the  development of the political conflict in Yemen into armed  clashes in which the air force and artillery are taking place,  as if the country was heading toward a civil war.    TISHRIN says: Syria has several times appealed to the  brothers in Yemen to resort to dialogue, reason, national logic,  and pan-Arab conscience, and to reject means of violence.  President Hafiz al-Asad has more than once contacted Yemeni  officials and urged them to resort to reason and wisdom, and to  put the Yemeni people's interests above any other considerations.    TISHRIN stresses that the Yemeni people's interests lie in  their unity, and that a fragmented and bleeding Yemen is an  element of weakness for Yemenis and the Arab nation. It says:  Had the Arabs been united today, taking into consideration that  they are one nation, they would not have been in a weak position  to sign something that conflicts with their people's aspirations  and nation's objectives, and to yield to the dictates of  foreigners, invaders, and those who covet their land and  resources.    TISHRIN adds: The simplest Yemeni or Arab citizen knows full  well that Yemen's interests lie in its unity and cohesion among  its citizens. So, how can Yemeni officials ignore this? They  are supposed to be an example to be followed, not a tool for the  destruction of the unity of one people.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: Syria, along with all Arabs,  appeals to the brothers in Yemen to resort to the language of  dialogue and reason, not the language of aircraft, tanks, and  guns. Nothing is more painful than fighting among the sons of  the one country. Arabs have in Lebanon's bitter experience  something which should be an eloquent lesson for anyone willing  to learn a lesson.</p>

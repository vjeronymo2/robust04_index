			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Putting price before conscience - A look at a Japanese printer campaign in which environmental concerns have lost out to cost Kazuo Inamori, founder and chairman of Kyocera, the Japanese high-technology ceramics company, is an iconoclast with a reputation for promoting tomorrow's orthodoxy today. This year, however, he has been forced to abandon advertising based on the environmentally sound qualities of Kyocera printers in favour of a punchier, cost of ownership campaign. 'Green' is not yet the colour of the month for hard-headed office equipment buyers, it seems. Inamori's far-sightedness is legendary. A decade ago, he was the first to exploit the ending of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone's telecommunications monopoly, setting up a carrier which has become the leader among Japan's new public telecommunications operators. He has overseen Kyocera's diversification from its base in semiconductor casings into computer games, cameras and, more recently, page printers. These are relatively inexpensive machines, typically costing around Pounds 1,500, designed for use with personal computers. They offer a combination of high print quality and economic operation and have become the workhorse of today's networked data processing. The page printer market is dominated by Hewlett-Packard, the US electronics giant. Its Laserjet machines command a 60 per cent market share, leaving a handful of competitors, among them Canon, Kyocera and Oki, scrambling for the rest. Kyocera has been looking to raise its world-wide market share from about 6 per cent at present to around 15 per cent. Today it competes only in the market for machines printing at least 10 pages a minute. Later this year it will introduce a four-page-a-minute model which it hopes will double its market share. In seeking to expand further, however, it faces fierce marketing challenges, among them overcoming the power of a spectacularly successful brand. HP sets the pace in the computer industry. It is a byword for quality electronics and the name is essentially synonymous with laser printers. Customers ask for HP printers without going into the competitive differences between machines. And dealers, selling a commodity product with a low profit margin, find little incentive to promote other makers' offerings. It is, according to Philip Murphy, general manager of Kyocera Electronics (UK), a 'self-perpetuating connivance' which works to the disadvantage of HP's competitors. Printer technology, furthermore, is not intrinsically exciting to customers looking only for convenience and reliability. HP's machines are powered by laser technology licensed from Canon of Japan. Kyocera has a competitive technology which uses light emitting diodes. Both technologies involve 'writing' on a rotating drum which, in turn, transfers an electric charge to paper to attract toner in the shape of the characters to be printed. Kyocera's 'green' campaign, launched last November at a worldwide cost of about Pounds 8m, exploited the fact that the laser printer drum mechanism - the cartridge - is designed for disposal. When the toner runs out, the cartridge must be replaced. There is a saving on maintenance costs at the expense of the price of a new cartridge. Manufacturers of laser printers receive a steady income from the sale of these consumables. And the cartridge has to be disposed of. Kyocera says that by the end of 1994, laser printers will have used 300m cartridges - 'a new variety of noxious, non-biodegradable landfill' its advertising claims. Its own machines, it says, simply have to have their toner replenished. 'How to save the world from your office' was the slogan Kyocera used to advertise its Ecosys range of printers. Even at street prices they work out more expensive in capital cost than their HP equivalents: 'You should tell your customers there is no greater investment than saving the Earth,' Inamori told his senior mangers. The campaign was aimed at increasing awareness of the Kyocera brand. But the business world is clearly not yet ready to embrace greenness as a criterion for printer purchase. 'Perhaps next year' was a typical response from potential customers. This spring, with the slogan 'the page printer that prints money', Kyocera in the UK switched to a new campaign based on data collected by Context, a London-based marketing consultancy. Its analysis suggests that over the life of a printer, the cost of consumables - paper, toner, new cartridges - is more significant than the purchase price. It concludes: 'Kyocera is able to lead the field in terms of overall cost of ownership through its adoption of a long-life developer and drum assembly unit which has a life of 300,000 pages.' Kyocera claims costs of 0.5p a page compared with 1.9p a page for competing systems. Its rivals dispute these figures. Will this latest campaign be successful? The photocopier market is familiar with the concept of cost per page but it is new to the printer business. Most companies neither know nor measure their printing costs. And different managers may be responsible for capital spending and spending on consumables. The market may have to go through some sharp re-education if Kyocera is to get its message across.</p>

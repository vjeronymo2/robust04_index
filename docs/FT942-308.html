			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (3): Leo, the tea shop's other trade - UK Computer Business / Alan Cane recalls a preposterous episode in Britain's postwar industrial history Leo: The First Business Computer By Peter J. Bird Hasler Publishing, Pounds 15.95 272 pages In 1947, the year before the transistor was invented, Britain's largest catering chain decided to go into the computer business. Not satisfied with building machines for its own use, in 1954 J. Lyons &amp; Company set up a subsidiary, Leo Computers, to sell them to others. It remained in the business for 17 years, eventually disposing of its interests in Leo Computers to English Electric for Pounds 1.9m. Overall losses on the venture were just over Pounds 100,000. These bald facts do little justice to one of the most exciting, inventive and, it has to be said, preposterous, episodes in postwar British industrial history. The Journal of the Office Management Association for 1957, quoted in Leo, makes the argument: 'A potential computer user needs to have some confidence in his own judgement if he is to buy his computer from a tea shop.' Point taken: but what a tea shop] 'Joe' Lyons with its hundreds of shops and Corner Houses, 'nippies' (waitresses) and packet tea, was a national institution. It was tightly run with an intuitive understanding of the importance of margins in a volume business. 'Only a farthing profit was made on each of the 150m meals sold annually from all the teashops,' Peter Bird notes. His book is the first detailed account of the Leo (Lyons Electronic Office) adventure. The machines themselves - Leo I, II and III - are now footnotes in the history of early computers. But Leo makes an important point that has been neglected time and again in the development of the computer industry: successful automation depends on an understanding of what the machine can be expected to achieve, coupled with detailed planning and documentation. If other computer users had learned what Lyons management already knew, there would have been fewer computer disasters over the past 40 years. Lyons was aided here by its already meticulous office methods; but it also employed some remarkable individuals during the Leo project, many of whom were to go on to become mainstays of the UK computing establishment. The project had its origin in a visit to the US in 1947 by Oliver Standingford and 'TRT' Thompson, the senior Lyons executives responsible for office procedures. They were impressed by early American computers and learned that an advanced system, Edsac, already under construction at Cambridge University, could be used as a model. 'The possible saving from such a machine should be at least Pounds 50,000 a year,' they wrote, urging that Lyons should build its own. The capital cost would be about Pounds 100,000. The Lyons Board accepted the proposal in what Bird describes as 'in retrospect, an extremely casual, but far-sighted, decision for a catering and food manufacturing organisation to have taken during this difficult postwar period'. Compared with today's manufacturing costs - the price of building and equipping a modern semiconductor fabrication plant is about Dollars 1bn  - Lyons' initial budgetting seems comic: Pounds 140 for an oscilloscope, Pounds 14 for benches and stools, Pounds 15 for small tools. Much of Britain's early efforts in computing were marked by a similar grand amateurism. The metal casing for one early computer was beaten by Mulliner Park Ward, the Roll-Royce coach builder. Electronic consoles for Leo were at one stage fabricated by Camper Nicholson, the yacht builder. Ingenuity amounting at time to sheer brilliance, especially in software, overcame the obstacles. The Leos worked and worked remarkably well. The Post Office used them for billing until 1980 when they were replaced by ICL mainframes, which incidentally, continued to run Leo software. As the industry matured, the costs of staying in contention rose and Leo Computers, which had never made money for Lyons, became too great a burden. It was merged with English Electric and then vanished into the digital melting pot which became ICL, now owned by Fujitsu of Japan. Bird, director of Lyons Information Systems for 10 years, has carried out extensive research in putting Leo together. But he is clearly more fascinated by the technology than the personalities, which detracts from what should read as a rattling good business tale. Characters such as John Simmonds, Thompson and David Caminer are sketched in as stereotypes, rather than as flesh-and-blood creatures dealing with the most complex machine the human mind has ever created. Bird's role as historian, however, is invaluable in placing Leo in context. It is a welcome counter to the parade of US-authored studies which would have you believe that nothing of note in computing happened outside North America.</p>

Joe Clark first met with Foreign Ministry Under Secretary  Ambassador Ozdem Sanberk. In a statement he made prior to the  meeting, Ambassador Sanberk stated that Turkey sees an  atmosphere of insecurity in Cyprus, and therefore supports the  confidence-building measures package.    Clark, in turn, stated that the solution to the Cyprus  problem depends on the leaders of the two communities. Clark  noted that he will submit a report to the UN secretary general  concerning his visits to Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey. Clark  further stated that he hopes Turkey will continue to extend its  constructive help to find a solution to the Cyprus issue.    Clark later visited Foreign Ministry Deputy Under Secretary  Tugay Ulucevik and conferred with him for some time.</p>

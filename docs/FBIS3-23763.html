			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Emil Pain, member of the Presidential </F> Council, by Mari Silven in Moscow; date not given: "Treaty  Advantageous to Russia"]    [Text] Emil Pain, member of the Presidential Council,  was part of the presidential team during the visit to Georgia.  In an interview granted OBSHCHAYA GAZETA on his return to Moscow  he describes his impressions, justifies B. Yeltsin's position at  the negotiations, and takes issue with deputies of the State  Duma.    [Silven] On the eve of B. Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi you  were  apprehensive as to how the Georgian public would greet the  president....    [Pain] Yes, his circle was concerned about how B. Yeltsin  would be accepted by representatives of the intelligentsia, with  whom he was to meet. But the meeting was quite relaxed. There  was a great deal of joking, but difficult questions concerning  Russia and Abkhazia were asked also. The audience in the House  of Scientists was in an exultant mood, virtually, and this was  explained, I believe, not so much by the traditional Georgian  hospitality as by the fact that people in Georgia are wishing  for a miracle. Aside from the hope of this, they have nothing  left. Yet they can hope for a miracle only from Moscow.    In his speech Yeltsin said for the first time that Russia  did  not absolve itself of some of the blame for what had happened in  Georgia also, and this enjoyed a phenomenal success. Generally,  the previous democratic solidarity between the Georgian and  Russian intelligentsia was recalled, in the main. The mood was  one of forgiving Russia for everything that happened with  Abkhazia and of recalling that which was connected with the  formation of independent Georgia.    [Silven] Recalled by whom?    [Pain] Well, E. Shengelaya, head of the Union of  Cinematographers of Georgia, and A. Tavkhelidze, president of  the Academy of Sciences, for example.    But I was struck most by the abrupt change of position in  connection with integration with Russia. That same  intelligentsia which had considered Georgia's independence a  means of salvation from all troubles is now, having drained a  cupful of independence, saying: "It is not we who are to blame,  it was Russia that pushed us out of the Union." A desire to  justify oneself is psychologically understandable, like the  desire to find someone else to blame. In order to explain their  own defeat they are also talking about the interference of a  "third force."    [Silven] And were you not concerned for B. Yeltsin's  physical  safety?    [Pain] We were, of course, and this is why he was heavily  guarded. But everything turned out alright. There was just one  tiny episode: As Yeltsin was leaving the House of Scientists, a  group of young street children tried to jeer him. And here E.  Shevardnadze made an exceptional gesture: He slammed shut the  door of his car and alone, without security, walked down  Rustaveli Street. The mood of the crowd changed instantly. The  public broke into applause, and he was greeted in such a way  that I had the feeling that I was once again in August 1991,  when Shevardnadze led a column of demonstrators to the Russian  White House. The level of democratism demonstrated by  Shevardnadze is convincing. Anyone may approach him  unhindered--despite the fact that the situation in Georgia is  extremely unsafe. The Russian president cannot be approached  that easily.    [Silven] How do you evaluate the results of the trip? An  opponent of the treaty called it "a translation from the  Georgian," maintaining thereby that the treaty is beneficial  only to Tbilisi. What arguments could you in point of substance  counterpose to the position of the councilmen?    [Pain] I believe that if the reference is to practical  matters, this treaty is more to Russia's advantage. Georgia has  obtained credit, and there will be an increase in the supplies  of gas and other forms of energy, but not on a scale such as  might pull the country out of the present critical situation.  This is more a symbolic, psychological gesture.    For Russia, on the other hand, the treaty has solved certain  most complex questions. The problem of its outlet to the Black  Sea, for example. Russia has currently the sole small port of  Novorossiysk. In accordance with the treaty, Georgia will make  available to Russia its ports and, primarily, the tanker port of  Batumi. An agreement was reached also on the creation of three  military bases on the territory of Georgia. This is the first  such agreement, I believe, throughout the time of the existence  of the new independent states. It is not a question,  incidentally, of new contingents of troops but of remnants of  the units of the former Transcaucasus Military District. Their  transfer to Russia and their ability to fend for themselves  (together with their families) would have cost us more than the  legalization of these formations in Georgia.    Much is being said currently about the problem of Russians  in  the near abroad. They are fleeing Georgia, but fleeing hunger,  cold, and the increase in crime, and by helping Georgia,  therefore, Russia is alleviating also the position of its  compatriots.    [Silven] Why, then, did parliament declare its rejection of  the treaty?    [Pain] The solidarity with which all factions opposed the  draft treaty is impressive. It could have arisen in the soil of  the fact that all factions in the Duma are now of the  opposition. But I believe that the position of Russia's Choice  in this case is more the result of insufficient thought and a  survival of the once-popular quasi-democratic idea of a nation's  right to self-determination. This principle has not, as we all  know, been elaborated in international practice, nor has  Democratic Russia clarified its interpretation. Who has the  right to self-determination: an ethnic group or the entire  territorial community? Is self-determination following ethnic  purges permissible? If so, any territory could engage in this.    The protest of the other factions ensues from the doctrine,  which is very fashionable currently, of vital interests and  reintegration. And many people understand the latter in the  medieval sense of the word, what is more: as Russia's  territorial acquisitions. Not everything can be annexed today,  naturally, and for this reason the supporters of reintegration  are hankering after what is ailing. After "pieces" which, it  would seem, are asking to be admitted to Russia themselves.  Where would we be were we to put this idea into practice? The  countries from which "pieces that are ailing" had been "ripped  off" would become a zone of hatred around Russia and that same  cordon sanitaire which all the councilmen in Central Europe so  unanimously reject.    The Duma has two political poles, conditionally speaking:  "imperialists" and "isolationists." The first clash between them  was played out over unification of the monetary systems of  Russia and Belarus: The "isolationists" were opposed, the  "imperialists," in favor. In the Georgian business they were  oddly on the same side of the barricades because the  "isolationists" are opposed to feeding a poor Georgia, and the  "imperialists" support openly or in veiled form the annexation  to Russia of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. But how is it possible  to advocate the integrity of Russia and at the same time deny  neighboring states this right? This ambiguity is today  widespread among Russian politicians. It has determined the  Duma's decisions to a considerable extent. But at the same time  I believe that a share of the blame for the treaty incident is  borne by the executive also. Why did it not harmonize this  document with a number of Duma committees and explain and,  perhaps, emend individual wording in it before the president's  trip?    [Silven] You refer to the Duma's principal objections  connected with article 3 of the treaty, according to which  Russia undertakes to assist in the creation of a Georgian  national army? It is said that this is tantamount to arming it  for war against Abkhazia.    [Pain] In actual fact, everything is the other way about.  The  treaty links military assistance with stages of a political  settlement of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict: initially  agreements, then an army.    Russia is interested in the creation of a Georgian army and  border services. It is not a matter of indifference for it what  the border with Chechnya looks like: whether this is a  passageway in which armed detachments fight among themselves or  the fortified border of a state firmly oriented toward Russia.  According to the treaty, the parties would undertake to prevent  border crossings by armed detachments.    However paradoxical, incidentally, the Ossetians and the  Abkhaz should have an objective interest in the formation of a  regular Georgian army because it is not a regular army but  uncontrolled formations that represent the main danger. As long  as the latter exist, the danger of the ouster of Shevardnadze  will remain. Any other Georgian leader--of those currently  visible on the horizon--would be more frightening for Abkhazia  and South Ossetia.    Further, it is very important that Shevardnadze acknowledged  for the first time--if only in a small group at the  negotiations, publicly, nonetheless--the need for Georgia's  political arrangement on the principles of federalization. This  very term had previously been shunned in Georgia, now, however,  this word was tossed into the negotiations.    [Silven] It is maintained that the treaty is inopportune....    [Pain] Why so? There are no Georgian troops in Abkhazia,  just  as there are, for that matter, no Georgians at all--the largest  ethnic group prior to the start of the conflict: An ethnic purge  was carried out there. So the return of refugees--almost 200,000  persons--is inopportune? It was the mechanisms and technical  conditions of their return that were discussed with his Georgian  colleague by S. Shoygu, chairman of the Committee for Emergency  Situations.    As far as the idea of the impossibility of the conclusion of  a treaty between Russia and Georgia prior to a political  settlement of the disputes between Georgia and Abkhazia and  South Ossetia is concerned, it does not, in my view, withstand  criticism. There are just the same problems in the majority of  CIS states. So we should not be signing a treaty with Ukraine  until the latter regulates relations with Crimea? There are  similar problems in Russia itself, come to that: Can we deny  other states the conclusion of a treaty because relations  between the federal authorities of Russia and Chechnya have not  been completely clarified?    This will not be achieved in a matter of days or months  even.  Leaving interstate relations unsettled, on the other hand,  merely means stimulating a continuation of the conflict inasmuch  as one of its main causes is contained in the uncertainty of  Moscow's official position on the question of the territorial  integrity and the borders of Georgia--notwithstanding the fact  that Russian citizens are, as we all know, fighting on the side  of the Abkhaz.    The question of permissible forms of assistance to  ethnically  related peoples is a very serious problem. No one can prohibit  cultural contacts between related peoples or economic  assistance. Legal protection of ethnic minorities--kinsfolk on a  different territory--via the system of international mechanisms  is permitted in principle also. But the formation of illegal  military detachments and the crossing of a border with weapons  to participate in civil wars on the side of one's "own" ethnic  community are absolutely impermissible.    Nowhere do ethnic borders coincide with political borders,  and were the world community to recognize the possibility of the  armed protection by an ethnic metropolis of its diasporas in  other countries, the world would be threatened by general  carnage and total conflicts throughout the world. It is Russia's  duty, therefore, as a member of the Security Council, to put a  decisive stop to such operations.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By 'Imad al-Afranji] </F>   [Text] Gaza -- The Fatah Hawks, Fatah's military  apparatus, have called on the Palestinian leadership to stop the  negotiations in protest of Israeli practices in the occupied  territories. They urged the leadership not to resume the talks  until acts of pursuit and liquidation against all wanted men  from all factions are halted.    The Fatah Hawks called on the movement's organizational  authority in the Gaza Strip to immediately freeze all channels  of contact with the Israeli administration.    The statement said that this has no connection with the  peace  process, that what is taking place at the negotiating table is  being done according to the laws of negotiations and what is  taking place on the ground in the occupied territories is  governed by the laws of the occupied territories, and that there  was no contradiction between the two.    The statement was issued in the wake of the killing of six  Fatah activists last Monday by special Israeli units.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Row on French right wing turns into deep split A BLAZING row erupted yesterday within France's conservative opposition alliance over differences in attitude towards the Maastricht treaty. On Monday night, the Gaullist RPR party issued an ultimatum denouncing participation of the centre-right UDF umbrella grouping led by former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing in the referendum campaign to persuade voters to approve the treaty. The RPR leadership said continued UDF participation would have 'grave consequences for the union of the opposition'. The Gaullist party has now taken a decisive step towards outright opposition to the Maastricht treaty, whereas the UDF and its centrist allies are openly committed to support it. Some political commentators fearthe split between the Gaullists and the UDF could become so damaging as to jeopardise their chances of an effective campaign in next spring's general elections. Many of the leading figures in the UDF and centrist parties, starting with Mr Giscard d'Estaing, are already campaigning for a 'Yes' vote in the Maastricht referendum announced by President Francois Mitterrand for next autumn. Their eager agreement to take part in the referendum campaign, on the same platform as ministers in the Socialist government, is one factor which has helped to ignite the blazing row between the two conservative groups. But the other factor is last week's Danish referendum, which narrowly rejected the Maastricht agreement, and which has caused the Gaullist party to swing decisively against the treaty. Last month's debate in the National Assembly showed that the Gaullists were deeply and passionately divided over Europe. Almost half the party's 126 members voted against the Maastricht treaty, while nearly all the remainder abstained. But since last week's Danish referendum, the anti-Community wing of the Gaullist leadership, led by Senator Charles Pasqua, the former interior minister, has succeeded in capturing control of the party's European policy, and has swung it decisively against the treaty. But UDF and centrist leaders yesterday firmly rejected the Gaullist threats, and last night Mr Giscard d'Estaing planned to fulfil his commitment to speak in support of Maastricht at a meeting in Selestat near Strasbourg, on the same platform as Mrs Elizabeth Guigou, European affairs Minister in the socialist government. The Gaullists claim that UDF participation in the Maastricht campaign will turn the referendum into a plebiscite of personal support for President Mitterrand, with damaging effects on the election prospects of the conservative parties next March. There can be no doubt that Mr Mitterrand has from the beginning been aware that the European debate was always going to be deeply damaging for the conservative opposition.</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STUDY OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS  </P> <P> The Torrance City Council has delayed action on an ordinance to tighten  controls on the use and storage of acutely hazardous chemicals in the city.  </P> <P> The council Tuesday was to consider whether to hire a law firm to study further  regulating acutely hazardous materials used by more than a 100 companies  throughout Torrance. Instead, City Atty. Kenneth L. Nelson suggested that the  council delay action until Aug. 29 to give staff more time to study current  state, county and federal laws on hazardous materials.  </P> <P> Nelson said he wants his office and the Fire Department to further study the  issue before the city spends money on an outside firm.  </P> <P> The suggestion for tighter restrictions came during a council meeting in May,  when Councilman Tim Mock requested that city staff draft a proposed ballot  measure to tighten controls on all hazardous chemicals in the city.  </P> <P> Mock said he wanted the measure to require industries to obtain a  conditional-use permit to use and store acutely hazardous chemicals. A panel of  experts would review the safety of a chemical's use on a case-by-case basis  before issuing a permit, he said.  </P> <P> He said the proposed measure might also provide voters with an alternative to a  ballot initiative in March, which would restrict the use of acutely hazardous  hydrofluoric acid at the Mobil Oil Corp. refinery.  </P> <P> Since then, council members have indicated that they are no longer interested  in a ballot measure but would still favor tighter restrictions on hazardous  materials, Nelson said.  </P></p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): More than just A B C  -Specific definitions of the consumer psyche are replacing the old market research groupings Are you an Age Acceptor or an Age Modifier? Perhaps you are a Successful Idealist, an Affluent Materialist or a paid-up member of the Resigned Poor. Do you live in an Along-with-the-Drift or a Boom-then-Decline neighbourhood? One thing's for sure - you are no longer just a dull old A, B, C1/C2, D or E. It used to be said that A/Bs had money and taste; C1s taste but no money; C2s money but no taste; and D/Es no taste and no money. But today there are many ways of slicing the population cake other than by simply cutting such crude wedges. The old socio-economic categories - on which so many vital marketing and advertising decisions have depended - are increasingly being displaced by other, more sophisticated segmenting techniques that try to probe consumer psyche, not just allot social class. 'We may think we know A/Bs are different from D/Es,' says Peter Sampson, development director with the market research company Infratest Burke. 'But consumers today are adopting contradictory buying modes. How can socio-economic categories tell us why someone driving a Pounds 30,000 car also wears a Pounds 10 wristwatch? Or why another person buys premium price Haagen-Dazs ice cream yet also buys the cheapest own-label toilet paper? There's no predicting an overall consumer type anymore.' Successfully identifying these new distinctions increasingly looks like the key to finding customers, retaining their loyalty and targeting money spent on advertising. The conflations and fragmenting of consumer types also bode well for the market research industry, whose turnover as measured by the 26-member Association of Market Survey Organisations increased by 8.7 per cent in real terms last year. Given Europe's shifting social and demographic patterns - the current breakdown of the two-parent family, the forecast reduction in 15-24 year-olds and the growth of the 45-54 age group - there is every reason why this trend will continue. To combat the risk of making fallacious assumptions, though, companies themselves are also branching out into consumer research. The UK branch of Nestle, for instance, is pilot-testing a scheme that is being closely watched by its French and German counterparts. Nestle UK is collating a list of 100,000 customers who have demonstrated their attachment to its Buitoni brand Italian food range. David Hudson, the company's director of strategic marketing, says that the database will be turned 'into a club of people who all share a love of Italian food'. Hudson compares the old socio-economic categories to a map that tells travellers nothing more than which continent they are on. 'I need usage and attitude-related data which actually tell me what the consumer is thinking about our products. Our Casa Buitoni club will have a newsletter about Italian food. It won't just be a means of dishing out money-off coupons. It will allow us to know where our customers live, who they are, what they like doing, which of our competitors' products they use and why.' The move by Nestle does not signify that the company is abandoning brand advertising; rather its club - a direct marketing technique - is being explored as part of a broad marketing mix. Martin Glenn, new product development director of Pepsi Foods International in the UK, shares Hudson's sceptical view of the old ways of analysing customer types. 'Socio-economic classifications are no longer useful for products which are closely substitutable, such as snack foods or cars. They do not segment most mass markets; all A/B/C1/C2/D/E types buy Walkers crisps or Ford cars. You need to understand your own market on a specific level, to look at usage and attitudes within a market.' Glenn, formerly with Mars' European Petcare division in Germany, has spent the past decade bringing new consumer products to market. 'Ten years ago every good brand manager would have his target group of consumers, skewed towards A/B/C1s or C2/Ds or whatever. But marketing understanding has greatly improved. These definitions now don't discriminate with sufficient accuracy. The A/B/C/D/E categories don't discriminate even by income - E is meant to be pensioners but you can have some very wealthy pensioners.' While socio-economic segmenting can still give a broad-brush picture of the market place, researchers and advertising agencies now deploy hundreds of different lifestyle categorisations such as the ones used at the beginning of this article. Take Young &amp; Rubicam's model, which is called The 4 Cs. Paul Edwards, head of planning in the UK, says it stands for cross-cultural consumer classification. 'It's a socio-psychological way of measuring people, dividing them into seven value groups. Two people can have the same behaviour but different values behind that behaviour. This system allows us to segment for any product across different cultures, where we couldn't possibly use the old socio-economic categories.' There are also geo-demographic analyses, most of them variations on the theme of postcode exploitation. The theory is that housing types are more subtle guides to purchasing habits - consumers tend to buy the same sort of goods and services as their neighbours. In the late 1980s, CACI Information Services developed Acorn, the world's first geo-demographic classification system. Acorn has since come up with dozens of classifications, based on UK government population census information. The old socio-economic distinctions seem even more outdated now that companies are calling for pan-European market research in order to help them market their products on a pan-European basis. If socio-demographics are inadequate on a single-country basis, they seem even more so when crossing borders. Sampson of Infratest Burke was also a member of a working group of the Amsterdam-based European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research. In the late 1980s the group investigated the possibility of harmonising socio-economic definitions. The task proved impossible as Esomar discovered that such harmonisation was not only difficult but misleading. Socio-economic analysis of European consumers could not be satisfactorily harmonised because class-plus-income patterns were so different in each country. Instead, Esomar now uses a system of research based on ownership of consumer durables.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ahmad al-Qasir: "The Leaders of Yemen Must </F> Fear God and Heed the Interests of Their Country and Their  Nation"]    [Excerpts] While all the world's nations are rushing to  solve their problems peacefully and seeking to establish  political and economic blocs to meet the requirements of the new  world order, and while the Arab nation is doing all it can to  remove the aftermath of the criminal Iraqi aggression against  Kuwait and bring the Arabs together once again, the Arab nation  is hit by a new horrible tragedy, as if the costly disasters and  woes it has faced over the past decades were not enough. By  this new plight we mean the outbreak of unprecedented vicious  fighting among the sons of fraternal Yemen in the north and the  south. [passage omitted]    Seeing such an Arab plight and painful tragedy, it was  inevitable for Egypt, as always, to rush to save the people of  Yemen from destruction. Egypt proceeded from its historical and  pan-Arab responsibility toward the Arab nation. The swift  Egyptian moves were embodied by the many contacts President  Husni Mubarak held with Arab leaders to put an end to the bloody  conflict in fraternal Yemen, and by Egypt's call for an urgent  Arab League Council meeting to appeal to the warring parties to  end the armed struggle, stop the bloodshed, and preserve the  unity of fraternal Yemen.    Thanks to his pan-Arab sentiments, farsightedness, and  discerning vision, President Mubarak realized the seriousness of  the Yemeni crisis at its eruption. He worked seriously, in  cooperation and coordination with the Arab leaders, to avoid the  bloody conflict. He repeatedly sent special envoys to Sanaa and  Aden in an attempt to heal the rift and bring the viewpoints of  the brothers closer. But it seems that the Arab nation has  hired forces, blinded by fanaticism, working for their own  interests. They worked to escalate the crisis, not realizing  its serious implications against the unity of the people of  Yemen, its negative impact on the course of Arab solidarity, and  its direct threat to the entire pan-Arab security. Yemen's  important strategic and geographic position cannot be ignored at  all. [passage omitted]    Egypt is once again appealing to the leaders of Yemen to  fear  God and heed the interests of their country, nation, and  religion. It is appealing to them to rise to their pan-Arab  responsibility and to rush to suppress the sedition before it  becomes too great to control. This requires that the parties  sit down together at the negotiating table in a spirit of  brotherhood and love and renounce enmity and hatred. More  importantly, the people of Yemen should be given a chance to  express their will and give their decisive word as to who should  rule them through constitutional channels. Then, the enemies of  the Yemeni unity will not be able to sell their commodity, the  masks will fall from their faces, and peace will once again  prevail on the land of fraternal Yemen. Woe betide those who  want to turn the wheel of history backward.</p>

Robert Richard Kiss reports from their news  briefing:    [Kiss] A request for the registration of Torgyan's party has  been refused, Torgyan himself said at a news briefing. The party  was formed in order for the electors to clearly see who they are  voting for in the elections. Just like the Independent  Smallholders' Party, other parties would also like to get into  parliament. There would have been only one Torgyan party but,  following the refusal, it is clear that the Independent  Smallholders' Party [FKGP] can launch the fight on its own and  it will not establish an alliance with anybody before the first  round of the elections, Jozsef Torgyan said.    He then talked about the party's foreign political strategy.  The green light must be given to Asian and Pacific capital,  because companies from Hong Kong and Taiwan would invest  billions of dollars in Hungary. [passage omitted]</p>

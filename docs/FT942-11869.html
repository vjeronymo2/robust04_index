			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / US indicators point to robust growth The US index of leading indicators rose 0.7 per cent in March, more than expected and suggesting that economic growth will be robust during the next six months, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Separately, the National Association of Purchasing Managers released a bullish half-yearly forecast, predicting 7 per cent growth of corporate revenues in cash terms this year and a 10.9 per cent increase in capital spending. Purchasing managers expect the price of goods they buy to rise only 1.5 per cent in 1994. Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said the jump in the leading index, led by a sharp increase in the length of the average working week, indicated the economic recovery was not losing momentum. Nine of the 11 components of the leading index rose in March, with positive contributions from higher commodity prices, an increase in building permits and orders for durable goods, and a drop in weekly claims for jobless benefits. The overall index rose 0.4 per cent in January and was revised to show a zero change, rather than a 0.1 per cent decline, in February. The jump in the index showed 'the economy continues to hit on all cylinders,' said Mr Martin Realia, chief economist of the US Chamber of Commerce. Most forecasters believe preliminary reports of real economic growth at an annualised rate of 2.6 per cent in the first quarter, against 7 per cent in the fourth quarter, understated the US economy's momentum. Purchasing managers were considerably more optimistic about the outlook for 1994 than they were last December, Mr Robert Bretz, head of the NAPM's business survey committee, told the association's annual conference in Atlanta yesterday. In December, purchasing executives forecast an increase in revenues of 4.7 per cent this year. Purchasing managers said operating rates at member companies had risen from 83.7 per cent last December to 87.9 per cent, the highest rate since they began to compile operating rate figures in 1989. They said companies would respond to capacity shortages by increasing capital spending by nearly 11 per cent in cash terms this year. Their survey of export intentions was the most bullish since it began in 1987: 64 per cent of members said exports would rise this year, 7 per cent said exports would decline; 79 per cent of member companies export regularly.</p>

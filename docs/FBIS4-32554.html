			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Council of the Union of Labor [UP] has  made a decision on joining the opposition to Prime Minister  Waldemar Pawlak's government. UP has accused the government  coalition of failing to implement the policies announced during  the election campaign and of continuing the policies of the  previous governments. UP has also criticized the government's  Strategy for Poland program. According to UP, this document  assumes a further exacerbation of the uneven distribution of the  social costs of the transformation of the state.    The UP National Council has not yet decided whether Industry  Minister Marek Pol, who represents UP in the government, should  leave the Council of Ministers.</p>

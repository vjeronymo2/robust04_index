			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpt] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division.  The Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Hojjat  ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Nateq-Nuri and the deputies from the  cities of Amol, Golpaygan, Khomeyn and Bu'inzahra, and Avej gave  speeches. Then the Majles took up its agenda. We direct the  attention of our esteemed readers to the detailed proceedings.  <H5>  Majles Highlights </H5> <H5>  Speeches </H5>   Mr. Tavakoli, deputy from Khomeyn, criticized the excessive  imports of automobiles into the country. Elsewhere in his talk  he criticized Note 10 in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995]  budget concerning the sale of hospitals and making them  autonomous. He called it a disaster.    Mr. Shayesteh, deputy from Golpaygan, mentioned creating  conditions favorable to exports, reducing food crop imports,  reinforcing and developing conversion industries, population  control and insuring vulnerable crops as ways to make the  economy grow and prosper.  <H5>  Legislation </H5>   The Majles approved the scientific, educational, and  cultural  agreement between Iran and Turkmenistan.    The 38-article charter for the Social Security Treatment  Services Organization, which the government presented to the  Majles in a bill, was approved.  <H5>  Seyyed Mahmud Kazemi-Dinan, Deputy From Amol </H5>   All those involved in the economic war must strive to  produce  more.    The first pre-agenda speaker was Kazemi-Dinan, deputy from  Amol. He thanked the people of the province of Mazandaran for  welcoming the president of the republic. He said: This trip  brought with it the good news of the prosperity of Mazandaran.  This will be continued by the new province management, thanks to  the divine blessing of his excellency's (the governor-general's)  continued efforts, and it is well-known and obvious that his  beautiful leadership and planning has received a lovely and  pleasing welcome from the dear nation. God willing, the  God-given talents of Mazandaran will emerge in a timely and  appropriate way with the help of the sacred government of the  Islamic Republic of Iran. [passages omitted on anti-American,  other statements]    We have already put behind us its fourth year with  steadfastness, through the efforts of the nameless powerful  economic officers. Through critical management and the efforts  victorious leaders and commanders in the unequal war, we have  overcome the enemy's vengeful objectives and the grudges and  pessimism of friends on the deadly battlefield of the  complicated economic crusade. We continue ceaselessly on our  path carrying out the great economic adjustment and we occupy  ourselves writing the Five-Year Plan and budget before the  astonished eyes of world imperialism's economic monster and  despite its heavy blows, such as the drop in the price of oil.    The deputy from Amol then said: Thanks are due to the  planners, well-wishers, soldiers, and executive managers who  were shot at from both sides by bombs and bullets. Have no fear  of traveling under the leadership of the decisive commander in  the former sacred defense. Under the heroic Hashemi's leadership  the courageous army of love will be given matchless courage by  the creator. As the famous proverb says, if 'Ali is the camel  driver, he knows where to make the camel sleep and he does not  fear.    Kazemi-Dinan then emphasized: All those involved in the  economic war must strive to produce more, in accordance with  prior guidance whose expected conditions have arrived. If we  exercise piety by consuming less for love of the beloved, we  will defeat our rival. This is the second phase of the test,  which God willing we will pass proudly, as we did the first  historic test.    He discussed the other imperialist plot, intended to  dominate  the Muslim women of our country. He said: We will make every  effort to reach the goal of making serious effort to educate our  sisters. However, economic planners and managers must be told,  based on the fundamental guidance of His Holiness the Imam, to  give priority to agriculture and we must put industry in the  service of agriculture, because the existence of the noble  nation depends on agricultural production.    Our nation has high potential, and the governments, which  have attained power, have traveled this path. This is in  conflict with the goals of world imperialism. The dear farmers  must understand that they are the soldiers with low expectations  on this path and they strive continuously, having girded  themselves under the pressure of arms and and unnecessary  delays. It is no longer appropriate for organizations to sell at  higher prices and for products to be more expensive while you  reinforce them. In the Five-Year Plan you must support their  fertilizer, pesticides, machinery, raw materials, electrical  power, and water.  <H5>  Morteza Shayesteh, Deputy From Khansar and Golpayegan </H5>   The ways to economic prosperity include population control,  reduced imports, strengthening conversion industries, and  insuring vulnerable crops.    The next speaker was Shayesteh, deputy from Golpaygan and  Khansar. He offered congratulations and felicitations on the  birth anniversary of the prince of martyrs (peace be upon him),  His Holiness Abol-Fazl al-'Abbas (peace be upon him) and His  Holiness Seyyed al-Sajedin Zeyn al-'Abedin (peace be upon him)  to the Shi'ites of the world and our esteemed compatriots. He  said: In view of the fact that the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March  1995] budget bill is under study and the Second Five-Year Social  and Cultural Development Plan will also be studied in the near  future, I consider it necessary to give my expert views on the  gross national product.    He added: In the year 1335 [21 March 1955-20 March 1956]  food  for 1.6 persons was produced on a hectare of agricultural land.  In the year 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] this figure  reached 3.2 persons. To feed the people in our society, we must  bring this figure up to 4.5 persons. Various statistics indicate  that 25 to 30 percent of various foodstuffs are lost because of  poor conversion and storage resources, meaning that enough food  to feed 15 to 20 million people is destroyed through losses.    Continuing, the speaker said: For many reasons, such as the  fact that it uses little foreign exchange and earns much foreign  exchange, creates employment, has potential resources and  employs existing technology in the country, the agricultural  sector needs to continue its rapid development. Based on  existing data this sector's share in the gross domestic product  [GDP] in the year 1339 [21 March 1960-20 March 1961] compared to  the other sectors was 37.5 percent. In the year 1351 [21 March  1972-20 March 1973] it was 16.2 percent. In the year 1356 [21  March 1977-20 March 1978] it was less than 10 percent of the  GDP. In the year 1365 [21 March 1986-20 March 1987] it began  rising and reached 23.7 percent, and in the year 1371 [21 March  1992-20 March 1993] it reached 26.6 percent.    One path to development in the economic sector is to  increase  investment in this sector. According to existing statistics, the  agriculture sector's share in forming fixed gross domestic  investment is insignificant. In the year 1352 [21 March 1973-20  March 1974] it was 19.7 percent. In the year 1363 [21 March  1984-20 March 1985] it was about 4.2 percent and in the year  1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] it was about 7.5 percent.  Although relative attention was given to this sector after the  triumph of the Islamic revolution, the sector's share of total  development credits was insignificant.    From 1352 to 1356 [21 March 1973-20 March 1978] this share  was about 7.5 percent. From 1368 to 1372 [21 March 1989-20 March  1994] it was about 9.6 percent, so that about 1.33 rials[R] was  invested for each hectare of agricultural land, or about 0.1  percent, an insignificant figure compared to the developed  nations. According to existing statistics, in the years 1344 to  1362 [21 March 1965-20 March 1984], the production investment  indicator in the agricultural sector was 2.36 percent, and it  was 4.23 in other sectors. Again based on existing statistics,  about one in three of the workers in our country works in  agriculture.    It is also worth mentioning: In terms of quantities, the  employment structure in the economic development cycle has  continually shown a decline in the agricultural sector along  with increases in the industrial and service sectors. On the one  hand our current society is faced with the phenomenon of  unemployment and it is expected that by the year 1385 [21 March  2006-20 March 2007] our country will need 16.56 million  employment opportunities. To create a job in the service sector  requires investment of R2.11 million, and it costs R1.37 million  in the agricultural sector. Apart from the fact that investment  for agricultural employment is less than in the other sectors,  it also has significant profits and is relatively advantageous.    Continuing, the speaker added: Exports of agricultural and  traditional goods have always made up the biggest part of nonoil  exports, and in the years 1361 to 1370 [21 March 1982-20 March  1992] they grew an average of 24.3 percent. In the year 1361  agricultural goods valued at more than $255 million made up 60  percent of nonoil exports, while industrial export goods were  valued at $21 million and made up about 7.5 percent of nonoil  exports. In the year 1365 [21 March 1986-20 March 1987]  agricultural exports increased 110 percent over the previous  year. That same year industrial goods made up 12 percent of  nonoil exports.    He then said: These figures show agriculture's place in our  nation's economy. I declare that if full attention is given to  this sector, in the near future we will be able to forget about  the policy of the one-product economy.    At the end of his speech he made the following  recommendations to achieve economic growth and prosperity:  Population control, reducing losses by training producers,  distributors and consumers, reinforcing and developing  conversion industries, building silos, warehouses and  refrigerators, writing laws and regulations in the interest of  the economic sectors, especially agriculture, creating  conditions favorable for exports, reducing food imports,  creating cooperation and better contacts between the service  sectors and the economic producing sector in such a way that the  focus will be on production, insuring vulnerable crops,  reinforcing and developing production cooperatives and  organizing the sales market.  <H5>  Mohammad Baqer Tavakoli, Deputy From Khomeyn </H5>   The sale of hospitals and government units and making them  autonomous in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill  is a disaster.    Tavakoli, deputy from Khomeyn, was the third pre-agenda  speaker. He offered congratulations on Combatants and Guards  Day. Concerning the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget  bill, he said: As long as the government and the Majles are  unable to reform the administrative and management structure and  reduce the enormous costs in the ministries and government  companies and reduce the costs of production, and as long as  they cannot limit the enormous competition for consumerism,  ostentation, trips abroad and seminars, by raising prices and  eliminating some subsidies, we will not succeed in reducing  costs.    He added: Although the Majles has prohibited the purchase of  passenger automobiles and the formation of companies in the 1372  [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] budget to reduce costs,  unfortunately late in the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March  1993] a huge amount of passenger automobiles was purchased and  numerous companies were formed.    Although Note 25 of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995]  budget bill was implemented on a revenue cost basis, it will  include about R3 trillion in revenues for government, oil,  power, and communications companies. If we consider the nation's  population in the year 1373 to be 60 million, the average worker  wage at 28,000 tomans and the average family to be five people,  as of the year 1373 every Iranian will have an average income  deficit of 5,000 tomans and every family will have an income  deficit of 25,000 tomans.    He added: Workers, who are the nation's real vulnerable  class, will have 11 months purchasing power in 1373 compared to  the year 1372. The implementation of Note 25 optimistically  projects inflation at about 10 to 15 percent. Calculating the  inflation in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill  at about 13 to 25 percent, less an increase of 5 percent in  worker wages for that year, this great class in the nation will  be faced with inflation of about 20 to 35 percent.    According to statistics, the government consumes about 7  million of the 48 million liters of gasoline consumed daily, and  in the transportation and shipping sector the government is  considered one of the major consumers. With the increase in the  price of fuel and transportation costs, heavy costs will be  imposed on the government. Ultimately the inflationary burden  will fall on the people and the vulnerable class.    He then recommended the deletion of Note 25 and discussed  the  matter of drugs in the country. He said: Drugs are an important  and vital public need. In view of the fact that in the year 1372  [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], because of limited foreign  exchange about 20 percent of the nation's drugs were sold at the  floating foreign exchange rate, regrettably I must say that  treatment services and social security for this same vulnerable  and wage-earning class were eliminated from insurance polices.  Next year a percentage will be added to that. I therefore ask my  colleagues to give special attention to this vital matter.    The implementation of paragraphs Z and M of Note 10  concerning the sale of hospitals and treatment units and making  them autonomous is a disaster, because this will only be  practical in the major cities and Tehran and will have bad  effects on the country.    Continuing, Tavakoli discussed the government's failure to  observe social justice in Paragraph T, Note 5 of the 1372 [21  March 1993-20 March 1994] budget. He said: Again we saw and are  seeing comfortable families receiving huge subsidies. For  example, among electrical power subscribers, today rural and  low-consumption subscribers receive monthly subsidies of 1,000  tomans. Normal consumption subscribers receive average monthly  subsidies of 3,400 tomans, and comfortable and high-consumption  subscribers in society receive monthly subsidies of 10,000  tomans. That is, the comfortable subscribers receive ten times  the subsidies of the rural and low-income subscribers.    He added: Unfortunately, credits to build rural public bath  houses and to improve the rural areas in Central Province have  been deleted from the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget,  and I ask officials to correct this error.    Continuing his remarks, Tavakoli asked the minister of roads  and transportation for help and cooperation in concluding the  Khomeyn-Dehno project, and he asked the minister of health care,  treatment and medical education for help and cooperation in  elevating the expert nursing program in Khomeyn to the level of  a nursing college.  <H5>  Majid Naderi, Deputy From Bu'in, Zahra, and Avej </H5>   The final pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles  session was Naderi, deputy from Bu'in, Zahra and Avej. During  his speech he said: Now 38 years have passed since the martyrdom  of the great men whose battles and sacrifice began at a time  when the dead earth was heaped over this nation, and our Islamic  land was subjected to cultural, political economic and military  assaults. In those days the enemies of Iran and Islam occupied  the country and imposed humiliating treaties. This was done  during Reza Khan's 20-year era.    Making use of the so-called open political atmosphere and  starting groups and political parties dependent on foreign  policies, they took over the newspapers and mercenary  publications and tried to destroy the freedom of the Iranian  nation. It was religious zeal and enthusiasm that led to a  reaction against the occupiers. He continued: After the month of  Shahrivar in the year 1320 [23 August-22 September 1941] the  appearance of publications such as the magazine  Parcham, the newspaper MARDOM, the emergence of  secular, materialist and nationalist writers and the printing of  misleading books and their extensive distribution, were all  definitely calculated to prevent religious unity among the  various social classes. [passages omitted on Navab Safavi]  <H5>  Legislation </H5> <H3>  Bill on the Cultural and Educational Agreement Between Iran  and Turkmenistan </H3>   The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles  session was the report from the Islamic Guidance and Art  Commission on the Bill on the Cultural, Scientific and  Educational Agreement Between the Governments of the Islamic  Republic of Iran and the Republic of Turkmenistan.

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REFLECTIONS: LEARNING TO ACCEPT A GAY SON  </P> <P> As members of Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, Burt and Sheila Galper  have been counseling other parents for several years. There was a time when  Burt Galper refused to attend the meetings. The Galpers, parents of four grown  children, live in Van Nuys.  </P> <P>  My 28-year-old son's name is Mitchell. When he was 19 years old, he came home  from UC Santa Barbara for Christmas vacation. He called my wife into the room  for some reason or other, and about a half hour later they called me in. My son  threw a book on the bed, and the title of it was, "Loving Someone Gay."  </P> <P> I looked at it and I asked him, "Why are you showing me this book?" And he  said, "Because I'm gay." And I fell apart. I just couldn't believe it. We never  had any idea that he was gay. My first thought was that I was very ashamed of  him. I was uneducated about gays and I thought that he had made a bad choice.  </P> <P> We started talking about it, and I was crying, and he kept on saying, "Dad, I  was born this way and there's nothing that I can do to change. You're going to  have to learn about gays." And I said, "I don't want to learn about gays. As  long as you're in my house I don't want you to be gay." And we argued. It took  approximately nine months of torture between the two of us arguing, and Sheila  and I arguing.  </P> <P> I cried a lot. I was depressed a lot. When Mitch was home during the summer,  I'd come home and go to my room, I'd watch television, I wouldn't talk to him.  I wanted him to date girls. He said, "Dad, it doesn't interest me."  </P> <P> Sheila heard about an organization called Parents and Friends of Lesbians and  Gays. And they said it's very important to bring your husband to a meeting. I  was stubborn, and I wouldn't go. My wife said, "Mitch isn't going to change.  Why don't we go to this meeting for him and see?" Finally, I said, "OK, I'll go  for him."  </P> <P> Each month that I went to a meeting I felt better. I realized that I can't have  my son live the life that I want him to live. He has to live the life that he  has to live. I called him up, he was in college, and I said, "I want to tell  you something. I'm going to accept you completely. I love you, son,  unconditionally. Everything you do is OK, because conditional love is no love  at all."  </P> <P> We found out about AIDS in 1981. I brought it up to my son and and he said that  he was taking care of himself. So I've never really had the fear of him  catching AIDS. I tell other parents, "Your gay son is probably educated about  this but your heterosexual daughter is not, and you should educate her."  </P> <P> Mitchell is a dentist now in the Hollywood area and he does very good work. He  works one day a week with AIDS Project Los Angeles in a clinic for AIDS  patients who cannot afford to go to a regular dentist.  </P> <P> He has a lot of friends who are dying. He's very much involved in the AIDS  Project buddy system. The buddy system is where they become a buddy of an AIDS  patient. If the AIDS patient is having a problem, he's there to help him. It's  a great organization and they do good things for AIDS patients. He's lost a  couple of buddies, and that hurts.  </P> <P> I am a lot smarter than I was years ago and more compassionate. I feel better  about myself. Maybe I was outside looking in before and now I get involved. If  it wasn't for my son, we would never have met the people in this organization,  whom we really love.  </P> <P> We now help other people and we support him 100%. We walk in the parade during  Gay Pride Week and I carry a big sign that says, "My son is gay and that's OK."  When we turn the corner on Santa Monica Boulevard, the crowd just stands up and  start screaming, "We love you, parents. We love you. You're wonderful." It  brings tears to your eyes; the roar is just unreal. There's so much love from  them for the parents. A lot of it is because they don't get it from their own  parents.  </P></p>

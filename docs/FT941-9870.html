			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / German engineering talks fail Talks to head off a strike in the German engineering industry collapsed last night, with both sides accusing each other of a refusal to compromise, writes Quentin Peel from Darmstadt. Attempts to agree on more flexible working hours, as an alternative to the current 36-hour week, failed, in spite of 10 hours of negotiations between leaders of IG Metall, the engineering workers' union, and Gesamtmetall, the employers' federation. The union is keen to see a temporary reduction in working hours, as an alternative to more redundancies in the recession-hit industry, but without a full cut in earnings. Mr Klaus Zwickel, leader of IG Metall, said no date had been set for further negotiations, before the union is due to decide on February 21 on calling a strike ballot. Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, the employers' leader, said they were prepared to open the current wage contract to reduce working hours to 30 per week in extreme cases, but the union was insisting on some compensation to maintain earnings.

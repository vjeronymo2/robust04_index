			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Trade between China  and the European Community (EC) will continue to grow this year  as bilateral trade volume last year reaching a record high of  26.1 billion U.S. dollars, according to an official of China's  Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).    The official said that EC Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan is  scheduled to arrive here on Saturday [26 February] to attend the  13th Sino-EC joint commission on trade and economic cooperation  and he will also hold talks with MOFTEC Minister Wu Yi.    They are expected to touch on issues of bilateral economic  and trade relations and new ways to further expand cooperation.    The official said that China attaches importance to its  imports from the EC and the import volume has been on the rise  during the past few years, with last year's trade volume hitting  14.4 billion U.S. dollars.    He especially mentioned that between 1991 and 1993 China  sent  three purchasing delegations to Europe.    China purchased as much as 6 billion U.S. dollars worth of  goods in 1993 alone, mostly technical equipment.    However, he pointed out, the expansion of China's imports  from Europe is limited by the quota restrictions on China  exports to Europe and the discriminatory moves in protecting the  European market.    Last year, China had a trade deficit of nearly 3 billion  U.S.  dollars with Europe, he said. Traditional items, including  textiles, light industry goods, local and livestock products and  grain and edible oils, remain the major commodities of China's  exports to Europe.    In recent years, with the increasing inflow of foreign  capital to China, light industrial products take a larger share  in the exports to the EC, he said.    During the meeting of the Sino-EC joint commission of trade  and economic co-operation, the two sides will hold consultations  on the restoration of China's signatory party status in GATT, he  said. This is the first time China and the EC will have  exchanged views on China's re-entry into GATT.    The official hoped that the EC could reach an agreement on  China's restoration protocol as soon as possible.    It is known that there are the basis and wishes on both  sides  to develop bilateral economic and trade relations.    From 1979 to 1993, the EC's contracted investments in China  amounted to five billion U.S. dollars, 40 percent of which had  been poured into the productive fields of automobiles,  telephones, glass and medicine.    Though the EC's investment in China is smaller than those  from the U.S. and Japan, it increased rapidly in the past few  years, and some large enterprises, in particular, strengthened  their involvement in China.    The official welcomed the EC countries to invest in China,  and said that China will provide favorable conditions for their  business activities.</p>

It stressed the importance of  treatment and prevention of drugs at home, as well as  alternative economic development and strengthening of the  institutions charged with combating drug trafficking abroad.    In theory, and regarding the international component of the  new strategy, there seems to be a change of course. Robert  Gelbard, U.S. assistant secretary of state for international  drug trafficking affairs, has said that while in the past a  special effort was made to intercept and seize drug shipments  destined for the United States, the current plan is aimed at  cocaine-producing countries, combining eradication of coca  plants with self-sustained development.    In principle it sounds good. The only catch is that this is  the strategy's publicity portion. During the past few years the  drug trafficking issue has been at the core of relations between  Washington and Latin America. In its development this issue has  been defined by the White House as a national security problem  and in fact has gradually become a threat to the internal and  external security of the rest of the area's countries.    During the two most recent Republican administrations  (Reagan- Bush) the concept of "drug trafficking" occupied the  central spot in the new sociological language on drugs. Stress  was put on the external nature of this "malignant" problem. The  core of the problem was thought to consist of narcotics  trafficking and transportation.    In other words, the danger was thought to stem from the  supply, which the Reagan-Bush administrations regarded as a  threat to U.S. social and even institutional structures.    Since the first Reagan administration, political-strategic  logic ruled out the drug phenomenon's economic and commercial  rationale. In the cause-effect diagnosis, ideology replaced  pragmatism. With the hobbyhorse of "morals," the emphasis on  solutions was expressed in words like "combat, war, and  crusade." The Pentagon said it was necessary to combat the  problem "at its origin" -- production and processing centers --  with highly coercive and repressive methods.    This argument, which failed to underline the importance of  demand as the cause of the supply -- and which therefore  concealed the situation's commercial and financial reality --  evidently had a political objective, that is to say, to transfer  the cost of the fight to the producing countries.    Roughly, this has been the story of the failed "war on  drugs"  of the past three Republican administrations, with three  additions. Drugs have also invaded a very specific area --  counterinsurgency.    Pentagon and Department of State publicity fanned the notion  of "narcoterrorism" in the framework of a counterinsurgency  policy, which has to do with the new standard that the U.S.  Department of State seeks to impose on the subcontinent at the  end of the Cold War.    During the Reagan and Bush administrations, the most  prominent U.S. proposal to the Latin American drug-producing  countries was to create a coercive regional counternarcotics  force, with extraterritorial jurisdiction which could operate  without the limitations imposed by sovereignty at local borders.    In view of the "coca for development" Andean strategy --  encouraged by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and Bolivian  President Jaime Paz Zamora -- Washington implemented a policy  stressing military aspects.    Bush, both president of the world's largest  narcotics-consuming country and the epitome of contradiction,  avoided facing the problem at home and pressed to mobilize the  Armed Forces of the "drug countries" into carrying out  essentially police tasks.    In addition, the Pentagon succeeded in establishing some  posts in area countries, particularly Peru and Colombia. Two  examples are Santa Lucia military base in the Upper Huallaga in  a Peruvian coca- producing zone controlled by the Shining Path,  and a base in Leticia, Colombia in the Amazon area of the border  with Peru, where 500 U.S. soldiers are stationed.    Although Bill Clinton's speech now emphasizes the antidrug  struggle at home and the budget allocation for the external  front has been reduced, part of what he failed to say when he  explained his strategy makes it possible to conjecture that the  new president will continue to apply some of the former policy's  central components through the militarization of producing  countries.    It is no mere chance that there are U. S. military engineers  in Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Guatemala in the framework of  the "Caminos del Sur/94" exercise.    Their alleged tasks hint at the nature of their specific  assignments, such as training in Guatemala, training and radar  site installation in Colombia, and participation in the local  fight against drugs in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Colombia. These are  functions usually assigned to the police.    In reality, the Pentagon has spent a great deal of time and  money on these actions and has succeeded in involving the CIA  and DEA.    For this reason, we can assume that President Clinton was  carried away by the momentum of the circumstances. While he says  one thing in his speeches, in practice he follows and improves  on previous strategies in Latin American countries.</p>

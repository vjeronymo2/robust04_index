			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD OIL PRICES PLUMMET IN WAKE OF OPEC MEETING  </P> <P> World oil prices plummeted today after a meeting of three key OPEC oil  ministers in Saudi Arabia apparently failed to produce any significant cutback  in production.  </P> <P> On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the benchmark West Texas Intermediate for  May delivery plunged 54 cents to $16.90 a barrel in midday trading.  </P> <P> On the U.S. Gulf Coast cash market, West Texas Intermediate for prompt delivery  dived 45 cents to $17 a barrel.  </P> <P> On the European spot market, Britain's widely traded North Sea Brent fell 49  cents to $15.47 a barrel.  </P> <P> The United Arab Emirates' Dubai light -- the key OPEC crude from the Middle  East shipped mainly to the Far East -- slipped 5 cents to $13.60 a barrel.  </P> <P> Unleaded gasoline for May delivery dropped 0.99 cent to 59.45 cents a gallon on  the Merc, while home heating oil slipped 1.40 cents to 52.80 cents a gallon.  </P> <P> Oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE met Tuesday in Jidda, Saudi  Arabia, to discuss overproduction by the latter two nations, which had played a  role in the recent 14% plunge in world prices.  </P> <P> The three are key players in the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting  Countries, which pumps more than a third of the world's crude and which  attempts to support higher prices by limiting production.  </P> <P> "It appears (Saudi oil minister Hisham) Nazer's little tea party didn't come up  with anything significant. At least that's what the market is saying today,"  said Peter Beutel, a trader with Elders Futures Inc. in New York.  </P></p>

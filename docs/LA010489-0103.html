			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GUARD SESSIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE;  </P> <P> HOMELESS CAN'T USE ARMORIES ON WEEKEND  </P> <P> Long-planned National Guard training sessions will monopolize armories in Santa  Ana and Fullerton for most of this week, making them unavailable to the  homeless who have been sheltered there during recent cold nights.  </P> <P> The news caught county officials and local help-the-homeless volunteers by  surprise. Volunteers confirmed the news Tuesday, then issued an urgent appeal  for temporary shelter space should cold rains or frigid night-time temperatures  make emergency shelters necessary.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Exhibit Halls Suggested  </P> <P> "We need big gymnasiums, maybe exhibit halls like the ones at the fairgrounds,  maybe big church halls," said Scott Mather, who heads the Orange County  Homeless Task Force. His mainly volunteer organization coordinates the opening  of emergency shelters when overnight temperatures are predicted to fall to 40  degrees, or to 50 degrees when a 50% chance of rain is forecast.  </P> <P> "The county has the cots, blankets and towels, and we have the food,  transportation and volunteers," Mather said. "We have everything to operate a  facility; all we need is a facility.  </P> <P> "We've made a few contacts, but we're not getting very far," Mather said late  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The forecast for the rest of the week is that a cold front will move into  Orange County and the rest of the Southland on Thursday, which could mean a  return of rain and cold weather. The National Weather Service, whose forecasts  govern whether emergency shelters are opened, was predicting low temperatures  in the 40s for Thursday through Saturday mornings.  </P> <P> Maj. Steve Mensik, a National Guard spokesman in Sacramento, said the coming  weekend is "a heavy drill weekend throughout the state. We try to have everyone  drill on the same weekend. I'd be surprised if there are any armories not being  used this weekend for (the) drill."  </P> <P> Typical training will be refresher courses in map reading, radio operation,  first-aid and mobilization procedures, Mensik said, adding that such training  weekends are scheduled more than a year in advance.  </P> <P> As a result of the training, the Santa Ana and Fullerton armories would not be  available to the homeless on Friday or Saturday nights, Mensik said. In  addition, the Fullerton armory will be closed Thursday and Sunday nights  because it will be involved in equipment loading and unloading operations.  </P> <P> Although the Santa Ana armory could be made available to the homeless on  Thursday and Sunday nights, Mather said, "We're still going to be jammed."  </P> <P> Mather said the surprise word of the armory-scheduling problem resulted from "a  breakdown in communication."  </P> <P> "We reserved the (Santa Ana and Fullerton) armories for December and January,  but we didn't know that the Guard's regularly scheduled activities would take  precedence over ours," he said. "Nothing can be done about it. There's no bad  guy."  </P> <P> So far, the armories have been open for the homeless all but two days since  Dec. 15, Mather said. They were not open on Dec. 21 because the weather was  unusually warm, and they were not open on Dec. 26 because county officials  miscalculated that the day would be warm, when in fact it turned very cold, he  added.  </P> <P> The armories did not open Tuesday night because the prediction of rain was only  20% and temperatures were forecast to dip to the middle-to-high 40s.  </P> <P> Mather said donors of temporary shelter space will, under state law, be free of  liability hazard and will have exclusive use of their facilities during  daylight hours.  </P> <P> "We've been doing this for a while and it goes very smoothly. If someone opened  up a hall for us, we'd have them in about 5 p.m. and out by 7:30 a.m." He said  those spending the night in such shelters would be transported by volunteers.  </P> <P> Mather said what is needed is a large floor space with a nearby kitchen and,  ideally, shower facilities. "Showering is important. A lot of these guys have  jobs," he pointed out.  </P> <P> Shelter is needed for a total of about 300 people, Mather said. He estimated  that the average high school gymnasium would comfortably house about 120 people  and the average church hall about 75 to 100.  </P> <P> Staff writer Jim Carlton contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> BULLS GORE RUNNER, 38, TO DEATH  </P> <P> A 38-year-old man was gored to death today when he tripped and fell during the  annual running of the bulls in this southwestern town.  </P> <P> The running of the bulls in this town of 12,000 people 149 miles west of Madrid  is staged as part of the annual fiesta dedicated to St. John.  </P> <P> In the ritual, the bulls are turned loose before dawn in the town's sealed-off  streets, and young men race ahead of them. The bulls are killed in bullfights  later in the day.  </P> <P> Many small towns and cities across Spain maintain the tradition. But in recent  years, there has been growing opposition from Spanish and foreign groups to  bullfights and the running of the bulls on the grounds that the practices  constitute cruelty to animals.  </P></p>

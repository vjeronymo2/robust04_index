He told a news  conference a working committee had been established on Monday  night to explore the possiblility of holding the election in  kwaZulu, where more than 100 people have been killed in the past  week.    "The Angolan experience indicates that in a society  infinitely more riven than ours they actually did conduct free  and fair elections. If they can do it in Angola we can do it  anywhere in this country, including kwaZulu and Natal," he said.    In Angola, rebel UNITA [National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola] leader Jonas Savimbi rejected the result  of the internationally monitored election, which his UNITA  movement lost, and returned to civil war.    The IEC also announced at the news conference that there had  been 305 complaints of infringement of the Electoral Act and 15  summonses had been issued. Mr Justice Kriegler said two  elections officials travelled to Durban on Monday night and had  talks with representatives of the kwaZulu government and the  Transitional Executive Council on implementation of the IEC's  mandate in kwaZulu.    The meeting agreed to create a working committee that would  include police to look into the feasibility, "under the current  political climate, to mount an election in kwaZulu" as a matter  of urgency, Mr Kriegler said.    The committee began its work on Tuesday morning and is  expected to report on its findings by April 5, Mr Justice  Kriegler said. If the committee concluded that an election was  not possible in kwaZulu, it would be up to political leaders to  find a solution. "As far as the IEC is concerned, that will be a  political impediment. It will be for the political role players  to resolve the issue and to remove any poltical impediments," he  said.    The IEC visit to Durban followed talks between President F.  W. de Klerk and kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who  had pledged to allow the IEC to work in his region. Mr  Buthelezi's supporters have occupied at least two venues for  African National Congress rallies in the region, sparking fears  of a bloody run-up to the election.    Political violence has soared in kwaZulu and Natal, leaving  more than 100 people dead and scores injured in the past week.  A Zulu march in central Johannesburg on Monday to demand a Zulu  kingdom erupted in vicious gunbattles that left at least 31  people dead and hundreds injured.    Mr Justice Kriegler said planning for the election in  kwaZulu/Natal was going ahead. He said the IEC on Tuesday  morning began identifying and securing voting stations  countrywide. Asked whether the violence in central Johannesburg  on Monday could have an effect on the election, he said: "It  does not seem to impact directly on free and election. It may  have serious political implications later." He added the IEC  was in regular contact with security forces on plans to ensure  adequate safety for voters.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis called on the UN  Security Council to think seriously whether continuing the talks  is the way to resolve the Cyprus issue when the Turkish side has  no political will for this. He also made it clear that the  Greek Cypriot side will make no suggestions before the National  Council convenes to discuss the views that will be discussed  with the Greek Government.    In a statement to Greek radio in London before he left for  Cyprus, Kliridhis added that the UN Security Council must  consider seriously UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's  report and that the permanent members must begin work on the  next step.    Kliridhis said it is difficult to define the U.S. stance if  Washington still believes there is a chance for the  intercommunal talks to resolve anything, either on the substance  of the issue or the confidence-building measures.    The president said there are no obstacles to convening a  pannational conference, and that the Greek and Cypriot  Governments still have to decide on the appropriate time. He  added: Maybe it would be more suitable to begin with a meeting  by our National Council with the Greek Government and then  expand it to a pannational conference.    Commenting on a statement by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf  Denktas about the prospects of Cyprus joining the European  Union, Kliridhis said Denktas is concerned because he knows that  when Europe makes it clear that it will accept Cyprus regardless  of whether there is a solution to the Cyprus issue, Turkey will  have to decide whether it is willing to solve it or continue to  be an occupation force.    Discussing Turkey's stance, Kliridhis said its views are  identical to those of Denktas. He added: Turkish Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller wants to create the impression that she is  trying to keep her promises, but domestic problems and the  Turkish Cypriot leadership are keeping her from doing so.</p>

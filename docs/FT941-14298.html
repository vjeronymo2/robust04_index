			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Tories boost profile of industry policy The government is to raise the profile of its approach to industry in an effort to boost exports and strengthen its industrial base. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, announced a white paper on competitiveness which will set out the government's 'hands on' role in 'backing winners', to be published in the summer. It will be the first white paper on the government's approach to industry since the Conservatives came to office in 1979. Announcing the decision to the House of Commons trade and industry committee yesterday, Mr Heseltine said: 'Governments intervene all the time; the only question is what form it takes.' The white paper will emphasise 'competitiveness', emulating the language of the Clinton administration, not old-style 'industrial policy'. Whitehall said it would take a 'broad view' of the government's approach to Britain's industrial weaknesses, including skills shortcomings, technology promotion and the liaison between Whitehall and industry. Mr Heseltine ruled out any return to large-scale public funding of particular industrial sectors, but said government was ready to do 'anything it reasonably can to enhance the environment within which industries can flourish'. The white paper will take the form of a response to the trade and industry committee's report on competitiveness in manufacturing industry, due to be published in March. But it will concentrate on all wealth-creating sectors. Referring to the work of the trade and industry department's competitiveness unit, Mr Heseltine warned the committee that Europe 'is going to have to face up to some fairly unpalatable changes as it meets the challenge from Asia in the next decade. . . People will not base industries in Europe out of charity'. He conceded that Whitehall departments were not working closely enough together in liaising with industry, but criticised some trade associations which, he said, 'often do not do a good job'. In addition to the report on competitiveness, the government has conducted a wide-ranging 'benchmarking' exercise, comparing the performance of specific sectors with those overseas. The results are believed not to have been published in full. Labour members of the trade and industry committee called on the government to provide financial help for companies involved in technological projects. But Mr Heseltine refused to support any significant increase in subsidies.</p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / 'Treaty of hope' signed by Bush and Yeltsin HUMANITY'S largest step back from the nuclear arms race was formally agreed in Moscow yesterday by presidents Boris Yeltsin of Russia and George Bush of the US. The Start 2 treaty promises, over the next decade, to cut the two countries' arsenals of strategic missiles to one-third of their present levels. 'I would call this treaty a treaty of hope,' said Mr Yeltsin, speaking in the Kremlin after signing the agreement. Mr Bush matched his rhetoric by speaking of standing 'at the threshold of a new world of hope'. Like the Russian president, he said it represented the fulfilment of dreams which had until recently seemed unrealisable. Mr Yeltsin appeared vigorous and genial throughout the public parts of the two-day event. He said Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the new prime minister, would continue economic reforms with 'the same cabinet' as had served Mr Yegor Gaidar, his predecessor. He also promised to continue to back the US-United Nations line of sanctions on Yugoslavia, in spite of dissent within his parliament on both issues. He said he was 'absolutely confident' that the Supreme Soviet would ratify the treaty (as it had ratified Start 1 last November). However, Ukraine, which with Belarus and Kazakhstan still holds strategic weapons, has not yet ratified Start 1 - necessary before Start 2 can be implemented. It is seen by the US as dragging its feet dangerously on the issue, although yesterday Ukraine's president Leonid Kravchuk predicted that his parliament would ratify Start 1. Both Ukraine and neighbouring Belarus have bases housing bombers capable of delivering nuclear missiles. Ukraine has been adamant that these bases, though nominally controlled by the Commonwealth of Indepen-dent States, are under its control. Mr Bush assured Mr Yeltsin that Mr Bill Clinton, to whom he cedes office in two weeks, backed the treaty and was committed to 'keeping relations with Russia on the same high plane they are already on'. Mr Yeltsin said he wanted to meet Mr Clinton soon after the President-elect takes office on January 20. But Mr Clinton, flying home to Little Rock from a holiday in South Carolina, said no date had yet been set for a meeting with the Russian leader. The treaty, codifying the agreement reached between the two presidents in June last year in Washington, lays down a series of reductions over two phases - the first ending seven years after Start 1 comes into force, the second ending at the latest in 2003. The number of strategic nuclear missile warheads held by either side will not exceed 4,250 at the end of the first phase and 3,500 by the year 2003, while intercontinental ballistic missiles with multiple warheads will be cut entirely - signalling the end of the SS-18s deployed in the former Soviet Union, a long-standing US goal. Submarine-launched ballistic missiles, counted separately, will not exceed 1,750 warheads on either side. One US official said yesterday that the cutting of the SS-18s and partial destruction of their silos 'removes once and for all that dreaded thing, the first strike'. In addition, 100 bombers will be 're-oriented' to conventional roles, and transferred to conventional bases. New verification procedures have been agreed, including a limited inspection right for Russian officials of America's B2 'Stealth' bomber. George Graham adds from Washington: In the US, senior senators from both parties said they expected the Start 2 agreement to win ratification in Congress. Senator Joseph Biden, the Democratic chairman of the Senate judiciary committee - which has jurisdiction over treaty ratifications - said his concern was not with the treaty, but with the prospect that it might not be implemented if the US did not do more to help the Russian government with its economic reforms. 'I think we have been almost derelict in doing the things we could be doing,' Mr Biden said. Page 11 Arms treaty is hostage to fortune Leaders heaped in historic praise</p>

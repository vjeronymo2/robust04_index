			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Louis Gallois, the president of Aerospatiale, has  asked for 3 billion French francs [Fr] from the company's major  shareholder, the French Government, to provide the necessary  financial support to the company while it prepares for  privatization by the end of the century. The French Government  has agreed to supply the company with Fr2 billion, and no one  seriously expected more. Aerospatiale has had a difficult year  with Airbus and military sales low. Its sales decreased 5  percent in 1993. Despite this situation, its debt has been  reduced. However, the group's balance sheet remains burdened by  a colossal debt even though it has been reduced by 9 percent in  1993: it is Frl5 billion, or twice shareholders' equity (Fr6  billion).    "The state has done its duty as a shareholder," commented  Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery commented. According to  him, the EU Commission can not criticize the Fr2 billion.  Aerospatiale, unlike [failing computer company] Bull, is not in  difficulty and the austerity plan which has been enacted [at  Aerospatiale] should allow a return to profitability in 1995.  In the meantime, privatization is not the order of the day.  Alphandery confirmed that the Fr2 billion will come from the  Fr21-billion funds budgeted by the government for public  companies.</p>

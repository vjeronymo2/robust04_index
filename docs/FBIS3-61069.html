That was the only time available. After all,  conversion has become disorderly partisan warfare. Not only  does it not have a strategy or tactics, it does not even know  whether to advance or retreat, trapped in the pincers of the  disorder in the state. Acrid is the smoke of financial  conflagrations and the doused bonfires of the way stations of  the helpless. Is the Russian Government really indifferent to  the destruction of the military-industrial complex?    First and foremost we no longer have a military-industrial  complex as such, Aleksey Nikolayevich explained. There are only  the high-technology sectors left. But so far neither the  president's entourage nor the government has found the time to  take a look at them. However, their verbal tirades have been  simply staggering.    At first the president blithely promised that by the first  fall the military industry would keep the people watered and fed  with the "harvest" of its conversion projects. But then the  drought came, reducing the ruble to worthless scraps of paper.  Then last August the government adopted the alleged armament --  but really disarmament -- program; in November it "adjusted" it;  and at the end of December Chernomyrdin ordered a complete  review.    The results are shameful. Not even from the very first days  but rather the first hours of the new year the fulfillment of  the defense orders for 1994 was on the brink of catastrophe.  This is because in the previous two years the collectives of  enterprises working on military hardware had suffered damage  comparable to that caused by a nuclear strike. The most  specialized sections had come to a complete standstill and  dropped out of the manufacturing process. To restore them now  will take nothing less than heroic efforts surpassing even the  labor exploits of the Great Patriotic War. And even then it  will take not months or years, but decades.    A gloomy but objective forecast. It is based on the colossal  brain drain of top-class people not just from enterprises but  also from scientific research institutes and design bureaus.  The first wave of extreme poverty swept away the most highly  qualified doctors of sciences, the second wave took candidate  doctors with it. Today it is the wave of "top specialists."  Yet each of them is like Saltykov-Shchedrin's peasant whose  labor keeps two generals fed. What you have left are those  young kids who detest the idea of running away and those who  like everything the way it is.    [PRAVDA] Aleksey Nikolayevich, are Russia's intellectual  knights not signing up with subcontractors? Where are they  going to beat their swords into plowshares?    [Shulunov] First of all, quite a few foreign firms have  absolutely no interest in importing defense staff into their  countries. Those people are far more necessary over here  because they possess not only military secrets but also purely  civilian secrets which are sometimes incomprehensible to foreign  entrepreneurs. The most talented design staff are being offered  work not in offices but at home. They are being equipped with  personal computers, equipment, cars -- work at home rather than  wasting your time on chaotic public transport. We guarantee  personal secrecy and a living wage.    Very many people are joining commercial structures in this  country -- small but lively and well-equipped firms -- they are  designing and taking part in the production of and trade in  purpose-built instruments, apparatus, technologies, and  household goods. It is very good that such activity has started  up in our country. After all, just two years ago such an  infrastructure did not exist here.    But the bright lights also beckoned our talented defense  specialists from abroad. The U.S. Congress and State Department  adopted an urgent decision to admit and welcome Russia's best  minds, especially those from the military-industrial complex.  They set a generous quota: 11,000 people a year. But it was  emphasized that they should be from Russia, not Ukraine or  Belarus. They can expect very considerable financial assistance  to help them adapt, the promise of the accelerated acquisition  of American citizenship, and the promise of cost-of-living and  "training" allowances. At a time when defense specialists are  publicly becoming impoverished -- in December the "average" wage  was 35,000 rubles [R] -- the competition among people wanting to  lead at least a normal life was very great.    The demand for the export of rare intellects and talents is  growing but will mean an irreparable loss for this country. It  is time to understand clearly that some people would really like  Russia to cease being a world power with a unique science and a  mighty scientific and technical and defense potential and be  transformed into a raw-materials appendage of the West, the  East, and then Africa, too. There is evidence of this to date:  Last year the export of technical output fell to 5-6 percent.    [PRAVDA] The president has published an edict providing for  an increase in the level of pay to eight times the minimum wage  for fulfillment of the state defense order and 10 times that  figure in the nuclear industry.    [Shulunov] This is a two-edged sword. The first is in the  budget. After all, we do not have the financial results for  1992 yet. We got through 1993 entirely without a budget,  papering over the cracks one department at a time and even  taking each event as it came. It is hard to judge what is in  store for us now. But the budget is covering at most 65-70  percent of the planned items and areas of expenditure.    And here is the second edge of the financial sword. The  payment of defense orders is planned to be at last year's level.  But because prices are rising all the time and wages are trying  if not to get ahead then at least not to lag behind, the state's  military finance coffer is becoming a purse for small change.    Here is a surprising detail which shows that our present  authorities are truly in their infancy: No one yet really  understands what the state defense order is. There is not even  a single interpretation of the terminology itself. For example,  we in the defense industry take it to mean the Defense  Ministry's order paid for by funds issued to it by the state.  And the Defense Ministry shares our view. But the tax  inspectorate takes it to mean something completely different.  The Finance Ministry has its own interpretation and the Economy  Ministry understands it quite differently. Consequently, at the  very highest level it is not a financial struggle going on but a  war of words. But there is no time for that kind of thing. At  the moment the government is merely plugging the financial gaps:  First there was the cost of the referendum; then the struggle  against the Supreme Soviet and the possession of its territory;  finally there was the cost of the parliamentary elections, the  ratification of the Constitution, the overhaul of the White  House, and the move there. Of course, in view of these daily  costs, losses, and political concerns it has no time to worry  about providing hauberks, especially those which still jingle  rather than those which are completely rusted through.    [PRAVDA] But the hauberk is a museum piece. Whereas  conversion and the fulfillment of the defense orders are already  turning into disorderly partisan warfare.    [Shulunov] It may be said that there is financial and  economic robbery going on. Here is an example. A  characteristic feature of our defense industry was the  enterprise which was like a whole city. These enterprises'  assets included not just an impressive social base but also  enormous common boiler houses. In midwinter they have been left  without fuel because of the colossal rise in the cost of coal  and fuel oil. They have had to ask the banks for enormous  credits regardless of the interest rate. Meanwhile, they knew in  advance that these loans would virtually not be repaid. After  all, in the first three weeks of December alone insolvency debts  rose from R15 trillion to R19 trillion across the country. At  the same time we were owed R700 billion by the military who a  year ago were counting on the state budget when they concluded  with enterprises what seemed to be modest state defense order  contracts calculated down to the last cent. But they ceased to  be able to pay in April, when finance became more like a  political fiction.    Defense workers are now caught in a vicious circle from  which  there is no escape. I think that there will be an unprecedented  explosion in the second half of January, at the latest. After  all, we no longer have the means to pay for the fuel or  materials essential to production. And the banks will refuse to  grant new credits. A financial cataclysm is looming.    [PRAVDA] Aleksey Nikolayevich, but only a few months ago  there were ways for defense industry personnel to make an  organized withdrawal from the cycle of financial crises and  massacres, by exporting and selling arms on the world market.    [Shulunov] Yes, for two years Russia's most progressive  forces worked in harmony on the creation of a new and very  flexible structure to ensure the success of arms exports on the  market front. The Defense Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, the  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, and the State Committee  for the Defense Industry were among our active allies. We all  tried to at least restore what had been lost in the potholes of  perestroyka. Nor did we avoid mistakes either. The Commission  for Military-Technical Cooperation was set up to prevent them,  and it began working on a regular basis, virtually every week.    But then came a bolt from the blue. In line with the 18  November edict of the president we totally reorganized the  existing system without, however, creating a parallel structure,  hastily destroying everything that had been tried and tested.  De facto, without any analysis, without knowing what other  shortcomings were "looming" around the corner, without  formulating a new strategy, perestroyka was once again  undertaken, and in an utterly unqualified and incompetent  manner. It is hard even to calculate the tremendous damage. I  think 1994 will be a write-off for military-technical  cooperation, because we have been driven back to where we  started in late 1991 or early 1992. But it's a hopeless  lament....    [PRAVDA] Maybe those on high have become aware of the awful  experience of abortive conversion and military readaptations  [voyennyye perelitsovki] in the world's major powers? And the  solution?    [Shulunov] The solution is already known in all its detail.  The U.S. military industry conducted the first experiment in  conversion in the late seventies-early eighties. It was  extremely unsuccessful. But it is thanks to this experiment  that the most rational way has been found. When major  corporations own the number one or number two-ranked  manufacturers of recognized categories of arms, they buy out  their weaker competitors and carry out either horizontal or  vertical integration, keeping weapons production wholly to  themselves. Their former rivals, rid of the burden of competing  in military production, acquire civilian firms with the profits  they derive from this situation and continue to lead a peaceful,  tranquil life.    The result was that both the corporations and the state  benefit. The U.S. Defense Department's considerable reduction  in arms purchases has not meant a drop in the production of  military hardware. And last year 15 percent of the output  produced "captured" its own sectors of the world market. In  1995 it is planned to export around 30 percent of the arms  produced.    The competition, needless to say, is very tough. But the  Russian leadership is, regrettably, somehow too busy to  formulate a foreign economic strategy on military-technical  matters. We do not yet have the right to dream of an  expansionist policy. But it is high time we reconquered those  positions we hastily surrendered on our traditional markets.    A start has been made. The thing is that over the past two  decades we have exported arms worth $120 billion. The bulk of  them -- complex equipment -- with a long service life, around 30  years. What is more, there is more Russian military aviation  equipment in the world than anyone else's -- there are more than  5,000 of our combat aircraft in the arsenals of various  countries in the Near East, India, China, and Africa. But, in  accordance with past tradition, government licenses were needed  for annual repairs and deliveries of expendable material and  spare parts. And the government's distraction with domestic  affairs made it very hard to organize this. We finally  succeeded, quite recently, in winning round our leaders and  obtained permission to supply spare parts direct, earning around  $4-5 billion a year. Even at the present crazy ruble-dollar  exchange rates, manufacturers will make profits of 300 to 1,000  percent.    Profitable or what! But I don't know how this will develop.  We agreed with the former minister of foreign economic  relations to abolish altogether as of 1994 furtive taxes on  military exports. But it is hard to tell the future now  following the 18 November edict.    [PRAVDA] Yet we do also have experience of conversion.  After the Great Patriotic War conversion on a Soviet scale was  indeed a total affair. And urgent at that! Leningrad's Kirov  Plant switched in a matter of months from producing tanks to  producing the world's first skidding tractor. The same thing  happened at thousands of other enterprises.    [Shulunov] Yes. But, first, you had the powerful state  planning system of the time. Today, as well, conversion should  be unified and planned. Second, it rested on iron labor  discipline, which is now being eroded from above. Third, the  stable financial position of the state was strengthening.  Despite outside attempts at interference the state increased  production year after year and the budget grew steadily, rather  than waning as is happening now.    Well, we must go on fighting. This is not, regrettably, the  postwar period. The Battle of the Kursk Bulge lies ahead, not  just for defense personnel but for all industry. Enough of  partisan warfare.</p>

We have done so in this case. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 773(c)(4) of the Act requires the Department to value the NME producers' factors of production, to the extent possible, in one or more market economies that (1) are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the NME country, and (2) are significant producers of comparable merchandise. The Department has determined that Indonesia is the most suitable surrogate for purposes of this investigation. Based on available statistical information, Indonesia is at a level of economic development comparable to that of the PRC. Further, Indonesian government statistics and other data indicate that the country is a significant producer of the product under investigation. Based on available information, Indonesia is the only surrogate country, of those identified by our Office of Policy, that meets both of these criteria. For those factors that we have been unable to value using information from Indonesia, we have used India as the surrogate. India is economically comparable to the PRC and is a significant producer of furfuryl, which is comparable to furfuryl alcohol within the meaning of section 773(c)(1). Furfuryl is the feedstock, and the major input, in the production of furfuryl alcohol. When a furfuryl producer sees a demand for furfuryl alcohol, the facilities necessary to produce the furfuryl alcohol are usually added on site. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , memorandum to the file from Donna Lea Berg to John Brinkmann, Surrogate Producers of Furfuryl Alcohol, dated November 22, 1994, and memorandum from David Mueller, Director, Office of Policy to Gary Taverman, Director, Office of Antidumping Investigations, dated August 2, 1994, Furfuryl Alcohol from the People's Republic of China, Non-Market Economy Status and Surrogate Country Selection.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Fair Value Comparisons <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To determine whether sales of furfuryl alcohol from the PRC by Qingdao I&amp;E and Sinochem Shandong I&amp;E were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (USP) to FMV, as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of the notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> United States Price <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because the subject merchandise was sold directly by the Chinese exporters to unrelated parties in the United States prior to importation into the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the two responding exporters, we calculated purchase price based on packed, CIF U.S.-port or FOB Chinese-port prices to unrelated purchasers in the United States. As necessary, we made deductions for foreign inland freight, containerization, port storage, foreign brokerage and handling expenses, and marine insurance, valued in India. Where applicable, we made deductions for ocean freight based on rates of a market-economy shipper. (For a complete analysis of USP deductions, see the calculation memorandum for this proceeding on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the Main Commerce Department building.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Foreign Market Value <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, we calculated FMV based on factors of production reported by the factories in the PRC which produced the subject merchandise for the two responding exporters. To calculate FMV, the reported factor quantities were multiplied by the appropriate surrogate values from Indonesia for those inputs purchased domestically from PRC suppliers. Where inputs were imported from market economy countries and paid for in a market economy currency, we used the actual costs incurred by the producers to value those factors ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Oscillating Ceiling Fans From the People's Republic of China <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 56 FR 55271, October 25, 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The respondents have argued that the PRC prices for the major input in the production of furfuryl alcohol ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , furfuryl) are market determined. Thus, the respondents assert that the Department should rely on the domestic prices of furfuryl in the PRC. We disagree with this argument and have not used the prices for these inputs in calculating FMV. Our practice is to afford respondents the opportunity to show that the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> subject merchandise <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is produced within a market-oriented industry. Showing that a respondent purchases one input at a market-determined price is relevant to but, alone, not sufficient for granting market-oriented treatment ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sulfanilic Acid from the PRC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 57 FR 29705, July 6, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Peruvian police capture guerrilla leader MR Victor Polay Campos, leader of Peru's second-largest guerrilla group, has been captured in a Lima suburb. His arrest is a much-needed boost for the anti-terrorist police and a relief for the government, which this week introduced a night-time traffic curfew in the capital following stepped-up terrorist activity. Mr Polay is head of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA ), a pro-Cuban group which has operated in Peru since the mid-1980s. It has periodically vied with the hard-line Maoist Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) for domination of areas of Peru's coca-rich northern jungle. The group was particularly active in Lima during the Gulf war, attacking US-affiliated installations and businesses. MRTA activity has fallen in the past few years. This further blow to the organisation will please Peruvian businessmen; it financed its well-equipped forces through kidnap and extortion rackets in which thousands of legitimate businesses paid 'quotas' to support the revolution. Less ruthless than Sendero, the MRTA has nevertheless been responsible for hundreds of deaths and millions of dollars' worth of damage in bomb attacks. Mr Polay was first captured in 1989 but, in July 1990, he escaped from a high-security prison, with 47 other MRTA prisoners. He was formerly a friend and party colleague of ex-President Alan Garca.</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / As They Say in Europe: 'Football and television inebriate rapidly' AS WE ride the great Euro-Community not-very-merry-go-round, one passenger after another falls ill. Not as unwell as some of those on the outside, but worse than they have been for 40-odd years. Britain, Germany and Italy have all appeared sickly. Now eyes are turning to France. The French franc has been transformed in a matter of days from a potential currency anchor to speculators' favourite. That was linked, on the face of it, to some unsurprisingly gloomy forecasts about immediate prospects for the economy. However, the team of analysts employed by this column detected two entirely different factors undermining the republic. The first was the extraordinary wound inflicted by the great football scandal which has undermined the presidency, the system of justice and made everyone look unusually stupid. New readers begin here: the story opened with the allegation last month that the European champions, Olympique Marseille, had become champions of France by bribing members of the Valenciennes team to throw a crucial match. A common enough tale of footballing folk, you might think, but the boss of OM is the renowned socialist millionaire Bernard Tapie, while the procurator for Valenciennes, Eric de Montgolfier, turned out to be a man who relished the opportunities for cutting a dash hitherto denied him by run-of-the-mill villainy. He appeared frequently on TV to discuss the case and his role in it. As a result, he was called in by the minister of justice and told to shut up. Meanwhile, the same minister was suing Bernard Tapie, who had compared the state's investigative techniques unfavourably with those of the Gestapo. De Montgolfier promised to behave better and called a press conference to protest his innocence. And, in an exclusive interview with Liberation, he said he regretted only one remark: 'I am distracting the pack.' By this he had meant that he kept the media at bay while the investigation proceeded. The remark had been inspired, said de Montgolfier, by an event at an al fresco press conference. A municipal registrar standing on a roof had taken a photo of the procurator which showed his bald head surrounded by a hirsute press mob. Liberation wrote: 'Football and television inebriate rapidly. Mixed with a certain wilfulness in the administration of justice, we are in an infernal cocktail.' The presumption of innocence, said some, had been forgotten. President Mitterrand, on the other hand, while demanding prudence in the conduct of the case, had praised the 'energy' and 'intelligence' of his friend Tapie,' . . . as if these qualities in themselves were guarantees of honesty and moral rigour,' wrote Ouest-France. The second cause of the republic's present discontent is to be found in the crisis at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development which ended in Jacques Attali's departure a week ago. This event destroyed a substantial market for French suppliers who, under the benign rule of Attali, had had no need to worry about such details as competitive bidding. The affair added to the mood of self-doubt. France-Soir summarised it characteristically: 'Attali, Jacques. Graduate of the Polytechnique, the School of Mines, Sciences Po, National School of Administration (ENA), doctor in economic science. The finest collection of degrees in the republic. A head, a brain, a machine for thinking . . . Jacques Attali. Delirium. Megalomania.' French megalomania is beginning to upset the Germans - always an unwise move. Klaus Engelen of Handelsblatt was sufficiently upset to ask: 'Why can't the French let others run an international financial institution once in a while?' The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the International Monetary Fund are led by Frenchmen and Paris says that it has the right to appoint Attali's successor. Engelen's view, expressed with his customary tact, is that once the French control anything they exploit it ruthlessly. 'The IMF was turned into a self-service shop for French and US interests. The French get the top jobs, the Americans all the power and the Germans and Japanese provide the money.' But Engelen is mistaken. The French are not like that, at least not according to an opinion poll which led Ouest-France to comment: 'In today's France, which moans about its fate while reading its balance sheets, beliefs are not what they are said to be. Skilled, educated, cared for, the French today want only tranquility. Their happiness lies above all in good health, then work followed by love, justice and friendship. Money is their last but one concern.' Football, television and megalomania come nowhere, apparently. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

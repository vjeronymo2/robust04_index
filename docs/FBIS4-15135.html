			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>   [Text] Brussels, April 7 TASS--Visiting Estonian Foreign  Minister Juri Luik said at a press conference here on Wednesday  that negotiations on the withdrawal of Russian troops from  Estonia have reached a dead end "because of the Russian side's  excessive demands".    The minister is in Brussels for talks on strengthening ties  between Estonia and the European Union. He said the two sides  are going to sign an agreement on Estonia's associated  membership in the European Union in autumn of this year. An  agreement on free trade between them can come into force from  January 1, 1995. The minister said Estonia's ultimate aim was  full membership of the European Union.    "We are ready, everything now depends on Brussels'  decision,"  the minister said. ITAR-TASS learned from sources in the  European Commission that the question about the further  expansion of the European Union will be considered only in 1996.    While in Belgium, the Estonian minister held talks with  officials of the West European Union. According to Minister  Luik, he was assured that the Baltic countries would soon be  able to establish closer ties with the WEU policy.</p>

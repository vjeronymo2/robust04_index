			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Wage inflation shows sharpest fall for 10 years WAGE inflation as measured by changes in average earnings has fallen at the sharpest rate for 10 years, according to government figures published yesterday. The Department of Employment said that the index of average earnings across the economy had risen in the year to May by an underlying 6.5 per cent, after 7 per cent in April and 7.5 per cent in the previous month. This is the first time the year-on-year increase has fallen by a full percentage point in any two-month period since July 1982. The May figure is the smallest annual increase in average earnings for 25 years. The fall is largely the consequence of the downward pressure on wage settlements over the past year. It will be welcomed by the government, which sees lower wage inflation as helping industrial competitiveness and so paving the way for recovery. The year-on-year increase in average earnings would have been even lower but for buoyant overtime payments which in recent months have pushed up wages in some parts of manufacturing. In May, overtime working in the manufacturing sector totalled 11.26m hours a week, the highest figure since November 1990. Within manufacturing, the year-on-year increase in earnings was 6.5 per cent in May, down from a revised 7.5 per cent in April and 8 per cent in March. In services, the figure was 6.5 per cent, compared with 7 per cent and 7.25 per cent in the two previous months. The fall in wage inflation was reflected in figures for unit wage costs in manufacturing. In the three months to May, wages per unit of output were 2.8 per cent above the corresponding figure 12 months earlier, the lowest increase since 1989. In the three months to February, the equivalent year-on-year figure was 4.1 per cent. Manufacturing output per person between March and May was 4.5 per cent up on the same period a year earlier. In the three months to February, the corresponding figure was 3.2 per cent.</p>

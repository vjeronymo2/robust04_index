			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Survey of Tohoku Region of Japan (3): The young leave the land - Farm income has not kept up with the rest of the economy A SENIOR official at the Akita prefecture federation of agricultural co-operatives (JA) has no doubt about the greatest problem facing Akita farmers: 'Ageing farmers cannot find successors to take over the business. If they can't find successors agriculture will be destroyed,' he says. Mr Susumu Inaba's logic is flawless. Although it is unlikely that large stretches of Tohoku farmland will lie fallow for lack of farmers, the social and economic structure surrounding agriculture in the north of Japan is probably doomed. The unwillingness of the children of farmers to stay and work the land is, of course, merely a symptom of the deep economic difficulties facing Japanese agriculture. Farm income has failed to keep up with the rest of the economy, even though farm prices are often many times world levels. Mr Hajime Sasaki, an organic vegetable farmer near Omagari, in Akita, says: 'The way farming has been going, I don't want my children to take over the business.' This is a startling admission in a farm society where emotional ties to the land are sometimes nearly as deep as ties between family members. Mr Sasaki simply worries that his children would be unable to earn a reasonable income on the farm. The problems facing agriculture in Tohoku are similar in character to those found elsewhere in Japan, but Tohoku is also in some ways a special case, because of the larger share of agriculture in the regional economy. Agriculture, for example, accounts for about 16 per cent employment in Tohoku, compared with 8 per cent nationwide. Primary industries in Tohoku account for 5.5 per cent of the gross regional product, compared with 2.3 per cent for the nation. Tohoku farms are larger than average - 1.61 hectares, compared with 1.37ha. And farm families in Tohoku are more highly dependent on agricultural income than their compatriots. Average income from agriculture in Tohoku was Y1.4m (Pounds 5,864) per family in 1990, 23 per cent above the national average for a farm family; but total income, including non-farm sources, came to just Y6.08m, compared with a national average for farm families of Y6.6m. This greater dependence on agriculture can hurt, as it did last year when cold weather inflicted Y104bn of losses on the rice crop, and a severe typhoon in Aomori prefecture blew ripened apples off trees, causing losses of Y58.4bn. And these are not young, resilient families able easily to absorb blows. Tohoku's farmers are ageing rapidly, with 39 per cent of the workforce over 60, compared with 15 per cent over 60 in 1975. Tohoku farmers are also far less commercialised than farmers elsewhere. The dependence on rice for income declined from 55 per cent in 1975 to 45 per cent in 1990 - but nationwide the average is 27.4 per cent of the value of farm output. In some senses, Tohoku is simply behind the rest of the nation. Farmers in the west of Japan were quicker to reduce dependence on farm income, because factory work was available practically on their doorstep. Yet because of the slowness to change, Tohoku farmers are that much more vulnerable to the vagaries of not just the weather, but of government farm policy, particularly should the government give in to international pressure and open Japan to rice imports, which are currently banned. JA is waving the banner to keep trade barriers high, and the farmers strongly support this. Yet beneath an uncompromising exterior, many farmers have grown increasingly cynical about government policy, and are quietly resigned to seeing the market opened. Mr Takeshi Kuroda, a 46-year-old rice farmer in Akita, expects his business to decline sharply when the market is opened. Yet this, he believes, will eventually open opportunities for him to expand the size of his farmland from the current 6.5ha, to increase the efficiency of his operation and compete with imports on the basis of quality. 'I can lower my production costs, and Japanese people like Japanese rice best,' he reasons. Mr Koichi Yamazaki, director of the Tohoku Agriculture Bureau (the local branch of the agriculture ministry), doubts whether Tohoku farmers could every match US farmers in efficiency. But he does foresee a day eventually when farm holdings would be consolidated to 30ha, allowing Japanese farmers to match European efficiency. But, he warns: 'It will be 10 to 20 years before the age structure is stabilised.' The process of social change in the countryside in the meantime promises to be painful, as old people work the land long after they should retire, and resist to the bitter end selling their family heritage. Mr Yamazaki worries that liberalising the rice market prematurely would accelerate the process of change, and cause even greater pain. Mr Yamazaki is none the less optimistic that a younger generation of more commercially-minded farmers will eventually go into the business. The completion of the Tohoku Expressway in the last decade has cut by about two-thirds, to eight hours, the time needed to truck vegetables from Aomori to Tokyo. They can now be shipped overnight to Tokyo's wholesale markets, thus vastly broadening the market for perishable cash crops. Mr Yamazaki's office is helping about 300 young people a year to enter farming, by finding available land. Tohoku agriculture is facing a painful and unavoidable restructuring, but it also plainly has a future.</p>

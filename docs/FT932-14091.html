			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / UK conduct within ERM criticised BRITAIN must give independence to the Bank of England and agree to abide by ERM rules if it wants any future membership of the European exchange rate mechanism to succeed, the chairman of the committee of European Community central bank governors has warned. Mr Wim Duisenberg, in an interview with the Financial Times, said Britain, during its short-lived ERM tenure, had reduced interest rates on nine occasions, 'a couple of times too many'. Other EC nations complied with EC operating rules by increasing borrowing costs on occasion to keep their currencies in line with the D-Mark. While the pound was welcome to rejoin the ERM, Mr Duisenberg thought it would be in the UK's interest to make the Bank of England rather than the Treasury responsible for interest rate decisions so that these matters were taken out of the hands of politicians. He rejected claims made last year by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that Britain's ERM exit reflected 'fault lines' in the system. The EC governors had concluded that the ERM was technically sound and that it was in Europe's interests to stick with it despite the recent pressures, Mr Duisenberg said. 'We have looked at the system with a magnifying glass but we have not found any fault lines.' He was also critical of statements during the turbulence from various governments, including the UK, stating their firm opposition to realignments. 'If you make statements, you need to stick to them,' he said. Mr Duisenberg, governor of the Dutch central bank, was speaking in Basle as the governors' committee concluded in its annual report that EC states made mistakes in their efforts to calm financial markets during the exchange rate crises last autumn and early this year. During the unprecedented strains which forced Britain and Italy out of the ERM and led to the devaluation of the Irish, Spanish and Portuguese currencies, the report says governments gave the impression that 'policy measures to counter tensions were being taken on a piecemeal basis, with insufficient attention devoted to the credibility of the parity grid as a whole'. The document paints a bleak picture of economic activity across the EC this year. Economic verdict, Page 3 Observer, Page 25</p>

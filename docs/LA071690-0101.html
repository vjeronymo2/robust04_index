			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOY, 8, WAS STRANGLED, AUTOPSY FINDS; MOTHER'S BOYFRIEND HELD  </P> <P> An autopsy found that 8-year-old Carlos Alberto Pineda was strangled, the  coroner's office said Sunday.  </P> <P> The body of the boy, who had been missing for six days, was found Friday  afternoon at an apartment construction site at Muirfield Road and Edgewood  Place in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> His mother's boyfriend, Manuel Morales, 25, worked at the location and lived  nearby. He was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of child abduction after the boy  vanished, police said.  </P> <P> Morales has denied having anything to do with the boy's disappearance, telling  officers that he was taken from him by robbers, police said.  </P> <P> The boy was last seen on July 7 when he left his mother's house with Morales,  ostensibly to borrow $1,500 for a trip she wanted to take back to her native El  Salvador. Police said Morales and Adela Pineda had quarreled the day before  about the trip, and Morales had threatened "to do something she would remember  for the rest of her life," if she left.  </P> <P> The next day, however, he relented, and left with the boy to borrow money for  the trip, officers said.  </P></p>

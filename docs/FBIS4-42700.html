			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Michael Evans report: "British Firms Fight To Replace </F> Hercules With European Rival"]    [Text] A European aircraft that could replace the American  Hercules and carry more equipment and soldiers to a war zone is  at the centre of a dispute involving the Ministry of Defence and  the Treasury.    The MoD [Ministry of Defense] wants to replace the RAF's  [Royal Air Force] ageing fleet of C130 Hercules transport  aircraft and is looking favourably at an American option, an  updated version of the C130J plane developed by Lockheed.    However, the Ministry is under increasing pressure to  re-examine a European alternative, the Future Large Aircraft.  It is claimed that the plane, still on the drawingboard, will  be able to carry twice as much tonnage per day as the Hercules.    Yesterday the British firms involved in the seven-nation  European aircraft accused the Ministry of unfair conduct by  failing to subject the Hercules replacement programme to proper  competition.    The Government withdrew from the Future Large Aircraft  project in 1989 and is considering two options: refurbishing the  present Hercules fleet or replacing 30 of the RAF's C130  aircraft with the updated C130J model.    Yesterday the principal British companies involved in the  European project. The British Aerospace, Rolls-Royce and Short  Brothers, claimed that 7,500 jobs would be at stake if the  Defence Ministry went for the American option. British  Aerospace factories at Prestwick in Scotland and Filton in  Bristol could be threatened.    The Hercules replacement programme looks set to become the  latest project to run into arguments over jobs and the relative  merits of American and European aerospace technology.    In 1986 it was decided to abandon the British-designed  Nimrod  airborne early warning aircraft after more than 900 million  pounds had been spent, in favour of American AWACs.    Dick Evans, chief executive of British Aerospace, said it  was  time the MoD looked more closely at the strategic implications  of procurement policy. "This is too big a decision to be left  to RAF and the procurement executive," he said.    There was also concern that the Treasury would be against  developing a new transport aircraft when there was an updated  Hercules available to buy off the shelf.    Yesterday the British companies said it would be more  economic in the long term to give some of the present Hercules  planes "minimum refurbishment" and stat replacing the whole  fleet with the future Large Aircraft from 2002.    Mr Evans said that the Future Large Aircraft was being  designed as a tactical long-rang transport plane to meet the  requirement of the 21st century and Britain could not afford to  lose the opportunity of being involved in the programme.    He predicted that world-wide sales of about 700 of the  aircraft would earn Britain 12.8 billion pounds with a per cent  stake in the overall programme.    The countries currently committed to the Future Large  Aircraft Programme are France, German, Italy, Spain, Portugal  and Turkey. Although Britain withdrew, British Aerospace and  other companies are still involved.    British Aerospace said the Future Large Aircraft would be  able to carry 20 per cent more types of equipment than the  Hercules, including the Warrior armoured vehicle, the multiple  launch rocket system, the FG70 155 millimeter gun and Chinook  helicopter.</p>

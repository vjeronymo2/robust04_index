			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEAMMATE SAYS GRETZKY WAS FLU VICTIM, TOO;  </P> <P> KING STAR WAS SLOWED IN FIRST GAME OF NHL PLAYOFFS BUT IS ALL RIGHT NOW  </P> <P> The flu bug that took several King players out of the lineup last week seems to  be gone -- as might be the team's chances of advancing in the National Hockey  League playoffs.  </P> <P> In fact, even John Tonelli was back at practice Monday for the first time in  more than a week. But, Tonelli and goalie Kelly Hrudey were not the most  celebrated players to have influenza.  </P> <P> "Nobody knows it, but Wayne (Gretzky) had the flu in the first game," teammate  Marty McSorley said Monday afternoon on the eve of tonight's fifth game in the  Forum in the best-of-seven series against the Edmonton Oilers. "Did you notice  that he was the first one off the ice on every shift? He never does that."  </P> <P> Gretzky also chose not to go to the interview room that night and when he did  talk with reporters in the locker room, he was looking tired and was sweating  profusely. Reporters thought that the loss, the 100-degree weather and the  crowd in the locker room explained his condition.  </P> <P> Gretzky also played only six minutes in the third period. At the time, it  seemed to be just another reason for some to criticize the coaching of the  Kings' Robbie Ftorek.  </P> <P> "Robbie isn't going to use excuses," McSorley said without alibiing for the  Kings' 3-1 deficit in this series. "He isn't going to say that."  </P> <P> Also, Ftorek's policy is to say as little as he possibly can about injuries and  illnesses. Gretzky was playing so he had no obligation to release information  on Gretzky's health.  </P> <P> McSorley mentioned it Monday because he was asked directly and because, he  said: "That's all behind us now. Wayne played a hell of a game last (Sunday)  night."  </P> <P> Asked if he, himself, had had the flu, McSorley said: "The only thing wrong  with me is I haven't been scoring."  </P> <P> McSorley doesn't always show up at optional practices, but he was among several  who surprised Ftorek by being there. The only players who were required to be  on the ice today were the three who had not played the night before. And  Tonelli had told Ftorek that he wanted to be there.  </P> <P> Still, half the team showed up anyway. Gretzky rarely shows up at optional  workouts and didn't break form Monday.  </P> <P> McSorley uses the 1987 Stanley Cup final series as a case in point. McSorley  was playing for the Oilers when they went up, 3-1, on Philadelphia with two of  the remaining games scheduled for Edmonton. Philadelphia managed to take that  series to seven games before losing.  </P> <P> "All it takes is a bunch of determined hockey players. . . . I've seen it  slowly slip away from a team and I've seen teams come back," McSorley said.  "Ask Doug Crossman, he was on that Philadelphia team."  </P> <P> Crossman, another player who chose to skate Monday, agreed: "It can be done. .  . . We have enough experience and enough composure to do it. We're not going to  roll over."  </P> <P> The Kings need to play a little longer, at least, if they want to give Tonelli  a chance to at least compete for a fifth Stanley Cup.  </P> <P> "It's got to hurt him to be out now," McSorley said. "The guy is dying to play.  He lives to play. That's why guys feed off of him. When he was in the hospital  we sure missed him. You can almost feel his presence with this team."  </P> <P> The Kings will have Tonelli's presence back at the Forum tonight, but whether  he plays is another question that won't be answered until game time.  </P> <P> As Ftorek points out, at playoff time, with only 20 players dressing, everyone  has to be ready.  </P> <P> Tonelli developed complications with his flu and has been in much worse shape  than the others who have come back in a day or two. Tonelli doesn't want to  admit that he had pneumonia. Just as he doesn't want to say how much weight he  lost or how high his temperature got. But it is with a serious tone that he  says, "I was sick."  </P> <P> Kings Notes  </P> <P> The fifth game of the Kings' best-of-seven Smythe Division semifinal playoff  series against the Oilers will begin at 7:30 p.m. and will be televised by  Prime Ticket and broadcast by KLAC (570). . . . Asked if he was feeling any  pressure to win this series to save his job, King Coach Robbie Ftorek said:  "That's something I wouldn't waste time thinking about. The only thing I'm  concerned with is winning the next game. I care about the team. As for me  individually, I don't give a hoot."  </P> <P> Marty McSorley, pointing out that the Kings' 91 points for second place in the  Smythe Division and the Oilers' 84 points for third added up to (175) more than  the total for any other second-and-third place matchups, said: "It's unusual to  have a first round matching teams of this caliber."  </P> <P> In assessing the Oilers' position after taking the 3-1 lead with Sunday's  victory at Edmonton, former King Jimmy Carson said: "We held serve. But by no  means are we going to get cocky at match point." . . . Carson acknowledged that  there is a certain confidence that comes with being the defending champions.  It's a feeling that was not there in his time with the Kings. "There is a sort  of a wave of emotion that is starting to build," Carson said. "They've won four  Cups in five years. You just ride with it."  </P></p>

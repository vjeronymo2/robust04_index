			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Letter: Costly move over border Sir, There is a touch of Monty Python in the fact that in this day of instant electronic money transfer and an alleged 'common market' that Visa International can make your headlines with 'Visa plans small payments cross-border service' (July 12) for small companies and individuals. Is not the cheap, simple transfer of funds around Europe a pre-requisite of a Single European Market? Why have not our Brussels bureaucrats made this, rather than standards for false eyelashes, the priority? I have just tried to pay into Barclays a cheque for Pounds 13.33 drawn on a French bank. I was told there would be an initial handling charge of Pounds 4, then a Pounds 2 charge for the interest (usury?) while the cheque was being handled, and a further Pounds 6 for a 'correspondence' charge: a total of Pounds 12. Net receipts Pounds 1.33. The sooner we have a common currency the better for all of us, except the banks. Charles Harvey, 58 Keyford, Frome, Somerset BA11 1JT</p>

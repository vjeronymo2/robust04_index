			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: Second-quarter setback at Cigna CIGNA, one of the US's largest insurers, reported a sharp reduction in earnings in the second quarter, caused by losses in its general commercial insurance business and reduced investment gains. Post-tax profits were Dollars 88m or Dollars 1.22 a share, down from Dollars 130m or Dollars 1.81, a year ago. First-half net income fell to Dollars 134m, from Dollars 237m, before the effect of accounting changes. The general commercial business, which covers property/casualty risks for medium-sized US companies, suffered from poor underwriting and pressure on premium rates, the company said. It added that the senior management of this part of its business had been replaced earlier this year and that it had reduced its involvement in the area. As a result, Cigna's property/casualty division reported losses of Dollars 79m (before after-tax investment gains of Dollars 34m), compared with a loss of Dollars 55m (before gains of Dollars 41m) the year before. The escalating losses came in spite of a marked fall in catastrophe losses, which were Dollars 15m pre-tax, compared with Dollars 55m for the same period in 1992. Net income from the employee life and health benefits area on the other hand, climbed to Dollars 104m (before after-tax investment gains of Dollars 7m) from Dollars 67m (before gains of Dollars 30m). Net income from employee retirement and savings benefits fell by Dollars 2m to Dollars 36m, due to an Dollars 8m investment loss, compared with a Dollars 4m loss a year ago.</p>

Certain  business leaders who are concerned that the rapid appreciation  of the yen on foreign exchange markets on 14 and 15 February may  further harm corporate business results and economic conditions  are beginning to express the criticism that "it is wrong to just  say no to numerical targets and not come up with any measures to  reduce the surplus."    Other economic leaders, such as Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of  Keidanren [Federation of Economic Organizations], express  support, saying "The breakdown in the summit talks was  inevitable as a result of our opposition to managed trade  methods." The situation is such that future developments in the  yen exchange rate and U.S. retaliation against Japan may  adversely affect "support for Hosokawa."    Discussions at the meeting of Nikkeiren's [Japan Federation  of Employers Associations] policy committee on 15 February  concentrated on how to deal with the yen's appreciation. Some  members lamented, "We have to prepare for 85 yen to the dollar"  or "We cannot continue if the exchange rate goes beyond 110 yen  to a dollar."    Tadao Suzuki, president of the Mercian Corporation, who  attended the meeting, criticized the helpless government and  prime minister: "It is said that Japan and the United States  will have a `mature relationship.' Yet, to merely say no to  numerical targets is acting like a spoiled child. We need to  come up with certain concrete measures, such as accepting  numerical targets for government procurement, or we must work on  the various industrial sectors to indicate voluntary targets for  market liberalization."    Hiroshi Hamada, president of the Ricoh Company, Ltd., also  expressed his misgivings, saying: "It is easy for anybody to  say no and to make the relationship bad. But making the  relationship better is what diplomacy is all about, isn't it?"    Ryuzaburo Kaku, chairman of Canon Inc., pointed out that  "Japanese politicians for more than 10 years have paid too  little attention to the task of reducing the current accounts  surplus. An exchange rate level like this one will deal a fatal  blow to Japan's manufacturing industries."    On the other hand, many business leaders voice their support  for the prime minister. Tadahiro Sekimoto, chairman of the NEC  Corporation, said, "Rejecting the numerical targets, which were  plagued with contradictions, at the Japanese-U.S. meeting was  the right thing to do. The ongoing `unwarranted yen  appreciation' will not help reduce Japan's surplus."    Yotaro Iida, chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Inc.,  argued for the need for self-help efforts. He said: "It is  true that we are suffering from the yen's appreciation.  However, it is wrong for business operators to blame the prime  minister or the government without doing what they need to do."</p>

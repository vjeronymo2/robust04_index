			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Willis says he will retire early MR NORMAN Willis, TUC general secretary, yesterday denied reports that he was about to retire, but said for the first time that he would not remain in the job until he is 65. He is now 59. Mr Willis said he would make no further comment 'in the run up to congress', which starts in Blackpool on Monday. Clearly angered by newspaper speculation, he added that when he did make a decision about his future it would not be provoked by 'pressure from the press'. Mr Willis's comments will not dampen speculation, which was fuelled by private remarks by senior union leaders, that he is likely to go - voluntarily or otherwise - within a year. The annual New Statesman survey on what trade union leaders think of each other, published tomorrow, shows Mr Willis second from bottom of a list of 13 headed by Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union. The poll was compiled from replies by 36 out of a possible 100 union leaders. Only Mr Tony Dubbins of GPMU, the print union, fared worse than Mr Willis, who came second from bottom in a similar survey last year. Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, leader of the public service union Nupe, fell to second place. He was followed by Mr Bill Morris, leader of the TGWU general union, and Mr Jimmy Knapp, head of the rail union RMT. Meanwhile, the TUC is attempting to return full employment to the top of the political agenda. Yesterday it released results of an opinion poll by NOP which found that 96 per cent of respondents said the achievement of full employment was either very important (83 per cent) or fairly important (13 per cent). Fifty-five per cent believed full employment would never come about with the government's current policies. The TUC will unveil its programme to reduce unemployment next Wednesday.</p>

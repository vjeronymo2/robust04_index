			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEAVING A SAFE HARBOR FOR MOCA;  </P> <P> CHIEF CURATOR PAUL SCHIMMEL IS THE FIRST MEMBER OF THE LOCAL ART COMMUNITY TO  GET A TOP SOUTHLAND MUSEUM POSITION  </P> <P> "There's a lot at stake at MOCA," Paul Schimmel said the other day of the  Museum of Contemporary Art, where he assumes the post of chief curator Monday  morning. "We have a very high-visibility institution. As the identity of the  institution increases, so does the level of commitment that has to be made."  </P> <P> Last December, when news of Schimmel's appointment was announced, the question  of the museum's high-visibility status was on many minds. Mary Jane Jacob,  whose tenure in the post had ended the previous August after a scant 2 1/2  years, was already the third chief curator in MOCA's brief history. Having  completed five years of often energetic programming, some first-rate and some  rather less so, the museum had yet to establish a distinct profile. It was hard  to know whether its seemingly erratic direction arose from problems of staff or  from conflicted demands at the top, where the board of trustees had earned a  reputation for being willful and difficult.  </P> <P> Schimmel knows something about working with a board of trustees whose  reputation for difficulty precedes them. He also knows something about shaping  a tentative and ill-defined program into one that is weightier and more  substantive. During nine years at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, first as  curator and then as chief curator, he can be credited with having been  instrumental in transforming the institution from a perfectly respectable, if  decidedly regional, museum of contemporary art, headed by a notably contentious  board, to one of the finest and most adventuresome small museums in the  country.  </P> <P> On the heels of that success, Newport last year launched a $50-million capital  campaign to underwrite and endow a new building designed by the celebrated  Italian architect, Renzo Piano. The prospect of such a development was  certainly remote when Schimmel, then 26, arrived in Orange County in 1981 from  his native New York City, fresh from graduate studies at the Institute of Fine  Arts.  </P> <P> "My perception of Newport, when I first came," Schimmel explained, "was that it  was a difficult board, a conservative community, and a very specific, almost  exclusively regional program. Obviously it has evolved significantly since  then. The facility hasn't changed, but the recognition the institution has in  terms of balance of programs, the kinds of publications it does, the  willingness of the board to underwrite what are, at least in some cases,  difficult and controversial exhibitions, and the general cultural ambitiousness  of the Orange County community have made it a really different place than it  was."  </P> <P> Raised to a higher plane, that institutional profile wouldn't be a bad fit for  the Museum of Contemporary Art. And the successful transformation of the  Newport Harbor Art Museum likely figured prominently into MOCA's decision to  offer the senior curator's job to Schimmel.  </P> <P> Ironically, Schimmel had been among those discussed for the post in 1986,  following the departure of Julia Brown Turrell for the directorship of the Des  Moines Art Center, and prior to the hiring away of Mary Jane Jacob from  Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art. Certainly many factors played a part in  his having been passed over then, but it is reasonable to assume that the  Newport Harbor Art Museum's proximity to Los Angeles had worked against him.  </P> <P> In addition to the unspoken rule that says you have to move away before the  folks back home will recognize your worth, the longstanding insecurity of the  Los Angeles art world had to be overcome. Typically, influential museum  curators and directors have been imported. In fact, with the exception of those  who have climbed an institution's curatorial ladder, Schimmel's appointment at  MOCA is noteworthy as the first major museum position locally to have been  filled from within the ranks of the Southern California art community. If the  appointment therefore reflects a newly significant degree of cultural density  and confidence, Schimmel himself has been among those responsible for the  change in climate. During the last four years, for example, two of the most  important exhibitions of postwar American art mounted anywhere in the country  were organized under his direction at Newport: "The Interpretive Link: Abstract  Surrealism into Abstract Expressionism, Works on Paper 1938-1948," which  skillfully traced an epochal shift in art through the early drawings and  watercolors of the New York School, and "Chris Burden: A 20-Year Survey," which  examined the controversial work of a distinctly under-recognized, Los  Angeles-based artist and deftly inserted it into the forefront of contemporary  discussion.  </P> <P> While quick to acknowledge the unarguable high points of MOCA's programming in  the past, neither does the curator hesitate to pinpoint its chief failing. The  institution has zigzagged from one approach to the next, as various  constituencies have been identified or have pressed their claims. Pulled in a  variety of directions, the young museum's mandate can seem arbitrary and  shapeless.  </P> <P> "I plan to make a very conscious effort not to just think about the individual  merits of a single exhibition," Schimmel said of his strategy for MOCA, "but  about how it fits within a larger program -- one that can be described with  boring words like balance, breadth, reach. A program where there's a different  character to each show, where they don't feel the same all the time."  </P> <P> How would he characterize the overall program since its 1984 debut?  </P> <P> "Three phases," Schimmel replied, without skipping a beat. "Julia (Brown  Turrell) did a very strong program of California art. Concurrently, (MOCA  director) Richard Koshalek's interest in significant New York artists from the  1960s came through. Then, in reaction to this orientation, there was a feeling  that the museum needed to deal more with what was happening nationally, with  the up-and-coming stars of the art world. So there was a series of shows of  very hot, very topical artists. And then, the third phase, led by Mary Jane  (Jacob), was a real strong emphasis on European art, on an international  approach.  </P> <P> "If you think about it, it was first a California program, then a national  program and recently an international program. If you mixed it all together and  added just one more ingredient -- more historically and thematically oriented  exhibitions, of which there have been a few -- it would be a balanced, much  more interesting program. I'd like to think that I was hired because what I've  tried to do (at Newport) is address all those same issues, and in such a way  that they happen simultaneously rather than sequentially."  </P> <P> Schimmel's concise analysis could be said to reveal an underlying, subtly  provincial bent to MOCA's program history. Only secondarily has the museum  pressed its judgment of what constitutes the important currents of recent art,  of postwar history and of cultural debate today. Instead, the museum has been  responding first to a perception of the local community and what it lacks:  recognition for its artists, firsthand knowledge of significant new art as  identified in New York, and regular contact with aspects of the vigorous  international art scene that has been the hallmark of the past decade.  </P> <P> Regardless of whether the art MOCA has shown comes from the West Coast, West  Broadway or West Germany, these "three phases" have not arisen from convictions  about which postwar art the museum believes is decisive, as seen by looking  outward from an inherently distinctive vantage point in Los Angeles. Generally,  the program has emerged from inward-looking presumptions about what Los Angeles  supposedly needs.  </P> <P> "You really can't play to a regional art world anymore," Schimmel asserted, "or  you're just talking to yourself."  </P> <P> The surest way to turn this discontent around, he believes, is to establish a  strong profile by identifying and drawing upon the committed artistic passions  of the museum's professional staff. In that endeavor, he will likely benefit  from something his predecessors couldn't: a heightened degree of curatorial  experience.  </P> <P> To date, the greatest strength in MOCA's staff has been bound to its greatest  weakness. In hiring, the director has seemed less interested in traditional  academic credentials than in creative intelligence and enthusiasm. The result  has been a relatively young staff blessedly light on the narrow bonds of  conventional training in art, yet decidedly green in dealing with sophisticated  museum issues. Now, after several years of intensive, on-the-job training,  aspects of MOCA's staff are beginning to be seasoned.  </P> <P> Schimmel intends to develop a symbiotic relationship with the diverse interests  of both the staff and trustees, but not to act as a rubber stamp for either. "I  prefer to embrace the most substantive of their goals for the institution as my  own," he explained. "Certain of their desires are significant and well-founded.  If I can make them as if they are my own, then the chance to succeed will be  greatly increased."  </P> <P> By way of example, Schimmel pointed to the number of exhibitions on issues  surrounding the dominant New York School painters of the 1950s that he  organized at, or brought to, the Newport Harbor Art Museum. "The Interpretive  Link" surprisingly turned to works on paper as the undeclared source of many  Abstract Expressionist ideas later expressed in paintings. "Action/Precision"  took a long-overdue look at the second generation of New York School artists,  while "Bay Area Figurative Painting" and "The Figurative Fifties" examined the  response, in terms of imagery, to Abstract Expressionism by artists in San  Francisco and New York.  </P> <P> "You could make the case that I did (these shows) because (Newport trustee)  Donald Bren, of the Irvine Company, gave us a lot of money to do them and is  personally very interested in Abstract Expressionism. But the truth of the  matter is that I was very interested in working on this material as well. And  when you think about it, these shows are absolutely the antithesis of the way  Bren collects. He goes after the most significant works by the most significant  artists, and here I was biting off at the fringes. But it did mean something to  him and to others on the board that we were delving into related art historical  issues."  </P> <P> In addition to program considerations, Schimmel is concerned that the museum  has not yet committed space for regular display of its permanent collection in  either of its two expansive buildings.  </P> <P> "The unsung hero of MOCA is its collection," he said, "or should I say, its  collection of collections. You have the Panza, the Schreiber, the Gersh and the  Lowen collections. What you don't have is a lot of the stuff that fits in (the  gaps in these holdings). But MOCA has done an exceptional job in building a  collection at a time when that's almost unheard of. We need a concerted,  programmatic effort at having a major segment of the permanent collection on  view all the time."  </P> <P> While the curator's estimable tenure in Orange County does offer a sturdy  platform on which to build, there are considerable differences between the  Museum of Contemporary Art and the Newport Harbor Art Museum. MOCA claims  roughly six times as much exhibition space as Newport. Its program budget alone  is about the same as Newport's entire operating budget ($1.8 million). The  staff sizes are hardly comparable.  </P> <P> More important, MOCA is squarely in the public eye in ways that Newport isn't.  The Newport Harbor Art Museum, like the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, is  an isolated artistic outpost in its community, and as such has benefitted from  its convenient proximity to the major cultural center that is Los Angeles.  Outsiders can zip into Newport Beach with relative ease to see a special  exhibition; yet, the museum is just far enough away to remain beyond the  mundane scrutiny that would attend operation within the day-to-day art life of  Los Angeles. When sizing up a neighboring museum's performance, it's best to  keep in mind the Victorian sightseer's favorite admonition: Distance lends  enchantment to the view.  </P> <P> The other thing Los Angeles has that Newport Beach doesn't is a rapidly  growing, increasingly prominent cadre of artists. As Schimmel arrives at MOCA,  that single fact could be the clincher.  </P> <P> "The Metropolitan, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney all existed in New  York (before 1945)," he said, "but they were provincial institutions until the  art world essentially reinvented itself in the context of America. Until  everyone in the Los Angeles art community realizes that their greatest asset is  the artists -- before the institutions, before the collectors, before the  foundations, before the curators, before the critics -- this really will not be  among the preeminent art capitals of the world."  </P></p>

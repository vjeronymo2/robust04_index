			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Bank of Italy chief anxious to step down AFTER nearly 14 years as governor of the the Bank of Italy, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi has reminded the government of Mr Giuliano Amato he is anxious to step down. Mr Ciampi, who will be 73 this year, yesterday confirmed weekend reports he had offered his resignation but had been persuaded to stay on. It remains unclear how long he is prepared to remain in office. Rumours of his desire to retire shortly were fuelled by an apparently unsolicited statement from the prime minister's office thanking him for his role in defending the lira and giving him Mr Amato's full backing. When asked yesterday about his offer to resign, Mr Ciampi said: 'If a person is asked to stay on, it means that the same person has requested to go.' Last week he was attacked by Mr Umberto Bossi, the leader of the populist Lombard League, for being out of touch with events. This attack immediately provoked expressions of support from all the other political parties. Yesterday, Mr Ciampi said he had no desire for the succession to the governorship to become an issue. Yet with the lira floating, the heavily indebted economy in recession and the political parties in disarray as a result of corruption scandals, the governor of the Bank of Italy has become a figure of stability. The bank itself is the sole institution, along with the state presidency, not to have been tainted by the corruption scandals. With the bank due to celebrate its 100th anniversary in August, a number of bankers have seen this as a natural occasion for Mr Ciampi to leave.</p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLD COMFORT;  </P> <P> FOREIGN FLAVOR;  </P> <P> TREATS: FOR A TASTY WAY TO COOL DOWN, TRY A TAIWANESE SLUSH. THE PYRAMIDS OF  SHAVED ICE ARE EXOTICALLY FLAVORED.  </P> <P> The iciest treat in town may be Shau May's Taiwanese slush. This small Chinese  restaurant in Alhambra is named for a leading ice cream company in Taipei. The  slush is a sort of Chinese sundae, except that a pyramid of finely shaved ice  replaces the ice cream, and the "toppings" go on the bottom.  </P> <P> These goodies are far removed from the nuts, cherries and whipped cream of the  usual American sundae. Take your choice of sweet red or green beans, cooked  oats, taro, boiled peanuts and tapioca pearls. Then move on to exotic jellies  such as pale almond curd, dark grass jelly and shimmery, pale-yellow ai yu  jelly, which Shau May has retitled "love jade." Fruits include longans and  lychees along with peaches, pineapple and fruit cocktail.  </P> <P> The woman behind the counter spoons your choices into a shallow dish, showers  them with ice from a tall grinder and sweetens them with a ladle of syrup. For  an extra 25 cents, she'll swirl condensed milk over the top.  </P> <P> Shau May offers about 16 toppings, but owner-manager Charles Hu says you can  find as many as 100 in Taiwan -- although not usually all in the same place.  </P> <P> In Taiwan, this cool sweet is available all year, although its popularity  increases in the summer. Its Chinese name, pao bin, means shaved ice. There is  also a variation called honey bean ice, which consists of yellow beans cooked  in honey or syrup and combined with fruits and ice.  </P> <P> How would a Taiwanese compose a slush? Customer Carol Cho, a Taipei native  working in Los Angeles, was spooning up a combination of red beans, oats, taro  and rice balls. Another of her favorites is green beans, peanuts and rice balls  or tapioca. The novice could ease into these exotic substances by combining red  beans and almond curd with peaches and fruit cocktail. Pineapple, lychees and  grass jelly is another possibility. And Asians sometimes opt for a simple dish  of red beans, condensed milk and ice.  </P> <P> Shau May gives customers a choice of any three "toppings" for $1.50 or four for  $1.75. Open daily from 11 a.m. to midnight, the restaurant is located at 15 E.  Valley Blvd., next to the Garfield Theater.  </P> <P> If you can't get there, it's easy to make a Taiwanese slush at home. Pick up  the common canned fruits in a supermarket, then go to a Chinese market for cans  of longans, lychees, ai yu and grass jellies. Some markets even carry dry mixes  for almond curd. The crucial equipment is an ice shaver that will produce fine,  snow-like ice rather than granules. These are available in some Asian markets.  </P> <P> The following recipe suggests suitable canned toppings and provides  instructions for cooking the beans, making almond curd and sugar syrup. Place  the ingredients in separate bowls, let guests make a choice, then pile on  plenty of ice, add the syrup and milk. It's a formula guaranteed to send  shivers up your spine.  </P> <P> TAIWANESE SLUSH  </P> <P> (Pao Bin)  </P> <P> 1 (1-pound 4-ounce) can fruit cocktail  </P> <P> 1 (1-pound) can sliced peaches  </P> <P> 1 (1-pound 4-ounce) can pineapple chunks  </P> <P> 1 (1-pound 4-ounce) can lychees  </P> <P> 1 (1-pound 4-ounce) can longans  </P> <P> Sweet Red Beans  </P> <P> Sweet Green Beans  </P> <P> Cooked pearl tapioca  </P> <P> 1 (1-pound 3-ounce) can grass jelly, drained and cut into cubes  </P> <P> 1 (1-pound 3-ounce) can ai yu jelly (Chinese lemon jelly), drained and cut into  cubes  </P> <P> Almond Curd  </P> <P> Finely shaved ice  </P> <P> Sugar Syrup  </P> <P> 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk  </P> <P> Drain fruit cocktail, peaches, pineapple chunks, lychees and longans and place  in separate containers.

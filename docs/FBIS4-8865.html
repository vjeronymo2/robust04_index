			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Gojko Beric: "Has-Been General"] </F>   [Text] Where is General Ratko Mladic, the greatest murderer  in the history of Bosnia? It is common knowledge that he is  always at the scene of the most fierce shelling of Bosnian  besieged towns. Consequently, he could now be somewhere near  Gorazde. However, General Mladic no longer takes part in any  negotiations. He cannot be seen on SRNA either, where he used  to appear every couple of days playing the role of the main  military strategist -- the one to approve every move. He was  the crucial man when the self-styled Serbian assembly decided to  reject the Geneva peace accord, when Milosevic, Cosic, and  Mitsotakis returned from Pale and suffered a severe loss of face.    The last media promotion of the Chetnik general in Belgrade  was more than a month ago in NIN. In a long interview for this  weekly magazine, he presented his vision of the war in Bosnia  and said General Kukanjac was to blame for the failure in the  operation of seizing Sarajevo. Mladic has not appeared in  public since then. Several days ago, a Belgrade RFI  correspondent reported that there were rumors about Mladic's  dismissal, but that Karadzic still did not dare do it, for his  most famous general "still has a good reputation on the front  lines."    A certain mysteriousness regarding the position of Mladic on  Karadzic's hierarchical ranking is a choice bit of dirt for  masters of speculative journalism. However, all things  considered, this could be a matter for serious analysts as well.  General Ratko Mladic is a war criminal -- that is a fact. The  Helsinki Watch, leading international organization for  monitoring the state of human rights, also holds that view. But  that is not the reason behind Mladic's possible sinking, for  Radovan Karadzic is also on the list of war criminals of the  Helsinki Watch. The underlying cause of his conflict with  Mladic is something completely different.    Last summer, after the Igman operation, Mladic was at his  peak. He intended to conquer Sarajevo and wanted to become a  Serb Napoleon, so Milosevic's generals feared him. Even  Karadzic feared him, but could not even dream of depriving  himself of his services. After the battle for Teocak, where he  was heavily defeated, Mladic's military glory started to fade.  He did not do too well in the offensive against Olovo either,  and was forced to withdraw from almost 20 km long front line  near Maglaj. Mladic then set out to conquer Bihac, but did not  manage to improve his rating there. Karadzic used the series of  Mladic's failures -- surely not without Milosevic's blessing --  to move the pugnacious general as far away from himself as  possible.    Their final act of revenge is yet to come. For the time  being, the conflict is just one of the signals that the Pale  brethren are not even remotely as unanimous as they used to be.  They ran out of cheap human material for continuing the war.  True to its fascization of Serb patriotism, SRNA has recently  broadcast a scene of recruitment of 18-year-olds. We saw  confused and nervous young men whom Karadzic intended to send to  war. And 13- or 14-year-olds will go next. Watching the program  on SRNA, we were reminded of the famous picture of Hitler  pinching the cheeks of German boys sending them to their deaths  in the suburbs of Berlin, just a few days before he committed  suicide in his bunker.</p>

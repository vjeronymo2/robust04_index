			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Salmon dumping row goes to EU Scottish salmon producers have stepped up their action against Norway. They have made a formal complaint to the European Commission alleging that the Norwegian salmon industry has been dumping its fish on the European Union market. The complaint comes five months after European salmon prices collapsed after an unexpected surge in output by Norway, the dominant European producer. Scottish salmon farmers say Norway's higher production is made possible only by heavy government subsidies and financial support for the banking system which lends to the farmers. It wants the European Commission to investigate whether Norwegian farmers are selling fish below the cost of production and, if this dumping claim is sustained, take action against Norway. That could entail countervailing import duties, or asking Norway to bring supply and demand into balance by taking fish off the EU market. The complaint by the Scottish Salmon Growers Association comes at a delicate moment, just as the EU is supposed to conclude negotiations with Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria on their terms of entry to the EU. The UK government has irritated salmon farmers by showing itself keener to secure Norwegian membership of the EU than to take action on the farmers' behalf. To support its dumping claim the association commissioned a report from accountants Ernst &amp; Young which showed that Norway's high level of salmon production at low prices could not have been achieved without direct grants and subsidies to producers amounting to 20 per cent of the cost of production over the past five years. It said losses by the Norwegian industry in these years had mostly been absorbed by the four leading banks, which have been in government control since 1991. Mainly because of a surge in Norway's production, helped by breakthroughs in treatment of disease, salmon prices in the EU collapsed last October.</p>

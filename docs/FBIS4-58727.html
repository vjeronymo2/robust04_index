			<p>BFN     [Text] Algeria expresses satisfaction at the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement that was signed in Cairo yesterday  on the implementation of Palestinian self-rule in the occupied  territories.    A Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman considers this  agreement  to be important and a new qualitative phase on the road to a  just and comprehensive settlement of the Middle East issue,  which takes into account the legitimate rights of the  Palestinian people and their sovereignty, and their right to  establish an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.    The Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman adds that Algeria,  which renews its complete solidarity with Syria, Jordan and  Lebanon, is of the view that the peace process in the region  necessarily requires the unconditional Israeli withdrawal from  all occupied Arab territories.</p>

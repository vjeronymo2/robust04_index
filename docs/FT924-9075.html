			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Letter: Sponsorship succeeds with shared vision Sir, I refer to your article on sponsorship 'How to get the best from your patron' (October 24). A key point missing from your list of dos and don'ts is that sponsors and beneficiaries should share business goals and objectives. Successful sponsorship emerges from the satisfaction of both (or all) parties knowing that objectives have been fulfilled. A frank exchange of business goals at an early stage can help identify mutual and individual objectives and the allocation and agreement of relevant responsibility. An informal partnership then arises which can only grow in strength, awareness, image and return if regularly reviewed. The potential for sponsorship of the arts is enormous if only all parties involved share their visions and views, and combine their skills and experience accordingly.

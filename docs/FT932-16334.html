			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Clydesdale Group set for market flotation CLYDESDALE GROUP, the electrical goods retail chain, plans a Stock Exchange flotation in late June which is expected to raise Pounds 30m in new money and capitalise the company at about Pounds 80m. The flotation is aimed at largely wiping out borrowings, currently standing at about Pounds 32m, and at financing an expansion programme in England which is already under way. Clydesdale's merchant bank is Rothschilds and its broker is NatWest Securities. Clydesdale has been expanding rapidly since 1990 and has added 23 out-of-town stores in England to its 86 high street and 11 out-of-town stores in Scotland. In the next 12 months it plans to open a further 20 out-of-town stores in England as far south as Birmingham and Peterborough It claims to have 2.7 per cent of the highly fragmented UK electrical goods retail market. But though this sounds small, Clydesdale believes it is the third largest company in the sector which is worth some Pounds 10bn. The leader is Dixons, which includes Currys, with 12.7 per cent, followed by Comet with 5.5 per cent. Clydesdale is setting itself what it calls 'a loose target' over an unstated timescale of raising its market share to 10 per cent. The key man is Mr Henk van Eck, a Dutchman who came in as chief executive in 1985 at the behest of institutional investors led by Ivory &amp; Sime, the Edinburgh fund managers, after the company ran into serious problems two years after a management buy-out. He was able to insist on getting 51 per cent of the company. Mr van Eck sacked the entire management and 27 per cent of the staff, shed non-core businesses and closed nine stores in England. 'When business began to turn down with recession in the third quarter of 1988 we'd already pared the business right down. That is why we were virtually the only regional retailer in our sector to survive the recession, if you exclude the regional electricity companies,' he said. In 1990 Clydesdale secured the funds it needed to expand and reduce its debt  -gearing had reached 400 per cent. It placed Pounds 11.5m of new equity and arranged Pounds 26m of bank facilities. Mr van Eck's stake was diluted to 29 per cent and the other big shareholders are now Scottish Amicable and Standard Life, each with 20 per cent. As well as adding out-of-town superstores to its high street base, Clydesdale has differentiated its marketing strategy to appeal simultaneously to the ABC1 market segment and the C2 and DE segments. It has cut its inventory from 15 weeks to 10 weeks by delivering and installing most large items from two central warehouses, one in Glasgow and a new one near Wakefield, South Yorkshire. 'Our efficiency and our low cost base enable us to offset the much bigger bulk purchasing discounts which the bigger groups get,' said Mr van Eck. Turnover in the year to March 31 1993 is estimated at Pounds 140m, against Pounds 71.2m in 1991. Operating profit is likely to be Pounds 7m, against Pounds 4.4m in the 14 months to March 1992, and pre-tax profit is likely to be Pounds 4m. 'Unlike some of our rivals which are expanding northwards from a high cost base in the south of England, we are heading south from a cheap Scottish base,' Mr van Eck said.</p>

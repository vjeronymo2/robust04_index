			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Sergey Babkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 13 TASS -- "Russia is destined to play  an important role in the promotion of the Middle East  settlement," ITAR-TASS was told today by Amin Barakat,  ambassador of the Palestinian state to Russia, in connection  with Yasir 'Arafat's visit to the Russian Federation, expected  to begin on April 19.    Speaking about the goals of Palestinian President 'Arafat's  trip to the Russian capital, the ambassador said that this would  be his first visit to the Russian Federation. In the course of  talks with Russian officials, 'Arafat will discuss the deadlines  for the establishment of Palestinian autonomy and for the  withdrawal of Israeli troops from territories where Palestinian  self-government is to be proclaimed. He also said that 'Arafat  had addressed a message to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The  document calls on Russia to exert influence on Israel in order  to make it fulfil the terms of the "Gaza-Jericho-First"  agreement, in accordance with which Palestinian self-government  is to be established in the Gaza Strip and in the area around  Jericho (the Western Bank). The second purpose of the visit is  to discuss bilateral relations in the political and economic  spheres. A Russo-Palestinian agreement on cooperation in these  spheres is expected to be concluded.    Asked what the Palestinian leadership expected from Russia  in  the process of the Mideast settlement, Barakat said: Russia's  role is clear. It is a member of the U.N. Security Council and  co-chairman of the Madrid peace conference, and one of the  initiators of the "Gaza-Jericho-First" agreement, signed in  Washington last year. In my opinion, Russia will play an  important role in the further promotion of the settlement  process at the stage when it helped, together with the Palestine  side, to break the deadlock in this process.    The ambassador expressed the hope that Russia, which is a  great country with a huge potential, would help Palestine to  estabish its national statehood.    Touching on problems, interfering with the early fulfilment  of the Palestine-Israeli "Gaza-Jericho-First" agreement, the  ambassador said that representatives of the two sides were now  discussing in Cairo the details of its implementation, linked  with the Israeli withdrawal from the territories that are to be  transferred to Palestinian self-government, with the security  measures that are to be taken there, and also with the transfer  of powers to the Palestinian national authorities after the  withdrawal of the Israeli Army. He noted that Israel was trying  to misinterpret the formulations of the agreement at the Cairo  talks. "Instead of deciding how Israel is to withdraw from those  territories, the talks are again being focused on individual  provisions of the agreement," the Palestinian ambassador noted.  "We shall continue the negotiations without renouncing our  vision of autonomy, which will eventually develop into a  Palestinian state," he added.</p>

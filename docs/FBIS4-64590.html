			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arturo Zampaglione: "Clinton Illustrates His </F> Foreign Policy: `We Are Not the World's Policemen'"]    [Text] New York -- Last Tuesday evening [3 May] Bill  Clinton entered CNN's "global village" to defend his foreign  policy, following the humiliations suffered in Somalia and  Bosnia, as well as numerous criticisms from abroad, and his  recent flunking in opinion polls. "The United States cannot  solve the whole world's problems, and must not become the  world's policemen," the President said defensively in response  to questions from almost 100 journalists. "But we have the  obligation to join other countries to alleviate suffering and  restore peace."    Clinton went on to illustrate American strategy in the  various hot spots, acknowledging that he had made some mistakes  and underestimated some problems, but highlighting the  consistency of his foreign policy doctrine. However, he did not  manage to free himself from the memory of his two predecessors,  Richard Nixon and George Bush, who seemed to be haunting the  platform at the Jimmy Carter Library, where the interview took  place.    Until the very end, Nixon severely criticized the  international choices made by the White House under the  Democrats. Shortly before his death, he sent Random House  Publishers the manuscript of Beyond Peace, in which  -- referring to 15 months of Clinton Administration -- he wrote  that "if the United States wants to continue to lead the world,  it must first decide it wants to do so, and then take the  necessary measures to move from words to deeds."    Bush, who achieved victory in the Gulf war, is the living  proof that the United States still has the strength to impose  peace and defeat aggression within the new international order.  Therefore, he is a nagging figure for Clinton, because he  reminds him of the fact that a drastic, energetic solution is  theoretically possible also in Bosnia, as suggested yesterday by  Margaret Thatcher in an article published in the NEW YORK TIMES  under the title "Stop The Serbs. Now. For Good."    Haunted by Nixon and Bush's specters, but unable to express  a  full-fledged international leadership doctrine of his own --  which, anyway, at least so far, has not been among his  priorities -- Clinton tried to highlight, on the one hand, some  of the White House's successes (such as the Middle East  agreement, the ratification of NAFTA, the dismantling of the  former Soviet nuclear arsenal) and, on the other hand, the  limits of American action in the critical areas. In such areas  -- he said somewhat hesitatingly -- the United States cannot act  as a "police force," but rather, must build consensus, and act  jointly with the international community.    Bosnia is a case in point: Clinton admitted that the  situation in the former Yugoslavia was much more complicated  than he had thought during the electoral campaign. He blamed to  a large extent Bush's procrastination, and said that he had done  "his best." He then summarized the American position: "yes" to  the possible use of NATO aircraft to defend the six safe areas,  and extending this to Brcko, the Serbian town at the center of a  strategic corridor which may become the scene for the next  battle between the three armies; "no" to direct American  intervention "which would run the risk of prolonging the war";  "yes" to lifting the arms embargo for Muslims and Croats,  although Europeans are opposed to this.    It was precisely over the Bosnia issue that the debate in  Atlanta went through its tensest moment. CNN Sarajevo  correspondent Christiane Amapour tauntingly requested an  explanation for American hesitations. Clinton lost his temper:  "Come off it, madam! What hesitations?" "Undoubtedly," he  then explained, "I underestimated the difficulties involved in  building a coalition and reaching an agreement within NATO. Of  course, I would have preferred Europeans to align themselves  with my positions. But I must also respect their opinions and  their experience in that area."    This latest remark seemed to be reserved for home  consumption. In fact, requests for unilateral American action --  aimed, in particular, at rearming the Muslims -- are snowballing  in Congress. Clinton wished to warn of the dangers involved in  such a move, which could turn against the United States in the  future. He tried to draw a distinction between situations where  U.S. vital interests are at stake -- and where, therefore,  acting alone is justifiable -- and situations where it is only a  question of upholding the general principle of peace.    Speaking of China, Clinton seemed to favor a compromise on  the civil rights' issue, which he had previously linked to the  extension of the preferential nation clause. Furthermore, he  promised South Africa financial aid to the tune of $600 million.  As regards Haiti, he did not rule out American military  intervention. However, it is unlikely that these summary  expressions of decisiveness on international matters, as  broadcast by Ted Turner's CNN, will succeed -- within the next  few days -- in changing the opinion of Americans: 41 percent of  them, compared to 40 percent, say that they disapprove of  Clinton's foreign policy.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / MPs criticise Revenue over 'adjudicator' MPs yesterday launched a strong attack on the Inland Revenue over its appointment of an 'independent adjudicator' to deal with complaints from taxpayers. Members of the Commons committee on the parliamentary commissioner - or ombudsman - accused the Revenue at a committee hearing of creating a function which was duplicative, confusing and had the potential to deceive the public. Mr William Reid, the parliamentary commissioner, said using the word 'independent' seemed to him 'like a slightly faulty description of goods'. He added: 'The only truly independent individual is myself. The Revenue's adjudicator is not as independent as I am.' Mr James Pawsey, Conservative chairman of the committee, said: 'This position is set up by the board (of the Inland Revenue), reports to the board and is staffed by the board.' He asked: 'Is it not truly misleading to call it independent?' Sir Anthony Battishill, chairman of the board of the Revenue, said there was no intention to mislead the public. 'I think you are being prematurely unkind to the adjudicator.' But, under pressure from committee members, Sir Anthony started to use the word 'dispassionate' during the hearing in place of 'independent'. He agreed to review literature produced by the board which used the phrase 'independent adjudicator', and to examine criticisms from MPs that the documents did not make sufficiently clear that the public could ultimately turn to the ombudsman for redress. He said he would encourage the adjudicator to hire his own staff in place of Revenue officers once the post was operating. But he stressed that the Revenue's internal complaints procedures were fair and 'terribly fierce' against staff. He said the Revenue received about 15,000 complaints last year, and that about 10,000 led to compensation or abandonment of the pursuit of tax.</p>

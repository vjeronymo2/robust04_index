			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Letter: Locked into PEP losses Sir, Having been in PEPs since the day they were first traded I have come to the conclusion that the current increasingly strident advertising could be misleading. I, and my family, wish we had never heard of them, for we are much out of pocket. We deal with several PEP managers. None has ever forwarded reports and accounts of the companies in which they hold shares on our behalf. This is typical of the second-rate service they extend to their PEP customers. No doubt their excuse is that they are dealing here with penny numbers; but that is in the nature of the beast (and why offer the service if they don't like to?). At 40 per cent tax and at current yields the costs of our PEPs are probably greater than the tax benefits (at 25 per cent tax the situation would become untenable). But what is unequivocal and worse is that we are locked into our loss-making shares: (eg, Lucas - 35 per cent; Tarmac - 54 per cent; Ladbroke - 21 per cent; Pilkington - 48 per cent; and my piece de resistance, warmly recommended by my brokers for one of my PEPs, Adwest  - 52 per cent). I could go on. And, of course, these losses cannot be offset against my non-PEP gains. Ernest G Gobert, 3 Beechwood Drive, Marlow, Bucks SL7 2DH</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad </F> Basindwah by correspondent Yusuf al-Sharif; place and date not  given]    [Text] [Al-Sharif] I held a long dialogue with Yemeni  Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah on the massive disaster  besetting his country and its unitary experiment, which is  facing a difficult test. Indeed, the dialogue was interrupted  by telephone conversations with the military command, the  Foreign Ministry, and Interior Minister Yahya al-Mutawakkil in  Sanaa to follow up on the raging battles in Yemen and their  domestic and foreign repercussions.    After war broke out between the forces of what were two  parts  of the country, why did President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih turn down  the Arab mediation offers to contain the deteriorating situation  in Yemen and the Arab League's offer to send forces to disengage  the two warring factions?    [Basindwah] Let me first explain the situation. When 'Ali  Salim al-Bid secluded himself in Aden in the middle of August,  we accepted all national, Arab, and international mediation  offers to persuade him to return to perform his duties in Sanaa.  We even accepted all his personal conditions to return and  agreed on all the proposals and formulas proposed by the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] to resolve the political crisis.  President Salih and the People's Congress agreed without  reservation because our main objective was to preserve the  Yemeni unity for which the people struggled. Since unity was  established in May 1990 the YSP leadership has continued its  political pressure and blackmail to gain more posts, influence,  and funds. Despite this, our response was immediate,  appreciating the YSP's choice of merger, its ceding leadership  in the south after 23 years of rule, and because we wanted the  unity process to continue as it started, with the integration of  the unified political will of the People's Congress and the YSP.  Regrettably, despite the success in merging the official  state's institutions in both parts of Yemen, the YSP continued  for four years to place obstacles before the merger of the Armed  Forces, although the General Command of the Northern and  Southern Armed Forces and the post of defense minister were  given to the YSP so that it might not evade responsibility or  claim that the merger was hindered by the People's Congress  during and after the transitional stage. The YSP hindered the  merging of the two Armed Forces so that it would remain in  control of the command of the Southern Forces and use this card  to blackmail, pressure, and terrorize anyone who rejected total  obedience in the provinces of the South, as was the case when it  ruled the South.    [Al-Sharif] Do you believe that the continuing separation of  the Armed Forces was the main factor behind the political crisis  and its aggravation?    [Basindwah] In the pluralistic democratic formula that the  YSP called for as a framework for unity, it was politically  unacceptable to remain a partner in the government with  sovereignty and legislative and executive powers and at the same  time play the role of opposition to the constitutional and  legitimate regime of the unified state. Logically, it had to  choose between siding with the government or the opposition.  But al-Bid chose a duplicitous stance and rejected all the  solutions put forward by the mediators to heal the rift and ease  the political crisis through dialogue with President Salih or  between the two parties or among the tripartite ruling coalition  that includes the Reform Grouping. From his seclusion in Aden,  he persisted in increasing the differences. The People's  Congress called for a comprehensive national dialogue on the  causes of the crisis and its negative repercussions and to find  a way to emerge from the labyrinth created by the YSP. The  participants in the dialogue worked out the Pledge and Accord  Document with the participation of all parties in the government  and opposition and public figures. I would like to ask you if  al-Bid returned to Sanaa to take the constitutional oath as vice  president, for which the agreement in Amman provides. Why have  the YSP ministers and deputies retrenched in Aden? What is  their goal and purpose?    [Al-Sharif] I am afraid I cannot answer that question; the  Yemenis know more about their affairs than anybody else.    [Basindwah] They leaked their intention to return to the  days  of partition three and a half years after the establishment of  unity, in an unexpected statement by Salim Salih, the YSP's  assistant secretary general. Salih dropped a bombshell by  proposing federation as a substitute to merger unity. They  threatened that if we reject federation, we may regret it later  on. Naturally we rejected it because unity came to rectify an  error and handle conspiracies that were not created by the  Yemeni people. Unity also affirmed a fact that was known on the  ground and in the history books, namely, that we are one people.  It was not a unity between two peoples, two parties, and two  countries, as was the case in the unity between Egypt and Syria.  You know that throughout Yemen the entire people, even  simple-minded people, refused to refer to the North and South  before the establishment of unity. We used to say the southern  part and the northern part.    [Al-Sharif] We are past this stage now. In the absence of  reason and dialogue, the military option has triumphed over the  political options that were always available, even in the  darkest moments. Egypt has been a major partner in supporting  the 26 September revolution in the North and 14 October in the  South. It has sacrificed thousands of its best men and supplied  Yemenis with weapons, which we imported with our own money, and  technical experts to modernize Yemen so that it could restore  its past glory. On this basis, we have a right to ask: Why did  you get involved in the military option?    [Basindwah] It is my right and duty to admit with pride and  honor Egypt's military, political, and cultural role. Were it  not for this role, the fate of our revolution would have been  similar to earlier revolutions and uprisings in Yemen, which  were wiped out after a few weeks or days, simply because our  Arab brothers ignored our legitimate humanitarian desire for  liberation and freedom. But what do you have to say about the  Scuds that the YSP troops are now firing at random against  Sanaa, Ta'izz, and Dhamar? Is the murder of dozens of  defenseless civilians and the destruction of homes and vital  installations the practical embodiment of the plan of the  cultural modernization of the unified state of Yemen, about  which the YSP leadership has been bragging?    [Al-Sharif] Didn't the Northern Army carry out similar  military operations against civilians in Aden and other Southern  governorates?    [Basindwah] We challenge the YSP to prove any military act  committed by the Armed Forces of the unified state against  civilians. These were the strict orders of President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih in his capacity as the supreme commander. I  would like to correct many of the mistakes persistently made by  the media organs of the YSP and the external forces that support  its conspiracy with regard to the military plan to extend the  authority of the constitutional legitimacy of the state of unity  throughout the country. This plan does not place the seizure of  Aden at the head of its priorities; it merely seeks, in what I  am at liberty to say, to lay siege to its approaches, exit  points, and roads leading to it. As for the collapse of the  secessionist clique in the YSP, which is fortifying itself  inside Aden, this is the job and responsibility of the people  and the unionist leaders and elements in the YSP and its Armed  Forces. Our wager is on the people's adherence to unity and on  the suffering and oppression that have pained them under the  fascist and totalitarian rule of the Southern part.    [Al-Sharif] We have not settled the issue of who is  responsible for starting the fighting and choosing the military  option.    [Basindwah] The conspiracy scenario began to be implemented  immediately after the Pledge and Accord Document was signed in  Amman. We were surprised by a ferocious attack by the YSP's  Armed Forces on the al-'Amaliqah Brigade, which was stationed in  the Abyan area in the Southern governorates. The attack failed.  The president, who is also supreme commander, made a strenuous  effort to contain the military crisis provoked by the YSP's  separatist leaders. They provoked it after their political  efforts to repartition the country failed. Several days later  they provoked another military clash in the Harf area in the  Northern governorates and failed again. They repeated these  military tactics near Shabwah's oil fields in the Southern  governorates. These battles were limited to offensive action by  their side and moves to repulse them by the legitimate forces.  Earlier it was possible to contain any attempts to expand the  fighting and handle the issue by political methods, regarding  what had happened as a mere escalation of tension. This  situation continued until the YSP forces carried out an all-out  offensive in the 'Imran area. It was a criminal, separatist,  premeditated attack.    [Al-Sharif] The reports on who began the fighting in 'Imran  were conflicting.    [Basindwah] Fortunately, or unfortunately, the Yemeni  military committee that includes Jordanian and Omani officers  and the U.S. and French military attaches was carrying out its  duties in the 'Imran camp at the time. This committee is more  competent and reliable than other parties in giving testimony  and pointing an accusing finger at the guilty side. The  committee members had a miraculous escape when fighting erupted  between the 2d Armored Brigade, which receives its orders from  the YSP separatists, and a brigade serving under the legitimate  command. The 2d Brigade's commander fired several shots as a  sign to begin the fighting. The brigade under the legitimate  command took no heed and refused to fire back. Mujahid  al-Kahhali, a reserve officer who leads a so- called corrective  movement and who was in the camp without having official  business there, detonated a highly explosive charge. This  caused confusion and the two brigades clashed, destroying each  other in hours. The military committee could not contain the  situation. The president immediately visited the wounded from  both brigades and supervised the aerial transfer of seriously  wounded troops to a medical center in Jordan. He announced that  the wounded troops from both sides were Yemenis and that their  plight pained the entire nation. He said the dead troops were  martyrs of a united Yemen and ordered compensation of 20,000  rials for every dead officer of the YSP brigade and 10,000 rials  for every dead soldier. He also ordered that new weapons and  ammunition be issued to those who survived, giving them leave  from duty until after the 'Id al-Adha feast. But the  premeditated political crisis resurfaced in the Dhamar area. A  YSP commander ordered the units of the Ba Suhayb Brigade to  deploy outside the camp with their tanks and large and  medium-caliber guns. This was a blatant violation of the  agreement reached within the military committee and constituted  disobedience of the orders issued by Staff Brigadier General  Haytham Qasim Tahir, defense minister, commander of the Armed  Forces, and a YSP official. The brigade commander subjected the  city of Dhamar to tension and apprehension. I carried out  several contacts with the defense minister in Aden--most YSP  ministers were by now living there until the situation cleared  up--but his brother the commander of the Ba Suhayb Brigade  maintained his attitude and insisted on deploying outside the  camp. At 2010 on a Wednesday evening two weeks ago we were with  the president at the Presidential Palace in Sanaa when he  received an urgent telephone call from the Army General Command  reporting that the brigade had opened fire on a Republican Guard  battalion stationed on the other side of Dhamar and that the  city's main electric power plant had been destroyed. The  president, in his capacity as supreme commander, issued an order  to both sides to observe a cease-fire. He also ordered the  Republican Guard battalion not to return the brigade's fire but  to take precautionary measures.    [Al-Sharif] Information has it that the Ba Suhayb Brigade  observed the cease-fire.    [Basindwah] Yes. The two sides observed the cease-fire for a  short time. But 45 minutes later a ferocious attack with tanks,  armored vehicles, and artillery was launched against 1,200  officers and men of the Central Security Forces in Aden who  carried only light weapons. This was a brutal act of  extermination in full view of the public. The YSP forces  launched a second brutal offensive against an armored brigade  under legitimate command in the Radfan area. The situation  erupted and it became impossible to control the synchronized  attacks in most areas, all of which were part of the separatist  conspiracy. Some YSP forces joined the legitimate forces, other  YSP forces fled, and some are still fighting. No one is saying  this side won and that side was defeated. All are Yemenis and  the loss is the entire country's loss. It is difficult to  replace troops and weapons.    [Al-Sharif] Don't you think the president has the necessary  powers as supreme commander to order a cease-fire so as to avoid  further casualties and destruction and before the fighting turns  into a full-scale North-South civil war? Some enemies of Yemen  would like to attribute a sectarian nature to this strife,  saying that it is a conflict between the [Shiite] Zaydi tribes  and the [Sunni] Shafi'ites.    [Basindwah] Civil war always occurs between two groups of  the  same nation or even between two sects. This is what Yemen's  enemies hope for. But Yemen is united now in a state made  legitimate by popular referendum. The people were unanimous in  choosing unity and a single constitution. I believe things will  return to normal in a few days, that the conspiracy will fail,  and that those who plotted against unity and constitutional  legitimacy will stand trial.    [Al-Sharif] What is the aim of your diplomatic tour, which  began in Cairo and took in Jordan, Syria, and the Gulf  countries, after the president rejected mediation and turned  down the Arab League's offer to send Arab forces to disengage  the two warring sides?    [Basindwah] Arab and foreign mediation was required during  the political crisis when the YSP was keeping its conspiracy  against unity, constitutional legitimacy, and the elected  government under wraps. Mediation now should focus on  persuading the rebellious conspiring group to accept the  legitimate authority and listen to the call of reason and  democracy. This is why the government has declared that what is  happening is a domestic Yemeni affair. Those who wish to carry  out good offices must help us to control the situation and  preserve the country's unity. They must not deal with those  officials who have lost their legal status.    [Al-Sharif] I would like to remind you of Yemen's position  during the Gulf crisis. Yemen urged an inter-Arab solution.    [Basindwah] Yes, that was our position. We still want an  Arab solution that will defend constitutional legitimacy,  maintain our unity and sovereignty, and safeguard our nation.  This is why we turned down the offer to have Arab forces sent  to us, because what is happening--as I said--is an internal  Yemeni affair. The disengagement of forces would mean  recognizing the separatist rebels as an independent entity. We  have responded to every mediation effort and agreed to make  every possible concession. But the conspirators have always  backed down and refused to implement the agreements. They  insisted on the return of the YSP forces to the South and the  return of the legitimate forces to the North. This was an  introduction to their declared secession. We knew of this  conspiracy from the beginning. We rejected it politically.  They tried then to make it a fact by military secession.    [Al-Sharif] Does this mean the abolition or dissolution of  the YSP?    [Basindwah] Certainly not, because Yemen has chosen  democracy  and pluralism. We are discussing a conspiratorial and  secessionist group. But this does not mean the YSP leadership  has no elements who support unity, adhere to legitimacy, reject  hegemony, and believe in democracy. The decision to dismiss the  vice president was adopted with the unanimous legal vote of the  House of Representatives, including YSP representatives. The  same applies to the dismissal of Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr  al-'Attas, who suddenly and without the permission of the  president traveled to the United States, where he spent four  days in hospital on the pretext of receiving treatment. He and  his entire family are now enjoying themselves in the parks of  Florida. The same goes for the dismissal of the Aden governor  and the defense minister, who are the heads of the sedition. As  for the dismissal of the petroleum minister, he is accused of  stealing over $350 million in oil royalties. These dismissed  officials will be replaced by other honest YSP elements.    [Al-Sharif] The telephone rang and the Yemeni foreign  minister lifted the headset and started a long conversation with  the General Command in Sanaa, the Foreign Ministry, and the  Interior Ministry. He asked about the military situation,  affirming that his meeting with President Husni Mubarak was  positive and that the Egyptian Foreign Ministry constantly  briefs him on the current situation in Yemen. I asked him if I  could speak with Interior Minister Yahya al-Mutawakkil. I asked  al-Mutawakkil about the widespread rumors of the arrests of YSP  officials in North Yemen. Al-Mutawakkil said: These are  seditious rumors by the YSP. Only very few people were arrested  to secure the rear of the legitimate forces when accusations of  provocation and political mobilization were proved against them.  Among those arrested is 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Saqqaf, chief editor  of the YEMEN TIMES, who published seditious and alarming  statements that 12,000 people were killed in the fighting, while  news agency correspondents and the statements issued in Aden and  Sanaa put the dead in the hundreds. Al-Mutawakkil said: We  hope to end the state of emergency once the fighting stops and  the constitutional legitimate authority imposes its authority  throughout Yemen. The overall security situation is reassuring.  The indiscriminate shelling of Sanaa and Ta'izz by Scud  missiles has alarmed the people but has increased their  determination to confront those who rebel against unity and  those who plot against constitutional legitimacy.    I asked Basindwah about the course of the fighting in light  of his conversation with the General Command in Sanaa.    [Basindwah] The legitimate forces are now besieging Aden at  Dar Sa'd near the Shaykh 'Uthman quarter and at al-'Alam and  al-'Anad, 50 km from Aden. The fall of Aden is a matter of  time, because we want to preserve the life of the inhabitants  and the vital installations.    [Al-Sharif] And what about foreign reaction to the events in  Yemen?    [Basindwah] Diplomatic and security reports indicate that  ships have arrived at Aden and Diya' al-Mukalla carrying weapons  from particular states.    [Al-Sharif] Which states?    [Basindwah] We refuse to accuse anyone until we have  tangible  evidence. Generally speaking, the YSP has received arms  consignments from East countries, including Bulgaria. These  weapons were paid for from the $250 million in the Treasury of  the Southern part before the days of unity.    [Al-Sharif] We are afraid that rumors and misleading reports  leaked to Sanaa and Aden are designed to worsen the military  situation.    [Basindwah] Can we deny that a consignment was seized in al-  Hudaybah before the fighting started? The consignment contained  military communications equipment and listening devices. From  where did they bring the money? That is the question.    [Al-Sharif] In a statement to a London-based Arab  television station during the political crisis, President Salih  said some sides paid to create the crisis.    [Basindwah] But he refused to name the sides that pay.    [Al-Sharif] Reportedly, Sudanese and Iraqis are fighting  alongside the forces of legitimacy.    [Basindwah] I will tell you of an incident showing the  failure of the tendentious YSP propaganda: Nasir al-Sabili, the  dismissed governor of Aden, announced the arrest of a group of  people affiliated with the Egyptian al-Jihad organization and  claimed that the General People's Congress objected to their  extradition to Egypt. Egyptian Ambassador in Sanaa 'Ata Harun  was contacted and he assigned the Egyptian consul to  investigate. Meanwhile, the interior minister officially  ordered the Aden governor to hand over the detained group to the  Egyptian security authorities without any conditions or  restrictions. But in Aden, the Egyptian consul discovered that  the whole issue was a fabrication and that no arrests had been  made. This is how the YSP uses its propaganda to incite the  world against the legitimate authority. We challenge them to  produce one Sudanese or Iraqi fighting within the ranks of the  legitimate forces.    This fact was confirmed by Ambassador Badr Hammam, Egypt's  envoy to Yemen, during the political crisis. In my meeting with  President Husni Mubarak to explain the situation in Yemen,  Ambassador Hammam testified that Sanaa is innocent of those  accusations. Similar rumors were disseminated during the Gulf  war, with fabricated reports that Iraqi planes sought shelter in  Yemen. Regrettably, the other day I read an article by an  Egyptian writer claiming that 50,000 Iraqis remained in Yemen  after the Gulf war and are now fighting against the forces of  the YSP. What are foreign embassies and news agency  correspondents doing in Yemen? Have they said anything to  support these allegations? We must wonder about the motives and  the mission of Salim Salih [a YSP official], who arrived in  London before the military action and who is still there. And we  must ask what Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas is doing in the United  States. He said his mission was to try to get a cease-fire. So,  did he know the YSP would soon ignite the war?    [Al-Sharif] The YSP has accused the constitutional  government  of importing chemical and biological weapons before the war  broke out.    [Basindwah] This accusation deserves no response because it  denies itself by itself. If it had been true, the United States  would have announced it and imposed international sanctions on  us.    [Al-Sharif] By the way, how do you assess the U.S. position  toward the disaster of the fighting in Yemen?    [Basindwah] The United States has announced that it is eager  for Yemeni unity, not out of fear for its economic and strategic  interests in Yemen, because these are safe, but because it is no  longer in conflict with any other superpower now that the Soviet  Union has collapsed and the Cold War and the policy of  polarization have ended. The United States believes that unity  is a factor of stability, security, and peace in the Arabian  Peninsula. Divisions have always been a cause of tension and  unrest. The Americans praised and valued our options for  democracy and pluralism and they sent a high-ranking official to  congratulate Yemen on successfully emerging from the experience  of free and peaceful elections. In the oilfields, U.S.  companies are continuing their activity, digging, building  pipelines, and exporting oil regularly and efficiently. This  perhaps explains our reassurance that the United States remains  concerned about Yemeni unity.    [Al-Sharif] But statements by the U.S. assistant secretary  of  state, which he made in the Gulf after his visit to Yemen and  the eruption of fighting there, were interpreted by some  observers as a change in the U.S. position toward unity.    [Basindwah] He only answered correspondents' questions  following his visit to Yemen. His answers were his personal  interpretation of the progress of military operations and he did  not commit the U.S. Government to them. Naturally, some  observers are optimists, others are pessimists; some are  realistic and credible in their analyses while others are not.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Quotient receives approach QUOTIENT, London-based computer firm specialising in stock processing software, confirmed yesterday that it had received an approach which might lead to an offer. At yesterday's closing price of 118p, a rise of 28p on the day, a full bid would be worth a little more than Pounds 16m. Mr Tim Simon, Quotient chairman and chief executive, refused yesterday to identify the potential suitor. Discussions about the approach were in progress with Quotient's financial adviser, Samuel Montagu, but he could not say when the company would be able to make a further statement. The share price has risen by 34 per cent since April 5 when ACT, the Birmingham-based computer services company, raised its stake from 0.9 per cent to 13.1 per cent. ACT sold its Apricot workstation business to Mitsubishi of Japan last year leaving it with net cash of about Pounds 25m. Mr Roger Foster, ACT chairman, has made no secret of his intention to use the cash for strategic acquisitions, especially among companies weakened by the economic downturn. ACT already has a strong financial services division. Some 20 per cent of ACT's stock is held by Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant bank. Quotient, which both processes stock and develops software packages for brokers to use in-house, was badly hit by the fall in the world's stock markets in the late 1980s and suffered a loss of almost Pounds 1.6m in 1989. Last year pre-tax profits were a little more than Pounds 1m on sales of Pounds 22.4m. It is developing an advanced trading system in partnership with Fujitsu of Japan.</p>

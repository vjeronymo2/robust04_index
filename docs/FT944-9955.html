			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Outdoors: Aston Martin back on the right road - Motoring Aston Martin started to lose its way as a small-scale, high-performance car-maker 20 years ago, Now, however, it is back on track. It took the wrong turning early in the 1970s by replacing the DB6s with massive, V8-engined cars which, progressively, became more obese, over-powered and over-priced. While rich owners could enjoy playing with these Pounds 100,000-plus toys on racing circuits hired for the occasion, their bulk and thirst made them less pleasant and practical as normal road cars. With the introduction of the new DB7, however, everything has changed. Aston Martin is making a great car again - and we have Ford to thank. Its input into the DB7 included a vastly more extensive development programme than the British company could ever have afforded in the old days. It promises to be the most reliable Aston Martin for years. By Aston standards, the price of Pounds 78,500 is down to earth - the V8s start at Pounds 133,574. But the DB7 is incomparably more pleasant to drive. Its 3.2-litre straight six has a dual personality. It develops 335 horsepower at 5,500rpm, sounding just a shade metallic as the revolutions rise, but delivers maximum torque (that is, pulls hardest) at only 3,000rpm. The supercharger boost is felt from 1,000rpm upwards, which represents 30mph (50kph) in fifth gear. Once clear of town traffic, a lazy driver could exploit this silken surge of power and treat the DB7 almost as a one-gear car. Most, of course, will prefer to let the engine spin fast through the gears and experience the lightning acceleration - 0-62mph (100kmh) in just 5.7 seconds - even though they will have to trust the maker's claim of a 165mph (266kph) maximum. The five-speed gearbox is not as good as those of the best German and Japanese cars - my test car's transmission made sizzling noises when cold and felt a bit slack at times. A 4-speed automatic with electronic control is available and a limited slip differential that helps stifle wheelspin is standard. And although the DB7 has ultra-low-profile Bridgestone tyres only 40 per cent as high in cross-section as they are wide, its ride is astonishing. Subtle power assistance takes all the effort out of low-speed steering but removes none of the open road feel. Styling is an individual matter but, by common consent, the DB7 looks sensational. There is a hint of the old DB6 around its haunches and the Aston Martin badge sits easily on the down-swept nose. Inside, it is traditionally British, with soft leather seats that support in all the right places and touches of wood veneer on the fascia. Air-conditioning, cruise control and all-disc, anti-lock brakes are standard. But air-bags are not available until early next year. At the most, only 650 DB7s will be built in the next 12 months - and half of those have been spoken for, with Pounds 10,000 deposits paid up front. Sales will start in the US in the spring of 1996. A DB7 Volante cabriolet is coming and may be joined later by a V12. If a car with the Aston's price is just a dream, consider the DB7's distant relative, the Ford Probe. Based on a Mazda (Ford also owns a chunk of the Japanese company), this US-made 2+2 comes in two versions: a 2.5-litre V6 at Pounds 20,160; and a two-litre, four-cylinder version, equipped less elaborately, at Pounds 16,745. I drove a two-litre Probe at the end of a memorable day at the wheel of a DB7. Never mind that the Probe is little more than one-fifth the Aston Martin's price. It is quite sleek and still unusual enough to make heads turn. A tortoise to the Aston Martin's hare? I suppose so but, in the real world, its usable performance is little different.</p>

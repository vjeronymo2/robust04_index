			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Hydro International to float Where there's muck . . . Hydro International, a market leader in using 'vortex technology' for low-cost storm control and sewage treatment, is going public next month through a Pounds 4m placing and full listing. After 14 years of battling to win acceptance for its technology, the Clevedon, Avon-based concern sees opportunities to accelerate its growth through international expansion and development of new markets. Hydro's products use a vortex - a kind of whirlpool effect which can be harnessed to regulate fluid flows - for two main product ranges, flow control valves for flood protection and storm control, and hydro dynamic separators, for separating solids from liquids, especially in the treatment of sewage and other waste water. The company is hoping to benefit from recent environmental legislation demanding sharp reductions in the level of pollutants that can be discharged into seas, lakes, rivers and other water courses. Mr Tim Lamb, managing director, said about 35 per cent of the Pounds 24bn expected to be spent by the UK water and sewage industry up to 2005 is in areas in which the company operates. Hydro had sales last year of Pounds 4.1m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 156,000, expected to rise this year to about Pounds 5m and Pounds 400,000 respectively. Profits may dip next year because of research and development spending, Mr Lamb said. After the placing, which is being handled by Allied Provincial, about 30 per cent of Hydro's shares will be in public hands.</p>

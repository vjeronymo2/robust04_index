			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station editorial: "The Enemies of the Nation and People </F> Are Vigorously Continuing Activities To Oppose National  Reconciliation and Peace in Cambodia"]    [Text] The roundtable meeting to be held in Pyongyang on 27  May constitutes a major event for our nation and people. The  Cambodian people, who are victims of the 15 year Vietnamese war  of aggression, yearn for national reconciliation and peace so  they can live again in peace. As before, however, the enemies  of our nation and people do not want us to unite and have peace.  They intend further to fan the flames of war in order to  massacre the people, which will permit them to have the  opportunity to grab the interests of our nation and people at  will.    Look, while His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk is striving to  convene a roundtable meeting, the communist Vietnamese puppets  are actively seeking foreign arms aid -- the puppet Sar Kheng's  recent visit to the United States is conspicuous evidence, and  so on. Moreover, Winston Lord, U.S. assistant secretary of  state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, recently disclosed  that he was currently holding talks with France, Australia, and  others about the possibility of sending armaments for the  two-headed government further to attack Democratic Kampuchea.    The above activities and utterances are evidence that the  communist Vietnamese and their puppets and alliance never want  us, the Cambodians, to unite and to live peacefully. They will  continue to inflame war with a view to doing away with our  nation and killing our people. Should the Pyongyang roundtable  meeting fail, it will be due to the continuing opposition by the  communist Vietnamese and their puppets and alliance to the  national reconciliation plan of the king.    All in all, the communist Vietnamese and their puppets and  alliance can never act unchecked. The trend of peace and  national reconciliation against war is becoming more and more  zealous with each passing day. This tendency is immensely  forceful and absolutely unstoppable. Those opposing national  reconciliation and peace by further inflaming war are all  traitors of the nation and people. One day, they will, at all  costs, be crushed to pieces by the trend of national  reconciliation and peace among the nation and people. National  reconciliation, peace, independence, and Cambodia's genuine  national unity then will be restored.</p>

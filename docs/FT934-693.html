			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: All knotted up with too much legislation Sir, Thank you for printing the article 'Trapped in a Company Flat - The Leasehold Act is creating a two-tier property market', by Caroline Garnham (Finance and the Family, December 18). This demonstrated admirably the tangle that is being created by current legislation; not all that different from the work of a kitten with a ball of string. Economists think that the economy is driven by market forces, but growth is a function of the ability to do things without the burden of tax advisers, investment managers, pension fund administrators, solicitors and specialists on current EU legislation. It is even tough being the beneficiary of a will. The administrators send you a letter giving you the good news and some four months later you get a cheque for half the amount. It is good fun (for some) trying to get an explanation from a solicitor who has made a mistake] Oh for the simple life, when laws could be read and understood by all (as in the Ten Commandments) and we did not have to pay for the advice which we did not need and at rates that we could not afford. F K C Pike, Knighton House, Ferry Road, Studland, Swanage, Dorset BH19 3AQ</p>

The sources said government departments involved in drawing  up the new policies are still busy applying the finishing  touches.    Auto makers and would-be investors at home and overseas are  nursing high expectations in the belief that the policies would  bring major changes not only to the industry but to the national  economy as well.    Two years ago, the central government decided that the  automotive industry should be developed into an economic pillar.    Since then the industry and government departments have been  busy drafting specific measures for rapid growth over a  seven-year period.    Industry officials say that the new policies will direct  financing to large manufacturing plants while letting  unproductive ones go bankrupt.    More than 120 independently operated plants now assemble  motor vehicles in China.    The sources would not elaborate on the impending policies  because they have not yet been completed.    Different government departments have brought different  ideas  to the table and discussions are continuing, said an official  from the Ministry of Machinery Industry, which oversees car  manufacturing.    The official, who did not want to be publicly identified,  did  not say if there is a deadline for finishing the new policies.    Many people had expected the policies to be announced by the  end of last year. Observers said the delay may indicate major  differences of opinion.    Senior government officials recently sketched out the  outlines of the new policies when they reiterated the principles  for developing the industry. Among the key points are that:    --The government will not authorize new manufacturing  projects because too many plants now assemble small numbers of  low-quality vehicles.    A senior official with the State Planning Commission has  said  that under the new policies, the government will let inefficient  enterprises wither in the face of competition.    -- Government support is to be concentrated on large  manufacturing plants such as the No 1 Automobile Works in  Changchun, Jilin Province; a joint venture in Wuhan between the  Dongfeng Group and the French car maker Peugeot SA; and Shanghai  Volkswagen, a joint venture.    The three auto makers now make the German-designed Audi 100,  Jetta and Santana models and the French-developed Citroen ZX  sedan.    As for other auto plants run by the aerospace and weaponry  industries and other sectors that previously had focused on  defence work, their development should follow a step-by-step  approach, the official noted.    -- The government will not approve new projects that  assemble  motor vehicles with imported CKD (complete knock down)  components.    That means State support will go to existing auto makers  that  develop new cars by themselves or co-operatively with foreign  designers.    --The State must have a dominant position in the highly  lucrative automotive industry.    Last year, 1.3 million motor vehicles were produced,  compared  with 1.08 million in 1992. Sales in 1993 were 115 billion yuan  ($13.22 billion), a big rise from 1992.    -- Finally, auto makers should develop and manufacture small  cars that ordinary Chinese can afford.    The average urban worker in China earns about 400 yuan ($46)  a month while monthly income in rural areas stands at 77.5 yuan  ($9).    The country has 1.17 billion people but only 8.3 million  motor vehicles. About 1 million of all the cars and trucks in  use are sedans, of which only a small proportion are owned by  ordinary people. But as the economy continues to grow and  personal income continues to rise, more people will be able to  afford a car.    In fact, surveys indicate that a growing number of ordinary  people plan to buy a car in the near future.    In Beijing, the number of driving schools has increased to  200. Just a few years ago there were only 10.    Surveys show that tens of thousands of people are being  trained at the schools. Not surprisingly, though, as demand  rises so have the fees charged by the schools.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 24 (XINHUA) -- Hu Jintao, a Chinese  Communist Party leader, today expressed the hope for further  development of long-term and good-neighborly relations between  China and the Republic of Korea (ROK).    This conforms not only to the fundamental interests of the  two peoples, but also to peace, stability and development in the  north-eastern Asia and the rest of the region, he said.    Hu, Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the  Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and  member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, made  these remarks at a meeting with Mun Chung-su, secretary-general  of the Democratic Liberal Party Central Committee of the ROK,  here this afternoon.    Noting that China and the ROK are close neighbors and their  peoples' contacts can be traced back to ancient times, Hu said  the two countries had not long established diplomatic ties, but  bilateral ties have developed rapidly and their exchanges and  cooperation covered a wide range.    He added that the friendly contacts between the two parties  have also been expanding.    Mun praised China for its stability and rapid economic  development, adding that it is his hope that the visit will help  increase his understanding of China's reform, opening to the  outside world and modernization and promote the growth of the  ties between the two parties and the two countries.    Li Shuzheng, head of the International Liaison Department of  the CPC Central Committee, attended the meeting.    This evening, Tian Jiyun, member of the Political Bureau of  the CPC Central Committee and vice-chairman of China's National  People's Congress Standing Committee, hosted a banquet in honor  of the visitors.    The ten-member delegation, including six members of the  national assembly, arrived here earlier this afternoon.    Tomorrow morning Li Shuzheng is expected to hold working  talks with Mun and his party on relations between the two  parties.    After their visit to Beijing, the delegation will also pay  goodwill visits to Xian and Shanghai.</p>

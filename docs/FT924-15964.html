			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Scottish Asian net asset value up 20% Scottish Asian Investment Company raised net asset value per share by 20 per cent from Dollars 11 per share to Dollars 13.2 (Pounds 7.70) per share in the year ended July 31 1992. Net losses for the year were Dollars 287,401 (restated Pounds 637,095 profits), while losses per share came out at 8.21 cents (earnings of 18.2 cents). Following the decision to move the company onshore from Jersey to the UK, the board said it believed it would be advantageous to change the denomination of its shares from US dollars to sterling and also produce accounts in sterling. These resolutions, together with several other minor proposals to complete the restructuring from an offshore fund to a UK investment trust, will be put to shareholders at an EGM in December.</p>

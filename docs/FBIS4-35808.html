			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Muhammad Ahmad al-Aghbashi, the general  commissioner for relief and rehabilitation, has reported that a  relief column was attacked and plundered last week by the  scattered remnants of the rebellion's army, while on its journey  from Babanusah to Wau. The relief column was carrying 1,500  tonnes of food, destined for distribution in areas affected by  the war.    Dr. al-Aghbash condemned this attack, which constitutes a  violation of agreements pertaining to the transportation of  relief supplies, which guarantees safety for relief convoys, as  signed by the government and the rebels under the auspices of  the United Nations and the Intergovernmental Agency on Drought  and Development [IGADD] states.    The United Nations, which supervises Operation Lifeline's  activities in providing relief to the south, has presented a  formal protest to the rebel movement in Nairobi regarding this  attack, considering it to be a violation of the agreements on  relief.    It may be recalled that the last agreement in this regard  was  signed on 17 May under the auspices of the IGADD committee,  under which the number of relief areas was increased from 21 to  84.</p>

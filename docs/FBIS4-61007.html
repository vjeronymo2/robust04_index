			<p>BFN     [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze, head of the Georgian state,  gave his traditional radio address to the nation on 2 May. With  the details from Tbilisi is Nikolay Mamuashvili:    [Mamuashvili] In his address, Shevardnadze wished all the  people of the Republic a happy Easter Sunday. Addressing the  people of the Tskhinval Rayon and Abkhazia, the head of state  noted that he believed in the day when everyone would be able to  return to the conflict zones and that Abkhazia and Tskhinval  Rayon would be able to live a peaceful and calm life.    I am profoundly convinced, Shevardnadze went on, that  Christian morals will give us the right and the  opportunity--together with the Abkhazians and the Ossetians--to  heal our deep wounds and to live a peaceful life again.    Regarding his recent visit to western Georgia, Shevardnadze  said that he was happy with the changes he had seen in the  region, which provide grounds to be confident about the Georgia  of tomorrow. I have seen well-kept gardens, Shevardnadze said,  and people working in the fields. Practically all enterprises  in industrial Kutaisi have started working again. The highway  to the mountains of Svanetia has opened. Everything is being  done to ensure order in Adzharia, Kakhetia, and other regions of  the country.    In Shevardnadze's opinion, we are standing on the threshold  of serious positive changes that will be beneficial to the  Republic.    In his speech, the head of the state also touched upon the  question of forming a new Georgian national army, which, as he  put it, needs not just bare enthusiasm but professionalism,  order, and discipline. It is precisely this, Shevardnadze went  on, that guided me when I proposed General Nabaidze to the post  of Georgian defense minister, who has passed through a fine  school in the Russian Army. The head of state stressed, I quote:  The bitter experience of the past has proved that, without  close contacts with Russia, we will be unable to create a  full-blooded, normal army that, as in all countries of the  world, should be the guarantor of democracy, peace, and  stability.</p>

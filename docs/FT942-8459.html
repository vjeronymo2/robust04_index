			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Apple peps up its Powerbooks Apple Computer rejuvenated its line of Powerbook portable notebook computers this week with the launch of six 'new and improved' models, writes Louise Kehoe. The Powerbook 500 series features a new type of cursor control device, replacing the built-in trackball with a touch sensitive pad. By moving a finger tip across the pad, or tapping it, the user controls the movements of the cursor on the computer screen. Other innovations include 'intelligent batteries', that enable users to monitor battery life accurately, and CD-quality stereo sound capabilities for multimedia applications. Apple also introduced two new 'sub-notebook' computers, including the first with an active matrix colour display. They will be upgradable to the new PowerPC chip at the heart of Apple's latest desktop Macintosh computers when a low-power version of that chip becomes available. By promising upgradability, Apple hopes to encourage buyers to act now rather than wait for the PowerPC notebooks expected later this year. US prices range from Dollars 2,269 for a Powerbook 520 with 4MB of memory, 160MB hard disk and monochrome display to Dollars 5,539 for the Powerbook 540c with 12MB of memory, 320MB hard disk, built-in modem and colour screen.

Two issues focused  their discussions: the country's fiscal situation and the  review of the 1994 national budget. Following this meeting of  nearly the entire cabinet, its members held their first formal  news conference, which was coordinated by Guillermo Alvarez  Bajares, minister of the Central Information Office.    The finance minister said that the 1994 expenditures budget  of 1.43 trillion [currency not specified] was estimated in April  1993 and was based on petroleum revenues of $15 per barrel. The  price of the crude is currently $12.5 per barrel. As a result,  they were forced to reestimate revenues.    Thus, this Council of Ministers approved a 10-percent  reduction in spending as part of a tax reform program that will  soon be presented to the Congress. This should reduce the  budget deficit by 2 percent of GNP and should reduce inflation.    [Finance Minister Julio Sosa] "We tried to study a reduction  in the operating costs of autonomous services, of funds for  personnel under contracts, and of planned allotments for, among  other things, the purchase of vehicles, although this might seem  unimportant. These things seem unimportant, but they add up to  rather large amounts. This is obviously part of the fiscal  austerity program announced by the president of the Republic.  We also considered -- and this was amply discussed -- the need  to carry out infrastructure projects included in the current  budget but that must be reduced through a regime of concessions."    Meanwhile, and also on economic issues, the development  minister announced an upcoming meeting to which all sectors  involved were invited to reach a voluntary agreement to  stabilize prices and prevent an escalation in the cost of living.    [Development Minister Luis Palacios] "The idea is to urge  all economic sectors to try to reach a voluntary agreement to  lower inflation."    Another issue that focused the attention of journalists was  internal security. In this regard, the interior minister  reaffirmed that the government will guarantee full respect for  human rights and peaceful protests. He clarified, however, that  it cannot continue to allow masked men to lead them. To put an  end to this, he will meet with student leaders. The minister  added that public order requires a firm, vigorous, and sustained  attitude, not just repression.    The justice minister commented on the overlapping duties of  the police. He announced a redefinition of the duties of these  groups to maximize their efficiency.    [Justice Minister Ruben Creixems] "Venezuela is a democratic  country. It has a system that aspires to life in a legal state.  The country's Constitution and its laws define public order and  enshrine principles of personal safety. Thus, police  authorities must be subject to the Constitution and the law.  We must eliminate once and for all in Venezuela that  inadmissible principle that one must shoot first and investigate  later.    "I think that the interior minister, the defense minister,  the governor of Caracas, and I will hold interesting meetings to  somewhat define the scope of various police forces' duties,  because at times it appears that all are in charge of  everything. And when all are in charge of everything, they  might think that somebody else is handling a particular issue.  To the extent that jurisdictions and duties are specifically  defined and to the extent that the issues of organization and  security pertaining to the police corps are settled, one will  then be able to assign specific responsibilities in cases of  violations or able to reward those corps that have performed in  an outstanding manner."    In the opinion of the education minister, the problem is not  the disturbances that the students could stage but the poor  quality of the education they receive. Thus his goal is to  improve quality:    [Education Minister Antonio Cardenas] "I am very worried  that our children and teenagers are spending nine years in basic  education and are leaving without mastering their mother tongue,  without knowing how to read and write correctly, and without  being able to express their ideas correctly. I am even more  worried that some of them -- unfortunately not a majority -- go  through secondary, diversified, and professional education;  reach the university and graduate; and leave the university  still with serious deficiences in the use of their mother  tongue."    The journalists also asked questions about the orientation  of  our foreign policy. The foreign affairs minister said there are  three key issues: maintaining the excellent level of our  relations with neighboring countries and with the United States,  fully articulating integration processes, and improving  Venezuela's image:    [Foreign Affairs Minister Miguel Burelli] "It is possible  that now that the crisis is being resolved it will be recognized  that Venezuelan institutions were so good that they endured the  commotion created by those military coups and the trial of the  president of the Republic. No country on the American continent  has been able to resist this kind of thing. Thus, instead of  having that bad image, we should have been recognized as a  country with formidable political institutions."    This cabinet meeting also approved the reorganization of the  Ministry of the Secretariat. A commission headed by the  incumbent minister was established for this purpose. It must  present a report within 15 days.    The media was also told that henceforth the Council of  Ministers will meet on Wednesdays at 1030. The journalists were  advised about changes in the news reporting procedures and were  urged to cooperate as much as possible to ensure the best  coverage of all Palace events.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report from Kazakhstan by correspondent Alla </F> Nugmanova, including recordings of comments by Y. Usov,  president of AKPO joint-stock company, and President Nursultan  Nazarbayev -- from the "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] The world's first fast breeder reactor at Aktau, the  center of Mangistau oblast, has been shut down, just like many  other industrial installations in the Republic. The reason for  this is that there is no fuel -- or, to be more precise, there  is no money with which to buy it. This despite the fact that  the Republic has its own fuel resources. Debts and nonpayments  within the Republic are increasing. Suppliers themselves have  no funds. The economic crisis is hitting specialists worst.  You cannot survive without a proper salary here.    [Usov] A quarter of our staff have left the works during the  last four months. It is not just that we cannot pay wages, the  two main problems are: 1) We cannot pay railway charges; and 2)  We cannot pay customs duty. But we cannot keep our telephones  going, either. We cannot get any work done.    [Nugmanova] In this situation President Nazarbayev offers a  stark solution. He says all subsidies to enterprises from the  budget should end. Loss-making plants must be declared  bankrupt. It is cheaper for the state to pay unemployment  benefit to workers made redundant when these plants close than  to subsidize them.    [Nazarbayev] [words indistinct] so, the state will not issue  any worthless money.</p>

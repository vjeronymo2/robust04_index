The boy's body was found near the Sacramento Yacht Club by  a person searching for wild asparagus, authorities said. Sacramento police said  injuries to the body led them to classify the death as a homicide. The  4-foot-5-inch, 81-pound boy was the object of a lengthy search by police,  relatives, private groups and the FBI. Police appealed for information from  anyone who may have seen a person with a child between Aug. 27 and  mid-September in the area where the body was found.  </P></p>

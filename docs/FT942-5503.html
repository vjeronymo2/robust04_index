			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Israeli tanks and artillery face Hizbollah Israel and the pro-Iranian Hizbollah group remained in a tense stand-off yesterday, after an overnight exhange of salvoes during which Israel moved tanks and artillery up to its border with Lebanon. Residents of northern Israel emerged yesterday morning from a night spent in bomb shelters. Salvoes of katyusha rockets, fired by Hizbollah in retaliation for Thursday's devastating Israeli air strike on its training base in the Bekaa Valley, landed inside Israel overnight, but caused no injuries and only little damage. Israel and its proxy militia, the South Lebanon Army, hit back by shelling the sources of rocket fire. There were no further rocket barrages during the day, however, and the threat of an escalation of hostilities appeared to be receding. Nevertheless, many residents of villages in southern Lebanon were reported to be fleeing north for fear of further Israeli air raids. Many families from the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmonah were also heading away from the border area, spending the weekend with friends and relatives. A Fijian member of the United Nations peacekeeping force was killed last night when guerrillas in a car opened fire at a Fijian-manned checkpoint in a village near the southern port of Tyre. The attackers were reported to be Hizbollah guerrillas angered by the death of one of their comrades in an outbreak of fighting with Fijian peacekeepers earlier in the day. Thursday's air raid was the heaviest blow suffered by Hizbollah at Israeli hands, but the group's secretary-general, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, pledged yesterday to intensify its anti-Israeli actions. Lebanon's schools, banks and shops stayed closed yesterday as thousands of Hizbollah supporters filled the streets of Beirut in funeral processions for the 26 guerrillas killed in the Israeli raid. Mr Amr Mousa, Egypt's foreign minister, yesterday condemned the Israeli strike as 'not acceptable' and warned of the potential negative implications for the peace process. But Israeli officials said that they hoped the peace process would not be affected and that Syria would now exert its influence to rein in Hizbollah.</p>

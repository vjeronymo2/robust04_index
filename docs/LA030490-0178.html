			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LOYOLA LACROSSE TEAM STICKS TO ITS GOALS;  </P> <P> CLUB SPORTS: THANKS TO HARD WORK BY THE COACH AND PLAYERS, THIS WEST COAST CLUB  IS BECOMING COMPETITIVE IN A SPORT DOMINATED BY EAST COAST TEAMS.  </P> <P> Lacrosse, you've come a long way baby. First an ancient American Indian sport  and then an Ivy League college favorite, it has finally made it to Loyola  Marymount.  </P> <P> Now a club sport at Loyola, it took the determination of Coach Dave Basile and  the dedication of the players to build a credible lacrosse team.  </P> <P> Becoming competitive has been the major goal for Basile since he took over the  team three years ago. The team was actually created four years ago but played  without a coach for its first season.  </P> <P> To become competitive it needed a coach. So Basile, first entering the scene as  a referee for several of their games, decided to take on the job.  </P> <P> "I knew it was just a club sport, but I really wanted to get actively back into  lacrosse," said Basile, a Philadelphia native who teaches at Bishop Montgomery  High School.  </P> <P> For the first two years, Basile says, he did everything that he could to keep  the team going. He located competition and set up matches. He taught the  players the fundamentals. Now that the team has been established, he finally  has some help in the form of four assistants with experience in the East.  </P> <P> Club teams in California compete in the West Coast Lacrosse League and are  divided into a North and South Division. These are further divided into  Divisions 1 and 2. Loyola plays in Southern Division 2. The league spans the  state, with teams in the San Francisco area, Chico and Humboldt and San Diego.  Arizona and Arizona State are also included.  </P> <P> The best collegiate teams traditionally are on the East Coast. Teams like  two-time defending NCAA champ Syracuse, Johns Hopkins, Maryland and the  Carolina schools have dominated the scene in the United States. Much of that  has to do with the level of attention given to the sport in that area. There  are high school programs and summer leagues. It is a high profile sport in  parts of the East.  </P> <P> In California, Basile said the best programs are at Whittier College and Santa  Barbara.  </P> <P> "Those are the most competitive in California, but they still aren't anywhere  near the level of Syracuse," Basile said. Loyola beat San Jose State last  weekend to improve to 3-4 going into Sunday's 1 p.m. home game against the  University of San Diego.  </P> <P> Lacrosse is a sport some would consider violent. The safety equipment consists  of leg pads, padded gloves and a helmet. The only equipment the game itself  needs is a pole with a triangular net at the end, a soccer-sized field, two  goal nets and a hard rubber ball about the size of a tennis ball.  </P> <P> Players try to score goals by throwing a ball past a goalie. The ball cannot be  touched by the player's hands and must be handled with the stick. Defenders  check opponents hockey-style and also slash at the ball with their sticks.  </P> <P> Organization is the key to the game, according to Basile. The players must know  what kind of defense and offense is most effective and that, he says, is his  job.  </P> <P> Most of Loyola's players are athletes from California high schools who had  never played lacrosse. This means that teaching the fundamentals of the game is  the most important aspect of practice.  </P> <P> When the Loyola team started, Basile said, it had only 17 "dedicated players"  who showed up for every game, but the roster has grown to 35. Basile's goal is  to have 45 players so that a full-time junior varsity can be created. The  second team now only plays when it is certain that everyone is going to be  there.  </P> <P> Getting players can be tricky business in club sports, as there is no money to  offer scholarships. There is also very little attention garnered from playing  on the West Coast when all of the best teams are in the East.  </P> <P> "I can't really recruit anyone," Basile said. "The only thing that I can do is  offer up (California), the good-looking women and the college as inducements to  play here. Mainly I offer the players a change from playing in the cold."  </P></p>

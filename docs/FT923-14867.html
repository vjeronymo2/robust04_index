			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / British Midland to shed staff BRITISH Midland Airways, the UK's second biggest scheduled air carrier, is to shed some of its 2,800 staff after a disappointing first half of this year. The airline plans to cut costs by 10 per cent by October. It hopes most of the losses will be achieved through voluntary redundancies and non-replacement, but compulsory redundancies have not been ruled out. Sir Michael Bishop, chairman, said: 'We need to keep our cost base down and we are assuming no recovery in the economy until the spring of 1993.' The company's performance so far this year was 'below plan', he said. British Midland runs short-haul services in the UK and the rest of Europe, and saw an increase of 10 per cent to 11 per cent in the number of passengers it carried over the first half of last year. This was significantly worse than the performance of its rivals. The 22 members of the Association of European Airlines saw growth of 18 per cent for the first five months of the year on European flights.</p>

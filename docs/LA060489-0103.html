			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLOODY SUNDAY  </P> <P> There is no attempt to conceal the identity of Barbara Vine as being, in fact,  Ruth Rendell, but the name game evidently keeps her two different publishers  happy. It also gives Rendell two voices, and the Vine novels stray even further  from traditional crime fiction than the Rendell oeuvres.  </P> <P> The House of Stairs is the third of the Vines, after "A Dark-Adapted Eye" and  "A Fatal Inversion." It is terrific: a densely textured, poetic study of murder  once done (although of whom and by whom is teasingly withheld, the victim  unidentified until nearly the end).  </P> <P> The present as lived and the past as revealed converge like cars at an  intersection, and in the crash . . . but that is the author's last teasing  mystery. Vine-Rendell sets herself harder, subtler tasks each time out. "The  House of Stairs" is something of an homage to Henry James, whose writing  figures in the plot.  </P> <P> The house was a tall walk-up (106 steps) in a decaying London neighborhood in  the '60s and '70s. It was presided over by a rich, kind, vague woman named  Cosette who supported an odd assortment of hangers-on. One of them was the  narrator, a woman who writes trashy thrillers. Her fear that she may have  inherited Huntington's chorea, the wasting neurological affliction that killed  Woody Guthrie, lends a curious dissonant tension to the narrative.  </P> <P> Another resident was a strange, hostile figure named Christabel, just out of  prison in present time as the unfoldings begin. The handling of time is in fact  ingenious, present and past overlapping and dissolving one into another in the  narrator's consciousness. The identifying of the several characters and  relationships in a peculiar house in a particular time is the work of a  superior writer, who engenders suspense not out of arbitrary events but from  the inexorable collision of souls. Once again the line between crime and  "straight" fiction is not easy to discern.  </P> <P> Donald E. Westlake, whose satiric send-up of check-out-stand journalism, "Trust  Me on This," is shortly to be filmed, is probably the most consistently amusing  of American crime writers. He, too, likes to set himself literary challenges.  His new work, Sacred Monster, is a sparkling little set-piece in the form of a  long interview with a booze-soaked, drug-dazed superstar, the sacred monster of  the title. Nothing is quite what it seems, of course, to the star or to the  reader.  </P> <P> Westlake's ingenuity at spinning out his tale and working his sleight-of-hand  finale is an audacious treat. What he did to scandal sheets he has now done to  Hollywood's bad manners and worse mores, with much the same infusion of hard  truths.  </P> <P> E. C. Ward's A Nice Little Beach Town is so close to Newport Beach (where the  author lives) that it hardly requires a name of its own, although she calls it  White's Bay. Her nice little but surprisingly violent tale has at its pulsing  heart the skyrocketing value of beach properties.  </P> <P> An elderly Swedish fisherman is found shot, and his tenant, an idealistic high  school teacher, becomes the chief suspect when he and his ex-wife inherit the  old man's newly pricey pieces of coastal turf. An outraged son-in-law, an  irascible developer and his runaway son, a pyromaniac and assorted other thugs  paint the town gory. A likable and urbane story, mayhem notwithstanding.  </P> <P> Blind Side by William Bayer is an offbeat item that incorporates some pictures  ostensibly taken by the photojournalist who is narrating the story. (Bayer  provided both words and pictures.)  </P> <P> The photographer has been taking arty shots of inanimate objects since a  traumatic battle-zone experience left him unable to photograph people. A  seemingly chance encounter with a sexy model propels him over his block and  into a messy world of murder, blackmail, double-crosses and redouble-crosses,  all against a backdrop of obsessive sex, plain and kinky.  </P> <P> Bayer has created a heroine of hypnotic untrustworthiness and a hero who is  altogether too trusting but a great counterpuncher, even after he's been  blind-sided. The story's credibility quotient is very low but its pace is fast,  its temperature high.  </P> <P> Stoney Winston, the continuing figure in a series by Jim Stinson of Pasadena,  is a low-budget jack-of-nearly-all-film-trades, living in one of those decrepit  houses that cling to Laurel Canyon like burrs. In Truck Shot, Winston is  reduced (I think that's the right word) to teaching film temporarily at a  failing art school tucked in the San Gabriel foothills.  </P> <P> You'd think the school would be allowed to expire quietly, but an exploding  kiln that kills an instructor also blows the lid off a whole paste pot of evil  deeds, defalcations, cheating on exams, naked greed and much else. Winston is  quickly up to his lens-cap in confusion and danger.  </P> <P> Stinson, himself a sometime film writer who also does software training  manuals, writes about jobs and geography he knows well and it lends a  comfortable credibility to his work. Winston is an easygoing sort, a welcome  change from the current sleuths who are either burnt-out or too wisecrackingly  clever by half.  </P> <P> Jesse Sublett made a reputation as a bass player and songwriter in his native  Austin, Tex. He now lives in Los Angeles, but his Rock Critic Murders is set in  Austin and is marvelously enriched by Sublett's close acquaintance with the  city's vigorous rock scene. The viewpoint, I'd say, is astringent but  affectionate, although he makes neither the scene nor the city sound like a Boy  Scout jamboree.  </P> <P> His protagonist is a bass player, named, with unbearable appropriateness,  Fender. A reunion of a legendary local group is loused up when the guitarist is  murdered. A kilo of cocaine, fresh off a private plane from Mexico, is missing  and before it is found the seekers have been dropping like flies.  </P> <P> Among the losers are two tone-deaf but greedy rock critics who had evidently  grown weary of fame and wanted money. The story as story is fairly standard  stuff, but the density of the colors with which Sublett paints a little-used  setting makes "Rock Critic Murders" unusually interesting.  </P> <P> Andrew Vachss goes beyond hard-boiled to stories with the feel of granitic  gravel. In Hard Candy, his fourth featuring a loner named Burke, his setting is  again the gritty underside of Manhattan. Burke is backed by a freak show that  suggests Doc Savage as seen through a wood-alcohol hangover. The habitat is a  junkyard, with killer dog in place. The players include a mute named Max, a  gent called the Prophet and a Chinese lady ever ready with ancient wisdom and  hot information.  </P> <P> A hooker wants Burke to free her daughter from a commune that corrupts rather  than saves. The daughter is happy where she is, i.e. already lost. But Burke,  whose M.O. is to meet malevolence with greater malevolence, never takes refusal  for an answer.  </P> <P> The style is terse and urgent, the narrative mostly side-of-the-mouth dialogue.  Despite the backdrop of authentic urban nastiness, the goings-on are in their  way as fanciful as the pulps or 007, but not less readable for all that.  </P> <P> By wild contrast, there is The Queen's Head by Edward Marston, a trip back to  the theater in Shakespeare's and Queen Elizabeth's time. Someone is out to  sabotage an acting company, Lord Westfield's Men. One of the key actors is  killed in a tavern brawl, and the company manager has to find a substitute and  a solution. At length, Elizabeth herself is imperiled, and only a dazzling  piece of stagecraft saves her.  </P> <P> Marston, who lives in England, knows his period and his turf and provides a  painlessly charming visit to the theatrical past.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE HOUSE OF STAIRS,by Ruth Rendell writing as Barbara Vine (Harmony Books:  $16.95; 277 pp.)  </P> <P> SACRED MONSTER, by Donald E.

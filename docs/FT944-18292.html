			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: US mutual funds back Investcorp acquisition Investcorp, the international investment bank, said it had completed the acquisition of Ebel SA, a leading Swiss manufacturer of luxury watches, in a deal which uses a financing technique never used before in Europe. The deal relies on a form of financing, becoming increasingly common in the US market, under which mutual fund companies establish separate funds specifically to invest in senior floating-rate notes and longer-term loan maturities. In the Ebel deal, Investcorp will acquire a majority stake in Ebel, with the company's management buying remaining shares through a SFr130m multi-currency facility arranged by Bankers Trust. This consists of a SFr80m three-year revolving credit facility and a term loan in two tranches. The first tranche is a SFr48m five-year amortising bullet loan with an average life of 3 1/2 years; the second tranche of the loan is for SFr32m, does not begin amortising until the sixth year and funds are provided by mutual funds managed by Merrill Lynch and Van-Kampen Merritt. Because Ebel, which has extensive US sales, has dollar-based cashflow, the mutual funds can rely on receiving their interest and principal repayments in their home currency. 'We have structured the term loan to tailor the maturity profile to the needs of the investors and the company,' said Mr Paul Soldatos, a member of Investcorp's management committee.</p>

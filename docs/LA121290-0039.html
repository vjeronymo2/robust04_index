			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> NO RECOURSE AGAINST FREEWAY ACCUSER  </P> <P> Recently some person reported one of my cars for emitting smoke on the 101  Freeway in Calabasas. As an environment-conscious individual (that's why I live  in Westlake), I had the vehicle checked out every which way.  </P> <P> We could not make it emit smoke. It never has and it has always passed its smog  check. Obviously, the reporter was mistaken, vindictive or just a regular jerk.  </P> <P> I called air quality officials for the name of the person who falsely accused  me. (Someone has to pay for lost time and mechanic's time). Air quality  officials will not pay my expenses and they will not reveal their freeway  "Gestapo" colleague. I was under the mistaken belief that in America we have  the right to face our accuser.  </P> <P> Ventura County Supervisor Susan K. Lacey and Richard H. Baldwin, manager of the  county Air Pollution Control District, should think cautiously about how they  structure a plan for a hot line to report smoking vehicles. This is Ventura  County, Calif., U.S.A., 1990, not Nazi Germany and the Gestapo of the 1930s. If  they want people to be conscientious about this program, then give the falsely  accused the right of recourse and restitution.  </P> <P> MICHAEL WILLIAMS  </P> <P> Westlake  </P></p>

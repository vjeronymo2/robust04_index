			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Sir Peter Parker resigns from Horace Clarkson SIR PETER PARKER, the former chairman of British Rail, has resigned as deputy chairman of Horace Clarkson, the shipping and insurance group, following a dispute at Holman Wade, one of the group's Lloyd's insurance broking subsidiaries which specialises in selling stop-loss policies to Lloyd's Names. Clarkson shares fell by 10p to 68p on the news, which ends an association between Sir Peter and Clarkson of more than 20 years. Sir Peter had supported a bid by Mr Michael Wade, chairman of Holman Wade, to head a management buy-out of the broker, which he had originally sold to Clarkson in 1980. After the proposed MBO was rejected, the Clarkson board insisted on radical cuts in costs, which neither Mr Wade nor Sir Peter were prepared to accept. According to Mr Michael Beckett, a chairman-designate at Clarkson: 'The offer Michael Wade and other made to us was not acceptable and both felt they were better off elsewhere. 'It is our duty to shareholders not to give away assets. Holman Wade is a business badly affected by the turndown at Lloyd's, though there has not been a haemorrhage,' said Mr Beckett. Describing the dispute as 'a disagreement in principle', Sir Peter said last night that he believed the board's decision would lead to a 'reduction in service to members of Lloyd's' He had supported the MBO wholeheartedly. Holman Wade has been a leader in broking so-called 'stop-loss' insurance policies and 'estate protection plans' (EPP) at the Lloyd's of London insurance market. Stop-loss policies cover are a form of reinsurance for Lloyd's Names - the individuals whose assets support underwriting at Lloyd's - covering a tranche of losses above an agreed level. Estate protection plans insure the estates of Lloyd's Names, assuming liabilities after the deaths of Names. As Lloyd's losses climbed, amounting to at least Pounds 4bn between 1988 and 1990, claims on stop-loss and EPP plans have soared. This has lead to a shrinkage in the stop-loss market, making it more difficult for Holman Wade to buy policies for Names. Mr Beckett said that Clarkson no longer intends to sell Holman Wade and that Mr Pat Barr, a director of Clarkson, has been appointed chairman.</p>

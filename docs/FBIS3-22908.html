[see pp.  5-6 of 12 January 1994 Terrorism Report for report of Iranians'  expulsion] France's highest administrative court will have to  determine whether France violated the European Convention on  Extradition. In the eyes of the Swiss government, the  credibility of the fight against terrorism is at stake, Federal  Council Member Arnold Koller said. The Council of State  confirmed Wednesday that this appeal is admissible. [background  passage omitted]  <H5>  Respect Its Commitments </H5>   The Federal Council feels that France has violated the  European Convention on Extradition of 1957. This instrument is  based on reciprocity and the obligation to provide a reason for  any refusal of a request for extradition. Its legal force  depends on the relations of confidence between the contracting  countries regarding respect of human rights. The Swiss aim is  to obtain a court ruling of one state's failure to comply with  international commitments.    A single breach in the system endangers the credibility of  the fight against terrorism, Arnold Koller stressed. It is for  this reason of principle that the Federal Council decided to  bring the matter before a legal authority.  <H5>  Big Surprise </H5>   Arnold Koller reiterated that Switzerland was all the more  surprised by its neighbor's attitude since the French  authorities announced four times that the extradition would take  place. The surprise was also reinforced by the fact that in  1991 and 1992 Switzerland extradited to France two Iranians  wanted for participating in the assassination of the former  Iranian Prime Minister Shapur Bakhtiar.    The French Council of State has a twofold mission: that of  the supreme administrative court guaranteeing fundamental rights  and liberties, and that of adviser to the government in drafting  laws. Since 1977, it has also been referred to in contested  extradition cases. [passage omitted on French comments]  <H5>  The Inquiry Continues </H5>   Switzerland's action vis-a-vis the Council of State  "overjoyed" Roland Chatelain, the examining magistrate for the  canton of Vaud. He has not closed the file and is continuing his  investigation into the responsibility of the Iranians -- 13 in  all -- who are suspected in the assassination of Kazem Radjavi.  Ernst Muehlemann, chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee of  the Swiss National Council, also welcomed the Federal Council's  decision.</p>

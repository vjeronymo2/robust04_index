The delegation was met at Tbilisi Airport  by Vakhtang Rcheulishvili, deputy chairman of the Georgian  parliament, Niko Lekishvili, mayor of the city of Tbilisi, and  other officials.    The itinerary of the Azerbaijani delegation's trip to  Georgia  was changed at Lala-Shovket Gadzhiyeva's request. The program  had originally featured only Marneulskiy District, where, to  judge by information received, the crime situation has  deteriorated sharply. But before visiting Marneuli, L.-Sh.  Gadzhiyeva expressed a desire to visit highland Dmanisskiy  District, which is more remote from the center and where also  Azerbaijanis live under compact conditions.    And so, having negotiated more than 100 km along  snow-covered  winding mountain roads and having bypassed the district center  of Dmanisi, the chain of cars entered the Azerbaijani village of  Gamarli. Hearing of the arrival of the important visitor from  Baku, people hurried toward the cars from their nearby homes.  Lala khanum was tightly ringed by local inhabitants. Announcing  the purpose of her visit, the state secretary asked all the  villagers to meet at the local clubhouse for a comprehensive  discussion.    There were more than enough people wishing to have their  say--a multitude of urgent problems has accumulated in the  village and the district. Those in the hall were mainly women,  children, and the elderly. As we were told later, there are  hardly any young people left in this village, as in the  surrounding Azerbaijani villages--there is no work here, and for  this reason they prefer to make their way to Baku or settle on  the boundless expanses of the former Union--mainly in Siberia,  in the Urals, and in the central zone of Russia, where there is  a need for manpower.    Azerbaijanis once accounted for 70 percent of the population  of the district center of Dmanisi. Now 20-30 homes remain here,  at the most. The villages of Muganly, Saatly, Salamelik,  Guseyn-kendi, Sadzha, and Yyrgandzhak are completely empty. The  bare sockets of windows gape open in 70 homes--more than  half!--in Gamarli itself. Whereas several years ago Azerbaijanis  were leaving Georgia in no great hurry--they would sell their  homes and carry what they had earned over a long life to their  new place of residence--now they frequently leave without  luggage, and their departure is reminiscent more of flight. Why?  The answers are to be found in the bitter confessions of the  inhabitants of the village of Gamarli....    From the speech of Vagif Abdulayev:    "I was employed for a long time in the district soviet  executive committee as head of the Labor Department, and in the  executive committee itself, as in the district party committee,  more than 70 percent of the employees were Azerbaijanis. An  ethnic cleansing campaign began after 1989. All persons of  Azerbaijani nationality were dismissed from their jobs at that  time--hospital attendants and cleaners included. Some 122  Azerbaijani drivers worked at the district machinery and tractor  pool, now not one is left! Gangs of cutthroats are active in the  district: they are rustling livestock, robbing homes, and taking  people hostage. The Svany, who have moved here from the mountain  areas, and also the Armenians, who live nearby, are  distinguished by particular brutality in their attacks on the  village and attempts on the life of the inhabitants. We have  nothing with which to defend our families: We have had to hand  over in exchange for a receipt even our hunting rifles...."    From the account of Gamid Nasibov, inhabitant of  the village of Gamarli:    "Georgia is our homeland. The graves of our ancestors are  here, this is our ancestral home. Until recently we lived with  the Georgians like brothers--we shared our joys and sorrows. But  these are different times, and we are being driven, under the  threat of death, out of hearth and home...."    From the account of the 70-year-old Khadzhar  Askerova, an inhabitant of the village of Garabulag:    "There are nine children in our family. How are we to feed  them? The village store has not had a thing for three years now.  We go 30 km to the district center and stand in line all night,  and we often cannot even get a loaf of bread. We are told: `You  are Azerbaijanis, go back where you came from. We don't have  enough to feed our own.' Today I was in luck (she shows us two  small gray hunks of bread--rock-hard to the touch and  inedible)--I came by them somehow. The assistant asked 600  coupons for them (although bread was still 50 coupons a loaf at  that time)...."    The stream of grievances and complaints about the hard life,  the lack of bread, heating, jobs, and the total social and legal  lack of protection was endless. We also saw those who were the  casualties of aggravated assaults. An 18-year-old girl had been  shot through the arm, and the bullet is still lodged in her  body. Her friend was wounded also. A bullet smashed the leg of a  kolkhoz tractor driver, and it had to be amputated because of  the danger of blood infection. All three were wounded by one and  the same person--the deputy director of a neighboring  sovkhoz--when they were returning home from work in the fields.  Unfortunately, the criminal, who caused three innocent people to  suffer, is still at liberty. And a multitude of examples of such  impunity could be cited, according to the inhabitants of the  village of Gamarli.    In the neighboring village of Yagublu we were told an even  scarier story of how gangsters took hostage a local inhabitant  by the name of Bayramov. They demanded a huge ransom, and in  order to get him to own up where the money was kept they bound  the victim and ran a red-hot iron along his bare back. Finding  the torture unendurable, the poor fellow died.    During the meeting with local inhabitants in the village of  Yagublu the state secretary was approached by the representative  of the parliament of Georgia in Dmanisskiy District. The crowd  politely gave way to let him through. "Listen to him. He is a  just man and understands us," voices were heard from all over.  Aleksandr Skachkov spoke long and convincingly:    "Unless decisive measures are adopted at the level of the  Georgian leadership, the situation could get out of control and  become unpredictable. Dmanisskiy District has long been a no  man's land abandoned to the whim of fate. Local authorities  virtually do not exist. Mafia structures and gangs are the real  master of the district. Serious crimes--homicides, rape, and  abduction--are committed on the territory of Dmanisi daily.  Fifteen people have been abducted this year alone. And 80-90  percent of the crimes committed in the district are directed  here against persons of Azerbaijani nationality. And this means  that the mafia is being backed by certain forces which are  attempting to incite interethnic conflict between Azerbaijanis  and Georgians. God grant the Dmanisskiye Azerbaijanis good  health: They are law-abiding and very patient. It is thanks only  to these qualities of theirs that the nationality issue has not  been raised once here."    All the above-mentioned difficulties are prompting the  people  of Dmanisi to a mass exodus from Georgia. The mentality of  refugees has, unfortunately, taken hold in those who are still  holding on to their native hearths. "Give us refugee status. We  have lost this land; no matter what, we can't go on living here!  We are prepared to starve and live in tents, just as long as we  can get away from here," the state secretary was told in Dmanisi.    Addressing the people, both State Secretary L.-Sh.  Gadzhiyeva  and the deputy speaker of the Georgian parliament emphasized the  impermissibility of the inflammation of this mood. Vakhtang  Rcheulishvili observed that on the territory of Dmanisskiy  District the law enforcement authorities had uncovered a 150-man  gang and that every measure would be adopted very soon to  eliminate it. "A similar situation has come about throughout the  republic," he said. "I have 34 districts in Georgia, and  everywhere I hear one and the same thing: no flour, no bread, no  fuel. A civil war is being fought in Georgia, Georgians are  killing one another. I understand your pain and share your  anger. Be patient a little longer, do not leave!"    Lala-Shovket Gadzhiyeva told the local Azerbaijanis the same  thing. She invariably emphasized in her speeches the idea that  the problem of the orgy of crime in Dmanisskiy, Marneulskiy, and  Bolnisskiy districts was a criminal, not political, problem. It  cannot be allowed to grow to the level of an interethnic  problem. "The criminal has no faith or nationality. I would  greatly implore you, therefore, to call criminals criminals and  never transfer the discussion to the plane of  Azerbaijani-Georgian relations. Remember that in the  thousand-year history of cohabitation there have never been  conflicts between Azerbaijanis and Georgians, even less should  there be such today. G.A. Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan will  not permit this, E.A. Shevardnadze will not permit this. A  policy of national discrimination might have been pursued  earlier, perhaps, under the former leadership, but the present  leadership of Georgians is attuned emphatically against  violations of human rights, against violence...."    Leaving Dmanisskiy District, the delegation set off for  Marneuli, where the state secretary was impatiently awaited by  thousands of people who had come from all around. The head of  the Azerbaijani delegation laid a wreath at the foot of the  monument to Nariman Narimanov, prominent son of our people. A  crowded meeting was then held in front of the prefecture  building.    Not long before Lala-Shovket Gadzhiyeva's visit to Georgia,  criminals had taken five Azerbaijanis hostage. This caused the  Marneuli people's cup of patience to run over. A demonstration  lasting many days began in the town square, and eight young  Azerbaijanis announced an indefinite hunger strike as a sign of  protest. The protest demonstration and hunger strike had an  effect: The leadership of the republic intervened, and four  hostages were released. The fate of Dashdamir Dashdamirov, a  leaseholder of the Marneulskiy District's village of Gadzhiis,  remained unknown as of that time.    Approximately 130,000 persons live in Marneulskiy District,  I  was told by Kamil Kiradzhzili, member of the city council and  chairman of the Ozan Society. Azerbaijanis constitute about  100,000 here. Until recently many Azerbaijanis held senior  positions in both the administrative and law enforcement  authorities, naturally. Then, with the blessing of Tbilisi  officialdom, a purge began in the district. And during the rule  of the Gamsakhurdia regime 37 names of villages were changed in  the district overnight in an attempt to conceal from posterity  their primordially Turkic origin. A familiar picture, is it not?  Did not the campaign to push Azerbaijanis from their  grandfathers' hearths in Armenia begin this way?    There are in the leadership of Georgia today, fortunately,  different people, who are sincerely concerned at the current  situation and who are doing everything they can to prevent the  situation growing to the level of interethnic conflict. They are  primarily E.A. Shevardnadze, the leader of the Georgian state,  whom Lala khanum met after the tour of Azerbaijani districts and  with whom she had a long and comprehensive conversation. She  concealed nothing from him--she spoke about people's mood, about  the orgy of crime, and about the fact that people are starving  and living in poverty and despair. She expressed an impartial  opinion concerning the head of the executive of Dmanisskiy  District, who even in the presence of herself and Deputy Speaker  V. Rcheulishvili behaved rudely and insolently with the local  population. "You can imagine how he treats the people when there  are no witnesses present!"    Having complained about the total paralysis of power and the  collapse of the state structures, E. Shevardnadze said the anger  of the Azerbaijani population was understandable and close to  him. True, he observed, life is not a bit easier in the areas  populated by Georgians. "I have just returned from Western  Georgia. People there are complaining about the same problems."  Both the state secretary and the Georgian head of state agree  that, despite the existence of colossal objective difficulties,  it is essential to make every effort so that people's hopes not  be deceived. "We are against Azerbaijanis leaving Georgia," E.  Shevardnadze said. "This is their homeland. However difficult,  we will restore order and will soon have done with the gangster  groups in these areas. It just needs for everyone to have a  little more patience...."    Following the negotiations and a head-to-head talk with E.A.  Shevardnadze, the ceremony of ratification of the Treaty on  Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Security Between Azerbaijan  and Georgia took place. The latter was signed by L.-Sh.  Gadzhiyeva, state secretary of Azerbaijan, and V. Rcheulishvili,  deputy head of the parliament of Georgia. The ceremony was  attended by E.A. Shevardnadze and officials of Azerbaijan and  Georgia.    In Tbilisi, Lala-Shovket Gadzhiyeva and the members of the  Azerbaijani delegation laid flowers at the spot in the square  where a monument to the victims of the tragedy of 9 April will  be erected.    Later in the evening the Azerbaijani delegation returned to  Baku. And two days later I learned that the leadership of  Azerbaijan had adopted the decision to send the inhabitants of  the Azerbaijani districts in Georgia vehicles carrying flour and  fuel. So that it might be easier for them to get through this  long, harsh winter.</p>

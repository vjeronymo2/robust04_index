Enterprises would have to choose one of the four following  methods to determine salary levels:    --An agreement with the local Chamber of the Treasury [Izba  Skarbowa].    --An agreement signed between the enterprise's establishing  agency and the manager--so-called managerial contract.    --Independent shaping of salary levels by the enterprise  itself, on the condition that the ratio of aggregate profit and  salary to one zloty of salary, as compared to the same kind of  ratio last year, will not deteriorate.    --Establishing salary levels based on a government-fixed  index of growth of the average monthly salary (the basis would  be provided by the average monthly salary from the second half  of 1993, or from all of 1993).    Enterprises would be forced to pay two zlotys on every zloty  over established limits. Trade union activists received the  draft this week. They now have a maximum of 30 days in which to  conduct negotiations.</p>

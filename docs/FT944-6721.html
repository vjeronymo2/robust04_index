			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (20): Pakistan fact file President: Mr Farooq Leghari. Prime Minister: Ms Benazir Bhutto, (Pakistan People's Party). POPULATION AND AREA The latest estimate is 128m. Density (per sq km) at mid-1992 was 149.6. The main cities are Karachi, Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Hyderabad, Islamabad (the capital) and Peshawar. Pakistan's land area: 796,095 sq km (307,374 sq miles). This excludes the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir. The Pakistani-held parts of this region are known in Pakistan as Azad ('Free') Kashmir, with an area of 11,639 sq km (4,494 sq miles). Northern Areas (including Gilgit and Baltistan) have an area of 72,520 sq km (28,000 sq miles). Also excluded are Junagardh and Manavadar. The population figures exclude refugees from Afghanistan (estimated to number about 3.8m). LANGUAGES Urdu is the national language. English is used extensively in all governmental and commercial circles and is used fairly widely in hotels, airports, railway stations, post offices and large stores. Basic English is taught in schools and is the medium of instruction for higher education. ETHNIC MIX The driving force behind the creation of Pakistan was religion, and 97 per cent of the population is Muslim. Of these, the majority are Sunni, the rest being Shia (15/25 per cent). There are small communities of Hindus, mainly in Sindh. There are also Christians in the main cities and Parsis in Karachi. The main ethnic groups in Pakistan are the Punjabis, the Sindhis, the Baluch and the Pathans, plus a number of small tribal groups in the more remote northern areas. The muhajirs, or refugees from India at the time of independence, who for the most part speak Urdu as their mother tongue, can also be regarded as an ethnic group. A relatively new element in the population is the Afghan refugees, mainly concentrated along the tribal areas. CURRENCY Pakistan's currency is the rupee, divided into 100 paisa. The average exchange rate of the rupee in 1994: Rs46.56 =Pounds 1; Rs30.51 = USDollars 1. The exchange rate on November 8, 1994 was Rs49.5545 to Pounds 1; Rs30.6194 to Dollars 1. Government deregulation now allows freedom of currency exchange. Visitors are advised that some false currency notes are in circulation. VISA REQUIREMENTS A valid passport is required by all visitors. All nationals of India, Afghanistan, South Africa, Bangladesh, Iran, plus any country not recognised by Pakistan must have a visa. Israeli passport holders are not permitted entry. Tourists from most other countries need a visa only if they wish to stay for more than 30 days. Nationals of a few countries may stay up to 90 days without a visa. Check with the Pakistan Embassy or consulate in your own country. Visas are not issued at entry points. In some circumstances visas can be extended for short periods by applying to Passport Offices in Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar or Quetta. However both the rules and the practice are subject to change without warning. Visitors are restricted from certain areas, such as parts of NWFP, Baluchistan and the Northern Tribal Agencies, are not open to tourists without special permission. The cost of visas is variable according to the nationality of the applicant and the type of visa applied for. Arrangements for visa application and collection vary from office to office, and should be confirmed by phone with the relevant office.

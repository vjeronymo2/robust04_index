'Urayqat spoke  with reporter Mark Weiss after the Jabalyah incident.    [Begin recording] ['Urayqat] Well, I think Mr. Rabin has  decided to move massacres from one place to another. It seems  to me that Palestinian lives are not that important and of no  value to what authorities of the Israeli Government are  concerned. [sentence as heard] I think the incidents in Hebron,  the incidents in Jabalyah today [28 March] are grave. Is this  Mr. Rabin's response to our demands to have international  protection? Is this Mr. Rabin's response to us, when we urged so  many times that this unnecessary use of violence, this  unnecessary escalation conducted by the Army must stop? We  think just this stresses our point that until we have effective  international protection, I think there is no sense in going  ahead with the peace talks.    [Weiss] And what do you think the correct Palestinian  response should be to the killing of these Fatah activists?    ['Urayqat] The killing of Palestinians, irrespective of  their affiliations, is something of a grave consequence; it is  something that we take very, very seriously. Human Palestinian  lives are really very, very important to us. And, Mr. Rabin is  deciding on the ground the fate of the peace process, which in  my honest opinion, is coming to its end.    [Weiss] Would you support a postponement or a total  withdrawal of the Palestinian team from the Cairo talks?    ['Urayqat] I think that even if they go on talking in Cairo,  unless they can get an Israeli commitment to evacuate the  settlers from Hebron, I think if they cannot get a commitment to  a genuine, effective international protection for the  Palestinian people, I think these negotiations will be of no  value.

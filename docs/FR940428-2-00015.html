The meeting will be held at the Office of Naval Research, 800 North Quincy Street, Ballston Center Tower One, room 915, Arlington, Virginia. The first session will commence at 8:30 a.m. and terminate at 5 p.m. on May 3; the second session will commence at 8:30 a.m. and terminate at 5 p.m. on May 4; and the third session will commence at 8 a.m. and terminate at 4 p.m. on May 5, 1994. All sessions of the meeting will be open to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the meeting is to provide the Department of the Navy with an assessment of the importance of high fidelity models and Advanced Distributed Simulation technologies to enhance Department of the Navy test and evaluation, and acquisition programs. The panel will evaluate current utilization of modeling and simulation; identify specific programs that would benefit from an investment in modeling and simulation; identify specific areas and/or programs that are good candidates for demonstration projects to evaluate the effect of available capabilities of Advanced Distributed Simulation; evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of Advanced Distributed Simulation technologies and relevant modeling from a Department of the Navy perspective; and recommend specific research areas related to Advanced Distributed Simulation technologies and relevant modeling that warrant investments by the Department of the Navy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The meeting will include briefings and discussions relating to modeling and simulation management initiatives and challenges from the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office, Advanced Research Projects Agency, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Air Force, Office of Naval Research, and Center for Naval Analyses; Global Grid; current operational test and evaluation policy and procedures, and developmental test and evaluation policy and procedures and future applications for modeling and simulation technologies in the Department of Defense; the application of modeling and simulation technologies to joint war fighting; and the Joint Advanced Distributed Simulation Feasibility Study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This Notice is being published late because of administrative delays which constitute an exceptional circumstance, not allowing Notice to be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at least 15 days before the date of the meeting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further information concerning this meeting contact:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commander R.

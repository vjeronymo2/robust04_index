			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Knight's role cut in Murdoch empire Mr Andrew Knight, once designated as Mr Rupert Murdoch's chosen successor in the event of emergency, has given up the executive chairmanship of News International. The former editor of The Economist will in future only be chairman of the company that holds Mr Murdoch's UK interests. Mr Gus Fischer, managing director of News International, will become chief executive. News International, which has interests ranging from five national newspapers in the UK to a 50 per cent stake in British Sky Broadcasting, made it clear that the change of title would give Mr Fischer 'executive oversight of News International'. As a result the chairman would be free 'to concentrate on the corporate interests of the company'. News International said yesterday that the new title followed the changes in function that had in effect already happened. Mr Fischer who also remains chief operating officer of the main Murdoch corporate vehicle News Corporation will continue to run News International on a day-to-day basis. Mr Knight will concentrate on relations with government and other companies and with regulatory issues. In 1990 Mr Murdoch said Mr Knight would be his successor until his children grew up 'if I should turn out to be mortal'. The News Corp chairman and chief executive said last year that nothing had changed 'except that the children are older'. In October Mr Murdoch said his wife Anna would act as non-executive chairman in an emergency. There was no mention of Mr Knight.</p>

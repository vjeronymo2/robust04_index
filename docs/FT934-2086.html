			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper recovery 'unlikely before 1995' The copper market will have to wait until 1995 before a substantial increase in demand and a drawdown of stocks will cause a marked rebound in prices, according to Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. Analysts Karen Foster and Angus MacMillan suggest copper supply will outpace demand by 275,000 tonnes this year after a 75,000-tonne surplus in 1992. They predict a further 150,000-tonnes surplus next year but a 200,000 supply deficit in 1995. This should take the average London Metal Exchange cash copper price, which reached 104 US cents a pound last year, down to 88 cents in 1993 and to 80 cents in 1994. The analysts suggest the price will get back to Dollars 1 a pound in 1995. In a special copper market review, Billiton forecasts that copper consumption in the western world will slip from 9m tonnes last year to 8.975m tonnes this year before climbing to a record 9.175m tonnes in 1994 and 9.75m in 1995. Meanwhile, supply in the west is expected to grow from 9m tonnes this year to 9.1m tonnes in 1994 and to 9.35m tonnes in 1995. The analysts suggest the west will remain a substantial importer of copper from Poland and the Commonwealth of Independent States - of 250,000 tonnes this year, 225,000 tonnes next year and 200,000 tonnes in 1995 - and this will help to create the supply surplus. They also point out that between the end-1992 and end-1996 nearly 900,000 tonnes of new smelting capacity is expected to come into operation, representing an increase of roughly 10 per cent to western world capacity.

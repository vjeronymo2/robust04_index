			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> W&amp;M COACH OPTS NOT TO TAKE BC POST  </P> <P> Jimmye Laycock changed his mind overnight and will not leave William &amp; Mary  to become football coach at Boston College, BC Athletic Director Chet Gladchuck  said today.  </P> <P> Gladchuck said Laycock called him at 5:30 this morning and said he had been up  all night with his family and that leaving William &amp; Mary would be too  difficult for him and his family.  </P> <P> "I'm surprised, but nevertheless I've seen it happen before at this level,"  Gladchuck said.  </P> <P> At a news conference today in Williamsburg, Laycock said: "Boston College and  the people there were outstanding. After assessing the situation, my decision  to remain in Williamsburg is based purely on personal grounds."  </P> <P> Laycock, a 1970 William &amp; Mary graduate, had resigned Wednesday after 11  years as head coach.  </P> <P> "We're obviously pleased that Jimmye will continue his leadership of our  football program," said John Randolph, William &amp; Mary's athletic director.  </P> <P> Said Gladchuck: "I can't control a man's emotions, and that's what happened in  this case. I respect his loyalty. . . . I would never, ever criticize a man for  putting his family first. That's what Jimmye has done, and I respect him."  </P> <P> Laycock, 42, has led William &amp; Mary into the Division I-AA playoffs in  three of the past five years.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOUR PALESTINIANS KILLED, 35 HURT IN OCCUPIED AREAS  </P> <P> Four Palestinians were killed Saturday and 35 were injured in some of the  bloodiest outbreaks of anti-Israeli violence in the occupied territories,  according to Arab and Israeli reports.  </P> <P> The army confirmed four dead and nine wounded. It said two Palestinians were  killed in clashes with soldiers in the occupied Gaza Strip. The bodies of two  others found in Gaza were apparently killed after being suspected of  collaborating with Israel, Arab reports and Israeli media said.  </P> <P> After new unrest erupted, Israeli authorities imposed curfews on all refugee  camps in the Gaza Strip and on several towns, affecting 400,000 Gaza residents.  </P> <P> About 400 Palestinians have been killed in the 15-month uprising against  Israeli rule. Fifteen Israelis also have died.  </P> <P> Also Saturday, about 60 Israeli peace activists, including three rabbis,  traveled to the West Bank town of Beit Sahour, where they discussed peace with  dozens of Palestinians over plates of chicken and salad, witnesses said.  </P> <P> The activists of the "Peace Now" movement said they sought to prove "dialogue  between Israelis and Palestinians is possible when the government and the army  do not interfere."  </P> <P> The body of one alleged collaborator, Jamel Abdel Hamid Nadi, was found  Saturday behind a school in Gaza City's Rimal Quarter with multiple stab wounds  and signs of beatings, Arab reports said.  </P> <P> The reports said graffiti reportedly scribbled on a wall near Nadi's home and  signed by an Islamic fundamentalist group, claimed he had been killed for  cooperating with the Israelis.  </P> <P> The other body, found in Rafah in southern Gaza, was identified as Subhi Hamdan  Elsoufi, 21. Arab reports said Elsoufi was killed as a collaborator.  </P> <P> Israel television and radio also said both were killed on suspicion of  collaborating with Israel.  </P> <P> But the army denied either were collaborators and said that an investigation  into their deaths showed "the men were killed as a result of an internal feud  of a criminal nature."  </P> <P> The two other deaths were in Rafah and Khan Yunis in the Gaza Strip, where  soldiers opened fire on stone-throwing protesters, fatally wounding Ashraf Abu  Jazar, 17, and Adli Erbea, 22, Arab reports said.  </P> <P> It was one of the highest daily casualty tolls in the rebellion .  </P></p>

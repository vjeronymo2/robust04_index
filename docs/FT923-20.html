			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Finland (9): Harmony restored - Bank governor and the government DR Sirkka Hamalainen, the 53-year-old governor of the Bank of Finland since last April, has the toughest job in Finland at the moment. She - perhaps more than anybody else in the country - recognises the fragility of its economic position amid today's turbulent international money markets. 'No central bank alone can pursue a fixed exchange rate policy,' she argues. Without the close support of the government, it lacks the authority to maintain its commitment no matter how independent the central bank may be in theory. The government and the central bank must work in harmony on the same policy objectives to have any hope of success. Over the past 15 months, however, differences have emerged between the two institutions. Dr Hamalainen's predecessor, Mr Rolf Kullberg, fought a rearguard action against the pressures that grew up in parts of industry and government in support of devaluation. He failed to hold the line last November when the markka was devalued but his arguments lost none of their force early this year as it became clear that the devaluation had not ended the problem but indeed may have actually made it worse. The public disagreement between Mr Aho and Mr Kullberg in April did much to undermine what little faith remained in the markets about Finland's economic strategy. Mr Kullberg's resignation suggested that the central bank could not withstand political pressures. For her part, Dr Hamalainen insists that 'floating the markka is not a good solution'. She says: 'A fixed exchange rate is the best way to guarantee stable economic decision-making'. The September 8 decision to float was the result of what she calls 'a credibility problem'. The markets refused to believe the Finnish government was serious about its intention to tackle its budget deficit. 'The reason we floated the markka was because we did not see any changes coming in the factors that had brought about the lack of credibility,' Dr Hamalainen explains diplomatically. She has in mind the absence of any national wage agreement between employers and trade unions for 1993 as well as government decisions to reduce their spending drastically. 'Markets in today's uncertainties do not believe in words, they want to see deeds,' she explains. The central bank has come under some criticism for its decision to float without appearing to put up much of a struggle to maintain the markka's fixed exchange rate. But she asserts that it was clear from the onset that they would not be able to withstand the pressures from the market as Finland's capital reserves shrank alarmingly through July and August. In her opinion Finns are not going back to days of poverty but to the more balanced economy that existed in the early 1980s before the huge growth in the public sector. 'There must be structural cuts in spending,' Dr Hamalainen insists. But this does not mean Finland will have to destroy its welfare state to please the international markets. Both the government and the central bank want to see the open industrial sector grow again to around 30 per cent of Finland's gross domestic product from its current level of 20 per cent. She also points out that it only needs a 2 per cent real cut in spending programmes combined with an annual growth rate of 2 per cent to ensure that Finland meets the criteria laid down by the European Community at Maastricht last November for membership of the European Monetary Union. The floating of the markka displeased Brussels and it appeared to signal to the outside world that Finland was too ready to break out of even its own self-imposed constraints such as the linkage of the markka to the Ecu if it believed it was necessary to do so in its own national interest. Dr Hamalainen argues that floating was 'less aggressive' to the EC than a straight devaluation. She believes that her country needs an external discipline to pursue tighter fiscal policies. It is hoped to return the markka to the Ecu basket as soon as possible when the markets have settled down. But as the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development argued in its annual survey on Finland at the end of August, the loss of credibility suffered as a result of the November devaluation 'demonstrates the need for a consistent medium-term strategy designed, in particular, to introduce further discipline in fiscal policy and wage formation'. Until this has been achieved, the markka may well have to go on floating. In the weeks ahead Dr Hamalainen may not only have to keep her nerve but also adopt a stern and unbending attitude towards the government's budgetary strategy. She is anxious to make clear that no division of opinion exists any longer between the central bank and the government on what needs to be done to restore international confidence in the Finnish currency. But it is going to need a consistent and perhaps even forceful reassertion by the governor of the dangers of any more half-hearted or toothless efforts to please the markets with limited cuts. Not prone to the melodramatic, she is well aware of the gravity of Finland's position. The central bank's austere message appears to have got through to the politicians as well. As custodian of the country's vulnerable currency Dr Hamalainen is in a strong position to put some backbone into the government in the coming weeks. If she fails, the prospects for Finland are grim.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wilfredo G. Reyes] </F>   [Text] The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP)  breakaway Manila-Rizal Regional Committee (MRRC), the Visayas  Commission, "and other rejectionist groups" have expressed  willingness to engage government in exploratory talks.    In launching the Free Lagman Movement (FILEMON) yesterday at  the University of the Philippines PCED [expansion unknown]  Hostel, Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman disclosed his detained brother,  acknowledged MRRC Chairman Filemon Lagman, had expressed  willingness to represent the MRRC, the Visayas Commission, "and  other rejectionist groups" in exploratory talks with government  once he is released from jail.    It will be recalled former National Unification Commission  Chairman Haydee Yorac had lamented government could not begin  talks with the CPP opposition forces so long as they were not  united and did not declare their willingness to participate in  the peace process as a separate entity from the mainstream CPP  forces under Netherlands-based Jose Maria [Joma] Sison.    "The problem government is facing right now is (how) to make  a policy decision to release my brother, because when I last  talked to my brother, he said his group is now willing to engage  government in exploratory talks, with the possibility of  developing into formal talks," the Albay congressman said.    "Of course, initiation of these talks will be premised on  two  circumstances: first is his release, because you cannot talk  peace from a detention cell, and the second is that government  is itself willing to talk peace," he added.    Visayas Commission Chairman Arturo Tabara concurred with Mr.  Lagman's views, saying "Ine-express namin ang aming openness at  willingness na makipag-usap sa gobyerno, pero dapat muna nilang  palitan ang kanilang patakaran na makipag-usap lamang sa puwersa  ni Joma (Sison) [We are expressing our openness and willingness  to talk with the government, but their policy of talking only  with the forces of Joma (Sison) should be replaced]."    "Interesado kami sa isang negotiated political settlement,  ngunit dapat munang patunayan ng gobyerno na iaaddress nila ang  mga root causes ng conflict [We are interested in a negotiated  political settlement, but the government has to prove first that  they will address the root causes of the conflict]."    Mr. Tabara lamented government continued to deal exclusively  with the mainstream forces even if "the opposition represents a  sizable force with both party members and seven (New People's  Army) companies."    Mr. Lagman agreed, saying: "Government has been talking with  Sison for how many years now, and still has nothing to show in  the way of substantial progress."    "Why is this government so concerned against hurting the  sentiments of the reaffirmist (Mr. Sison's) group by (not)  talking with the rejectionists, if this group is not afraid of  hurting government's sentiments?"    The MRRC circulated an official statement, signed by MRRC  Chief Carlos Forte (reputed to be Filemon Lagman's pseudonym),  which said, "We condemn government's position of excluding  so-called CPP factions in entering into peace talks with them."    "The Ramos regime knows for sure that the Sison and  (National  Democratic Front vice-chairman for international affairs Luis)  Jalandoni-led CPP panel does not represent the entire  revolutionary forces in the country," the statement said.    "It has long been disowned by the autonomous Visayas  Commission of the CPP and now by the equally autonomous MRRC of  the CPP," the MRRC continued, adding, "Our openness to enter  into peace dialogue with government is not in exchange for  Lagman's release."    "First, it is our way of recognizing that revolution does  not  automatically mean war, and that a negotiated political  settlement could also be effective in realizing a substantial  part of our revolutionary program," they continued. "Second, it  is also our way of recognizing the people's clamor to pursue far  less bloody and violent means to attain their demands."    Mr. Tabara implied a negotiated political settlement with  the  MRRC would automatically include the Alex Boncayao Brigade  (ABB), referring to the urban partisan unit as "the ABB of the  Manila-Rizal region."    Earlier, the Lagman brothers and the MRRC had disavowed any  link to the ABB, which has engaged in assassination campaigns  against government counterinsurgency officials and suspected  criminals.</p>

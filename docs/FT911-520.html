			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / The Long View: Major's options grow fewer IT SEEMS appropriate that Margaret Thatcher should have chosen Vanity Fair as a vehicle for unloading some of her frustrations this week. For others, the memories of pride and the passion have faded almost six months after she was ousted and John Major took over at Number Ten Downing Street. But now the political temperature is climbing again as the general election options begin to pass their expiration dates one by one. Next Thursday's Monmouth by-election will presumably hammer the final nail into the coffin of a June poll, but it will be much more difficult for the Government to pass up the chance of an October or early November election, however unpromising the opinion polls might look at the time. The downwards distortion of the headline inflation rate will be at its maximum during the late summer and autumn, and there should be scope for several more small cuts in mortgage rates by then. The government will be able to keep repeating its prediction that the economy will turn upwards around the middle of the year, with precious few statistics published by October to allow the claims to be proved one way or the other: the next official forecast does not have to come out until November, and an earlier election might spare some Treasury blushes and fudges. True, unemployment will be rising rapidly through the summer, at perhaps 50,000-60,000 a month, but the jobless figures did little visible damage to the Tories in 1983 and 1987, and anyway unemployment will almost inevitably rise until well into 1992 so it has little relevance to election timing. Clinging on for a full five-year term has proved a losing gamble in the past. It did not save Sir Alec Douglas-Home in 1964, and sitting tight for a fifth winter was the undoing of James Callaghan in 1979. But historically it has proved very difficult for the Labour Party to win power at the polls at the first attempt, except in the remarkable circumstances of 1945. Harold Wilson needed two elections in 1964 and 1966 in order to achieve a working majority, and another two elections in 1974 in order to achieve any kind of majority at all. Now it appears that Labour will need a national swing of more than 8 per cent compared with the 1987 result if it is to gain a Commons majority. Quite possibly it will once again require two general elections before a clear mandate will be given to either party. For the first time these uncertainties will need to be managed in the context of full membership of the European Monetary System. There is much less scope for taking any strain on sterling on the exchange rate: and if City nervousness about a Labour victory should put pressure on the pound the cure - a rise in interest rates - would only put the Conservatives into a worse mess. However, we could presumably look to our friends in Europe for support: and there is no evidence that moderate left-wing governments cause anxieties elsewhere in the EMS. Moderate is the key word here; the pendulum nature of British politics is reasserting itself, for example in the choice between top marginal income tax rates of 40 per cent and 59 per cent, whereas the 50 per cent or so which might be a reasonable consensus choice in Europe is apparently not on offer to the British electorate. Inevitably, after 12 years, Conservative policies have created some hostages to fortune. Top businessmen's pay rises have created great resentment without generating the economic miracle which might have legitimised them. Indeed, market capitalism ought to be much more secure in Britain than it now is, hiding increasingly behind the oxymoron of the social market. Margaret Thatcher notably failed to desocialise attitudes to medical treatment in Britain, as can be seen in the current row over London hospitals which have discovered that they are uneconomic in a mildly competitive situation. Few tears are shed when banking and insurance jobs are shifted out of the capital to more efficient locations but in medicine, it seems, benefits are measured by the volume of spending rather than output, and by unions rather than by patients. John Major can nevertheless claim some modest economic achievements. In the past six months sterling has held its position within the EMS with unexpected ease and interest rates have come down by 2 percentage points. By next week he will be able to point to a fall in inflation, however contrived, from 10.9 to little more than 6 per cent. The stock market has climbed some 18 per cent, as measured by the FT-SE 100 Index. However, the cost of the improvement in monetary stability in terms of lost jobs and reduced output and consumption has been severe. And the continued existence of suppressed inflation within the system can be judged by the persistence of a balance of payments deficit even within an economy which has shrunk by possibly 3 per cent over the past year: domestic suppliers are still not competitive with their overseas counterparts even when operating well below capacity in a slack labour market. Should the markets fear Labour? The individuals making up those markets are, of course, personally vulnerable to higher taxes, which will affect their views, but that is not quite the same thing. On policies the history books are confusing. The anti-profit controls of the 1970s were actually invented by the Conservatives. The Labour administration was a big borrower in 1974-79, but its predecessor in 1964-70 actually balanced the budget. Much of the severe inflation of the mid-70s was the fault of Edward Heath's Tory Government. However, the reputation of Labour for devaluation sticks more firmly, in 1967 and in 1976 (when sterling depreciated by approaching a fifth). Devaluation, now repackaged as realignment, will be a hidden agenda item in the coming election, but it will be there nevertheless. It cannot help Margaret Thatcher's vanity, but it is fair that sterling interest rates still need to include a risk premium.</p>

Currently, a delegation of the U.S.  Senate Energy and Natural Resources Commission [as heard] is in  Hanoi. Here is our radio editor's opinion:    From now to the middle of January, five United States  delegations will come to Vietnam. They will represent large  United States companies such as IBM and General Motors, and  include the delegation of the Defense Subcommittee of the United  States Senate, a delegation of the Asia-Pacific Subcommittee of  the U.S. House of Representatives led by Russell Wilson, a  delegation under Senator John Kerry, and a delegation led by  Admiral Charles Larson, commander-in-chief of the U.S.  Asia-Pacific command.    According to Western news agencies, the delegations will  visit Vietnam to find out possibilities of cooperation and for a  precise assessment of the renovation process in Vietnam.  Through their visits, they expect to make a recommendation to  President Clinton to remove the 20-year-long economic embargo  against Vietnam.    United States Senator Bennett Johnston, head of a delegation  from the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Commission,  last Saturday [8 January] called on the United States President  to remove the embargo. He said in Hanoi that it was time to  close the door on the past and move toward normalizing of  relations and cooperation. Speaking to a REUTERS correspondent  in Hanoi, he hoped the U.S. President would quickly remove the  sanction against Vietnam.    Senator Don Nickles, a Republican Party member of the same  delegation, also said he wants the United States President to  lift the embargo.    The voice of the United States politicians demanding the  lifting of the embargo will become stronger in 1994. The  American delegations to visit Vietnam in the coming days will  surely have the same voice as the delegation of Senator Johnston.    It is an issue President Clinton has to consider and solve.</p>

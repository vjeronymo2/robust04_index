			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE BEAT: 'WEEKEND' AT POWERHOUSE; ONE-ACTS AT THEATER OF NOTE; 'MEN DIE  SOONER' AT CAST; 'PLAYROOM' AT RAPPORT  </P> <P> David and Doe have gathered the scattered remains of a far-flung flock to their  home near Madison, Wis. It's a stormy weekend in 1979 and the low rumble of  thunder echoes through Kathleen Tolan's "A Weekend Near Madison" at the  Powerhouse Theater.  </P> <P> "Madison" is bound by nostalgia to its roots in the late '60s. Its characters  are testimony to failed dreams and compromise, and ache with being  thirtysomething.  </P> <P> Poor kids.  </P> <P> Tolan's ideas are firm and her dialogue sings with honesty about her  characters, but the play has the looseness of its period and its success in  this production is due to its execution.  </P> <P> Director Andy Fickman knows the sound and soul of the play, hears its resonance  and the zig-zag rhythms of its dialogue. His cast is in on the game too,  hitting each mark in the music with unerring accuracy. They know how to make an  ordinary play extraordinary.  </P> <P> Andrew Shaifer is intuitive in finding the soft spots in the character of  David's brother Jim, an art gallery assistant who wants to recapture a lost  romance but not at the price he is given. David's wife, Doe, is a network of  hurt and hope in the performance of Jodi Kavanaugh. Joe Plewa as David and Jill  Kiblinger as Jim's ex, now enraptured with her folk-singing partner Samantha,  echo the loss of earlier fire.  </P> <P> Where have all the flowers gone? To suburbia.  </P> <P>  At 3116 2nd St., Santa Monica, Thursdays through Sundays, 8 p.m., until Oct.  19. Tickets: $15; (213) 466-1767.  </P> <P> 'Palmdale', 'Arroyo Rep'  </P> <P> The Theater of NOTE is back with two one-acts of varying quality and interest.  </P> <P> The opener, "Palmdale," is a slice of life about goings-on in the high desert.  It's as paper-thin as prosciutto. Cheryl Slean's play, directed forthrightly by  Marianne Simon, concerns Acey, a young woman played by the playwright, who has  learned to read palms and wants to move to the big hamlet to follow her dream.  The stock characters include an honestly romantic Chad Einbinder as her  boyfriend Eddie, a delightfully rambunctious Shannon Pingrin as her tomboy  sister Iris, and a well-defined mother played by Debora Roventini. Philip  Sokoloff looks only uncomfortable as the traveling sucker Juan, who gets his  palm read by way of practice.  </P> <P> More notable is the second half of the bill, Grubb Graebner's "Arroyo Repo."  John Callahan and Doug Burch portray scroungy desert rats out to make a  killing, in a play that's a Sam Shepard clone, saved by Bob Kip's vaudevillian  direction and the wild and crazy performances of its two protagonists.  </P> <P> They dredge up all sorts of detritus, including tires and a free-wheeling  wench, from a dangerous ditch near their shack. They also find great dollops of  humor and insight about the human condition. The play has little to say but  chuckles a lot (the TV doesn't work but they watch it anyway), particularly in  Burch's inventive performance as the incorrigible Rave.  </P> <P>  At 1761 N. Vermont Ave., Wednesdays and Thursdays, 8 p.m., through Oct. 5.  Tickets: $12.50; (213) 664-0689.  </P> <P> 'Men Die Sooner'  </P> <P> Guys have a rough life. And statistics seem to back up the premise of Tom  Cayler's one-man performance piece "Men Die Sooner" at the Cast Theater -- but  why?  </P> <P> Cayler and his co-writers Kay Cummings (who also directed) and Clarice Marshall  (who staged Cayler's movement) have some explanations as they explore the life  of a generic male from childhood to terminal panic.  </P> <P> Their stance is Benchley-esque and the lecture Cayler delivers is as spare and  satirical as "The Treasurer's Report." When he steps away from the lecturer as  his own exhibit No. 1, to check his heartbeat, to jog, to force his subject  into an escalating cacophony of movement, each gesture and pose is as  meaningful as the pat words of the lecturer.  </P> <P> It's a thin piece, and short, but that very thinness is its strength and the  root of its humor. And the charts (by Pier Voulkos) that the lecturer uses to  help visualize his points are as funny in their loony abstraction as is the  lecturer himself.  </P> <P> "Men don't cry," he says, on the way to heart attack and stroke ("Sauce  Bernaise Syndrome"), but fortunately they can laugh at what fools these mortals  be.  </P> <P>  At 804 N. El Centro Ave., Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 8 p.m., through Oct. 4.  Tickets: $12; (213) 462-0265.  </P> <P> 'The Playroom'  </P> <P> Mary Drayton's odd little play about a discomfitted Manhattan teen-ager who  decides to kidnap her new stepsister has a lot of promise, but the period  writing makes it look like "The Bad Seed Meets Corliss Archer" and the B-movie  dialogue and B-movie direction by Gregory Black defeat most of the actors.  </P> <P> An attic room in New York's Montana apartments is the focal point in Judy's  misfired attempt at getting attention. But it's the only focal point in Theater  Rapport's misfired production of a mediocre play that doesn't even come within  shouting distance of its possibilities.  </P> <P> Phoebe Farber as the nasty kid who starts it all, and Greg Safel as her  conniving boyfriend almost make their plot believable. But the rest of the  company unravels the loose threads of this dated fabric.  </P> <P>  At 1277 N. Wilton Place, Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., through Oct. 13.  Tickets: $14; (213) 285-8170.  </P> <P> </P></p>

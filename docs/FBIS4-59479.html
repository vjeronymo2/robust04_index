			<p>BFN     [Text] The Palestinian police commander in Jericho, Major  General Hajj 'Isma'il, says the policeman whose gun killed a  Palestinian boy yesterday and critically wounded his aunt, will  be courtmartialed for negligence. Latest reports say the  nine-year-old boy 'Amr 'Abid was accidentally shot dead by his  brother, who was playing with the policeman's gun. Witnesses  said earlier the boy was accidentally killed by a Palestinian  policeman.    General 'Isma'il said PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat had called  on the police to press forward with the investigation and make  the findings public. Police said the boy would receive an  official funeral with a police escort. Police officers who  tried to pay a condolence call on the bereaved family were  rebuffed by angry relatives.</p>

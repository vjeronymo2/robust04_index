			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Observer: Lung arm of the law Is next year's French Grand Prix about to go up in smoke? The answer, breathlessly awaited by not only motor-racing interests but tobacco companies, is due next Tuesday from an appeal court meeting in Rennes. Directly at stake is almost Pounds 4m imposed in fines on Renault and the Williams grand prix team for breaking France's strict law against tobacco advertising on television. The ruling, against which they have appealed, was made by a court in the small western town of Quimper. But the fate of the 1993 Grand Prix also hangs on the Rennes court's decision. The French motor-racing authority's president Jean-Marie Balestre has said no attempt will be made to organise the race unless the appeal is upheld, with a pronouncement exempting racing teams carrying such advertising from punishment. Although the law is scheduled to be toughened further on January 1, a measure of its present strictness is that the Williams team's transgressions did not take place in France. It was fined Pounds 300,000 for entering cars bearing Camel cigarette logos in the Japanese Grand Prix, knowing the race would be shown on French screens. Then another Pounds 3m was added for a repeat occurrence in the equivalent event in Australia last month. France's national TV company, TFI, faces court action for televising the races. Moreover the same anti-tobacco crusaders who filed suit against Renault and Williams have won a similar ruling from the same Quimper court against Citroen and Mitsubishi for similar offences in the similarly televised Paris-Peking rally. As for next week's appeal, the British team's head Frank Williams says he's confident of winning. If the decision goes the other way, however, the reverberations could spread far beyond motor-racing. For example, given any further economy measure in Britain's seagoing forces, newspapers selling in France might be wise to avoid headlining the story 'Navy cut.'</p>

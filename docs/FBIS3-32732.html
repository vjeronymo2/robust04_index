			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Carlos Torres y Torres Lara, first vice president of  the CCD, this evening denounced the U.S. President's statement  in connection with the Law on Venue Dispute. He said the  statement represents interference in the country's internal  affairs. Torres y Torres Lara held a news conference in which  he decried U.S. President Bill Clinton's statements in  connection with the implementation of the Law on Venue Dispute,  which deals with the La Cantuta case. He also said he rejects  the attack perpetrated against Deputy Chu Meriz's home.    [Begin Torres y Torres Lara recording] I deeply deplore the  statement released by President Clinton's administration, a  friendly nation -- meaning the U.S. people -- in a way that it  represents direct interference in Peru's internal affairs. We  may err in Peru, and we may err many times, but we cannot allow,  just as the United States would not allow, statements to be made  regarding our internal affairs. This is very deplorable. [end  recording]    Moreover, Torres y Torres Lara said the Penal Court made its  decision with complete independence. He added that the CCD will  closely monitor the trial, which will now take place in a  military court and should yield its first results within a month.    [Begin Torres y Torres Lara recording] Our concern and  decision to monitor the case is compelled by our desire to  ensure that the military court fulfills its duty by drastically  punishing those responsible. We will closely follow the case so  that it does not turn out as other cases have on various  occasions in other governments, meaning that neither a civilian  nor a military venue punished the crime. The CCD will be fully  provided with the necessary means to guarantee that justice  prevails in Peru, whether through a civilian or a military  venue. [end recording]</p>

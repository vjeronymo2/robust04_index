According to Lecsy Tejeda, president of the National Stage  Arts Council, a long and varied list of creators, including  poets Dulce Maria Loynaz (winner of the Cervantes literature  prize) and Eliseo Diego and the musicians Leo Brouwer and  Gonzalo Rubalcaba received international awards last year.    Prima ballerina Alicia Alonso, theater playwright Abelardo  Estorino, film directors Alfredo Guevara and Tomas Gutierrez  Alea, and cartoonist Roberto Fabelo also received important  distinctions.    Other artists in less mentioned fields such as applied arts  and the circus also received awards.    Despite the difficult economic situation in the country,  which has compelled the government to eliminate or drastically  reduce budgets, Cuban culture has been particularly productive  during the past 12 months.    If the international awards are categorized by field, Tejada  said, the plastic arts are at the head (42), followed by film  making (33), theater arts (19), music (12), and literature (10).    In Tejada's opinion, the National Art Education System  deserves a special mention because 23 of the people awarded are  still students at its specialized centers yet they stood out for  their talent and solid education.    To honor all those personalities -- both those who are  established professionals as well as the newcomers -- there will  be an art gala at the National Theater in Havana on 11 February.  A complete rundown of the 1993 awards will be presented at that  event.</p>

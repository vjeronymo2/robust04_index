			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard introduces new 'palmtop' PC HEWLETT-Packard has introduced a pocket-sized personal computer that can send and receive electronic messages as well as run standard PC programs. It is one of the first products to reach the market in what is expected to become a fast-expanding market for 'personal communicat-ors'. The 100LX is H-P's second 'palmtop' computer. It has already sold 'well over 200,000' of the earlier version, introduced two years ago, which does not have the built-in communications capabilities of the new model. H-P has taken an early lead in a field that is expected to expand rapidly with the entrance of competitors such as Apple Computer, with its much heralded 'Newton', as well as AT&amp;T, IBM and Compaq Computer. The 11-ounce 100LX 'palmtop' PC is designed for executives who use electronic mail to keep in touch with their offices and to access information on office computers. The US list price will be Dollars 749. Software built into the 100LX includes a version of Lotus Development's popular electronic mail program.</p>

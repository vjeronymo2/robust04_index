In the first nine months of 1993,  the republic experienced 7628 cases and 300 deaths, a 3.5-fold  increase over the previous year (Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 4  Dec 93). By year's end authorities had recorded 15,229 cases,  4503 of them in children, and 468 deaths. The first two months  of 1994 saw 4000 new cases and 100 deaths (Moscow RABOCHAYA  TRIBUNA 16 Apr 94). Experts consider the main cause of the  epidemic to be a low vaccination rate, resulting from public  concerns about vaccine safety (Moscow TRUD 1 Jul 93, Moscow  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 4 Dec 93).  <F P=103> 11111111 </F> <F P=104>  [RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA 16 Apr 94, etc.]  [Editorial Report] During 1993, Russia experienced an unusually </F>  high incidence of diphtheria.

Neither the country's stocks of diphtheria vaccine nor  its production capabilities were adequate to support the  immunization program (Moscow MEDITSINA SEGODNYA No. 21-22 1993).  Consequently, at the Center's prompting, the government  allocated funds to purchase foreign vaccines and develop  domestic production (Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 9 Nov 93, Moscow  MEDITSINA SEGODNYA No. 21-22 93, Moscow RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA 16 Apr  94).</p>

The fishermen are claiming that Norway  is handing over the control over its fish resources to the EU  [European Union]. Farmers are angry because the systems of  economic support for agriculture are being cut.    It is fish that has been the major obstacle for Norway in  the  membership negotiations. Fisheries Minister Jan Henry T. Olsen,  generally called "No-Fish Henry," stated even before the  negotiations began that he did not have a single fish to give  away.    But in the course of the negotiations the fisheries minister  has had to give away a fish or two -- in the end totaling 4,000  tonnes for Spain and Portugal.    Similarly "No-Fish Henry" promised that Norway would retain  control over the fish resources in Norwegian seas. However, the  final outcome was that the fishing waters north of the 62d  parallel will be managed by the EU from 1 July 1998. However,  Norway has received political assurances from the EU that the  current Norwegian management regime will continue to apply in  the future too. This means in practice that the EU will take  over the body of Norwegian regulations.    Norway will also have duty-free access to the European  market  for its fish products. This will apply from day one of  Norwegian membership.    But fishermen in Norway are very dissatisfied with the  results of the negotiations, and Einar Hepsoe, the leader of the  Association of Norwegian Fishermen, said:    "The agreement was worse than I hade been fearing from the  outset. We have lost on all important points. Norway has given  away its management rights and control over fish resources."    However, representatives of the fish industry think that the  agreement is a good one. It gives Norway good opportunities for  the export of fish products to the European market.    Agriculture has been the other major bone of contention for  Norway in the negotiations. The agreement gives three different  types of support for Norwegian agriculture. These are support  for agriculture north of the 62d parallel, support for  "difficult" areas (mountainous regions and the like), and  support for environmentally friendly agriculture. In addition,  Norway has been forced to accept EU prices for agricultural  produce from the first day of membership.    Farmers' and the food industry's organizations are deeply  dissatisfied with the agreement that they think could lead to  130,000 people losing their jobs.    However, Norway will retain control over its oil and gas  resources even after it becomes an EU member. The Norwegians  can also continue to catch whales, but products from them may  not be exported. The agreements on alcohol, the environment,  taxation and duties have not given rise to any debate in the  country -- at least not yet. Norway will retain its tough  environmental, health, and alcohol levies. On the other hand  Norway will have to introduce value-added tax on some services  that today are exempt from value-added tax, such as overnight  stays in hotels.    Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland has expressed her great  happiness with the agreement with the EU. She is not surprised  by the fishermen's and farmers' criticism of the agreement.    "Even before the agreement was reached, these groups had  already made up their minds about what they would think. They  say no to the EU regardless of the outcome of the negotiations."    Gro Harlem Brundtland admitted that Norway has had to give  way on a couple of points, including the adjustment of the  prices of agricultural produce from day one.    "We were making very ambitious demands from the very  beginning. If we had not done so I think that we would not have  achieved the favorable results which we have achieved today,"  the prime minister said.    Center Party chairman Anne Enger Lahnstein is disappointed  with the results from the negotiations.    "The negotiators have given way on all points. The most  important one is our management of fisheries north of the 62d  parallel where 95 percent of our fish resources are to be found.  The EU will eventually assume control over these. It is true  that we have been given political assurances that Norwegian  management rules will continue to apply here, but we have not  been given any legally binding guarantees. This worries me."    Conservative Party leaders Kaci Kullmann Five takes a  positive view of the agreement, however:    "I believe that it will be completely possible to win a  majority for this agreement in a referendum. We have not gotten  our way on everything, but you never do in negotiations."    The Confederation of Norwegian Industry (NHO) is satisfied  with the agreement that can now form the basis for the debate on  Norwegian EU membership.    "If Finland and Sweden decide to become members of the EU,  there will be significant negative repercussions for Norwegian  industry and commerce, the Norwegian economy, and employment if  Norway does not become a member," NHO president Svein Aaser said.    Now that the EU agreement is complete, the debate on  Norwegian membership will start. It is as yet still unclear on  what day the referendum will take place, but according to  Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal, it will probably be in six to  seven months. However, if today's opinion polls are taken as an  indicator, Norway will not join the EU. Today 44 percent say no  to the EU, 29 percent yes, and 27 percent have not made up their  minds.</p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEBSTER'S CHAOTIC AFTERMATH  </P> <P> As legal doctrine, the Supreme Court's blockbuster decision in Webster vs.  Reproductive Health Services is a disappointment. It tells us little that we  did not already know and provides only the dimmest guidance for future  litigation. As abortion policy, the decision is a disaster.  </P> <P> In the aftermath of Webster, seven of the nine justices have taken unequivocal  stands on Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision that first recognized the  constitutional right to an abortion. Four (William J. Brennan Jr., Thurgood  Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens) stand solidly behind Roe.  Three (William H. Rehnquist, Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia) are explicitly  prepared to overrule.  </P> <P> The future therefore lies with Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Sandra Day  O'Connor. In Webster, Kennedy joined with Rehnquist and White in an opinion  that refused to decide whether Roe should be explicitly overruled, but whose  hostility to any constitutionally protected right to an abortion was  undisguised. It is not clear whether this means that Kennedy is unprepared to  overrule Roe, or that he is only biding his time before showing his hand. The  smart money is on the latter interpretation.  </P> <P> O'Connor is therefore once again uncomfortably at center stage. As in past  decisions, she refused to say whether she regards Roe as sound precedent. She  needn't decide that question, she said, because her previous position -- that  regulation of "abortion is not unconstitutional unless it unduly burdens the  right to seek an abortion" -- would permit the Missouri law at issue in Webster  to stand.  </P> <P> The court's refusal to reach the question of Roe's continued validity irritated  Scalia. He charged that the "indecisive" decision "preserves a chaos that is  evident to anyone who can read and count." Scalia is clearly right in this: The  outcome in Webster is an open invitation to state and local governments to test  the limits of the court's resolve. If O'Connor and Kennedy in fact believe that  Roe should be overturned, there is little to justify the agonizing uncertainty,  the untold hours of unnecessary effort and litigation, the mountains of wasted  legal fees and judicial time that Webster is almost certain to produce.  </P> <P> If O'Connor and Kennedy are postponing the destruction of Roe in the hope that  the coup de grace will seem less political if sufficiently delayed, they are  almost certainly incorrect. As frustration and anxiety grow, as legislative  options for the regulation of abortion increase but remain trapped in the  courts, the whole question will become more, rather than less, politicized.  Whenever and however Roe is destroyed, the court will have hell to pay.  </P> <P> If there are in fact five justices who believe that the whole question of  abortion should be handed back to the states for legislative resolution, then  it would be best for the court and the country to have done with it cleanly and  decisively.  </P> <P> In the meantime, however, the definitive vote in evaluating the  constitutionality of abortion regulation is likely to be O'Connor's, which  means that everything depends on which regulations she will find to be "unduly"  burdensome. Unfortunately, her opinion casts little if any illumination on this  question.  </P> <P> There were two salient issues. The first concerned a Missouri statute banning  the utilization of any public facility for abortions not necessary to save the  life of the mother. Ten years ago the court ruled that state governments could  withhold public support for abortions. The Missouri law was different because  its broad definition of "public facility" suggested that the state was  attempting to reach out and use public property as leverage to control private  conduct.  </P> <P> O'Connor, however, refused to decide the question of the reach of Missouri law,  stating that the constitutionality of the application of the law to private  hospitals leasing state-owned land "need not be decided here."  </P> <P> She pursued a similar strategy of deflection with regard to the second major  issue -- a poorly drafted Missouri statute that appeared to require that  physicians conduct expensive and possibly dangerous tests whenever performing  abortions at 20 weeks or later. O'Connor ducked the issue by reinterpreting the  statute to require only safe and easily administered medical tests that "would  only marginally, if at all, increase the cost of an abortion."  </P> <P> At every level, then, Webster raises more questions than it answers. This  result could be disabling for the pro-choice movement. In the past decade the  movement has been lulled into political lethargy by the siren promise of  judicial protection. Had the court swept Roe cleanly off the books, the  movement might have been galvanized into action. But the legal ambiguities of  Webster appear to offer yet another siren call, one the movement would be  well-advised to ignore. In the future, the real game will be played in state  legislatures, not federal courts. What remains to be seen is whether the  pro-choice movement can effectively mobilize in the absence of a clear and  decisively negative court ruling that would enable states seriously to  constrict the access to abortion of middle-class women.  </P></p>

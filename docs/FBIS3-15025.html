			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondents Pavel Kuznetsov </F> and Ivan Novikov]    [Text] Moscow, 1 March -- The Council of the State Duma  believes that the amnesty decision provides thousands of  Russians who have newly acquired freedom to become actively  involved in the creative work of all constructive public forces  for the benefit of the country, stated Ivan Rybkin, who held a  press conference in the State Duma today.    He read out a statement by the chamber's Council adopted  yesterday. The statement says that if any of those amnestied  "lacks the brains, common sense, heart, or desire to take the  path of accord, the State Duma, in accordance with the spirit  and letter of the decisions adopted and together with the  president, will find an opportunity to take measures to prevent  the situation in the country being destabilized."    Ivan Rybkin underlined that the State Duma is ready to study  constructive proposals for a mechanism to implement the amnesty  resolutions adopted by the Chamber, as well as to study a draft  of a memorandum agreed with other bodies of state power about  the responsibility of government institutions and politicians to  preserve civil peace and public order in Russia.    The chairman of the State Duma said that the decisions on  the  amnesty were dictated by a strong conviction that Russia cannot  be saved from a national crisis without an amnesty for all the  participants of the notorious events in 1991 and 1993, just as  it is impossible to achieve this without a stable civil peace.  He underlined that during a debate of the amnesty question at a  session of the chamber, the absolute majority of deputies  jointly reached a formula for a achieving civil peace and  national accord. It is based on a constructive cooperation with  the president, all power structures, and political forces and is  aimed at strengthening society and understanding the great  responsibility for the rebirth of statehood and the creation of  a new Russia.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> AND FINALLY: Green Bay Packers quarterback Don Majkowski isn't the only  hard-rock fan in the NFL (or even on the Packers). His teammate, Packers  lineman Tony Mandarich, who's a pal of Guns N' Roses top-gun Axl Rose, wears an  "Appetite for Destruction" tattoo on his arm. . . . Speaking of odd  collaborations -- Robert Palmer has teamed up with UB40 to record a cover  version of Bob Dylan's "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight," which will appear on  Palmer's new "Don't Explain" album. . . . Watch for Hollywood Records to launch  a mega-dollar marketing campaign when it releases CD versions of its Queen  catalogue early next year, which should feature a generous assortment of bonus  tracks (Hollywood has the rights to a dozen Queen albums originally recorded  for Elektra Records). . . . She won't be singing the national anthem, but watch  for a Roseanne Barr comedy album in December, also from Hollywood. . . . Clever  to the last, Devo has a greatest-hits -- and a great-misses album -- coming  from Warner Records. . . . And Hard 'n Heavy, the world's first heavy-metal  video magazine, is such a hit that it's already spawned a competitor --  Metalhead Video magazine. Retailing at $12.98, the video-mag's second issue  features interviews with Whitesnake's David Coverdale and Steve Vai, coverage  of Aerosmith at Hollywood's Rock Walk of Fame and footage from a Poison  record-release party.  </P></p>

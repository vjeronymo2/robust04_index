			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Thousands of Richmond residents filed suit against Safeway, charging that 18  deaths and a variety of health problems were caused by a fire that gutted its  480,000-square-foot distribution center last year. The fire burned for five  days in July, creating a lingering stench and raining ashes on a surrounding  low-income residential area. The suit, filed in Alameda County Superior Court,  lists 5,500 plaintiffs in the first 44 pages. Safeway, which has settled  thousands of claims out of court since the fire, had no comment. Residents  affected by the fire allege that the grocery chain offered them only nominal  payments because they are poor and black.  </P></p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Maxwell flotation target put at Pounds 250m MR Robert Maxwell, the publisher, will today launch the flotation of 49 per cent of Mirror Group Newspapers - a flotation designed to raise in the region of Pounds 250m. Mr Maxwell will unveil a tabloid-sized prospectus and the flotation will be promoted with advertisements in the press and a television campaign from Monday featuring the Daily Mirror's famous cartoon character Andy Capp. The hoped-for valuation of more than Pounds 500m compares with the Pounds 113m purchase price paid to Reed International in 1984, although since then there have been fundamental modernisation programmes including the installation of colour presses and inserting equipment. The company is expected to unveil operating profits of around Pounds 80m a year and a last-quarter performance up on last year, a significant achievement given the depth of the current advertising recession. One third of the shares will be set aside for UK institutions, one third for overseas institutions and the remainder for British small investors. Mr Maxwell's recent purchase of the loss-making New York Daily News, which will not be included in the flotation, is expected to heighten interest in the shares in the US. The company will be floated as a 'pure publishing company' without property but with MGN's main popular titles at its heart - the Daily Mirror, the Sunday Mirror, The People, the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail and the Sporting Life. It will also include the newspapers' colour presses. The so-called pathfinder prospectus will form the basis on which the shares will be marketed to institutions over the next few weeks. It will include all financial details on the company except the share price, which is scheduled to be announced on April 30. The Stock Exchange blocked plans to give MGN readers priority in the flotation but the minimum investment figure is being set at the relatively low figure of around Pounds 250 to encourage readers of the papers and other members of the public. The shares will not be partly-paid. The MGN flotation marks the first opportunity for the public to buy shares in a new issue for a company - outside the government's privatisation of the electricity industry - for about a year.</p>

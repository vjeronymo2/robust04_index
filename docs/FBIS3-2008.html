			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Speech" by Wen Jiabao, CPC Central Committee Secretariat </F> member, delivered while inspecting rural work in Jiangxi  Province, late November 1993: "Strive To Create a New Situation  in Agriculture and Rural Work"]    [Text] The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee was another important meeting in the history of our  party. "The Decision By the CPC Central Committee on Several  Questions Concerning the Building of the Socialist Market  Economy Structure" (the "Decision") adopted at the meeting has  followed Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, concretized and systematized the  goals and basic principles on building the socialist market  economy structure set at the 14th CPC National Congress,  constructed the basic framework of the socialist market economy  structure, and formulated the general program for the reform of  the economic structure. It is a program for actions to carry  out the reform of the economic structure and to speed up  economic development from the present to the end of the century.  It is of great practical significance and farreaching  historical significance to the reform, opening up, and socialist  modernization in our country. The "Decision" has regarded rural  reform as its important part and put it in a very important  position. This is because the development of the socialist  market economy needs a firm agricultural foundation and  deepening rural reform is an important part of building the  socialist market economy structure. We should seriously  implement the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee and the guidelines of the central  rural work conference, strive to open up a new situation in  agriculture and rural work, and push the reform and development  in rural areas to a new stage. This is of very great importance  to smoothly attaining the goal of building the socialist market  economy structure and to fulfilling the strategic task of the  national economy and social development in the 1990's.  <H3>  I. Concerning the Present Situation in Agriculture and  Rural Areas </H3>   Guided by the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, the  agriculture and rural economies of China have entered a new  period of development and the general situation of the rural  areas is good. In particular, since General Secretary Jiang  Zemin convened the rural work forum of six southern provinces in  Wuhan and Premier Li Peng convened the national television and  telephone meeting on agricultural work in Beijing at the end of  last year, a new turning point has emerged in agriculture and  rural work. This is prominently expressed in: First, all  promissory notes for payment in the procurement of agricultural  products have been cashed and virtually no more promissory notes  have been issued in the procurement of agricultural products  this summer and autumn; second, the central authorities and  local governments have taken resolute measures to reduce the  peasants' burden and have attained evident good results; third,  since the central authorities began to strengthen  macroregulation and control, the situation whereby large  quantities of land are not used for farming and large amounts of  funds are flowing out of the rural areas has taken a turn for  the better; and fourth, leadership at all levels has attached  greater importance to agriculture and has changed the phenomenon  of neglecting agriculture which had emerged. Therefore, the  situation in agriculture this year is better than was expected  at the beginning of the year.    However, we must be aware of problems such as lowering the  comparable efficiency of agricultural production, particularly  grain production; the widening price scissors of industrial and  agricultural products; and the slow growth in peasants' income,  have not yet been fundamentally solved. In the course of  promoting reform, there are many new situations and new problems  in agriculture and rural work which we have to study and solve.  We should, through implementing the "Decision" by the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the  guidelines of the central rural work conference, earnestly solve  the existing problems and further develop the favorable rural  situation.  <H3>  II. Concerning Stabilizing the Party's Basic Policies for  Rural Areas </H3>   In leading the practice of rural reform, our party has  gradually formed a series of basic policies. The Eighth Plenary  Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee systematically summed  up these policies. There are nine major ones. The most  important ones are implementing the responsibility system, with  the household contract responsibility system on a household  basis with remuneration linked to output as the dominant factor,  and the two-tier operational system integrating centralization  with decentralization; persisting in regarding public ownership  as the dominant factor and developing various economic  compositions at the same time; not relaxing grain production,  energetically developing diversified management, and supporting  and guiding the healthy development of township and town  enterprises; gradually removing restrictions on agricultural  products markets and using various channels for circulation; and  encouraging some localities and some people to become rich  earlier than others through honest labor and lawful operation in  a bid to eventually attain common prosperity, and so on. These  policies, which have been tested in practice for more than 10  years, are proving to be completely correct. They conform to  the three standards put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, the  reality of agriculture and rural work in our country, and the  desires of the broad masses of peasants. The 14th CPC National  Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee explicitly put forward that these policies must remain  stable for a long time to come and should be constantly improved  in practice.    From the very beginning, the party's various basic policies  for rural areas are characteristic of their market orientation:  First, they give the peasants the right to make their own  decisions on production and management to arouse the enthusiasm  of the broad masses of peasants; second, they enable agriculture  and the rural economy to enter the market and give play to the  role of market mechanism; and third, they strengthen protection  and service for agriculture and stabilize agriculture's position  as the foundation. The rural reform based on these basic  policies is, in fact, the successful practice of building the  new socialist market economy structure in rural areas.  Therefore, stabilizing and improving the party's basic policies  in rural areas are important parts of the building of the  socialist market economy structure. We should have a thorough  understanding of this.  <H5>  III. Concerning Deepening the Rural Reform </H5>   Some problems which have cropped up in the development of  agriculture and the rural economy should be solved mainly  through carrying out reform. At present, in implementing the  "Decision" and the guidelines of the central rural work  conference and in deepening the rural reform, it is necessary to  seriously and properly grasp three aspects of work. First, on  the basis of stabilizing the contract responsibility system on a  household basis with remuneration linked to output, promote an  optimized distribution of rural economic resources and the  rational flow of production essentials in order to arouse the  enthusiasm of peasants and various kinds of rural economic  organizations, raise labor productivity, and improve the  efficiency of the utilization of resources. Therefore, the  "Decision" and the central rural work conference stipulated:  While upholding the prerequisite of collective ownership, the  period for farmland contracts should be extended, the  inheritance of contracted management rights of production  projects of a development nature should be permitted, and the  transfer with compensation of the land utilization rights should  be permitted; in a few localities where the economy is  relatively developed, various forms such as the transfer of  contracts and buying shares can be adopted to develop management  to an appropriate scale while adhering to the principle of  voluntary participation by the masses. These stipulations are  of great significance to improving the land contract system and  to raising labor productivity in agriculture and the output rate  of land. Second, develop the rural market, invigorate rural  economic circulation, and adopt various ways to link the  scattered production and management of thousands upon thousands  of households with a unified market. Make great efforts to  develop the agricultural products market and to develop markets  for various production essentials, such as land, manpower, and  funds, in a bid to gradually form a complete market system. In  the course of building and perfecting the rural market system,  stress should be laid on the development of various intermediate  organizations which link the peasant households with the market.  Many good forms, such as the integration of commerce, industry,  and agriculture; making production, processing, and marketing a  coordinated process; and companies helping peasant households,  have existed in Jiangxi. These management organizations and  management methods have broken the limits of ownership,  departments, and localities, and have linked the peasant  households with the market, cities with rural areas, and  production and circulation with consumption. They have powerful  vitality and we should energetically give them support and speed  up their development. Third, build a system for the government  to guide, support, protect, regulate, and control agriculture.  This is determined by the characteristics of agriculture itself  and is also an objective demand in developing the socialist  market economy in rural areas. The building of a social service  system for agriculture is an important guarantee to promoting  the specialization, commercialization, and socialization of  agriculture. The peasants have an urgent demand for such a  system and we must make great efforts to do a good job in this  respect.  <H3>  IV. Concerning Solutions to Conspicuous Problems in the  Development of Agriculture and the Rural Economy </H3>   The most conspicuous problem at present is grain and cotton  production. The central rural work conference focused its  attention on studying this problem and put forward some  solutions to it. First, increase the comparable economic results  in grain and cotton production, increase the peasants' income  from grain and cotton production, further arouse the peasants'  enthusiasm in production, and ensure a steady growth in the  output of grain and cotton. Second, establish central and local  grain risk funds and a reserve regulation system to ensure an  ample supply of grain, stabilize market grain prices within a  rational range, and protect the interests of the peasants and  the consumers. Third, make great efforts to support the  economic development of main grain and cotton producing areas.  Main grain and cotton producing areas should stabilize grain  and cotton growing areas, increase the multiple crop index and  per unit area yield, rationally readjust the production setup,  develop diversified management and township and town  enterprises, in particular, do a good job in the processing  industry for agricultural and sideline products, taking the road  of development of integrating production growth with increase in  value through transformation. Efforts should be concentrated on  giving support to major counties which produce commodity grain  and cotton and the building of production bases should continue  to be strengthened. All localities and departments should  firmly grasp the formulation of implementation methods and  organize people to implement them as soon as possible.    Grain is of great importance and has a bearing on the  national economy and the people's livelihood, social stability,  and state security. New problems cropped up in grain production  and circulation should be seriously dealt with and properly  solved and should not be treated lightly. In studying and  solving these problems, we must proceed from the national  conditions of our country and from reality. Our country has a  large population and not much farmland. The comprehensive  production capacity of agriculture, that of grain in particular,  is not great and the capability of resisting natural disasters  is not great either. The development in different localities is  uneven and there are localities which do not have sufficient  grain, even in provinces and regions which produce much grain.  The formation of a unified and orderly grain market system has  not yet been completed. Some external conditions for grain  production and management, such as the supply of the means of  production and the storage and transportation of grain, need  further improvement. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain the  steady growth of grain output over a long period to come. At  the same time, it is necessary, through deepening reform, to  gradually and properly put the purchase and marketing structure  in order and correctly handle the relationship between grain  producing localities and marketing localities, the relationship  between grain and other cash crops, the relationship between the  domestic market and the regulation of imports and exports, and  the relationship between the present and the future. In short,  it is necessary to implement correct policies for grain  production and management which are conducive to the development  of grain production, the stability of the grain market, and the  protection of the interest of the peasants and the consumers.  <H3>  V. Concerning the Development of Productive Forces in Rural  Areas </H3>   Concentrating efforts on the development of productive  forces  in rural areas is the central task in the party's rural work.  It is necessary to strengthen the construction of water  conservancy work, popularize practical technology for  agriculture, and strengthen the material and technological  foundations for agriculture. It is necessary to gear  readjustment of the agriculture product mix and the production  setup in rural areas to market and to make great efforts to  develop high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency  agriculture and develop township and town enterprises and other  nonagricultural industries. Jiangxi has put forward two main  tasks in the development of the rural economy and we can say  such tasks are of universal significance. One of them is  development, the development of agriculture, the development of  various kinds of nonagricultural industries, and the development  of products. Many localities have made full use of local  resources to carry out a series of developments so that  production and management have developed to a considerable  scale, have developed into industries, and have effectively  promoted the development of the rural economy. The other is to  continue the development of the township and town enterprises.  The "Decision" and the central rural work conference have fully  affirmed that township and town enterprises are an important  part of the rural economy and have put forward principles and  measures to guide and assist township and town enterprises to  develop healthily. It is necessary, through deepening reform,  to blaze new paths in the property rights system and the ways of  management of township and town enterprises in order to further  increase their vitality. It is necessary to develop mainstay  industries and best-selling products, increase production to a  considerable scale, improve economic results, and to increase  competitive power. It is necessary to guide township and town  enterprises into becoming appropriately concentrated, fully  transform and utilize existing small cities and towns, develop  new cities and towns, and integrate the development of township  and town enterprises with the construction of small cities and  towns.    Reform means the liberation and development of productive  forces. "Development is the last word." It is necessary to  concentrate efforts on developing productive forces so that the  rural economy can develop to a higher level.  <H3>  VI. Concerning Strengthening Agriculture's Foundation  Position </H3>   The "Decision" and the central rural work conference  stressed  the necessity to readjust the structure of the national economy,  readjust its distribution pattern, increasing the percentage to  be used in agriculture, of investment in the capital  construction of the state, funds included in the financial  budget, and credit funds. The central authorities have put  forward that, in formulating the state credit plan, it is  necessary to ensure the growth rate of agricultural loans is  more than two percentage points over the growth rate of other  loans and that, in the additional bank loans next year, the  percentage of loans for agriculture should be increased to more  than 10 percent and the percentage of financial input into  agriculture should also be increased. Not only the central  authorities but also local governments should act in this way.    In readjusting the economic structure, the important thing  is to readjust the ratio between industry and agriculture.  Comrade Mao Zedong put forward this issue in his speech "On the  Ten Major Relationships" a long time ago. The experience of  several decades has proved that if the structure is rational and  the agricultural foundation is stable, the development of  industry and the economy will have a favorable environment; and,  if the structure is irrational, agriculture shrinks and the  agricultural foundation is unstable and industry, even the  entire national economy, will be affected. At present, an  important factor affecting industrial production is the market.  The stockpiling of products in some industrial enterprises is  because the market, the rural market in particular, has not  opened up. The market in China has a great potential and such  potential lies mainly in rural areas. If agriculture is not  developed, and if the peasants' purchasing power is not  increased, industry will not have the necessary raw materials  and a broad market. We should understand this truth.    Readjusting the economic structure and properly handling the  ratio between industrial and agricultural production is an issue  to which we should pay attention for a long time to come. For  decades, we have repeatedly come across this issue. In the  course of building the socialist market economy structure, it is  all the more necessary to attach importance to the issue. The  development of agriculture and the rural economy has to meet the  needs of the market economy but, on the other hand, in the  course of building the market economy structure it is necessary  to strengthen support and protection for agriculture.  Agriculture is the kind of production which produces great  social benefits but few benefits for itself and which has a  relatively weak foundation and needs special support and  protection from the government. All developed countries act in  this way. To ensure that agriculture's foundation position  remains unshaken, we must increase input in agriculture and  strengthen support and protection for agriculture.  <H3>  VII. Concerning Strengthening the Building of Spiritual  Civilization in Rural Areas </H3>   It is necessary to uphold the principle of grasping with  both  hands, and grasping firmly with both hands, strengthen the  building of the socialist spiritual civilization in rural areas,  strengthen the building of rural grass-roots organizations with  party branches as the cores and the building of democracy and  the legal system, and strengthen the building of grass-roots  political power and the building of the contingent of rural  cadres. It is necessary to frequently carry out education on  patriotism, socialism, and collectivism among peasants;  eradicate feudal superstition, outmoded conventions, and bad  customs; oppose extravagance and waste; encourage  industriousness and thriftiness in managing a household; and  display the spirit of mutual help and friendship. At present,  the peasants are highly critical about social order. It is  necessary to strengthen comprehensive management of social order  and crack down sternly on train bandits and road scoundrels, on  illegal activities which damage the peasants' interest and  undermine production, and on kidnapping children and women. It  is necessary to strengthen guidance to rural cultural life. In  films, television, music, operas, literature, and paintings, it  is necessary to create more works loved by peasants. Literature  and art performance troupes should regularly go to rural areas  to give performances for peasants and should strive to enrich  peasants' cultural lives.    At present, to properly implement the guidelines of the  Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the  central rural work conference, it is necessary to depend on two  things: The first is to depend on party organizations at all  levels. It is necessary to pay attention to protecting the  enthusiasm of rural grass-roots cadres, raising their  ideological level and enhancing their understanding of policy,  and encouraging them to work creatively. Party organizations at  the provincial, prefectural, county, and township levels should  put implementation of the guidelines of the two meetings on  their agendas and make concrete arrangements. It is necessary  to put forward our own targets, plans, and methods for  implementation in accordance with the principles, goals, and  planning put forward by the "Decision" and closely in light of  local reality. The other is to depend on the masses of people.  It is necessary to disseminate the guidelines of the "Decision"  and the central rural work conference among the broad masses of  peasants. It is necessary to be good at using lively and vivid  methods and simple, easy to understand language to relay to  peasants the guidelines of the central authorities.    In the course of changing over to the socialist market  economy structure, many things in agriculture need studying and  many problems needs solving. The responsibility of rural work  is very heavy and it is necessary to strengthen the party's  leadership over rural work. The broad masses of cadres who have  taken up rural work, the leading cadres in particular, should  seriously study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, study a series of expositions by Comrade Xiaoping  concerning agricultural development and rural reform, and  strengthen the consciousness of adhering to the party's basic  line and implementing the party's various principles and  policies for rural areas. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, and the guidelines of the 14th CPC National  Congress, and under the correct leadership of the CPC Central  Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, united as one,  work hard, strive to properly carry out various kinds of rural  work, and promote rural reform and rural economic development.</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPACE CENTER SIMULATIONS OFFER THE RIGHT STUFF  </P> <P> Four minutes, 30 seconds to liftoff.  </P> <P> Mission control reports that the shuttle has switched to internal power. I  radio confirmation as my eyes wander over the monitors on the flight deck.  Outside the forward viewing ports, thin clouds drift through the serene blue of  the Florida sky. Perfect launch weather.  </P> <P> "Discovery? Repeat: Do you confirm oxygen vents closed? Over."  </P> <P> What oxygen vents? Something to do with fuel for the main engine? I search  frantically among the banks of switches for anything that mentions "oxygen." We  are falling behind schedule.  </P> <P> Less than two minutes before, the solid engines had ignited and we are  committed to launch. At last I spot it, an obscure switch labeled "O2." I flip  it and mumble confirmation over the headset, then glance at the panel again and  go cold.  </P> <P> I have vented all the oxygen from the sealed cabin. To the right, my pilot,  "Buzz," a doctor from California, seems unconcerned. He studies the electrical  system. Behind me, "Bubba," the Midwest carpet dealer, mentally rehearses his  space walk.  </P> <P> The countdown continues. This motion is going to make for a long two hours.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> The equipment and the mission are simulations, but the tension is real at the  Space &amp; Rocket Center in Huntsville, Ala.  </P> <P> Start with a generation that grew up with Sputnik, the Mercury astronauts and  Apollo on the moon. Imagine a theme park built around space exploration, with  real NASA training machines, detailed Hollywood mock-ups of the space shuttle,  and the chance to command a shuttle mission from launch to landing. Add some  astronauts, a German rocket scientist and the world's most extensive rocket  park.  </P> <P> The result is U.S. Space Camp, a hands-on program that sets the center apart  from other collections of space hardware. College-age counselors take children,  and adults, through a program of lectures and simulations that are no doubt the  closest most of us will ever get to real space flight.  </P> <P> Programs are divided into five levels -- three for children and two for adults.  Children in grades 4-6 can attend Space Camp, where they build and launch their  own model rockets.  </P> <P> Throughout the five-day program, kids can taste astronaut food, ride machines  that simulate moon gravity and explore astronaut training facilities at the  nearby Marshall Space Flight Center.  </P> <P> The more advanced Space Academy offers a five-day program for children in  grades 7-9.  </P> <P> Academy Level II trains high school sophomores, juniors and seniors in a 10-day  program patterned on NASA crew training manuals. The intensive 100-hour course  includes lectures by rocket engineers and astronauts.  </P> <P> Both adult programs, Levels I and II, are condensed three-day versions of the  advanced Academy curriculum, including descent into a two-story water tank like  the system used to teach astronauts the tricks of construction in space.  </P> <P> Any student from grades 4-12 may apply to Space Camp. The application must  include a recommendation from a classroom or science teacher.  </P> <P> I had never strapped on a tank before, but after some homework and a session  with certified scuba instructors, I dived 20 feet to experience simulated  weightlessness.  </P> <P> The realities of physics hit home in a new way. A 150-pound steel ball, buoyed  weightless underwater and shoved gently toward me, still delivered a jolt  through its properties of inertia and mass.  </P> <P> The lesson: In near-earth orbit, I might be able to "lift" a satellite, but not  stop it from spinning.  </P> <P> The culmination of each session is a "shuttle mission" combining all the week's  training in a carefully scripted simulation.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> Until midway through our flight, our crew's mission specialists sit patiently,  with only an occasional radio report to make. Now it is time for their  "extra-vehicular activity" -- the space walk.  </P> <P> An assistant helps them into bulky space suits. They get into white rubber  boots and helmets and take their places for the satellite-repair exercise.  </P> <P> One is strapped into a parachute harness attached by cables to a track far  overhead. The other steps onto a large mechanical arm like the one used in the  repair of phone lines.  </P> <P> The first figure glides out over the shuttle bay like a space age Peter Pan.  The second jerks the arm in fits and starts, up and over, to rendezvous near a  shiny satellite replica above the shuttle.  </P> <P> This is a quiet time for the commander and pilot, so the counselor overseeing  our mission secretly throws a switch on his command panel.  </P> <P> A red light on our emergency panel flashes "Fire." The pilot and I flip through  our emergency cards to find the fire control procedure. We expected something  like this, and in less than a minute the light is out. We are getting cocky.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> Not everything runs like clockwork. Coordinating training and machinery for  three or more groups simultaneously leads to some confusion and down time.  </P> <P> During my visit, a jet cockpit trainer was out of commission and one of the  microgravity simulators, which ride on a cushion of air, had a balky hose. A  special early-morning session to rehearse mission assignments started late with  a collection of drowsy counselors.  </P> <P> Agendas for the advanced programs are packed. Twelve-hour days are the norm.  Breaks for sightseeing are scheduled during each session; the staff reminds  participants that the experience is, after all, supposed to be fun.  </P> <P> Campers' families or others who just want to visit for the day can find less  demanding activities.  </P> <P> The center's Spacedome Theater features movies filmed in the huge new Omnimax  format like the ones shown at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington,  D.C. But here films are projected overhead on a shallow planetarium-type  screen.  </P> <P> A shuttle launch vibrated our reclining chairs with the rolling thunder. Later  we "oohed" and "aahed" like spectators at a fireworks show as panoramas of  Earth and the crisp starkness of space filled our field of vision.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> The idea of a museum that would allow children to take part in the excitement  of space travel was first promoted by Wernher von Braun, the German rocket  genius who immigrated to the United States after World War II.  </P> <P> The museum and rocket park opened in 1970. In 1982, the first U.S. Space Camp  program was offered, attracting 747 children. The center later added the  advanced sessions for teen-agers and adults. Annual attendance at this  three-ring space circus is up to 20,000.  </P> <P> The center is run by the state of Alabama and receives sizable donations of  equipment, money and expertise from NASA and a group of aerospace contractors  and local corporations.  </P> <P> Campers bunk in compact six-person "sleep stations" in the new  multimillion-dollar Space Habitat dormitory, whose futuristic design was  inspired by NASA's proposed space station. Counselors provide supervision.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> The runway at Edwards Air Force Base rises ahead of us. I begin the first of  the broad S-turns that will allow us to glide in at the right speed and  heading.  </P> <P> I ease the control stick to one side. The hydraulics slowly tip the whole cabin  in that direction. I steer back the other way, and again the cabin tilts in  response.  </P> <P> I am so intent on keeping the craft centered that I almost forget about landing  gear. Wait, that's the pilot's job. "Buzz, get the gear." More fumbling. Armed,  deployed, on the ground, with two seconds to spare.  </P> <P> Buzz says nothing, pretending to recheck the switches. Bubba can't wait to  rehash the mission over lunch. I decide to sit here a minute and come down to  earth.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> The U.S. Space Camp program has been so successful that an affiliate center  (grades 4-7) opened last year, adjacent to the Kennedy Space Center on the east  coast of Florida, sponsored in part by NASA's original Mercury astronauts  through their Mercury 7 Foundation. Nippon Steel has been licensed to open a  Space World franchise in Japan next spring.  </P> <P> The center has a snack bar for fast food, and a cafeteria. Campers eat all  meals at the cafeteria. An informal poll rated the food hot, varied and  unexceptional.  </P> <P> Family members can stay at the Huntsville Marriott a short walk away. It offers  the usual Marriott facilities including restaurants, and advertises a special  Space Camp family rate. Call the hotel at (205) 830-2222.  </P> <P> Programs for both young campers and academy participants run all year. All  adult programs take place Friday through Sunday in the fall.  </P> <P> The center recommends early registration for Space Camp and Space Academy  programs. Easter holidays and June and July programs fill quickly. Many schools  provide credit for students who must miss classes to attend the camp.  </P> <P> Tuition, which includes meals, lodging and all activities, ranges from $425 for  the five-day Space Camp fall session to $800 for the 10-day Level II Space  Academy summer session. Scholarships are available. Adult sessions cost $450.  </P> <P> For more information and an official U.S. Space Camp/Space Academy application,  write the Space &amp; Rocket Center, One Tranquility Base, Huntsville, Ala.  35807-0680, or call toll-free (800) 637-7223 or (205) 837-3400.  </P></p>

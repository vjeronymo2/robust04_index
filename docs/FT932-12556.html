			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Sluggish recovery seen for package tour industry THE package-tour industry is still struggling to emerge from recession, with sales of summer holidays up slightly on the back of heavy discounting, says Lunn Poly, the UK's largest travel retailer. Lunn Poly figures published yesterday show that about 7.5m people were expected to buy summer holidays through travel agents this year - an increase of 5 per cent from 1992. But Mr Richard Bowden-Doyle, Lunn Poly marketing director, said that the average price of summer holidays sold through Lunn Poly's 610 shops this year was Pounds 414, compared with Pounds 418 last year. Mr Bowden-Doyle, speaking at the convention of the Association of British Travel Agents in Majorca, said that the increase in holidays sold was the result of discounting after Christmas, when Lunn Poly cut 10 per cent off the prices of all its summer 1993 holidays. Before last Christmas sales of holidays for summer 1993 had been 6 per cent lower than the levels of the previous year. He said that 2m winter 1992-93 holidays had been sold by travel agents, the same as the previous year. Lunn Poly had, however, sold holidays at a discount throughout the winter. He said that Majorca had consolidated its position as the leading destination for UK holidaymakers, accounting for 12 per cent of summer 1993 bookings, compared with 11 per cent last year. Florida won 8 per cent of bookings, the same as last year, in spite of the recent killings of European tourists and other attacks, putting it in second place ahead of Cyprus, which has fallen from 10 per cent of bookings in 1992 to 6 per cent this year. Turkey is in joint third place with 6 per cent, compared with 3 per cent last year.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Swiss Banking (9): The real time breakthrough - Progress in electronics on the stock exchange Next June, the Swiss stock market goes electronic. Nothing particularly exciting about that, one might say. Stock exchanges around the world have been doing that since the late 1960s when programmers at the Toronto Stock Exchange discovered a way of making a computer behave like an auctioneer. The Swiss, it would seem, are slow as usual in adopting useful innovations. That is true, but it is not the whole story. The Swiss have also achieved a significant technical and practical advance to the design and operation of electronic exchanges. The Swiss exchange will be the first that carries out trading, settlement and clearing in real time. This is no mean feat, as those in London involved with the Taurus project, abandoned two years ago because of the technical difficulties of integrating trading and settlement, would attest. Its importance, apart from cost savings and reduction of the possibility for errors, is that it removes the risk that a party to a transaction can suffer significant losses because of delays in settlement. It also eliminates the risk that one of the parties will default during the settlement period. The Swiss hope that this feature alone will encourage traders to bring back some of the volume in Swiss securities that has been carried over to other exchanges, especially London's SEAQ International. The other big benefit for traders that should come from the electronic exchange is liquidity. At the moment, domestic trading is spread among three exchanges in Zurich, Geneva and Basle. With improved liquidity, spreads should narrow, providing better prices. Mr Bernhard Sauer, project director, says there is already a double-digit queue of foreign banks, led by Deutsche Bank of Germany, wanting to join the new exchange. The directors decided last year not to accept any new members until after the system was up and running. Goldman Sachs of the US, the last bank to get through the door before this freeze came into effect, is eagerly looking forward to the opening. 'We think there will be a myriad of opportunities with the electronic exchange,' says Mr Walter Haydock, general manager of Goldman Sachs Bank in Zurich. 'The Swiss market is fourth largest in Europe.' There is much speculation about how the electronic exchange will affect trading behaviour. The most important change will undoubtedly be a reduction in the influence of certain brokers, particularly those of the three big universal banks and Mr Martin Ebner's BZ Bank, on price movements. The big three, Union Bank of Switzerland, Credit Suisse and Swiss Bank Corporation, together account for more than half of all trading on the Swiss exchanges today, with BZ Bank accounting for about a fifth. In times of active markets, traders from other banks inevitably watch and take their lead from the actions of these big players around the rings. This gives the big banks extra power in the market. By contrast, when they work on the electronic exchange, traders will not necessarily know who is offering or buying shares. The decision to disclose one's identity in a transaction is optional, and the expectation is that most traders will not. 'A few may put their names up for macho reasons,' Mr Sauer says. Paradoxically, however, the electronic market will be more transparent than the open outcry rings because dealers will be able to see all the orders concerning a given security at any moment. On very large orders, a trader will not have to reveal the full volume involved, but he will have to insert a symbol indicating he aims to sell more than he has showing. Mr Ebner, who opposed the conversion to an electronic system, fears that without the atmosphere of a true market, volume on the new exchange will decline and spreads will widen. It also remains to be seen how much trading will take place off the exchange. Members have agreed that only very large transactions can be executed privately. Also, the big banks will no longer be allowed to practise in-house clearing or delay reporting off exchange deals. Mr Sauer says he would have preferred to see bankers obliged to put all transactions through the exchange. 'But my theory is that if this exchange turns out to be as efficient as we think it will be, then the clients will want to come anyway.' But will it all really happen? Are there still possibilities for hiccups before next June? The designers, a team put together by the Swiss stock exchanges themselves, are very confident that they can bring the system in on time and within its SFr80m budget. For one thing, the electronic settlement and clearing systems are already in place. The only new element in the system is the exchange itself. For another, the system has been up and running for several months already, and comprehensive training programmes are under way. Still, they are taking no chances. Last month, they agreed to delay the introduction by 10 weeks to allow member firms more time to develop their own software. And the introduction will be staggered, with foreign equities being the first to go live on June 2, followed over the next few weeks by Swiss shares and bonds. Soffex futures and options are already traded electronically, and they will be integrated into the new system in 1996, enabling users to do combined trading between underlying securities and derivatives. The larger economic consequences of the start-up of the new exchange are difficult to assess. All three existing physical exchanges in Zurich, Basle and Geneva will close. Basle is likely to be hurt the most. Its most active members will simply move to Zurich which is only an hour away. Geneva will lose the big bank traders based in the city, as the big three will concentrate their forces in Zurich. But leading Geneva banks, such as Pictet &amp; Cie, will pull back their Zurich staffs to Geneva. 'It is good for Geneva,' says Mr Jacques de Saussure, a Pictet partner. 'Under the present system, Geneva was fighting a losing battle against Zurich. Now we will have a more level playing field.'</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FREE CONSERVATION PROGRAM APPROVED  </P> <P> "Lite Bill," a free, yearlong program to reduce energy and water use in  Pasadena's 37,000 households will be undertaken by DMC Services Inc. of Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> The company was awarded a contract with the city last week by the Board of  Directors, despite objections from Directors Chris Holden and Rick Cole. The  two questioned why a minority-owned firm, Foothill Area Community Services, was  not selected.  </P> <P> After discussion, the board agreed that FACS could participate as a DMC  subcontractor if more than the anticipated 20% of the city's residential  households respond and the program is extended.  </P> <P> Under the Lite Bill program, door-to-door canvassers will be assigned to all  residential dwellings of four units or less to analyze home-energy use and  distribute energy-saving devices such as low-flow shower heads and water-heater  insulation blankets.  </P> <P> The program is expected to save customers $3.5 million over the next five  years. It will cost $952,000, including $373,000 provided by the Metropolitan  Water District.  </P></p>

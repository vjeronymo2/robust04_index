			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Therefore, the following MACT guidelines are being proposed. Fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from any MWC ash storage facility or any ash transfer point at an MWC plant with aggregate capacity to combust greater than 35 Mg/day of MSW would be required to be controlled so that no visible emissions are detected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fly ash/bottom ash visible emissions guidelines would be determined using EPA Reference Method 22 (3-hour continuous visual observation). Compliance with the visible emissions guidelines would be determined by an annual performance test. Reports of initial and annual performance tests would be required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any technology may be used to meet these standards. The fly ash/bottom ash fugitive emissions guidelines would apply to ash handling facilities within the property boundary of the MWC including trucks moving away from the MWC, but would not apply to offsite transport of ash. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Proposed Guidelines for Air Curtain Incinerators <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air curtain incinerators operate by forcefully projecting a curtain of air across the top of an open chamber or pit. The air curtain reduces emissions during operation by promoting better combustion. Incinerators of this type are built either above or below ground and typically have refractory walls and a floor. Section 129 of the Act exempts air curtain incinerators firing MSW from the definition of ``municipal waste combustion unit'' provided that the air curtain incinerator burns only tree trimmings, yard wastes, and clean untreated lumber and that it complies with an opacity limit that would be established by the EPA. As clarified under the proposed guidelines, ``untreated lumber'' means that the lumber has not been painted, pigment-stained, or ``pressure treated.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's proposed guidelines include guideline opacity levels specifically for air curtain incinerators that would combust greater than 35 Mg/day of only yard wastes, tree trimmings, or clean untreated lumber. The proposed opacity levels are 10-percent opacity (6-minute average), except that a level of up to 35 percent (6-minute average) would be allowed during the first 30 minutes of operation of the unit. The proposed opacity levels are based on levels achieved by well-designed and operated air curtain incinerators. Compliance with the air curtain incinerator opacity guidelines would be demonstrated by conducting an annual compliance test in accordance with EPA Reference Method 9. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Air curtain incinerators with unit capacities above 35 Mg/day that burn MSW other than yard wastes, tree trimmings, or clean untreated lumber are covered by the emission guidelines for MWC's. Air curtain incinerators with unit capacities above 35 Mg/day that burn only yard wastes, tree trimmings, or clean untreated lumber would be subject to the proposed opacity guideline and its associated testing, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements, but would not be subject to any other parts of the proposed emission guidelines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Comparison of the Proposal and European Emission Limits <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Europe is more densely populated than the United States and the combustion of MSW became increasingly common after World War II. Because European countries have more experience combusting MSW, it is interesting to compare the emission control requirements for MWC's located in the Member States of the European Union (EU) to those for MWC's in the United States. In addition to comparing emission requirements, the EPA also compared the prevalence of waste combustion in the United States and the EU. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, MSW combustion is more common in the EU than in the United States. There are 12 members of the EU: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Spain, and Portugal. The percentage of waste combusted in many of the EU countries is over 30 percent, with Denmark, Luxembourg, and The Netherlands, combusting 60, 60, and 40 percent of their waste, respectively. As a national average for the United States, 16 percent of the waste generated is combusted. In the Eastern United States, where the majority of MWC's are located, the rate of waste combustion is higher, averaging 25 to 30 percent. In the New England region, the rate of waste combustion approaches 60 percent. Therefore, although the United States as a whole has a much lower rate of waste combustion than does the EU, certain regions of the United States have combustion rates similar to those of the EU. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Factors such as population density, percentage of urbanization, land availability, and topography/geology influence the method of waste disposal for a country or a region. In the EU, the majority of the countries have population densities that range from 200 to 600 people per square mile and urban population percentages of 60 to 90 percent. The United States, in comparison, has a much lower average population density of approximately 70 people per square mile, and the percentage of the population living in urban areas is approximately 75 percent. In the Eastern United States, the population density and percentage of urban population are higher than national levels, at around 200 people per square mile with over 80 percent of the population living in urban areas, which is comparable to most of Europe. As noted above, other factors contribute to the use of MWC technology. For example, in Florida, the geology is such that in some cases landfilling waste is not a desirable option. Similarly, the mountainous regions in parts of Europe restrict the use of landfilling, and the increased usage of MWC's is common. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding regulatory development in the EU, the EU sets uniform environmental guidelines, and individual EU countries may adopt those guidelines or more stringent requirements. This is similar to the role the EPA plays with the individual States. Table 6 presents: (1) The proposed EPA emission guidelines for existing MWC plants with capacities above 35 and 225 Mg/day; and (2) the EU limits that apply to new and existing plants. Existing MWC plants in the EU with capacities greater than 144 Mg/day must meet these requirements by December 1, 1996. All other existing plants with capacities between 24 and 144 Mg/day must meet these requirements by December 1, 2000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Armenia is warned to curb guerrillas SOVIET military chiefs yesterday warned the pro-independence government of the Soviet republic of Armenia to curb guerrilla attacks on Soviet personnel by Armenian armed bands, writes John Lloyd in Moscow. Mr Arshot Manuchurian, the republic's interior minister, responded by saying he could not control the guerrillas, who were retaliating against 'bloody acts' by Soviet soldiers. Soviet and Azerbaijani troops fired on and occupied two more villages yesterday; a third avoided an attack by surrendering its weapons. The military's warning is aimed at what Soviet forces have identified as a widespread formation of guerrilla groups along the republic's border with Azerbaijan, with which it is locked in conflict over control of the Armenian-inhabited enclave of Nagorno Karabakh, in Azerbaijan.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A FEW OTHER SUGGESTIONS TO PAY FOR S&amp;L BAILOUT  </P> <P> Vic Simon's article is right on. But why stop at taxing IRA's and Keogh's? Lets  tax all pension plans.  </P> <P> And, if it's only money that we need (damn the moral issue), lets tax churches,  temples and all other religious efforts.  </P> <P> Get real, Vic. Everyone knows the real reason for the S&amp;L failures and the  budget deficit. Attack the germ, not the rash. Get Congress to cut spending and  put those S&amp;L thieves in jail.  </P> <P> JAMES P. WALSH  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

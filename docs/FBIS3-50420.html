"The meeting was held in a very calm atmosphere; we talked  about the reasons for his dismissal," the prime minister added.  The prime minister did not give specific reasons, but he said  that the privatization of the Silesian Bank was not the direct  reason for Kawalec's sacking.    Pawlak explained that during a conversation with him on  Friday, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Marek  Borowski reiterated that he expected a reply in writing to his  questions concerning the reason for Kawalec's dismissal. The  prime minister pointed out that the letter had not yet reached  Borowski, and for that reason he did not want to reveal any  details contained in the letter.    When asked if Kawalec's sacking could weaken the Polish  Peasant Party-Democratic Left Alliance coalition, and if there  already was a candidate for the vacant post to replace the  recalled minister, Pawlak explained that there is not yet an  agreement concerning the candidate. With regard to the  coalition, the prime minister said he does not think that  Kawalec's dismissal could cause any problems.</p>

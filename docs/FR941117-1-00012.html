			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the Medicaid statute was enacted in 1965, it has required that all State agencies involved with mental health care coordinate their activities. Specifically, section 1902(a)(20)(A) of the Act requires that the State Medicaid agency, in a State offering the optional IMD benefit under section 1905(a)(14), have agreements or other arrangements with other State authorities concerned with mental diseases. These include arrangements for joint planning and development of alternate methods of care, and arrangements providing assurance of immediate readmittance to institutions, where needed, for individuals under alternate plans of care. The IMD services authorized under section 1905(a)(14) currently are provided by 45 States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1902(a)(20)(B) of the Act contains additional requirements regarding IMD benefits for individuals age 65 or older. Among other provisions, this section requires that the Medicaid State plan provide for an individual plan for each patient who may be in need of institutional care to ensure that any ``institutional care provided to him is in his best interests, including, to that end, assurances that there will be initial and periodic review of his medical and other needs.'' In addition, the State plan must include assurances that each patient will be given appropriate treatment within the institution, and that each patient will have a periodic assessment of the need for continued treatment in the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1902(a)(20)(C) of the Act further requires States that offer the IMD benefit to provide for development of alternate plans of care, making maximum utilization of available resources, for recipients age 65 or older who would otherwise need institutional care, including appropriate medical treatment and other aid or assistance. This section also requires that States develop the methods of administration necessary to ensure that these responsibilities of the State agency for these recipients are effectively carried out.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1902(a)(21) of the Act requires that these States show that they are making satisfactory progress toward developing and implementing a comprehensive mental health program, including provision for utilization of community mental health centers and other alternatives to care in public IMDs. (The State's comprehensive mental health services plan, which a State has prepared in accordance with section 1912 of the Public Health Service Act, can serve as a basis for this process). These statutory requirements were designed to ensure that the mental health services covered by Medicaid are coordinated with all related services provided by other State authorities and that appropriate alternatives to institutional care are available. These requirements are implemented in our regulations at 42 CFR 441.106, which provides, among other things, that if a State plan includes services in public institutions for mental diseases, the State must implement a comprehensive mental health program which covers all ages. In this way, we make clear that a comprehensive program must include services for individuals under age 21 and over age 64 who are possible candidates for Medicaid coverage of inpatient psychiatric care as well as services for individuals age 22 through 64 who do not have a Medicaid benefit for inpatient psychiatric care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. General Goal of Proposed Regulatory Revisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are preparing the proposed regulations under the authority provided by section 1905(h) of the Act, as amended by section 4755 of OBRA '90, to specify alternative inpatient settings in which inpatient psychiatric services may be covered for individuals under age 21. We also propose to update our rules for the psychiatric <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21 benefit to take into account changes that have taken place in the provision of psychiatric services since the existing regulations were published, and to make implementation of the psychiatric <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21 benefit consistent with related Medicaid benefits and other statutory provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

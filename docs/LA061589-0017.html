			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR STAMPS: ROYAL ISSUES NOT SO RARE  </P> <P> Question: My topic in stamp collecting is British royal wedding issues. Do the  Princess Anne (1973) and Prince Charles (1981) wedding sets have good  potentials for price increases in the long term?  </P> <P> Also, I am thinking about assembling a set issued for the 1935 Silver Jubilee.  Considering that most stamps in this issue catalogue for more than $20, does  this set have investment potential? -- R.K.  </P> <P> Answer: If anybody could see the future, they would quickly become quite  wealthy. The stamps that you mention are popular issues, but they are not my  first choice for serious long-term investment. These stamps were issued in  sufficient quantities that they are not what we would call rare.  </P> <P> I think they deserve a place in a comprehensive collection of 20th-Century  British stamps, but for the long term, who knows? The Silver Jubilees are  probably more popular to collect in Great Britain than they are here, and I  believe that the recent Prince Charles, Lady Di and similar issues have been  overpromoted.  </P> <P> Q: Shortly after World War II, I was in Brazil, where I bought several sheets  of commemoratives showing a picture of the Rio de Janeiro post office. The  denominations are 5 and 10 cruzeiros. What are these worth now? -- M.C.  </P> <P> A: You have the more valuable members of a set of seven stamps issued to honor  the Fifth Postal Union Congress of the Americas and Spain in 1946. Catalogue  values are $4.50 for the 5 cruzeiros, $5 for the 10 cruzeiros stamp, per mint  stamp. So your panes (sheets) are worth something.  </P></p>

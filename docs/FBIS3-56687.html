			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by A. Portanskiy under the general heading: "Russia </F> and United States Try To Avoid `Aluminum War'"]    [Text] The general calls for assistance for the reforms in  Russia, often repeated in the West, are one thing, but talk on  the entirely specific question of trade with Russia are  something else entirely.    The Americans are suggesting to us that we make a commitment  to almost the whole world voluntarily to restrict exports of our  aluminum to a certain level. This agreement will allegedly be  temporary -- until the situation on the world market is put  right. Here a program of investment in our aluminum industry is  offered.    With this option Russian experts believe that the question  will soon arise of what we are to do without production -- we  will have to reduce it. That will not be long in causing a  whole range of adverse consequences for us. Export deliveries  will be reduced and social tension will be intensified in whole  regions where aluminum production is concentrated (let us recall  the recent success of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia  during the election campaign in Siberia -- A.P.).    The likelihood that our profit level will be preserved as a  result of the increase in world prices for aluminum after the  reduction in the dumping of Russian metal on the external market  is in reality not great. Because various countries have  accumulated a considerable amount of aluminum, which will  immediately be put on the market.    From the political viewpoint in our foreign trade we will  acquire a most unpleasant precedent which will subsequently  probably be repeated with our other export goods.    But refusing a voluntary limit on aluminum exports will  probably mean for us the start of the antidumping procedure  mentioned by [U.S lawyer] Larry Friedman. Although it is quite  hard to prove dumping in practice, the results of a possible  investigation are virtually predetermined -- they will not be in  our favor.    We are now caught in a sandwich, as the Americans say, or  between the hammer and the anvil, as the Russians say.  Nonetheless, the Russian side intends to advance at the  forthcoming talks in the direction of its main idea -- putting  the blame for the state of the market on all producing countries  and seeking a formula for an overall stabilization of the  aluminum market. Within the framework of this formula there can  be a number of options for resolving the problem. One of them  is investments in our aluminum industry on condition that  payments are subsequently made to investors in this metal. The  main merit of this option is that it opens up a prospect for the  increase in the consumption of aluminum for civilian purposes  inside the country -- something for which Russia has such a  great need -- and that will at the same time favorably affect  the state of the world aluminum market.</p>

Individuals may now buy hotels, motels, gas stations, supermarkets, golf  courses, health clubs, bowling alleys and farms or other agricultural  properties. However, they are prohibited from investing in "luxurious"  properties such as condominiums and apartments. Individuals and companies must  report all transactions to the Bank of Korea, which must approve any deal over  $2 million.  </P></p>

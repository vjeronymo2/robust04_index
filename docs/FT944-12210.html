			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Amcor acquires RIG Rentsch Amcor, the Australian packaging and paper group, is hoping to almost double its European sales with the ADollars 134m (USDollars 99m) purchase of RIG Rentsch, a publicly-listed folding carton packaging business based in Switzerland. It announced an agreed bid for the Swiss company yesterday, offering SFr2,550 (USDollars 2,024) per bearer share, and SFr510 per registered share. Rentsch's principal shareholders, with about 72.5 per cent of the voting capital, have accepted the terms, and public shareholders, who hold the remaining 27.5 per cent, will be presented with an identical offer. Rentsch has annual sales of around ADollars 300m, of which about 60 per cent come from tobacco packaging. By coincidence, Amcor's directors faced questioning over the ethics of packaging for the cigarette industry at last week's annual general meeting in Sydney. Mr Athol Lapthorne, chairman, said Amcor had considered the matter - the Rentsch deal had clearly not yet been disclosed - but decided that it was in shareholders' interests that the company should remain in this business. His remarks were applauded by the several hundred shareholders at the meeting. The Swiss company operates nine manufacturing facilities, all but one of which produce folding cartons. Its plants are spread across Europe and include sites in the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Poland and Switzerland. Mr Chris Nixon, managing director of Amcor's containers packaging division, said the company expected Rentsch to post earnings before interest and tax of about ADollars 20m in the first year. Amcor has been pursuing an aggressive expansion strategy recently, building up interests in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. However, this is the first time it has moved into container packaging in Europe. Amcor's European sales were ADollars 367m in the year to end-June, out of a group figure of ADollars 5.5bn.</p>

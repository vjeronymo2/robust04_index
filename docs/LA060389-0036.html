			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEAR GAS FIRED AT BEIJING PROTESTERS;  </P> <P> RIOT POLICE FORCE DEMONSTRATORS BACK FROM COMMUNIST PARTY HEADQUARTERS  </P> <P> Thousands of soldiers marched to the edge of Beijing's Tian An Men Square early  today only to be turned back by protesters, but in midafternoon security forces  began using tear gas against a crowd outside Communist Party headquarters.  </P> <P> Hundreds of riot police fired tear gas to push back a huge crowd from the gates  of Zhongnanhai, the Communist Party compound where many leaders live and work,  witnesses told Western reporters.  </P> <P> Several thousand troops appeared at about the same time outside the nearby  Great Hall of People facing Tian An Men Square to confront prodemocracy  protesters, the witnesses added.  </P> <P> The witnesses also said that at least 30 people were beaten by police outside  the Beijing Hotel.  </P> <P> The midafternoon confrontation unfolded after an earlier attempt to move  soldiers to the square during the predawn hours had failed.  </P> <P> A main column of about 5,000 unarmed soldiers advancing from the east was  blocked at 3 a.m. by an unyielding crowd of about 8,000 people and a hastily  assembled barricade of trucks. The soldiers retreated after a brief shoving  match with the front lines of the protesters just a few hundred yards east of  the square, which has been occupied for the past three weeks by pro-democracy  student demonstrators.  </P> <P> The crowd was protecting the students camped in the square, who now number  about 5,000, and also trying to prevent destruction of a 30-foot-high "Goddess  of Democracy," modeled after the Statue of Liberty, that was erected in the  square Tuesday morning.  </P> <P> Protesters broke into applause as the sweaty soldiers, looking tired and  humiliated, silently marched back in the direction from which they came. "An  enthusiastic send-off!" shouted some in the crowd, made up of both students and  ordinary Beijing residents.  </P> <P> A similar scene was repeated on the same main street, Changan Avenue, on the  opposite side of the square. An American television crew reported that  thousands of people massed around an army truck and several buses near the  Minzu Hotel, about two miles west of the square. Although most of the troops  appeared to be unarmed, citizens discovered automatic weapons and clubs inside  more than one vehicle.  </P> <P> Additional troops, some wearing what appeared to be gas masks, had been  advancing behind the vehicles, United Press International reported.  </P> <P> At least two busloads of troops and an officers' jeep made their way slightly  closer to the square before being trapped by swarms of protesters, who let the  air out of the jeep's tires, surrounded the buses and angrily lectured the  troops that they should not use force against the students gathered in the  square.  </P> <P> Another group of about 300 soldiers approached the square from the north and  was trapped by the crowd in a side street just west of the famous Beijing  Hotel, very near the spot where the main column of troops from the east was  blocked.  </P> <P> Throughout the evening, foreign eyewitnesses shared information about what was  happening, and many foreign correspondents, including a large number of  television crews, moved freely through the downtown area. Authorities made  virtually no effort to enforce martial-law restrictions and rules against press  coverage imposed Thursday, and journalists thus could piece together a fairly  broad picture of the night's events.  </P> <P> A young man stood on top of one of the troop buses trapped west of the square  and shouted to the crowd: "People, rise up!"  </P> <P> "I support it," said a middle-aged man in blue workers' clothes who stood  beside his bicycle, smiling and laughing at the extraordinary scene. "I simply  cannot stand to have troops enter the city."  </P> <P> Others in the crowd said they were out in the street because they back the  students' demands for freedom and democracy.  </P> <P> There were relatively few political chants during the confrontation. But some  in the crowd shouted, "Li Peng, step down!" in a call for the resignation of  China's hard-line premier, and one group carried a banner declaring, "Oppose  martial law!"  </P> <P> Li's resignation and the lifting of martial law, which Li declared on May 20,  have become the two most immediate demands of the student protests. The  protests originated in mid-April with demands for freedom of the press,  improved treatment of intellectuals and an attack on official corruption.  </P> <P> The retreating soldiers appeared bedraggled and demoralized. The Associated  Press quoted one soldier as saying, "If I'm going to die, I want to die on the  battlefield, not on Changan Avenue."  </P> <P> The true destination and purpose of the troop advance was not entirely clear.  It appeared possible that the initial goal of the night-time march could have  been simply to move the troops into position in secure buildings near the city  center, rather than immediately confronting the students camped in the square.  </P> <P> Some of the soldiers who came from the east said they had marched all the way  from suburban Tongxian, about 15 miles outside the city. By dawn, the lead  members of this group had withdrawn nearly four miles from downtown, but other  soldiers in the group had stopped and fallen asleep near a subway station only  about three miles from Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> It also seemed possible that authorities expected to be able to clear the  square but miscalculated the degree of public resistance. This is what  apparently happened during the first weekend of martial law, when citizens  first blocked the army troops on the outskirts of Beijing.  </P> <P> Also, the number of citizens in the square after midnight today was unusually  high because of an incident Friday evening in which a police van or military  vehicle traveling at excessive speed on the west side of the city ran down  several pedestrians or bicyclists. Accounts of the incident varied, but it  appeared that at least one person was killed and three others seriously  injured.  </P> <P> Many people who were already in the square angrily demonstrating over this  incident were in the front lines of protesters who blocked the troop movements.  </P> <P> Even so, observers found it hard to believe that whoever ordered the troop  advance really thought the square could be cleared without violence.  </P> <P> "What the hell did they expect?" commented a Western defense official shortly  after dawn. "If they send soldiers in unarmed and unprepared, the students are  going to block them."  </P> <P> This Westerner added, however, that the inability of the army to enforce  martial law does not necessarily show any incompetence on the part of troops  and officers, but rather reflects the continuing power struggle and lack of  political consensus at the top level of the Communist Party.  </P> <P> The mood among the students in Tian An Men Square as the troops advanced was  one of quiet tension and determination, mixed with a belief that the army would  not use violence against them.  </P> <P> "We will stay here and resist with all our strength," said one student after  the troop advance was reported over student-run loudspeakers. "We will struggle  for democracy and freedom."  </P> <P> As dawn approached and it became clear that another night would pass without  the soldiers reaching the square, the loudspeaker in the square began  broadcasting popular music hits.  </P> <P> "The students are worried, but they're excited, because so many citizens are  against the soldiers," said a young university instructor who went to the  square around dawn.  </P> <P> "They're happy," said one of the students camped in the square. "Now there have  been several attempts like this, and each time the people have blocked the  soldiers."  </P> <P> This man said that the students are strong because whatever happens now, they  win -- either by winning concessions leading to democratic reforms, or by being  suppressed.  </P> <P> "Being suppressed is also victory, because it would show the whole nation that  the government treats the people as the enemy," he said. "The people would see  the fearsome face of the government and hate it. The people would understand. .  . . The students don't care what the government does to them."  </P> <P> Today's pre-dawn events came after the defiant students in Tian An Men Square  received a boost Friday from a popular singer, Hou Dejian, who together with  three intellectuals, announced the beginning of another hunger strike in  support of the demands for greater freedom.  </P> <P> "The students have done everything they could but now they are getting tired  and they need our help," said Hou, 36, according to a report by Reuters news  agency. Hou gained fame as a singer in Taiwan, but settled in China several  years ago.  </P> <P> Hou will fast for two days and his three colleagues will not eat for three  days, after which others are expected to replace them, Reuters reported.  </P> <P> A group of about 800 students from the East China city of Nanjing have set off  on foot in a planned 625-mile march to Beijing in support of protesters here in  the capital, according to foreigners in Nanjing who spoke by telephone with  reporters.  </P> <P> A loudspeaker announcement in Tian An Men Square said the marchers were  expected to arrive on June 20, the tentative date for the opening of a session  of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's  legislature. Students are demanding that the legislative session lift martial  law and dismiss Li from the premiership.  </P> <P> Friday also was a day of competing government-organized and student protests,  some of which bordered on street theater of the absurd.  </P> <P> A government-sponsored rally on the outskirts of Beijing took on a sharp  anti-American tone, with three Chinese men dressed up as Uncle Sam wearing top  hats emblazoned with the U.S. flag. The intention, apparently, was to imply  that the United States is behind the student protests.  </P> <P> The protest involved about 10,000 peasants, officials and school children who  were brought to a sports stadium, United Press International reported. There  they watched one of the men dressed up as Uncle Sam manipulate a black paper  heart bearing the name of astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, China's leading dissident.  Along the rope were tied pieces of white paper marked "American dollars."  </P> <P> UPI reported that the listless and undemonstrative crowd chanted, "Down with  Fang Lizhi."  </P> <P> Pro-democracy student demonstrators, reaching deeper into a so-far bottomless  reservoir of innovative ideas, staged a raucous parody of recent  government-organized demonstrations. About 500 students, some displaying  swastikas and wearing masks of pigs or demons, staged a march ridiculing  martial law and chanting, "Oppose Freedom! Oppose Freedom!"  </P> <P> Their antics drew cheers and gales of laughter from onlookers, United Press  International reported.  </P> <P> "Official profiteering is not a crime. Patriotism -- that's a crime," shouted  the students in the parody protest. "Support Li Peng. Support Dictatorship. . .  . Suppress the patriotic students!"  </P> <P> They later bicycled to the offices of the Beijing Daily, where they burned  copies of the official newspaper to express anger over state-orchestrated  condemnation of their six-week-old pro-democracy movement, according to reports  by the Associated Press and Reuters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1. -- A column of about 5,000 white-shirted People's Liberation Army troops  from the Tongxian area, an eastern Beijing suburb, moved westward on Changan  Ave. and was stopped by crowds of people in front of the Beijing Hotel. It then  turned back eastward.  </P> <P> 2. -- A group of about 300 troops moving from the north reached the west side  of the Beijing Hotel, about 100 feet north of Changan Ave., where it was  blocked by citizens on a side street.  </P> <P> 3. -- Hundreds of troops in an army truck and several buses moved from the west  along Changan Ave. and were blocked by the public near Xidan Street.  </P> <P> RELATED STORIES: Fang Lizhi speaks out.

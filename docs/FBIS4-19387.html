			<p>BFN     [Text] Serb forces have taken control of most strategic  points surrounding Gorazde. This has resulted in a mass exodus  of civilians toward the city center, to where the small UN  contingent has also withdrawn. One of the British soldiers  seriously wounded this evening has died of his injuries. In  Washington, President Clinton said tonight that one should be  firm with the Serbs but avoid provocation. This evening the  defense minister, Francois Leotard, reacted too:    [Begin Leotard recording] The behavior of the Serb side is  extremely worrying. It is the continuation of ethnic cleansing  in Gorazde, as in Sarajevo, as elsewhere. This is unacceptable  for the international community and for France. Our soldiers  are there to end the acts of violence and hatred which run  against the grain of European culture. We fervently wish that,  through the talks currently underway, the Serb side will  understand that it cannot win through force, and in the face of  the international community territorial and other gains rejected  by the other parties. France will continue to try, with special  care, through its presence on the ground, through its diplomats  and the action of its foreign minister, Alain Juppe, to obtain a  peace settlement, which represents the only solution to this  conflict.

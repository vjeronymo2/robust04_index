			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Lorenzo wins new hearing on 'fitness' MR Frank Lorenzo, the controversial former head of Continental and Eastern airlines, yesterday won a second chance to persuade the US authorities of his fitness to start a new low-cost airline serving the US east coast. The Transportation Department ordered an administration law judge to re-open a hearing of Mr Lorenzo's application because the public interest required 'a fuller examination of the important questions raised in the case'. Last month the judge recommended that Mr Lorenzo's application be turned down, saying that although Mr Lorenzo's company, ATX, had financial backing and management skills, it lacked the 'proper compliance disposition'. The Transportation Department said the judge's decision 'insufficiently develops such important issues as the managerial competence of key officers and the relevance of past safety violations of carriers operated by ATX principals'. Mr Lorenzo's attempt to re-enter the airline business has created controversy because of his bitter battles with the airline unions at Continental and Eastern in the 1980s.</p>

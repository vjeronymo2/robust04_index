			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / BCCI: BCCI audit doubts go back to 1979 The principal auditor to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International raised serious concerns about the bank's operations more than 12 years before it was closed by regulators in July 1991. Whinney Murray Ernst &amp; Ernst, which is now part of Ernst &amp; Young, the international accountancy network, wrote to Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, founder of the bank, in 1979 demanding that it be allowed to audit more companies within the group. It also expressed worries about the failure to be able to obtain independent audit confirmation for funds deposited by and with companies within the BCCI group. A three-page letter shows that the firm said it would refuse to continue as auditor unless it took 'complete audit responsibility' for several related companies audited by other firms. These included BCCI (Overseas), CFC, ICIC (Overseas) and associated companies in the Cayman Islands, through which many of the manipulation of accounts took place. It also demanded to become auditor to Kuwait International Finance and - by 1980 - to BCP of Switzerland, two of the principal conduits through which it has since emerged that funds misappropriated by the bank were channelled. The firm did not become auditor to most of these concerns, but agreed to remain auditor until 1986, when it again demanded that it become sole worldwide auditor. At this point BCCI appointed Price Waterhouse to take on the role. The letter was written on April 11 1979 to Mr Abedi as president of BCCI Holdings in Luxembourg from Mr Alan Middleton, a partner with Whinney Murray who was hired some years later by BCCI. It said it had been denied access to the reports of the group's internal audit department and complained of the need for consultation earlier during its annual audit. The firm said it was giving 'serious consideration' to opening its own offices in Grand Cayman and would 'definitely proceed' if Mr Abedi reappointed it. It added that it was willing to be reappointed on the terms given and 'on the assumption that the fee on which we agree represents a fair reward for our services'. It says using a single firm should stabilise or reduce the total audit costs. Mr Elwyn Eilledge, senior partner of Ernst &amp; Young, said yesterday that he knew about the letter and that the firm's concerns were met. He said BCCI persuaded the firm that it was already using reputable auditors for its other subsidiaries and need not change them all.</p>

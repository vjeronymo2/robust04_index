			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=2 --> _Link comprehensive systems of care with HIV/AIDS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clinical research trials resulting in increased access for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently under represented populations of children, youth, women,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and their families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Funding Categories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Two categories of projects will be funded in FY 1994. Applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which do not fall within these program categories will not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first category of grants, the HIV Demonstration Projects for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Children, Adolescents, and Families, continues development of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprehensive care demonstrations, including efforts to develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> innovative models that foster collaboration between clinical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> research institutions and family-centered primary/community-based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical and social service programs for children, youth, women and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their families. Projects will focus on local capacity-building,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making maximum use of all available public and private resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for reaching and providing health care and supportive services to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the target population. Projects should strengthen the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infrastructure for the comprehensive system of care by broadening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the coalition of agencies, providers, community organizations and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families participating in services planning, coordination, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financing. These include other appropriate Federal, State, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local programs serving children with special health care needs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under Title V Maternal and Child Health programs, hemophilia  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment centers, Ryan White Title I, II and III programs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administration (SAMSHA) and Centers for Disease Control and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prevention (CDC), and other programs serving the target population  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., Medicaid, developmental disabilities, special education) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers, payers, organizations, and support groups in the private  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sector with a similar focus.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Preference for funding in this category will be given to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competing renewal of currently funded Pediatric/Family AIDS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Demonstration projects serving children, youth, women, and families  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infected with or affected by the HIV infection which demonstrate an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established model of a comprehensive and coordinated system of care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is culturally-competent, family-centered, and community-based.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This means that these projects will be funded ahead of new groups  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of applications in this category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second category of funding will be used to initiate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of comprehensive care systems for HIV affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children, adolescents and families in cities or states where there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is no currently funded pediatric health care demonstration project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nor well organized care system for the target population and where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there are barriers to access to care and clinical research trials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants for funding in this category will be supported for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial planning activities to develop their infrastructure for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprehensive care with the ultimate goal of a mature demonstration of family-centered, community-based coordinated care described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Category (1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Availability of Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Approximately $22.0 million is available for the HIV Demonstration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program for Children, Adolescents, and Families, of which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately $10.3 million will be available for competing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> renewals and new competitive grants. The following is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximation of funds available and the number of grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anticipated to be awarded in each category:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=2 --> _Category (1)_$10.0 million, up to 20 grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Category (2)_$.3 million, up to 4 grants. Individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grants are not expected to exceed $75,000 per year. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> For Category (1), project periods are three years. For Category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2), project periods are from one to two years, depending upon the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed scope of work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Special Concerns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> HIV Demonstration Program for Children, Adolescents, and Families  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grantees supported by HRSA should coordinate their projects with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other Federal, State, and local programs concerned with AIDS and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serving the target population of children, youth, women and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families affected by or at risk for HIV/AIDS, particularly Title V  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maternal and Child Health programs and other Ryan White programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

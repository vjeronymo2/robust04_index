			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / World Trade News: US wants Gatt round over by end of year THE Clinton administration is quietly expanding its focus from 'gridlocked' Washington to the deadlocked Uruguay Round with the intention of completing negotiations by the end of this year. The president's meeting today with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is seen as crucial to the success of the final push. So will be the Tokyo summit of the Group of Seven top industrial powers in July. Trade officials from the 'quad' (the US, EC, Canada and Japan) met this week to lay out a work programme in the hope of achieving substantive progress for the summit. The focus was market access issues, key to both the Round's conclusion and Congressional approval. Mr Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, has been assembling a new domestic team, generally described as bright, aggressive, and politically astute. Although largely untested in the trade arena, all too soon it must cope with the most complex and intractable trade talks. Among the neophytes is Mr John Schmidt, a Chicago mergers and acquisitions lawyer, whose appointment to succeed Mr Warren Lavorel as US co-ordinator for multilateral negotiations is still unofficial. Mr Schmidt, who is reported to have been studying up his new brief, was a campaign fund raiser. It is not clear when he would take up his new duties; Mr Lavorel is tipped to succeed Mr Charles Carlyse as Gatt's deputy director-general in Geneva, probably in June. Mr Rufus Yerxa, Deputy US Trade Representative in Geneva, will provide the only continuity in the political appointments, moving to Washington in the Number Two trade spot, and working initially on the side agreements for the North American Free Trade Agreement. Ms Charlene Barshefsky, an international trade lawyer, will bring to the Number Three job a thorough knowledge of the issues. She is being criticised, however unfairly, for having represented companies in Mexico, Canada and Japan. The agreement between the US and the EC to negotiate an expanded market access package is highly satisfactory to US industries comprising the Zero Tariff Coalition, which had to battle both Gatt officials and the US government for recognition that manufacturing needed concrete benefits from the Round. The industries, including paper, wood products, non-ferrous metals, account for about 30 per cent of the US merchandise trade, but they are facing significantly higher tariff barriers than their competitors. US officials seem resigned to accepting the farm trade deal, negotiated by Mrs Carla Hills, former US Trade Representative, and EC trade officials last November. But they are insisting that agricultural products - both processed and raw commodities - be included in a comprehensive market access package to compensate the US farm sector for its slight gains thus far.</p>

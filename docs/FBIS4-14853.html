			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 4 TASS -- Spokesman of the Russian  president Vyacheslav Kostikov denounced former Vice-President  Aleksandr Rutskoy for becoming a "mouthpiece" of extremists "who  try to kill the sprouts of civic accord" in Russia.    "The mourning ceremonies were used for the sake of rude  historical falsification", Kostikov said in a statement on  Monday referring to opposition rallies held over the weekend to  mark the six-month anniversary of the October 3-4 armed revolt.    "People who had nearly unleashed a civil war in Russia,  including the recently freed rebels, tried to pose for innocent  victims, moreover, for judges accusing the president", Kostikov  said.    Hopes that the amnesty to anti-Yeltsin rebels would sober  them up do not come true, according to Kostikov. "In this  connection it is especially urgent to consolidate all sound  political forces around the unifying idea of the agreement on  civic accord. Extremism must be stopped", the statement reads.</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> STORM DELAYS SKI CHAMPIONSHIPS  </P> <P> Opening competition in the 1989 NCAA Ski Championships was delayed today by a  "typical March snowstorm" that dumped more than 1 foot of snow on the courses.  While the women's giant slalom competition was scheduled to get off at 10 a.m.,  it first was pushed back until 11 a.m. and then until noon because of the  strong storm. Men's competition, originally set for 11 a.m., was pushed back an  hour and then postponed until 11 a.m. Friday. The changes were made because of  continued heavy snow from the Pacific storm system and fog that drastically cut  visibility at the Jackson Hole Ski Resort.  </P></p>

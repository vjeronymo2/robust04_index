			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Arts: Out of the Ordinary - Fringe theatre in London This new play, for only two people, is a comedy about a common paradox: a woman's need to be (a) dependent on (b) independent from a man. Less obviously, it also concerns a man's need to be (a) independent from (b) dependent on a woman. The breakdown of a relationship, and of both people's nervous systems, is just around the corner throughout. Meanwhile, the woman's nerves are in the foreground. She is irritable without him, is irritable with him; she can't work with him there, can't work without him; she can't go outside without him, can't go outside with him. Not all of this is funny, or meant to be. And the play's skill lies in its ambiguity of viewpoint. Much of the time, the woman, Betty, is enough to drive anyone crazy, whereas her man, Brian, is a model of new-man patience. Occasionally, though, you feel that her neurosis is a lot more interesting than his endless courtesy. You also start to feel that he is actually the more passive of the two; and that he needs her more than she him; even that his very reasonableness is a safe facade he dare not drop. Certainly his petty lies and conventional euphemisms enrage her. He comes back from having an over-long drink with a friend who 'sends his love,' he pretends he hasn't been smoking, and then he asks about her evening. 'The Chippendales popped round,' she snaps. 'They fucked me senseless . . . They send their love as well.' Her rudeness is out of all proportion - yet you sympathise. Or do you? She is terribly lifelike, and yet wholly absurd. She forever makes impossible demands of him: even 'You don't pull down the barriers I put up for you.' An incidentally remarkable feature is that the same woman, Debbie Isitt, is the writer, director and actress. She plays Betty as a rapidly mumbling or whining Brummie who seldom gets out of pyjamas; Brian (Mark Kilmurry) is a more lucid speaker, a more natural communicator - altogether more wretchedly normal. He gets things done; she cannot even post a letter for him. She insists, however, that, for all her panicky incompetencies, she is capable: 'I could handle anything if it actually happened. It's just the thought of it that I can't stand.' The scenario at first seems so thin, and so nearly maddening, that you think 'This isn't enough for a play.' Soon, however, the absurd claustrophobia of the relationship becomes so all-important that any sub-plot or extra characters would only weaken its fabric. Eventually, we see that there is a plot; that somehow the relationship has to change. Betty isn't a little housewife; she is a modern woman with a career of her own as a critical writer. The play interleaves her relationship with Brian with her feminist scrutiny of the male/female relationships in Hitchcock films. Here is one element that is too thinly fleshed out; Brian's work life is another. Out of the Ordinary is only 90 minutes long, and one of the best things about it is the way it ends - not with a feminist bang but a male whimper. At the Theatre Upstairs, Royal Court</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / BA strike set for Tuesday THOUSANDS of air travellers face possible disruption to flights after British Airways cabin crews set next Tuesday as the date for the first of a series of one-day strikes. 'We will definitely close down domestic, European and Concorde services unless BA agrees to further talks over the new pay and conditions,' said the TGWU general union, which represents 2,600 of the airline's 2,900 cabin crew. BA has conceded that, if the strike attracts strong support after midnight on Monday, short-haul services will be disrupted. It is thought unlikely that Concorde will be affected. The union said it was expecting all members to support the strike call, but officials admitted privately that it was impossible to predict how many members actually would strike. BA said it was planning a normal schedule on Tuesday. The company said the ballot for the action had produced only a 121 majority in favour of action, in a turnout of about 70 per cent. An earlier ballot, which produced a bigger majority, was ruled unlawful. 'We are hopeful that short-haul crews will report for work on Tuesday and that we will operate all our domestic and European services without inconvenience to passengers,' BA said. The company said it had no plans for talks with the unions. BA said it had reached agreement on a new pay and conditions deal with pilots and ground service staff, adding that the cabin crew union negotiators had supported the deal. BA's proposals mean pay cuts of up to Pounds 2,000 a year for about 500 crew working in Birmingham and Manchester. There are about 3,000 short-haul crew nationwide. Next year, crews will receive pay rises only if inflation is above 4 per cent. The union says the new contracts BA has issued strip employees of important negotiating and disciplinary rights. During the last one-day strike by cabin crew in August 1989, 350 out of 600 rostered staff stayed away from work.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Munich -- The Landshut Public Prosecutor's Office  has initiated preliminary investigations against Republikaner  Chairman Franz Schoenhuber for slandering Ignatz Bubis, chairman  of the Central Council of Jews in Germany. A decision as to  whether there is sufficient reason for initiating investigations  cannot be expected before Easter, Senior Public Prosecutor  Bernhard Brenneis told DPA on Tuesday [29 March].    Before investigations are started, the European Parliament  will have to lift Schoenhuber's immunity. Schoenhuber's  accusation of "instigation" against Bubis has been met with  dismay from all parties.</p>

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Soap war rivals set to clash again This weekend national newspapers will again be carrying full-page 'soap wars' advertisements, as Unilever defends its new-generation detergent, Persil Power, against last weekend's onslaught by arch-rival Procter &amp; Gamble. The advertisement in today's papers from Lever Brothers, UK subsidiary of the Anglo-Dutch group Unilever, is headlined 'Why this aerial bombardment?' in a clear reference to Procter's com-peting soap powder, Ariel. Last weekend Procter took advertising space to proclaim that 'only Ariel washes so clean yet so safe'. Persil Power was not named in the advertisements, but there was reference to the manganese-based 'accelerator' which is at the centre of the row. Unilever is promoting the accelerator as the ingredient which allows superior stain removal at lower washing temperatures. Procter says the accelerator could damage garments, causing fading and holes, and claimed in its advertisements last week that residues left in clothes could continue to cause damage even if consumers switched to another brand of detergent. Those advertisements led to a complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority, the advertising watchdog, by Lever Brothers on Monday. Lever Brothers is challenging the test results quoted by Procter and disputes the claims of product superiority made for Ariel. This weekend's Lever Brothers advertisements reiterate the results of tests com-missioned from independent institutes which are said to have found Persil Power causes no damage to fabrics. At the same time, says Lever Brothers, some of the tests showed 'significantly superior cleaning performance' by Persil Power when compared with 'another leading concentrated powder'. Mr Tim Hammond, Lever Brothers' detergents marketing director, said that the new product launch had taken Persil to the number one slot in the UK detergent market. 'Persil Power has been used in 50m washes by families across Britain - all of them using product containing the revolutionary accelerator,' he said.</p>

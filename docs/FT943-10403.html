			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Drop in new-car sales causes little concern New-car sales fell by 2.5 per cent last month to 34,489, from 35,376 in the same month last year, the first monthly decline this year. July is the slowest month of the year for new-car sales as buyers postpone purchases until August to take advantage of the change in the registration prefix. The August sales period accounts for about a quarter of UK new-car sales. The small fall last month caused little concern among manufacturers, who forecast that sales this month would rise by between 13 per cent and 14 per cent year-on-year. Ford, UK market leader, said August registrations could total 500,000, challenging the August 1989 record of 500,112. In contrast to the decline in new-car sales, registrations of new commercial vehicles increased in July by 24.2 per cent to 8,739, from 7,038 a year ago - one of the biggest monthly rises this year. The UK has led the European new-vehicle market out of recession. In the first seven months of the year new-car sales rose 13.3 per cent to 990,752, while new commercial vehicle registrations increased by 15.2 per cent to 120,109. Ford, Vauxhall and Rover, the three leaders in the UK market, all suffered significant falls in registration volumes last month, with Ford sales falling 11 per cent year-on-year and Vauxhall sales falling 12.3 per cent. Vauxhall took over temporarily as market leader from Ford, with a market share of 20.9 per cent compared with Ford's 18.7 per cent. However, overall it lost ground in the first seven months, its share falling to 17.1 per cent from 17.3 per cent in the same period a year earlier. Ford raised its share from 21.7 per cent to 22 per cent. Rover also lost market share in the UK, in contrast to its success in continental Europe. The biggest gains among leading manufacturers were by Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen of Germany, the Italian Fiat group and Renault, the French state-owned company.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS - JANUARY-JULY 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           July 1994            July 93                      Volume    Change %    Share %   Share %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total market         34,489      -2.5       100.0    100.0 UK produced          13,816     -13.3        40.1     45.0 Imports              20,673      +6.3        59.9     55.0 Japanese makes        3,109      +2.8         9.0      8.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ford group            6,501     -11.0        18.9     20.6  -Ford                6,441     -10.5        18.7     20.3  -Jaguar                 60     -43.4         0.2      0.3 General Motors        7,259     -12.7        21.1     23.5  -Vauxhall            7,197     -12.3        20.9     23.2  -Saab*                  62     -43.1         0.2      0.3 BMW group             4,917     -23.7        14.2     18.2  -Rover**             4,531     -22.9        13.1     16.6  -BMW                   386     -32.0         1.1      1.6 Peugeot group         3,314      +3.9         9.6      9.2  -Peugeot             2,108      -1.6         6.1      6.1  -Citroen             1,206     +11.6         3.5      3.1 Volkswagen group      3,445     +27.8        10.0      7.7  -Volkswagen          2,358     +30.5         6.8      5.1  -Audi                  544     +43.2         1.6      1.1  -SEAT                  270     +34.3         0.8      0.6  -Skoda??

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOALS PROVING ELUSIVE FOR SCIENCE EDUCATION;  </P> <P> FUNDING: THE MANY CONFLICTING IDEAS ON HOW TO REVAMP THE SYSTEM ARE ONLY ADDING  TO THE GROWING CRISIS.  </P> <P> In setting ambitious achievement goals for science education, President Bush in  his State of the Union address Wednesday night spotlighted one of the nation's  most thoroughly documented problems. The abysmal state of science education has  been chronicled by more than 300 studies in recent years.  </P> <P> Now comes the hard part: There are as many conflicting ideas on how to revamp  the system as there are reports.  </P> <P> "We know what the goals are. But we still don't know how to achieve them," said  James Rutherford, a leading science educator. "One reason we can't make any  headway is we haven't had a clear national strategy on how to get from where we  are to where we want to be."  </P> <P> As a result, there is disagreement on virtually every issue, such as whether to  encourage or ban the use of calculators and computers, whether to concentrate  on basic science literacy for all or for only the best and brightest, whether  to delay math training until students master reading and writing and whether to  focus resources on mentoring and other support systems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Agreement on Need  </P> <P> The only consensus is on the critical need for more federal leadership and  funding. But while the new Bush budget proposals represent a start in that  direction, there is a long way to go, experts say.  </P> <P> Just last week the private Economic Policy Institute here, in an analysis of  education spending from kindergarten through grade 12, put the United States in  14th place among 16 industrialized nations in such spending as a percentage of  national income, ahead of only Ireland and Australia.  </P> <P> The burgeoning crisis in science education is unprecedented since the Russians  launched Sputnik in 1957 and triggered a new emphasis on science education.  </P> <P> The concern comes amid foreboding forecasts that the overwhelming majority of  new workers entering the work force by the year 2000 will be female, black and  Latino -- groups that have fared the worst in science education.  </P> <P> Yet there is reason for hope, judging from the few nascent attempts to  restructure science education around the country, including some in California.  </P> <P> Sets Goal to Be Best  </P> <P> In his speech, the President simply declared, without getting into specifics:  "By the year 2000, U.S. students must be first in the world in math and science  achievement."  </P> <P> Bush also mentioned several other "education goals" to be achieved by that  year, including a high school graduation rate of "no less than 90%."  </P> <P> Despite the lack of details, educators were pleased by Bush's mention of  education, in general, and the goal he set for science and math, in particular.  </P> <P> "That's a refreshing breeze," said Bill G. Aldridge, executive director of the  National Science Teachers Assn. "We certainly don't need any more studies."  </P> <P> Here's what some of those studies show:  </P> <P>  -- 29% of all high schools have no physics teacher, 17% no chemistry teacher  and 8% no biology teacher.  </P> <P>  -- The typical high school biology textbook introduces more new words than the  first two years of a foreign language class.  </P> <P>  -- Student disenchantment with science appears to take hold about the 8th  grade. While 5th graders rank 8th among industrialized nations in science, by  the time they reach 9th grade, they have dropped to 15th, according to National  Science Foundation data.  </P> <P>  -- Of high school students who enter college intent on pursuing a science  career, 40% drop out after the first course and 60% by graduation.  </P> <P>  -- College enrollment in science courses is at an all-time low and industry  already is feeling the shortage.  </P> <P> The Aerospace Industries Assn. said that 67% of its members -- including most  of the top Pentagon and NASA contractors -- are suffering from a shortage of  scientists and engineers. And 55% report a shortage of skilled production  workers.  </P> <P> In all, the NSF predicts a shortfall of 560,000 scientists and engineers by  2010.  </P> <P> To meet such a demand if the graduation rate for white males in those areas  remained steady, U.S. colleges and universities would have to graduate twice as  many women, five times as many blacks and seven times as many Latinos --  beginning this year, says the congressionally chartered Task Force on Women,  Minorities and the Handicapped in Science and Technology.  </P> <P> In the Administration's new budget, the NSF would get a 14% increase, to $2.38  billion, including $251 million for science education. Moreover, according to  White House Science Adviser D. Allan Bromley, the Administration intends to  double the foundation budget by 1993, from the base year of 1987.  </P> <P> In overall federal funding for science education, the President is proposing a  26% increase, from $841 million to $1.06 billion, spread among numerous  agencies, such as the NSF, the Department of Education, the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Energy and the National  Institutes of Health.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Project 2061 Launched  </P> <P> Among the new attempts to reform science education is Project 2061, launched by  the American Assn. for the Advancement of Science. It is named for the year  that Halley's Comet will next pass Earth.  </P> <P> The project's current three-year phase enables teams of 25 teachers in six  school districts, including the cities of San Diego and San Francisco, to work  four days a month -- and daily each summer -- to design experimental K to 12  curricula, according to Rutherford, AAAS's chief education officer.  </P> <P> A shorter-term, federally funded project, launched by the National Science  Teachers Assn., is designed to come up with new science core programs for 7th  through 12th graders that abandon the century-old "layer cake" approach, which  requires 10th graders to take biology, 11th graders chemistry and 12th graders  physics, Aldridge said.  </P> <P> The goal, he said, is to expose more students -- especially women and  minorities -- to a broad spectrum of science topics earlier but less intensely.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE CHANGING WORK FORCE  </P> <P> The nation's pool of talent for new scientists and engineers by the end of the  century will be predominantly female, minority or disabled -- the very segments  of our population we have not attracted to science and engineering careers in  the past.  </P> <P> An estimated 42.8 million persons will enter the overall labor force between  1988 and the year 2000. The breakdown:  </P> <P> White Women: 35.2%  </P> <P> White Men: 31.6%  </P> <P> Black Women: 6.9%  </P> <P> Black Men: 5.7%  </P> <P> Hispanic Women: 6.8%  </P> <P> Hispanic Men: 8.3%  </P> <P> Asian and Other (Women): 2.6%  </P> <P> Source: Bureau of Labort Statistics' Task Force on Women, Minorities and the  Handicapped in Science and Technology.  </P></p>

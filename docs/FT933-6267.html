			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Markets: Six years on, memories of the crash revive - Wall Street AMERICANS cannot resist anniversaries. They are not content with making a big fuss of just the nice round numbers like 10, 20 or 25 years. Anything that happened this time any number of years ago is an excuse for a party, a commemoration, or for the chance to sell a few million more greeting cards. In fact, why wait a whole year? This week, New Yorkers who work at the World Trade Centre observed the six-month anniversary of the day the twin towers were bombed. At least the Floridians who suffered at the hands of Hurricane Andrew's fury had the patience to wait 12 months before remembering their disaster. So, it was no surprise this week when Wall Street analysts pointed out that the US stock markets reached their pre-crash high six years ago this past Wednesday. On August 25 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 25 points to 2,722. Just a few weeks later, of course, the great crash of October wiped a staggering 36 per cent off the Dow's value. The point of noting this particular anniversary, of course, was to suggest, none too subtly, that history might repeat itself. After all, this week the Dow rose on August 25 to an all-time high of 3,652.09. And, in the two trading days that followed, the average failed to advance past that mark, slipping back amid profit-taking. Could this be an omen? Are the markets heading for the kind of calamitous event that made October 1987 (not to mention August 25 1987) such a memorable date? Few really think so, for 1993 is different from 1987 in one all-important characteristic. Six years ago interest rates were rising - a key ingredient in any big market correction. Today, interest rates are falling - and to record low levels, to boot. While no one is discounting the possibility that stocks may struggle to sustain their present highs, and could even suffer some kind of setback, the consensus among Wall Street analysts is that as long as interest rates stay low, the markets should be in good shape. It is difficult to over-state the role interest rates have played in the 1993 bull market. It certainly has not been the robustness of the economy that has propelled share prices to such heights this past year. August has been a case in point. Equities have performed extraordinary well in spite of the fact that the economic news has been less than encouraging. So far this month, stocks have risen on all but six of 19 trading days, and only once (in yesterday's morning session) did the Dow register a double-digit decline. Countless record highs have been set in August and the volume of trading has been surprisingly heavy for what is traditionally the busiest holiday month of the year for market practitioners. Investors have been buying stocks because interest rates have been falling - and falling fast - thanks to a still-struggling economy, low inflation, and a shortage of new bonds. At the start of August, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond stood at 6.56 per cent. By yesterday morning, the yield had dropped to 6.08 per cent, the lowest it has been since the Treasury began issuing 30-year bonds on a regular basis in 1977. Short-term rates also have fallen sharply this month: the yield on the two-year note has dropped from 4.1 per cent to 3.8 per cent. With interest rates so low, stocks are attractive to investors seeking returns better than the 2 to 3 per cent available on short-term assets like certificates of deposit and money-market funds. One problem, however, is that stocks look expensive at the moment, at least by historical standards. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 is trading at 23.5 times earnings. Until recently, this did not seem to matter much. However, in the last month or so, it has been noticeable that investors have become more careful about where they invest their money. The search has been on for stocks that have missed out on the summer rally, or simply those that have underperformed the rest of the market. Thus, over the past couple of weeks, consumer product stocks such as Procter &amp; Gamble, Coca-Cola, Pepsico and American Brands have been in favour. Many consumer stocks have had a difficult 1993, and so are among some of the few bargains left in the market. Philip Morris is among them, although this week the stock lost a lot of its recent gains when the tobacco and foods group decided not to raise its quarterly dividend.  ----------------------------------- Monday        3605.98  -  09.50 Tuesday       3638.96  +  32.98 Wednesday     3652.09  +  13.13 Thursday      3648.18  -  03.91 Friday        3640.63  -  07.55  -----------------------------------</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Ukraine says Russia is violating CIS accord on nuclear weapons: The struggle over control of parts of the former Soviet nuclear arsenal and ownership of the Black Sea Fleet UKRAINE's defence minister has accused Russia of violating an agreement among former Soviet republics on the control of nuclear weapons and of using its forces stationed in his country to subvert Ukrainian independence. In a rare interview, Gen Konstantyn Morozov said the nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus were now under the direct control of Russia's defence ministry rather than under the joint command of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the ill-defined successor body to the Soviet Union. This, he said, was contrary to an agreement signed by members of the CIS in Alma Ata, the Kazakh capital, when the USSR collapsed in December 1991. Gen Morozov's comments mark a significant worsening in Ukrainian-Russian relations. They raise the prospect of an intensifying struggle between Kiev and Moscow both over control of parts of the former Soviet nuclear arsenal and over the ownership and location of the Black Sea Fleet, which have been in dispute for nearly two years. The tenor of his comments also confirms that Ukraine is becoming increasingly unwilling to give up the 176 inter-continental ballistic missiles and nuclear-armed strategic bombers on its territory while its conflict with Russia is unresolved. Ukraine's delay in ratifying the Start 1 strategic arms limitation treaty and in acceding to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has soured its relations with the west and threatens to upset the entire international disarmament process. 'Currently the Russian ministry of defence controls all the nuclear weapons in all the former Soviet republics,' said Gen Morozov. 'We are the only republic that is sticking by the CIS agreement.' The defence minister said this arrangement was plainly unsatisfactory and that western security would be better served if Ukraine had the practical capacity to block the use of nuclear weapons on its soil, rather than the purely political veto it is permitted under its accord with Russia. 'For a long time these weapons have been aimed at the US. In my view it would thus be convenient for the world if Ukraine had technical control over the non-use of these weapons,' he said. It would be 'technically possible,' he added, for Ukraine to acquire such capacity unilaterally, although it had no current intention of doing so. President Leonid Kravchuk has consistently vowed that Ukraine will ratify Start 1 and accede to the NPT as a non-nuclear state. But parliament has yet to hold a formal debate on these issues, and pro-nuclear sentiment is growing as Ukraine comes under increasing pressure from the west and Russia. The Russian parliament insists it will not ratify the Start 2 arms control accord signed by Presidents George Bush and Boris Yeltsin in January until Ukraine fulfils its commitments. On the Black Sea Fleet, Gen Morozov said negotiations were going 'very badly'. He accused Russia of using the fleet, stationed in Sebastopol in Crimea, to siphon off Ukrainian assets and politically to destabilise the region, to which Russia has asserted territorial claims. 'By politicising the Black Sea Fleet issue, it (Russia) is making the situation in the entire Crimean peninsula more acute,' he said. 'It is my view that Russia is trying to use its presence in Crimea to exert pressure on the government in Kiev over Ukrainian independence.' Gen Morozov said if Russia would not agree rapidly to a division of the fleet, then he would demand that Moscow remove it in its entirety from Ukraine. 'If Russia insists on maintaining a presence in Sebastopol, Ukraine cannot accept this position,' he said. 'I will demand the withdrawal of all ships of the Black Sea Fleet as a foreign army, and we will build our own fleet, although this would be a great loss. We cannot give part of our territory to another power under any circumstances.' Editorial Comment, Page 13</p>

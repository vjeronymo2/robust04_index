			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Mainland moves the market: Shares in Chinese companies are hot property in Hong Kong The appearance on the Hong Kong stock market today of Denway Investments, a holding company for state-owned automotive assets in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, is the clearest example of the transformation that is taking place in Hong Kong's financial markets. The stock market - which has been dominated by property companies, financial institutions, trading houses and utilities - is broadening to encompass large manufacturing and industrial companies, many of which are based in China and controlled by official interests on the mainland. The result is that four and a half years before its reversion to Chinese sovereignty, Hong Kong is laying claim to the title of 'China's financial centre'. Local and international demand for Chinese assets has grown sharply over the past 12 months. For investment managers the reason is plain. Says Mr Robert Lloyd George, chairman of Lloyd George Management, one of the fastest-growing fund managers in Hong Kong: 'There is no more exciting economy in the world than China's. It is the emerging industrial power in Asia and Hong Kong has the market to play it; it is like Tokyo 30 years ago.' The Denway issue set a record for the Hong Kong market in the level of oversubscription for a new issue. Investors found HKDollars 240bn (Pounds 21bn) for 330m shares valued at HKDollars 400m, or 657 times the amount on offer. The best a single investor could have done in the allocation was just eight 'board lots', the tradable parcel of shares on the colony's bourse, or 16,000 shares in total. For that amount he would have had to bid for 10m shares and put up HKDollars 12.2m. Popular interest in Denway came as little surprise. New issues - especially those involving mainland companies - have become a one-way bet. They are usually underpriced and successful applicants in the primary issue are able to make considerable sums by immediately selling a stock when it is listed. Denway's current 'grey market' price is more than twice its HKDollars 1.22 a share issue price. But of more significance than the ability to 'stag' an issue has been the influence on Hong Kong of economic reform and liberalisation in China. Last year, the country's Gross Domestic Product grew by more than 12 per cent. Economists' forecasts of continued strong growth this year has strengthened international business interest in China. Not even the current difficulties Hong Kong is having with Beijing about its political development have doused investor interest in what are locally known as 'China plays' or 'red (pace Marx) chip' stocks. Such stocks will increasingly become available to international investors. In the next 12 months nine large Chinese state enterprises - embracing petrochemicals, brewing, ship building, steel and machine tools - will be brought to the Hong Kong market. They will differ from Denway, which is a Hong Kong incorporated holding company, and Brilliance China Automotive, a Bermuda registered company, brought to the New York market last September, in that they will be incorporated under Chinese law. This presents a difficult test for merchant bankers because many Chinese companies comprise much more than businesses; they often include schools, hospitals and housing and are responsible for the provision of welfare for their workers. Consequently, it is difficult to place a value on the companies and estimates of the aggregate amount of capital to be raised for the nine vary widely. Forecasts range from HKDollars 7bn to as much as HKDollars 25bn. But the long-term significance for the Hong Kong stock market of the flotations exceeds the amount of capital to be raised. The new issues, merchant bankers believe, reflect a decision by the Chinese regulatory authorities to make Hong Kong the main market for raising foreign capital for corporate China. Underlying merchant bankers' confidence was the barely disguised official anger at the approval given to Brilliance to list in New York. It slipped through a gap in regulation created by the transfer of responsibility for stock exchange matters to the Securities Regulation Commission (SRC) from the People's Bank, China's central bank, late last year. The SRC moved quickly in January to prevent Shanghai Petrochemicals - one of the nine - from seeking a primary listing in New York, as its adviser Merrill Lynch was encouraging it to do. It was told to list in Hong Kong. The reasoning of Chinese officials in their preference for Hong Kong is is simple and turns on the colony's reversion to Chinese sovereignty on July 1 1997. On that date, China will have a stock market run on western lines and backed up by western regulation and Hong Kong's version of British common law, ensuring property rights. But most important for mainland companies is the Hong Kong dollar's fixed rate against the US dollar. This means that Chinese companies raising funds in Hong Kong will effectively be raising fully convertible, dollar-backed, funds. Already Hong Kong has become a significant capital market for mainland companies and Hong Kong companies expanding in China. Warburg estimates that of the HKDollars 73.5bn of gross equity (equity before dividends are subtracted) raised in Hong Kong last year, the amount raised for Chinese companies and China-related business ventures was nearly HKDollars 20bn. This year Warburg forecasts that capital raised for China and China-related ventures will be about HKDollars 35bn. Mr Ewan Cameron Watt, head of Far East research at Warburg Securities, expects that a second wave of Chinese state companies and western-Chinese joint ventures will follow the nine forthcoming listings and will bring structural change to the Hong Kong market. His views are echoed by Mr Andrew Bell, head of corporate finance at South China, a local brokerage, who estimates that up to 50 mainland companies could be lining up to seek a Hong Kong listing once the first nine have been digested. 'If the listing of nine succeeds - and with reputations and careers in China riding on their success, I think they will - then the gates will be open,' he says. Fund managers agree. Mr Lloyd George believes that, by the end of the decade, China-related listings in the Hong Kong market will account for 45 per cent of its capitalisation which he estimates will have grown to USDollars 900bn from USDollars 175bn in 1992. Foreign investors have been swayed by such predictions. Since last March, more than USDollars 1.5bn has been put into China investment funds. This compares with the USDollars 920m for the combined market capitalisation of both the Shanghai and Shenzhen 'B' share market - the only way, other than through Hong Kong, that international investors can own tradeable equity in mainland Chinese companies. But not all fund managers are convinced of the wisdom of investing in mainland companies listing in Hong Kong. Mr Oscar Wong, who manages GT Management's USDollars 30m China fund, for example, is sceptical about the prospects. 'On average I don't think they are very good companies and they will give foreign investors a bad impression of what is happening in China,' he says. 'They are not efficiently managed and it will take a long time to reorganise them.' But the Beijing government is determined to succeed in its plans to bring state enterprises to the capital markets of the neighbouring colony. For Hong Kong, success in this strategy will underwrite its own future. As Mr Archie Hart, head of research at Crosby Securities, notes: 'If Hong Kong has a future role it is as the financial capital of southern China.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- NEW LISTING OF CHINA STOCKS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Listing    Issue        No of       Capital                           date      price      shares (m)    Raised                                   (HKDollars)             (HKDollars m)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hai Hong Holdings         7/5/92     1.5          61.25      91.875 China Overseas           20/8/92     1.03        820        844.6 CTS                     11/11/92     1           400        400 Guangzhou Investment    15/12/92     1.05        425        446.25 Denway Investment        22/2/93     1.22        330        402.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Times over-     Price     performance                               subscribed     16 Feb       % change  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hai Hong Holdings                373          2.78          85.3 China Overseas                    99          1.39          35.0 CTS                              411          2.631        163.1 Guangzhou Investment             229          1,538         46.5 Denway Investment                657           n/a           n/a  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Closing prices as at 16/2/93 adjusted for warrant issue.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Crosby Securities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

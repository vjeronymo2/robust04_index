These funds may also be used to support professional meetings and conferences for the exchange and transfer of research concepts and findings related to the safety of nuclear power production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FY 94 ceiling for research grants to educational institutions is approximately $1,218,000.00. Of this amount, approximately $817,000.00 will be available for new grants. Because of this limitation, proposed grant budgets should be restricted to about $50,000.00 per year, with total project funding not exceeding $100,000.00 over a two-year period. Proposals for new FY 94 research grants should be submitted between the date of this Notice and May 20, 1994. Proposals received after May 20, 1994 will be considered for FY 94 funding to the extent practicable.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN: Grants Officer, Mail Stop P&hyph;841, Division of Contracts and Property Management, Office of Administration, Washington, DC 20555. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Leslie Mills or Dennis Tarner on (301) 492&hyph;7054.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On November 27, 1993, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a notice that announced the proposed availability of FY 93 funds for the NRC Grant Program. The NRC is revising that notice to provide information on their grant program for FY 94.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope and Purpose of This Announcement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Section 31.a and 141.b. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the NRC's Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research proposes to support educational institutions, nonprofit entities, state and local governments, and professional societies through providing funds for expansion, exchange and transfer of knowledge, ideas, and concepts directed toward the NRC safety research program. The program includes, but is not limited to, support of professional meetings and conferences. In addition, the NRC has a limited amount for research grants to educational institutions (see topics below). The FY 94 ceiling for these grants is approximately $1,218,000.00 with approximately $871,000.00 of this amount available for new grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this program is to stimulate research to provide a technological base for the safety assessment of system and subsystem technologies used in nuclear power applications. The results of this program will be to increase public understanding relating to nuclear safety, to pool the funds of theoretical and practical knowledge and technical information, and ultimately to enhance the protection of the public health and safety. In addition, each grant to an educational institution should contain elements which will potentially benefit the graduate research program of the institution, e.g., graduate student training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC encourages educational institutions to submit research grant proposals in the following areas:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Experiments and predictive modeling for thermal stratification, thermal stripping and flow-induced vibration in plant fluid systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Evaluation and modeling of phenomena associated with the addition of cooling water to a degraded core during various stages of a severe accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev, [no dateline as received] -- Vilen Semenyuk,  minister of power engineering, stated on 4 January that as of 1  January, reserves of fuel in Ukraine had fallen to an  unprecedented level -- three million metric tons of coal and 150  metric tons of fuel oil, which in fact is the emergency reserve.  Although energy consumption declined by 7.8 percent in 1993  compared with the previous year and even by 12.8 percent in  industry, energy consumption by the population increased by 30  percent. In addition, energy enterprises owe suppliers 4.1  trillion karbovantsi. According to information from the State  Committee for Atomic Energy, new nuclear fuel was not purchased  in the second half of 1993 because of a shortage of funds and  spent fuel was not transported to Russia. Available resources  should be exhausted in six months time.    Plans of the Ukrainian power engineering sector for 1994  include purchasing 26 billion cubic meters of gas, seven million  metric tons of fuel oil and 32 metric metric tons of coal  including 20 metric metric tons through direct agreements.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Cocoa and coffee surge - Market Report Prices of both COFFEE and COCOA soared in late afternoon trading at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday in response to a sudden spurt of speculative buying. July coffee futures ended Dollars 111 up at Dollars 2,295 a tonne after touching Dollars 2,305, the highest since late 1987. 'It was speculative buying,' said one trader. 'London triggered the buying and it spread to New York.' With no fundamentals justifying the rise an analyst described the coffee market as 'hysterical'. Traders said cocoa's late surge, which lifted the July position by Pounds 51 to Pounds 998 a tonne, was also technically driven and lead by investment fund buying. 'But the market still looks very strong,' one said, although noting London volumes were fairly low. GOLD built on its recent rally with a Dollars 3.55 rise to Dollars 387.75 a troy ounce.

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Warning of extra building society risk Credit rating agencies believe the UK government's plans to give building societies greater freedom could increase the risk profile of societies. IBCA, the European rating agency, said the plans, announced last week by the Treasury, had potentially negative implications for societies. While IBCA said it was not revising its positive view of societies 'for the moment', it appeared more conscious of the mistakes societies might make as a result of the changes than of the benefits to them. The government intends to allow societies to raise up to 50 per cent of their funds on the wholesale money markets; to wholly own a general insurance subsidiary dealing with house-related lines of insurance; and to carry out limited lending to businesses without it being secured against land. Moody's Investors Services, the US rating agency, was wary about the use societies might make of the new powers which, by definition, would raise their risk profile. 'Our ratings are stable but our outlook is cautious,' it said yesterday. Moody's highlighted the prospect of greater risk if societies increased the amounts they raised on the wholesale money markets in terms of short-term, confidence-sensitive funding. A report from IBCA focused on the increase in risk from moving into general insurance, and expressed scepticism about the merits of a building society lending to businesses. IBCA's doubt about the wisdom of societies' lending to business reflects the general view among society chief executives. But the agency's reaction to the proposal on general insurance is gloomier than that of the sector, which has welcomed the proposal. IBCA argued that general insurance in the UK 'has been almost characterised by its unprofitability', and suggested societies might make losses as well as profits in the increasingly competitive market.</p>

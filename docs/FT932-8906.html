			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / New chief of Iri may speed up sell-off THE APPOINTMENT of Professor Romano Prodi as chairman of Iri is being viewed as a strong signal of the Italian government's intention to push ahead with privatisation of the state holding company. His appointment at the weekend followed the arrest of Iri's chairman, Mr Franco Nobili, on Wednesday on charges of corruption. Mr Luigi Abete, head of Confindustria, the industrialists' association, welcomed the appointment of Prof Prodi, who resumes the post he left little more than three years ago. Mr Abete said it represented clear evidence of a desire to 'accelerate the process of privatisation'. Iri's 1992 losses are believed to be more than L4,200bn (Pounds 1.8bn) and group debts are L70,000bn. Mr Nobili is still being held in Milan's San Vittore jail as magistrates investigate allegations that he was involved in arranging kick-backs on contracts for two power stations both while he was heading Iri and in his previous role as chief executive of Cogefar, the private construction group. Prof Prodi, who is close to the Christian Democrats, headed Iri from 1982 to 1989. A firm believer in slimming down Iri he was frequently frustrated by political interference. He tried unsuccessfully to privatise SME, the foodstuffs and distribution group, and pushing this sell-off will now be one of his first tasks. Iri desperately needs to raise cash through divestiture to meet pressing financial commitments. Apart from SME, Prof Prodi is expected to turn his attention to delays in proposals for Iri to move out of banking through the sale of its stake in the commercial banks Credito Italiano and Banca di Roma. The return of Prof Prodi raises questions about the future role of Mr Michele Tedeschi, the chief executive who had been making decisions about current and strategic operations. Prof Prodi is likely to have a more hands-on role. Ian Rodger adds from Zurich: The Swiss Federal Banking Commission has asked Union Bank of Switzerland to comment on statements by Mr Florio Fiorini, imprisoned former head of the collapsed Sasea Holdings group, implicating the chairman of UBS in Italy's political corruption scandals. Mr Fiorini has told Geneva prosecutors Mr Nikolaus Senn, UBS chairman, assisted in the transfer of funds from Eni, the state-owned Italian energy group, through a UBS account in Lugano to the Italian Socialist party in the late 1970s.</p>

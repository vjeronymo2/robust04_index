			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KADAFI'S ACTIONS MAKE LIBYA AN EASY BUT NECESSARY TARGET  </P> <P> Col. Moammar Kadafi's combination of outdated ideology and state-of-the-art  weaponry makes him a threat to America's interests and Libya's neighbors. The  latest U.S.-Libyan clash -- in which American F-14s shot down two Libyan  MIG-23s over the Mediterranean -- is another periodic and necessary reminder  for him to curb his ambitions and trouble-making.  </P> <P> According to the Defense Department, the aerial battle took place during  routine U.S. maneuvers when the Libyan planes threatened the American patrol  over international waters. Although the incident occurred 600 miles away from  its new chemical-weapons factory, the Libyan action was no doubt related to a  fear that the United States would soon attack the plant.  </P> <P> Ever since he took power in September, 1969, just before his 30th birthday,  Kadafi has persisted in his megalomaniacal ambition to be the leader of the  Arab world. His hero is the late Egyptian President Gamal Abdul Nasser, whose  efforts to unite the Arabs and destroy Israel led to so much tragedy throughout  the Middle East. Kadafi's imitation would be farcical if not for the bloody  trail left by Libyan-backed terrorism.  </P> <P> Kadafi has repeatedly failed in his attempts to undermine or take over other  states. Neighboring Chad, with French assistance, beat back his invasion after  several years. His blatant and bullying interference in other parts of Africa  has made him an unpopular figure, particularly when his promises of aid were  never fulfilled. Kadafi has no real allies in the Arab world. Money and arms  have been supplied to terrorist and guerrilla groups ranging from the Irish  Republican Army to the Muslim nationalists of the southern Philippines, without  any appreciable gains for either Libya or its clients. If one considers only  Kadafi's lack of political victories or strategic gains, he is not a threat to  the United States.  </P> <P> But Kadafi's activities do pose a serious threat because of his responsibility  for terrorist deeds that kill or wound people, including Americans, and  destabilize other states. In the areas of terrorism, the proliferation of  chemical weapons and the Arab-Israeli conflict, Kadafi does jeopardize vital  U.S. interests:  </P> <P> Terrorism. Along with Syria and Iran, Libya is the leading sponsor of state  terrorism. It has supplied training sites, false documents, safe haven,  weapons, money and transport for a wide variety of terrorists. During the last  two decades dozens of murderous attacks would never have taken place if not for  Libyan assistance and, in some cases, direction. The Libyan government tried to  assassinate exiled dissidents, even on American soil. The United States tried  to deter Kadafi by commercial embargoes, and pressured its allies to follow  suit. Nothing worked.  </P> <P> After a particularly blatant terrorist attack on a club frequented by Americans  in West Berlin, the United States intercepted radio communications proving  Libyan involvement. In May, 1986, the United States retaliated with a bombing  raid on Libya. The results were dramatic: A badly shaken Kadafi virtually  ceased all his terrorist efforts.  </P> <P> This lasted about two years. But there were increasing reports that Kadafi  wanted to renew his activities, using terrorists from the Japanese Red Army --  a group that would be harder to trace back to Libya.  </P> <P> The reinitiation of Libyan-backed terrorism was timed to coincide with the  second anniversary of the raid on Tripoli. Last April the Japanese terrorists,  probably acting in concert with Lebanese colleagues, attacked a USO club in  Naples. Five people, including an American servicewoman, were killed. About the  same time, a Red Army terrorist, Yu Kikomura, was arrested on the New Jersey  Turnpike, apparently en route to bomb a U.S. target.  </P> <P> Libya has also been mentioned in connection with the bombing last month of Pan  Am Flight 103 over Scotland. If there is firm evidence of Kadafi's involvement  in this crime, the United States would seriously consider retaliation.  </P> <P> Chemical warfare. A more immediate issue is the news that Libya has  constructed, with the assistance of West German companies, a factory capable of  making chemical weapons.  </P> <P> Kadafi denied this accusation, claiming that the plant makes only medicine. But  his hollow alibi underestimates the effectivness of American intelligence,  including satellite surveillance of the installation. Iraq's blatant use of  chemical weapons against Iranian soldiers and Kurdish civilians has dangerously  lowered the threshold for employing such weapons. Kadafi is scarcely a  responsible leader -- he has long sought nuclear weapons, and the Egyptians  have accused him of once planning to sink the ocean liner Queen Elizabeth II --  and the prospect of his having mustard gas or nerve gas is quite chilling.  </P> <P> While protesting his innocence, Kadafi announced the building of a "defense  system" around the factory to protect it from "American terrorism" that, he  says, is aimed at destroying all Arab civilian industrial capacity. Obviously  fearful of another U.S. attack, he dubbed President Reagan a "stupid child" and  an "insane and mad dog." While the Libyan leader offered to allow international  inspection of the plant, U.S. intelligence sources reported that the Libyans  were moving the chemicals used in preparing poison gas so that the plant would  appear to be "clean." This nervousness may persuade Kadafi to back down to  diplomatic pressure. The United States is also trying to mobilize international  forces, at a conference on chemical weapons taking place this weekend in Paris,  for this purpose.  </P> <P> The Arab-Israeli conflict. Kadafi is one of Israel's most stubborn and ruthless  foes, and is trying to torpedo any progress on negotiations to resolve the  Middle East conflict. He has opposed Palestine Liberation Organization leader  Yasser Arafat's tentative moves toward moderation.  </P> <P> It can well be argued that Libya is an easy target for American military power.  It is weaker than Syria or Iran, and it lacks the degree of Soviet and Arab  support enjoyed by Damascus. But Libya should be aware of that fact, and this  very vulnerability should make it more cautious. Since Kadafi refuses to act in  even a marginally responsible manner, the United States will have to keep up  the pressure to force him either to compromise peacefully or to back down in  the face of force.  </P></p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / All-seat stadiums delayed The government yesterday backed down on its regulations for eliminating standing accommodation in football stadiums when it granted five English first-division clubs an extension of a year on the all-seat deadline of August 1. Derby County, Grimsby Town, Middlesbrough, Portsmouth and Sunderland will now be allowed until August next year to comply with regulations on stadium safety, established after Lord Justice Taylor's report on the Hillsborough stadium disaster in 1989. Eleven clubs applied to the Football Licensing Authority, which regulates ground safety, for more time to install seats. The authority consulted local authorities and the clubs themselves before making a recommendation to the national heritage department. The five clubs which won extensions are seeking planning permission to move grounds. The cases presented by Barnsley, Chelsea, Manchester City, Newcastle United, Oldham Athletic and Swindon Town were not deemed 'sufficiently strong' to warrant a government deferral. The authority said clubs needed to prove their cases were 'exceptional' and that failure to meet the deadline could not have been foreseen. The government said the clubs denied extensions had a further three weeks to show that meeting the deadline would be impossible. If the government is not satisfied with their reasons, they may be ordered to close their standing accommodation. The Football League, which represents all divisions except the Premiership, said: 'This is a decision we very much welcome. We have always argued that spending money on a ground that a club will leave in a few years is a waste of time.' The league said the clubs who were denied an extension would be disappointed, but it said: 'We believe the football clubs have had a fair hearing.'</p>

What  problems does the president's inner circle work on? These  questions are definitely of interest to many citizens of  Kazakhstan. Therefore we decided to pose these questions to  Imangali Tasmagambetov. Our choice is not accidental: Imangali  Nurgaliyevich has daily contacts with the president probably  more often than anybody else, participates in discussions of  various problems, and sees him during moments of rest.    [Question] Why not start the conversation with the question  of how you met the president?    [Tasmagambetov] It was in 1989, on the eve of the  organizational plenum of the Central Committee of Kazakhstan  Komsomol [All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League], to which  Nursultan Abishevich was invited. On the agenda were  multicandidate elections for first secretary, with six  contenders on the slate. Before the plenum began, Nursultan  Abishevich gathered all six and announced over a cup of tea:  "Consider us acquainted. I completely trust your plenum and am  ready to work with whoever is elected."    FROM OUR FILE. Before becoming the president's aide,  Imangali Tasmagambetov had worked as a teacher, first secretary  of the Atyrau Oblast Komsomol Committee, and first secretary of  the Kazakhstan Komsomol Central Committee, as well as chairman  of the republic State Committee for Youth Affairs. Candidate of  philosophy. Married. Father of three. The youngest--a son--just  turned one month.    [Question] Did you study in Atyrau?    [Tasmagambetov] No. I graduated from the Department of  Natural Sciences and Geography of the Urals Pedagogical  Institute. Its distinction lay in its preservation of the  traditions established by talented scholars from Moscow and St.  Petersburg. Many are no longer with us, but the traditions  remained in Uralsk. I consider myself very lucky to have  graduated from this school.    [Question] Was your candidate thesis in philosophy somehow  related to pedagogic issues?    [Tasmagambetov] Not quite. It was titled "Philosophical  Aspects of Ecological Problems." The topic, as you may see, is  on the border of two sciences--geography and biology. The task  was to attempt to analyze, by comparing the interrelations of  various social groups, their views on ecological problems.    [Question] You see in your line of work how the president's  team is formed. Our readers will probably be interested to know  about this process.    [Tasmagambetov] Forming a team is a complex process, since  we  are talking about putting together a collective of like-minded  people. This means it is necessary not only to find intelligent,  competent specialists. It is also necessary for each person who  comes to work here to be able to see the problem they are facing  from the viewpoint of the state. And while in the past  candidates for high-level positions were selected from among  people with "practical experience," now everyone in the  president's circle must be first and foremost an ideologue,  whether we are speaking of banking or a market economy.    [Question] How many specialists are there working on the  president's team?    [Tasmagambetov] Three hundred and ninety persons in  positions  of responsibility.    [Question] That is all?!    [Tasmagambetov] Yes. You are surprised, but some people may  think this is too many. I will tell you for comparison that just  a few years ago the apparat of the VLKSM [All-Union Leninist  Communist Youth League] Central Committee, which I knew, had  more than 1,000 staff in positions of responsibility. Now we are  talking about the apparat of the president of a large state. You  cannot economize on talented specialists. We are used to  economizing, and that is why we live such a life...    [Question] But people not only come. To put together a  perfect team, you have to let some go...    [Tasmagambetov] This is very painful. And not only for those  who have to leave. I have noticed that Nursultan Abishevich  takes it very hard when he has to part with someone. And the  main reason is not personal qualities but the loss of the sense  of the times: For a number of reasons a person cannot work in  the dynamic rhythm life demands of us, does not perceive the  logic of change.    [Question] By the way, speaking about dynamics. What does  the  president's day look like?    [Tasmagambetov] His schedule is very busy. As a rule, no  days  off. Take, for instance, a recent day--10 March. From 0900 to  0930 the president prepared for his working day and reviewed  documents. At 0930 he received the leaders of another state. At  1030 at an expanded meeting he listened to the report on  recently held elections. From 1200 to 1600 (with a break for  lunch) he conducted intensive negotiations with representatives  of the Chevron company. From 1600 to 1800 listened to a report  on the progress of privatization in Semipalatinsk Oblast. From  1800 to 2000 the president looked through business mail,  conducted telephone conversations with top officials of oblasts  and the republic. At 2000 he began studying documents related to  a brief visit by Geydar Aliyev. From 2100 to 0030--meeting with  Aliyev and a press conference for journalists on the results of  the visit.    [Question] Are you with the president the entire work day?    [Tasmagambetov] Yes. I am at work by 0800 in order to  prepare  all the necessary information for the president, and go home  half an hour to an hour after Nursultan Abishevich leaves, after  "transcribing" his comments and proposals regarding the next  work day.    [Question] What else is included in your duties?    [Tasmagambetov] Together with members of other departments,  I  study and analyze the sociopolitical situation in the republic.    [Question] How do you manage to sustain such a pace?    [Tasmagambetov] I have to. You should ask whether the  president has any chance to rest.    [Question] Consider it asked.    [Tasmagambetov] Generally, it is practically impossible to  talk him into taking some rest. But sometimes he does cave in  and leaves for an hour to shake off the stress on the tennis  court. I have noticed that tennis is the best way for the  president to relieve tension. Once a week is an absolute  necessity. And also--songs. You will be surprised, even  professional performers are surprised, that Nursultan Abishevich  knows by heart a tremendous number of songs--both modern and  folk. Generally, the Nazarbayevs are a very musical family. As a  example I will tell you an incident that took place in America  during a reception given by Vice President Gore. Gore told his  guests what a wonderful singer Nursultan Abishevich is,  recollecting his visit to Kazakhstan. The guests began to  applaud and asked him to sing. They came out as a  trio--Nursultan Abishevich, Sara Alpysovna, and their daughter.  They sang together, and then Dariga sang a song on Abay's  lyrics. And finally the Americans were totally elated when they  heard Dariga sing an Elvis Presley song in English. Nursultan  Abishevich joked later: "All the things you have to do for your  country!"    [Question] Does Nursultan Abishevich visit his native parts?    [Tasmagambetov] Over the seven months that I have been  working with the president, this has happened only once, when he  went to a class reunion on the occasion of his school's  anniversary.    [Question] We have been talking to you for an hour now, and  we have noticed, Imangali Nurgaliyevich, that during this time  you were twice asked for an appointment. And you did not say  either "yes" or "no." Is this diplomatic finesse?    [Tasmagambetov] This is reality. I understand very well that  in both instances an appointment is needed on an urgent matter.  But there is a tight schedule, and it is very difficult to  squeeze anything in. Therefore, both meetings had to be moved to  another time, after coordinating with the president. Right now  the president's schedule is filled by the hour for a month  ahead. International visits are scheduled and discussed half a  year in advance.    [Question] What particularly concerns the president today?    [Tasmagambetov] First and foremost economic issues. The  president is not satisfied with the progress of reform in the  republic. Therefore, in the second part of April and in May a  considerable amount of time will be devoted to the country's  economic problems, in order to define in detail the strategy and  tactics of the reform. The second item that concerns the  president is preservation of stability and interethnic accord in  our society. You can put it this way: The president's  unchangeable credo at all times is the idea of a single economic  and spiritual space.    [Question] We are frequently visited by foreign consultants.  This practice is somewhat disturbing. Sometimes one gets the  impression that we know more about their life than they about  ours. But the spiritual and intellectual potential of our people  is certainly just as high. Can it be that we are short on  educated people?    [Tasmagambetov] I understand that many people now have an  opportunity to travel. And suddenly everybody began to  appreciate the advantages of a market economy. But visual  comparison is not the same as analysis; it is not a scientific  approach to the problem. Therefore we need to both send our  specialists there for internship and invite the most  authoritative specialists of the world here.    [Question] The president certainly receives a lot of mail.  And in that sea of mail surely there are some letters that  deserve attention from the viewpoint of economic  transformations. How does the president react to comments and  proposals from the local level?    [Tasmagambetov] You are right. There is a sack of letters  for  the president every day. We have a letters department, which  selects and sorts out correspondence. Nursultan Abishevich is  indeed interested in letters whose authors contemplate ways of  getting out of the crisis, problems of state importance, and  offer competent economic advice. Some of them the president  answers personally. All in all, however, there are all kinds of  letters--with words of support, gratitude; there are  congratulations on some or other occasion; and quite a few  complaints.    [Question] It is hard to imagine Clinton or Mitterrand  receiving complaints. We, however, have developed a habit over  decades: If anything happens--write to the newspaper or the  president.    [Tasmagambetov] Unfortunately, this is our reality. I cannot  reproach people for turning to the president with complaints or  requests at a time that is difficult in the socioeconomic sense.  Because this is the way it has been for decades, when we were  told that everything will be decided for you up there, at the  top. But the real question as I understand it is whether you  yourself have done everything possible to solve your own  problems and whether the letter really should go all the way to  the level of the president. I am convinced that when we achieve  economic well-being, the number of letters to the president will  not diminish. Perhaps only the character of the mail will change.    [Question] Do you ever argue with the president?    [Tasmagambetov] The president is a man open to a debate and  polemics. He is willing to listen to his opponent's arguments,  and if they sound convincing he will agree with the interlocutor.    [Question] Do you go on all trips with the president?    [Tasmagambetov] Almost all. I can even tell you the  figure--how many "flight" hours we have accumulated over the  past five months. It comes to more than 140 hours.    [Question] Much has already been written about the  president's visit to the United States. It was clear from  television reports that Nazarbayev and Clinton liked each other.  Did this happen right away?    [Tasmagambetov] I think that much depended on the personal  qualities of the two leaders. As to liking, it is only extended  to equals. The Americans could not fail to appreciate  Nazarbayev's sincere desire for democratic and economic reforms  and his enormous conviction of their necessity; his ability to  think in world categories, the desire to absorb the best there  is in world practice, and to build a truly secular state taking  into account historic traditions and multiethnic nature of his  people. After all, as the hero of a Marcel Proust novel said:  "...the world was not created just once; it is being created an  indefinite number of times."</p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOY THEME ADDS A PLAYFUL NOTE TO BALL FOR BOAT PARADE ORGANIZERS  </P> <P> At the check-in desk: foot-high mirrored pedestals spilling plastic dinosaurs  and roach-size racing cars and G.I. Joes.  </P> <P> Inside the ballroom: stuffed animals and model planes and building blocks and  games, piled into a little red wagon on stage and heaped on top of giant  gift-wrapped boxes near the entrance.  </P> <P> A symphony of toys, appropriately enough.  </P> <P> On Saturday, one corner of the Anaheim Hilton was decked out as a festive  playroom for the 400 guests of the Huntington Harbour Philharmonic Committee's  Grand Marshal Ball.  </P> <P> The dinner party was a thank-you for organizers of last December's boat parade  and Cruise of Lights fund-raiser. The parade and cruise, under the theme  "Symphony of Toys," raised more than $100,000 for the Orange County  Philharmonic Society's youth music programs.  </P> <P> Missy and Court Prowell were all-stars of the ball. Missy is the committee's  chairwoman and Court was last year's grand marshal.  </P> <P> How did they split their duties? "Easy," said Court, who led the parading  harborites in a friend's 84-foot cruiser. "Missy did all the work."  </P> <P> Sharing the ball's spotlight was Leon Statler, who was named grand marshal for  1990.  </P> <P> In the cocktail-hour crowd were Don Hartfelder, Ken Dickson and Otto Strehlow.  Hartfelder, who was grand marshal in 1978, joked that although it was a lot of  work, "I did anything and everything to get my boat up to the front of the  line."  </P> <P> Vern and Betty Mays sipped drinks with John and Marky Paugh, Jim Mitchell and  Meryle Hammatt. Both the Mayses and the Paughs have participated in the parade  for 18 years.  </P> <P> "So we're old hands," said Vern Mays.  </P> <P> "Young old hands," added his wife.  </P> <P> In line for souvenir photographs were young hands Dianne and Anton Flecklin and  Mary and Dwayne Lund -- two of the couples who rode the "newcomers' boat" in  the parade.  </P> <P> Younger hands Christine Bremer and Tracy Hardigree, juniors at Huntington Beach  High School, greeted guests and clowned with a mime circulating through the  crowd.  </P> <P> The ball was chaired by Isabel Greenwald, with help from Marian Galanis, Eva  Holmes, Arden Duckworth, Dorothy Johnson, Yvonne Kelley, Dorothy Silverman and  Phyllis Helland.  </P> <P> After cocktails, guests enjoyed a dinner of lobster-and-crab-meat ravioli,  grilled filet mignon and poached salmon, washed down with Korbel Brut champagne  and Bollo Chardonnay and Bardolino.  </P></p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Last-chance talks for NY Post NEW YORK Governor Mario Cuomo was yesterday involved in last-ditch talks to keep alive the New York Post after Mr Rupert Murdoch abandoned an attempt to buy the ailing newspaper on Friday, Martin Dickson writes from New York. Mr Murdoch, running the paper temporarily under a contract from the bankruptcy court, ceased publication on Friday, saying the Post's 11 unions did not give him enough cost concessions to make the paper viable. However, Mr Cuomo was at the centre of attempts to revive the negotiations and some officials hoped Mr Murdoch might be tempted back if the unions gave further ground. See Observer, Page 15</p>

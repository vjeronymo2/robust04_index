			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Czech Republic (4): A rich diet of adjustment - The economy is poised for rapid modernisation TWO question marks hang over the performance of the Czech economy in its first year of independence. The first concern is the impact of the German and wider European recession. The second is the rate of decline in trade with Slovakia which is no longer benefiting from an implicit subsidy of around Dollars 700m annually from Prague. Neither would be such crucial factors if the economy of the new Czech Republic with its 10m people were not so open. But the disintegration of the former Czechoslovak economy, and rapid rise in trade with the west, means nearly 50 per cent of the Czech GNP now derives from foreign trade. Last year exports to OECD countries rose 20 per cent, due mainly to sharply higher exports to Germany and other EC markets. Such exports contributed 3 per cent to GDP growth and provided the hard currency needed to pay for higher imports of machinery, technology and know-how needed to modernise the economy. Strong exports also financed the fast growing demand for formerly unattainable consumer goods imports which reflects rising real incomes after two years of sharp contraction. Czech exports are still a fraction of OECD imports. But, like the other central European states which have association agreements with the EC, they are concentrated in 'sensitive areas' such as basic chemicals, textiles, food and steel, and vulnerable to unproved 'anti-dumping' charges. The disintegration of the former Czechoslovak economy meanwhile, entails a self-imposed economic cost similar to that which followed the dissolution of Comecon, the former Soviet bloc trading group. This took place in 1991 without a payments clearance system to replace the old transferable rouble system. Learning from that experience Czech and Slovak negotiators took care to set up their own payments clearance system between the two republics. This is backed by a ECU130m credit facility. But that will not be sufficient to compensate Slovakia for the loss of the Czech subsidy which allowed Slovakia to import far more Czech goods and services than it exported to the Czech Republic. Economists estimate that a 10 per cent drop in trade with Slovakia, which in 1992 took an estimated 23 per cent of Czech exports, leads to a 1 per cent decline in the Czech GNP, and twice that for the much smaller Slovak economy. But there is a real possibility that trade between the two countries could decline by 30-40 per cent this year, unless special measures are taken to finance trade over and beyond the ECU130m clearing fund credit. In spite of these negative factors the small group of free-market economists who shape Czech economic policy believe that there is sufficient momentum in the Czech economy to ensure growth of between zero and 3 per cent in 1993. This contrasts with a 14 per cent GDP decline in 1991, the first year of radical market reforms, and a 7 per cent fall last year. The economy bottomed out in the third quarter of last year, according to Mr Ivan Kocarnik, the minister of finance and rose nearly 4 per cent in the fourth quarter. Inflation fell to 11.1 per cent last year from 56 per cent in 1991 while unemployment at 2.5 per cent, remained the lowest in the region. This is largely because the private sector has grown from virtually zero in 1989 to around 20 per cent of the economy over the past two years. The creation of more than 1m jobs in the private sector has compensated for labour-shedding in the state-owned sector, especially in the big factories and heavy industry generally. The new year, however, started with a one-off burst of inflation resulting from the introduction of VAT and other tax reforms. The government expects inflation on a year-to-year basis to end up between 15-17 per cent in 1993, of which 6-7 per cent is attributable to the VAT and other tax changes designed to widen the tax base and shift the tax burden on to individuals and consumption and away from enterprises. Independent economists, however, believe inflation could rise above 20 per cent. Mr Vaclav Klaus, the prime minister who spearheaded the economic reform process as minister of finance after 1989, notes that taxes on business were reduced from 75 per cent in 1989 to 55 per cent last year and have been cut again to 45 per cent as part of this years tax reforms. 'Our aim is to create a stable, low inflation, low tax environment for business,' he says. This is in response to complaints by business about the high corporation tax and the complicated calculations the reformed system of taxation demands. Mr Klaus rejects demands from foreign investors for special treatment as an aspect of the 'perestroika mentality' created by the old communist regime. This sought to attract foreign investment without having to change the system so it created a corrupting climate of special concessions and exclusions. As prime minister Mr Klaus still pays close attention to economic policy. He is backed by a team of competent macro-economists including Mr Josef Tosovski, governor of the Czech National Bank, Mr Karel Dyba, the economics minister and Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the trade and industry minister. Much has already been achieved. The Czechoslovak crown became internally convertible in January 1991. The divorce from Slovakia is expected to strengthen the economic fundamentals sustaining the Czech crown. Over the past two years consumer and producer subsidies have been eliminated, the budget has been roughly balanced with a small deficit representing less than 1 per cent of GDP, while foreign debt, inflation and unemployment are the lowest in the region. On the institutional front sweeping tax reforms, including better tax collection, have been introduced and impressive progress has been made in creating a new banking system and dealing with the problems caused by the collapse of Comecon trade. The related indebtedness of many state enterprises has also been partially resolved through the creation of a special Consolidation Bank where bad-debt write-offs are being financed by the proceeds of privatisation. Tens of thousands of Czechs who had properties confiscated by the communists after 1948 have had them reinstated and the first round of Central Europe's most sweeping mass privatisation programme (MPP) through vouchers appears to have been successfully implemented. It all adds up to a rich diet of change and adjustment after the stagnant decades of Soviet-imposed 'normalisation' which followed the invasion of 1968. But further changes take place next month which are expected to lead to even faster progress in economic and financial modernisation. Productivity is expected to rise sharply at the cost of a sharp surge in unemployment. The changes which come into effect in April include adjustments to the bankruptcy laws. These are designed to prevent uncontrolled, domino-effect failures while encouraging the closure of persistent loss-making enterprises and departments. At the same time the government will issue shares in the 1,500 enterprises privatised by the MPP. At this point the enterprises will have new owners and powerful shareholders from the nine biggest investment funds which intend to put their nominees on the board. The success of voucher privatisation means that foreign investors will now be able to bypass the cumbersome official privatisation process and buy shares or privatised companies directly from their new owners, or from the new, paperless electronic stock market which also comes into being in April. The demand from shareholders for a return on their investment is expected to lead to a significant labour shake-out and a sharp rise in private investment to modernise and rationalise the new acquisitions. Unemployment is expected to rise from 2.5 per cent to 8-9 per cent of the workforce by the end of the year.</p>

Zhejiang party committee Secretary  Li Zemin and Governor Wan Xueyuan spoke on some main issues on  Zhejiang's family planning work in 1994. Xu Aiguang, provincial  family planning commission chairman, reported on Zhejiang's  administration of population and family planning targets in 1993.    Liu Xirong, Zhejiang party committee standing committee  member and vice governor, chaired the meeting. Xu Xingguan and  other leaders were present.    Wan Xueyuan, director of the provincial task force in charge  of population and family planning and governor, affirmed  Zhejiang's achievements in family planning work. He said: In  1993, party committees and governments at various levels have  continually strengthened leadership over family planning work,  have strictly enforced the target management responsibility  system, have persistently provided respective guidance in  accordance with separate categories, and have resolutely handled  major issues and arduous problems. Consequently, family  planning work has been progressing favorably and Zhejiang has  fulfilled its scheduled population growth plan. However, we  cannot be optimistic over Zhejiang's population growth and  family planning. Zhejiang will be under high-birth periods in  1994 and 1995. High-birth periods for some cities and counties  in south Zhejiang will continue up to the early 21st century.  Zhejiang's family planning work has been progressing unevenly.  While carrying out family planning work under new  circumstances, Zhejiang has encountered some new conditions and  problems. He pointed out: Population issues are social and  economic issues. The faster the market economy develops, the  more we should strengthen family planning work. We should  firmly establish an overall view of population: We should  integrate population issues as well as population and family  planning work in the overall economic and social development,  and should strive to coordinate population growth with economic,  social, resources, and environmental development. At present,  population problems are still an important constraint  restricting Zhejiang's economic progress. In the course of  establishing the market economy, we will still be facing  population problems, which are major problems to be studied and  resolved. Party committees and governments at various levels,  particularly key leaders, should guide all the leading bodies to  pay close attention to population issues; should coordinate, on  their own initiative, with relevant departments so as to share  the tasks according to their different functions in an effort to  implement state policies on population; should ensure that  various policies and measures are conducive to family planning  work; and should comprehensively rectify population problems.  Zhejiang's specific targets in 1994 are: By the end of 1994,  Zhejiang's total population should be under 43.8 million; its  population growth rate should be under 1.492 percent; and its  population's natural growth rate should be under 0.839 percent.  According to the requirements for improving counties with high  birthrates, about six out of Zhejiang's 20 counties with high  birthrates should get rid of the "high birthrates" term.  According to the requirements on contraceptive management,  about a quarter of Zhejiang's counties should implement  contraceptive management in an all-around manner. According to  the requirements on qualified villages, 60 percent of Zhejiang's  administrative villages should be able to fulfill the family  planning requirements. Consequently, the overall standards of  Zhejiang's family planning work can be raised.    Li Zemin stressed at the meeting: We should establish an  overall view that economic and social development should be  coordinated with population growth. To attain a comfortably  well-off living standard by the end of this century, Zhejiang  should, first, sustain coordinated progresses in its economy,  and, second, control its population growth. Zhejiang will still  fail to attain a comfortably well-off living standard if it  messes up family planning work leading to an uncontrolled  population growth even though its economic indicators and  figures have been raised. When handling related work, we should  beware of future hardship, per capita share, individual  responsibility, and the overall situation. He urged: Various  localities should continually implement the system whereby party  and government leaders personally handle the tasks and are held  responsible eventually with each subordinate party committee and  government held responsible to those at the next superior level.  Party committees at various levels should annually hold two  meetings to study family planning work. They should incorporate  family planning work in the general programs for local economic  and social development; should make annual arrangements to study  problematic areas; and should strictly enforce relevant  discipline and laws governing family planning work. We should  regard the performance of family planning work as a criterion  for evaluating cadres' work performance: Promotion will be  denied to cadres who have not earnestly or effectively handled  family planning tasks. Party and government leaders should  study population theory. When handling related work, party  committees and governments should stress problematic and key  issues and basic tasks.    At the meeting, Governor Wen Xueyuan signed target  management  responsibility contracts on population and family planning with  responsible officials of various city (prefectural) governments  (administrative offices).    Attending the meeting were members of the provincial task  force in charge of population and family planning and principal  leaders of cities and prefectures.</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / World Bank on Debt: Russian debt move seen as likely to ease negotiations THE move by Russia to take on the external debt of most of the other former Soviet states should eventually make restructuring of the debt easier and hasten the return of the republics to international creditworthiness, the World Bank says. It adds, though, that the difficulties experienced in servicing the Dollars 67bn of debts of the former Soviet Union in the past year are likely to continue for some time. This is because of the 'large stock of arrears on FSU (former Soviet Union debt run up in 1992', and the fact that 52 per cent of the total debt falls due for repayment over the next three years. By the end of November, four republics had reached agreement for Russia to assume responsibility for their share of the former Soviet debts, while seven more were in negotiation. 'The emerging streamlined arrangement can strengthen the creditworthiness of all FSU republics, since it will establish a clearer legal status in negotiations with creditors,' the bank says. The bank attributes much of the present difficulty to the doubling of foreign debt in the five years before the Soviet Union broke up, fuelled by so-called 'perestroika loans' from western government agencies and banks. Further finance will be needed, though, before the former Soviet states can shake off this legacy. 'The restoration of external viability and creditworthiness of FSU republics will require a period of sustained economic reform which, to be successful, must be adequately financed,' the bank says. The bank also points to inadequacies in reporting and monitoring procedures in Russia and other republics, which have made the management of external debts more difficult. Most are now moving to adopt better debt-management policies, making it easier for the authorities to control the growth of foreign debts.</p>

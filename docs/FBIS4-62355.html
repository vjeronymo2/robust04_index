			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the  latest incidents in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the  border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. [passage omitted]    Although Azerbaijan signed the agreement for a cease-fire,  it  has violated the agreement several times. The NKR Defense Army  Headquarters Press Service has informed us that fighting  continued yesterday in Agdamskiy and Mardakertskiy Rayons.  Azerbaijan's military forces tried to penetrate the NKR defense  positions to reach Yusifdzhanly in Agdamskiy Rayon; however, the  defense units counterattacked. The enemy forces lost several  men and were forced to retreat to their former positions.    The NKR military subunits have succeeded in obstructing  several attacks in the northern and northeastern part of  Mardakertskiy Rayon. The Azerbaijan Military Command  Headquarters is trying to amass several units in those areas at  the present time.    Azerbaijan's military units fired on Vartashen in  Martuninskiy Rayon with Grad rocket launchers the night before  last night. Initial reports said two women were killed and 10  residents were wounded. The attack also caused material damage.    No incidents have taken place in the border region between  Armenia and Azerbaijan during the past few days. [passage  omitted]    However, the Armenian Ministry of Defense Press Center has  disclosed that the military units in Azerbaijan and the  Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic [NAR] violated the cease-fire  agreement in the northeastern and southeastern sectors of  Armenia's border last night. Azerbaijan's units in  Kyzylgadzhyly in Kazakhskiy Rayon fired on [place name  indistinct] and Bekaber in Idzhevanskiy Rayon with mortars,  tanks, and machine guns from 1920 to 2300 last night. The enemy  units in the NAR fired on [place name indistinct] in Sisianskiy  Rayon with machine guns from 2230 to 0100. Several people were  wounded in the attack. Our border guards remained committed to  the cease-fire agreement and refrained from launching  retaliatory operations.    The same source disclosed that no other incidents occurred  in  the border region between last night and this morning.</p>

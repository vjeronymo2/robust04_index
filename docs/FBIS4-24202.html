			<p>BFN     [Text] A prince of the Zulu royal family says about half of  King Goodwill Zwelithini's royal family is currently leading a  fugitive life, fearing that they will be murdered by the KwaZulu  Police [KZP]. According to the prince, he has received several  death threats from the KZP over the last few months.    These allegations are the latest development in the war of  words between Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi and the  Zulu royal family on the political and financial position of  King Goodwill in the Inkatha-controlled regional government of  KwaZulu.    Earlier this week members of the royal family issued a  statement in which Mr. Buthelezi is accused of mudslinging to  win Zulu support for his coalition with the ANC.    In turn, Mr. Buthelezi said that certain members of the  royal  family are trying to drive a wedge between him and King  Zwelithini.    Political observers said the king has been trying to  distance  himself from Mr. Buthelezi since the April election.</p>

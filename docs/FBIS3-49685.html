Teoman Erkan,  Turkish deputy minister of national defence, and Gen. Boyko  Noev, Bulgarian deputy minister of defence. The plan envisages  the exchange of visits by top military officials, the exchange  of specialists, the training of officers at Turkish military  academies, cooperation in the defence industry and military  topography.    Today Gen. Erkan, who is on a three-day official visit to  Bulgaria, was received by Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov.  The defence ministers discussed a range of problems concerning  the two countries' relations in a friendly atmosphere. They  expressed the shared opinion that conducting cooperation in  various fields contributes a lot to the promotion of  good-neighbourly relations in the Balkans.    The frank conversation Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov  and I had with Gen. Teoman Erkan gives enough ground to believe  that there are no insoluble problems in Bulgarian-Turkish  relations, Gen. Noev said on the Bulgarian National Radio.  "There is political will, there is friendship and mutual trust  between us," he said. "Today's meeting is a continuation of the  policy of the Bulgarian and the Turkish Government aimed to  advance further the friendly relations between the two  countries," the deputy defence minister said. "The step we took  today should be viewed both in the light of NATO's recent  decisions and its summit and within the context of Bulgaria's  strong desire for closer integration into the North Atlantic  structures," Gen. Noev added.    It was stressed during the exchange of opinions that the  effort of Bulgaria and Turkey to guarantee security in the  Balkans and expand cooperation in all spheres is a model to  follow which should be made known to still larger circles of the  international community, the BULGARSKA ARMIYA paper wrote today.

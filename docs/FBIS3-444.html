President Mangope called on the striking workers to outline  their problems, but they insisted that he should address them  first.    The strike, which has paralyzed most of the essential  services in the territory, has resulted in cancellations at the  many luxury hotels in the area, and Sun City has admitted that  it is being badly affected.    One of the demands by the strikers is the reincorporation of  Bophuthatswana into South Africa. Earlier today the  Bophuthatswana cabinet decided that the territory would not take  part in the election.</p>

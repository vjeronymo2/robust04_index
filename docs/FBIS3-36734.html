On 5 February of this year, villages in the so-called upper  zone of Gali Rayon were barbarically despoiled and burned down  by Gudauta militants, who arrived on 16 Ikarus buses and were  armed with 10 pieces of heavy equipment.    All this was carried out on the false pretext of the  elimination of Georgian guerrilla units hiding in the rayon.    The villages of Okhumi and Mukhuri were burned down. Some  100 residential houses were burned down in other villages.    About 3,000 civilians in the rayon who represented not only  Georgian but also other nationalities were driven by separatists  into the surrounding woods, where the snow level is reaching one  and a half meters. In effect, defenseless women and children  were condemned to death from cold and starvation.    In the village of Okumi, dozens of civilians were killed in  a  punitive raid carried out by Cossack militants.    This morning Abkhaz separatists, with the active support of  their North Caucasian hirelings, launched an offensive on  Tsalenjikha Rayon in western Georgia, where refugees from the  upper zone [of Gali Rayon] were trying to find shelter.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Nurses pay body rulings to be adopted Mr David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary, promised a Labour government would increase nurses' salaries in line with the recommendations made by their pay review body. All the pay review bodies for National Health Service employees would be free to make their own decisions, and the workers would get the increases they deserved. To cheers, Mr Blunkett said: 'That is our pledge.' Confirming that the internal market created by the present government would be replaced with co-operation, he said this would ensure that hospitals once again put the needs of patients first. The 'unaccountable' self-governing NHS trusts would be abolished and existing arrangements under which family doctors could opt to control their own budgets replaced. Mr Blunkett said all those involved in the primary care sector would be able to participate in prioritising and planning as part of a 'joint commissioning' process. He confirmed that tobacco advertising would be banned and compulsory competitive tendering ended. Delegates approved a resolution which pressed for the strengthening of laws on the licensing of medicines, and for pharmaceutical companies to be made more accountable for their products. Department of Health officials immediately attacked Mr Blunkett's call to abolish NHS trusts, saying that Labour was 'deeply wedded to the old and failed command and control doctrines'.</p>

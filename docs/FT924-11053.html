			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / CBI report adds to economic gloom: Further job cuts expected as business confidence and manufacturing output fall BRITAIN'S manufacturing industry is expected to cut 25,000 jobs a month at least for the rest of the year, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday. In the first of its quarterly Industrial Trends Surveys carried out since the departure of sterling from the European exchange rate mechanism, the CBI reported a sharp drop in business confidence and further falls in output over the past four months. The survey showed sterling's decline had improved confidence on export prospects, which rose to its highest level for more than five years. But slowing growth abroad was reflected in a growing number of companies citing foreign political and economic conditions as likely to limit their ability to win export orders. The more than 1,300 manufacturing companies responding to the survey remained overwhelmingly gloomy about the general business outlook with most expecting a further fall in output and orders. Output fell for the 11th successive quarter in the period to October, and with inflationary pressures remaining low, the number of of companies cutting domestic prices was the highest since the 1950s. Foreign exchange markets, already nervous about political uncertainty in Britain, reacted sharply to the survey. In London, sterling closed near its three-year dollar low at Dollars 1.5790, down almost 1 cent on the day and almost 7 cents this week. It finished 2 pfennigs down on the day at DM2.4225 and edged lower in New York, where it closed at Dollars 1.577 and DM2.4095. In early Far East trade today it was quoted at Dollars 1.58125 and DM2.411. Share prices were buoyed by prospects of another cut in interest rates, but gains were tempered by sterling's weakness, political uncertainty and the pessimistic CBI survey. The FT-SE 100 share index gained 8.2 to 2,669.6. The CBI survey - carried out between September 23 and October 14, but before the latest base rate cut - came a week after the British Chambers of Commerce predicted that the UK was falling into a 'second leg' of recession. Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs committee, said that cost and price increases remained extremely low despite the threat of rising import prices. He added that the lack of confidence among both businesses and consumers justified a further reduction in interest rates. 'But just as important is the need for the government to provide a clear and coherent explanation of its economic strategy now that the pound has been withdrawn from the ERM. 'That should include a commitment to maintain public spending on capital programmes while bearing down on the cost of providing public services', he said. The CBI survey showed investment intentions had weakened to their lowest level since July 1991, with fewer companies authorising increased spending on buildings, plant and machinery over the next 12 months. Expectations of price rises were the lowest for any quarter since October 1966. In the Commons, Mr John Smith, the Labour party leader, challenged Mr John Major, the prime minister, to explain how he could draw comfort from the CBI survey which, he said, predicted 'jobs will be down, output will be down, orders will be down, investment will be down and confidence will be down.' 'The British public are now sick and tired of failed economic policies, as well as bogus economic promises of recovery which are never ever fulfilled', Mr Smith said. Mr Major said the survey showed export optimism was up on July, output expectations were up on September and that, for the first time, more companies reported a fall in unit costs than those reporting an increase.

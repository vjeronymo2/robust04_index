			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Not on your life, say insurers: OFT disclosure plans threaten to revolutionise British insurance practices Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential, Britain's largest insurance company, loves to tell about the time he paid a sales call on a young woman policyholder. The woman, needing to look up the details of her policy, turned to the family bible. And there, on the flyleaf, was the policy number of every Prudential life insurance product ever owned by a member of her family. But now, the traditional relationship between customers and insurers is coming under attack from Office of Fair Trading proposals for a new disclosure regime that threatens to revolutionise the way life products are sold. Last week, the OFT said proposals by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, had 'significant anti-competitive effects' and did not give prospective customers enough information to help them make wise choices among products, companies or sales agents. The SIB rules were intended to replace the current regime under which shoppers learn almost nothing about how much they pay life insurance companies when they buy a policy. Now, the Treasury will examine the OFT report and will order the SIB to draft another set of rules for the industry if it agrees with the conclusions. The OFT proposals will, for the first time, allow Mr Newmarch's favourite customer to find out before she buys her next policy how much is being deducted from her premium payments to cover the Pru's costs. Also, she will learn how much the policy is worth if she surrenders before maturity and, if she bought the policy through an independent financial adviser, the cash amount of commission he will earn on the sale. The question is: will the effect of the additional information be to discourage the purchase of insurance products generally? And, will it encourage investors to seek low-cost products - or low-cost sales outlets - now that shoppers will know roughly how much each product costs? The Association of British Insurers, the industry trade association, thinks it knows the answer, but it does not like it. It intends to lobby against the proposals, saying they will add to the industry's costs and offer few benefits to consumers. Mr Tony Baker, ABI director of public affairs, says: 'It will serve to put people off from buying the product. It will have an unnecessary and unfair effect on life insurance sales.' That is the nub of the running battle between regulators and the life insurance industry since the Financial Services Act went into effect in 1987. 'The FSA was really a watershed,' said Mr Charles Cannon, partner at consulting actuaries Mercer Fraser. 'It came as a shock to the industry that life products were even deemed investments.' Mr Cannon notes that for decades, the life insurance industry had won tax breaks and a favourable regulatory regime by arguing successfully to parliament that it fulfilled a social function; that of providing for families after the death of breadwinners. The companies argued that they collected small bits of money from many people and invested the sums in British industry. So attractive were the tax breaks on insurance products and so loose the regulation that companies piled into the business; there are more than 120 insurance companies operating in Britain. 'Lets face it,' said the chief executive of one major company, 'these companies just opened the door and the money poured in.' In recent years, the insurance business has become exposed as regulators - and the financial press - came to grips with the heart of the business. 'It is fair to say that the more information which has become available about life insurance, the less attractive it looks,' Mr Cannon said. Figures in the OFT's report, for instance, show that by the 20th year of a 25-year endowment policy, a consumer cancelling the policy will only earn 40 per cent of its final face value even though 80 per cent of the premiums have been paid. A study last year by the SIB found that a quarter to a third of all life and pensions policies are cancelled within the first two years, a point at which most customers will receive only a small fraction of premiums paid as a refund. Public pressure for regulators to tackle life insurance has become acute. 'For one thing, the average consumer has become much more sophisticated about financial products,' said Mr Tom Pyne, chief executive of London and Manchester Group. 'Also, with so many companies in the business, pressure on sales has been acute.' For its part, the ABI blames the financial press, which has focused attention on poor early surrender values and high commissions earned by sales agents - precisely the information which will become more readily available under the regime sought by the OFT. Until now, the life insurance industry has convinced regulators that, unlike cars and refrigerators, insurance is so complicated it is impossible to tell shoppers exactly how much they will have to pay for it. This lack of transparency in price has allowed insurance companies to pass on their rising costs to consumers with no discernible effect on sales. And rise they have, according to observers. Mr Marshall Field, formerly a partner at actuaries Bacon and Woodrow, who prepared a report on sales commissions for Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, points out that there is no lack of competition in the industry. However, competition has been for sales outlets, not for consumers. By outbidding each other for sales agents, life companies found they could increase volumes substantially. 'The industry was not competitive in the true sense until relatively recently,' said Mr Geoffrey Westall, manager of the European life practice at consulting actuaries Tillinghast and Co. More competition under the OFT plan will bring about a restructuring of the industry and threaten life insurers in several ways. First, prospective customers will for the first time be able to compare the charges deducted from their premium payments. 'It will expose the charging structure of with-profits policies,' said Mr Pyne, explaining that such disclosures would inhibit the size of commissions that life insurance companies would be able to offer sales agents. Sales commission is the single biggest ingredient in the cost of a policy and very few consumers realise they are paying it. Second, and perhaps even more significant, is the OFT proposal that banks and building societies, which are the 'tied agents' of life insurers - they sell the products of one company exclusively - can charge less for the same product than other sales agents. Mr Mike Wadsworth, partner at consulting actuaries R Watson said the new rule was certain to sharpen the competitive edge of so-called bancassurance. This is assurance sold by banks and building societies through their own branches to existing customers. Mr Wadsworth argues that, in any case, life insurers would have had to come to grips with their distribution costs no matter what happened on the regulatory front. Competition from banks and European players eager to exploit the UK market presage a shake-out in any event. 'But regulation has been the sand in the oyster. Without it, the changes would not have happened so fast or been so far reaching,' he said. Already, bancassurance is a far cheaper method of selling policies than the cold-calling approach of traditional sales agents, he added. The average agent sells a single policy per week, the average bank-based sales agent sells four. While bancassurance is currently only 12 per cent of the UK market, Mr Wadsworth estimates it will be 30 to 50 per cent by the end of the decade. Thus the OFT, whose goal is fostering competition and protecting consumers, may be the unwitting instrument of a life insurance revolution. Banks and building societies will challenge the role of traditional insurance companies, the long-term endowment policy will become a relic and companies will be forced to cap sales agents' commissions. In the likely industry shake-out which follows, the survivors will be those who move most quickly to fit the new model.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NEW INDIVIDUAL LIFE AND PENSIONS BUSINESS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Year ending    Year ending    Change                               31/12/92       31/12/91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Annual Premiums               Pounds m       Pounds m         %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Assurances and annuities         1,855          1,993        -7 Personal pensions                1,117          1,114         -  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total annual premiums            2,972          3,108        -4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Single Premiums  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Assurances and annuities         8,186          6,396        28 Personal pensions                5,263          3,998        32  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total single premiums           13,449         10,394        29  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Association of British Insurers  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 4 May (EFE) -- Official sources reported  today that the Brazilian Foreign Trade Secretariat will be  investigating the alleged "dumping" (unfair trade practice) of  sausage casings imported from Spain and the United States [as  received].    The case began following a charge presented by the U.S.  Hoechst company against the Spanish company Viscofan. The two  companies are competing in the Brazilian sausage casings market,  which moves $10 million annually.    The investigation involves 2 million tons of this material  imported in 1993.    The sausage casings manufactured in Brazil by Hoechst are  more expensive than those imported from Spain by Viscofan, which  has businesses in Germany and is looking at opening a factory in  Brazil.    The Foreign Trade Secretariat will also begin an  investigation by mid-May of wheat imported from Germany at  subsidized prices. Argentina is the main wheat supplier for  Brazil.</p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLEWATCH  </P> <P> A Little Help From His Friends: Paul McCartney plans to perform a tribute to  John Lennon when he appears in Liverpool on June 28 at the King's Dock Arena.  </P> <P> The former Beatle has been rehearsing "Imagine" and "Strawberry Fields Forever"  during what representatives are calling a "specially created" new show that  will be more "Beatle-y." McCartney has also asked the audience to show up in  1960s gear such as bell-bottoms and headbands. The tribute is in part a  response to the recent heavily criticized Lennon tribute held in London where  several artists performed Lennon songs. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

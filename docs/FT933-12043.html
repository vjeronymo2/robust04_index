			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / NatWest Tower structure sound THE 600ft National Westminster Tower, a City landmark, has been found to be structurally sound after the IRA bomb blast in April. The severe damage caused to the building by the blast initially provoked fears that it might need to be demolished. The bank said it did not yet know how long it would take to get the tower back into use. The 1,700 people who worked there have been relocated to the bank's other buildings in the City.</p>

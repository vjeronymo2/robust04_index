			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has reacted strongly to  the U.S. Senate's condition that U.S. military aid to Turkey  "must not be used for internal security purposes." She said:  "We could reject the aid package." Ciller said she would  contact President Clinton on the issue and stressed that Turkey  will regard the condition on the aid package as a U.S. request  to "abandon the struggle against terrorism."    In a statement to HURRIYET yesterday, Ciller asserted: "The  U.S. aid can be subject to no condition. It will be very wrong  if the aid is reduced and linked with the condition that it must  not be used for internal security purposes. As far as human  rights are concerned, Turkey is waging a just struggle. We are  waging a struggle against terrorism. If the United States says  we `cannot use its military aid for internal security purposes,'  then we will take that to mean that `we must not wage a struggle  against terrorism.' If the aid is reduced and made conditional,  then it will mean that the United States does not approve of our  struggle against terrorism. But the whole world knows that  President Clinton supports our struggle. The Senate  Appropriations Committee's decision is confusing. The mistake  must be rectified. I will call President Clinton when I return  to Ankara to confer with him on the reduced and conditional aid  package. We could reject the aid if necessary."</p>

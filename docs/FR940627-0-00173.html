			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Administrator is required to assess the economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact of regulatory actions on small businesses. Accordingly, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA) has been prepared for this rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and is presented as part of the Regulatory Support Document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (available in the public docket). The RFA compares the financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts of this rule on small F/FA manufacturers to the impacts on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large F/FA manufacturers. The analysis explains the small business  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition specifically developed in this rule to provide special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions for small F/FA manufacturers (see Section X.D) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assesses the effectiveness of these provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule defines a small business as any motor vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel or fuel additive manufacturer with total annual sales of less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than $50 million. A comparison of companies classified as small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under this definition to those classified as small by the Small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Business Administration (SBA) reveals that the F/FA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition classifies a larger number of F/FA manufacturers as small,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and more closely groups companies with similar financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics. Based on this analysis, EPA determined that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small business definition established in this rule is reasonable and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to the F/FA industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Impacts of this rule on F/FA manufacturers were determined by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projecting the effects of the estimated compliance costs on each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> company's return on assets (ROA). In general, a reduction in ROA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (after compliance costs) to less than 2.5 percent is indicative of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial distress. A ROA less than ^4 percent indicates that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> company is in severe financial distress, and a ROA less than ^30  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent generally indicates closure. According to these ROA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thresholds, results of the RFA show that approximately 68 unique F/FA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers (43 additive manufacturers, 23 fuel manufacturers, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2 that produce both fuels and additives) could potentially be pushed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into some level of financial distress. All of these companies are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classified as small (i.e., have sales less than $50 million). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> majority of these companies would fall into the first level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial distress; however, less than one-fifth of them (12  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> companies) would potentially be in danger of closure. In relation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the total population of F/FA manufacturers, the companies potentially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> falling into some level of financial distress account to about six  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent, with about 1.2 percent potentially in danger of closure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As previously described, this final rule includes two types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special provisions for small businesses. With respect to baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and non-baseline F/FAs, all small manufacturers (i.e., annual sales  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under $50 million) are excused from all Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. A segment of these small manufacturers, i.e., those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> having sales under $10 million, are also excused from Tier 2 testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility for their atypical F/FAs. Nevertheless, all twelve of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the manufacturers who are projected to be in danger of closure as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of this rule are very small companies with one or more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> atypical F/FAs. The RFA analysis shows that the special provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for small manufacturers with atypical products lowers overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance costs for 60 such manufacturers by roughly $20 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (as compared with costs that would otherwise occur in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> absence of this special provision). Without this provision, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional 15 manufacturers of atypical products would potentially be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pushed into closure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted that the RFA has assumed no changes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices, sales, product mix, or financial strategies. In many cases,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a portion of regulatory costs can be actually passed on to consumers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or back to suppliers. Manufacturers also have the option of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulating a product to a ``baseline'' standard which has much lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance costs, or even of dropping products with the greatest cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and smallest profit potential. A more detailed discussion on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances which could mitigate compliance cost impacts is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided in the RFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Recordkeeping Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information collection requirements in this rule have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted for approval to OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An Information Collection Request document has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been prepared by EPA (ICR  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1696.01) and a copy may be obtained from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 401 M Street SW.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Washington, DC 20460 or by calling 202&hyph;260&hyph;2740. These requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not effective until OMB approves them and a technical amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to that effect is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

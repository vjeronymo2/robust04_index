			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUSTICE DELAYED;  </P> <P> ELDERLY JAPANESE INTERNEES WAIT FOR GOVERNMENT TO FULFILL REPARATIONS PROMISE  </P> <P> Once before they were gathered together like this -- only in those days, nearly  five decades ago, they lived behind barbed wire fences under the watchful gaze  of rifle-toting sentries.  </P> <P> Today, these 125 Japanese-Americans, who were interned at 10 relocation camps  during World War II, are living out their final years at the Japanese  Retirement Home in Boyle Heights.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lost Homes, Businesses  </P> <P> Two-thirds of the 180 residents of the five-story retirement home were  incarcerated during the war because of their race. They lost their homes,  businesses and farms because of suspicion that they threatened national  security.  </P> <P> Now these former internees, some of whom are in their 90s, often sit in groups  playing cards, watching television or knitting, and occasionally exchanging  accounts of their days in the camps.  </P> <P> As they walk with measured steps from their sparsely furnished apartments to an  adjacent dining hall on Boyle Avenue, where they dine on Japanese-style rice  and fish, several former internees recall those years in detention. They talk  of promises made, but not yet kept.  </P> <P> They are waiting for letters of apology from the U.S. government as well as  monetary reparations of $20,000 per internee for the three years they spent in  the relocation camps. But many wonder whether they will still be around when  the apology and reparations finally arrive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Difficult Time Recalled  </P> <P> "I wouldn't put another person through the hardships we had," said Dorothy  Utsunomiya, 71, as she sat under the shade of a tree at the retirement home.  </P> <P> The small woman, a widow who speaks with a tremble that comes from Parkinson's  disease, recalled what life was like in the relocation camps.  </P> <P> Utsunomiya was 24 when she was sent to a relocation camp in Gila, Ariz. She  recalls being forced to live in horse stalls and enduring almost daily sand  storms that lasted three hours at a time.  </P> <P> "The experience we went through as American citizens was wrong," she said.  </P> <P> As she spoke, another elderly woman overhearing the conversation was surprised  to find that they had shared the same camp but had never met. Both women  expressed fear that reparations may not come.  </P> <P> "I hope to get redress before I die," Utsunomiya said, "(President) Reagan said  that we would get it, but it's been a long time coming now. We may be dead  before we get it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Money Appropriated  </P> <P> One year ago, the former President signed a law earmarking $1.25 billion to  Japanese-Americans who lost their homes and businesses after they were  interned. The funds were to be distributed over a 10-year period, but to date  no money has been appropriated and not one former internee has received  reparations.  </P> <P> About half of the original 120,000 internees already have died -- and they  continue to die at a rate of more than 200 a month, according to the U.S.  Justice Department's Office of Redress Administration.  </P> <P> Of the estimated 60,000 who were living on the day Reagan signed the bill,  2,400 have since died. And, officials said, there are 16,000 -- like those at  the retirement home -- who are over the age of 70.  </P> <P> "Every day you look at the local obituaries and you can see people in their  60s, 70s and 80s dying," said Bert Nakano, spokesman for the National Coalition  for Redress/Reparations, a group considered largely responsible for raising  grass-roots support for reparations.  </P> <P> In the aftermath of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Americans of Japanese ancestry  -- U.S. citizens and aliens alike -- were rounded up on the orders of President  Franklin D. Roosevelt and placed in relocation camps across the country.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shame Enforced Silence  </P> <P> For decades, most former internees were reluctant to publicly discuss their  experiences because they were ashamed and did not want to bring attention to  themselves.  </P> <P> But the civil rights movement of the 1960s created an awareness of the camps  among Japanese-American youth, and this awareness spawned the redress campaign.  </P> <P> Now, because of publicity the issue has generated, former internees speak  openly about "violations of civil rights" and of the U.S. Constitution.  </P> <P> Residents of the retirement home talk freely about the years they spent  incarcerated in camps, which were lined with row upon row of Army barracks  surrounded by guard towers.  </P> <P> For Utsunomiya and her husband, Ken, the incarceration began 30 days after  their wedding, and they were forced to leave their Santa Maria home.  </P> <P> She said the mouse- and scorpion-ridden quarters in Gila, Ariz., did not  particularly bother her. Nor was she extremely upset with the holes in the  floor covered by tops of tin cans and walls patched with boards. She also got  used to hanging sheets to divide the room that housed two families.  </P> <P> It was her freedom that she missed.  </P> <P> "There were guards in very high towers all night with lights and rifles," she  said. "We could go nowhere."  </P> <P> "They said that the guards and rifles were there for our own protection,"  another resident said. "But why were they pointed into the camps at us?"  </P> <P> Partly to provide food, and mostly to add a sense of hope to an otherwise empty  environment, the internees planted gardens and tended small farms around their  barracks.  </P> <P> Masato Uemura had once farmed carrots and green onions on a plot in North  Hollywood before losing everything.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Photos of Camp  </P> <P> Uemura, 91, lives in a sterile-looking one-room apartment in the retirement  home. He shuffles through the building with the aid of a metal walker. He  eagerly shows visitors black-and-white photographs of the relocation camp at  Manzanar, in the California desert, where he spent 18 months during World War  II.  </P> <P> From there, the Uemura family was separated, with seven of the children being  sent to Tule Lake, Calif., while Uemura, his wife, and their oldest child were  placed in a camp in Bismarck, N.D.  </P> <P> Now supported by his children, Uemura said he hopes to see the reparations in  his lifetime. He said he wants to give something back to his children for the  years they spent at the relocation camps.  </P> <P> "I feel sorry for my children," Uemura said. "We are Japanese, and that's why  we were in the camp. If we were Chinese or (any) other nationality, we would  not have to go."  </P> <P> Retiree Tom Tsubone clutched a copy of the U.S. Constitution. Underlined in red  ink was a portion of the Fifth Amendment that read: "No person shall be . . .  deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law."  </P> <P> Tsubone stopped reading and lifted his head.  </P> <P> "That's what it's all about."  </P></p>

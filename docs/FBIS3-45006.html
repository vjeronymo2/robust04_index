The just closed provincial rural work  conference has defined the objectives and principles for the  rural work in the next year and adopted measures to  energetically develop agriculture. Then, what is the major  problem of agriculture? Although there are a multitude of  problems in agriculture, the core of them at present can be  summarized as that peasants' enthusiasm in production has been  dampened and thus has declined. Since the third plenary session  of the 11th party Central Committee, the party's various  policies toward rural areas have aroused the enthusiasm of  peasants. The reason these policies have been well received by  peasants is that they have represented and safeguarded the  interests of the vast number of peasants. Since the beginning  of this year, however, some problems of the rural work have  emerged regarding the important issue of protecting the  interests of peasants. The price difference between industrial  and agricultural products have been widened, the comparative  efficiency of agriculture has declined, and the income of  peasants has increased slowly, thus leading to a decline in the  enthusiasm of peasants in growing grain. Since the beginning of  this winter, a few localities in the province have again  witnessed the phenomena of indiscriminately raising funds and  collecting financial levies, some other localities have even  tried to find excuses to withdraw the contracted fields from  peasants upon which they rely for existence. Thus, peasants say  that the benefits given them at the beginning of the year  according to the policy of reducing peasants' burdens are now  being withdrawn gradually.    Why does the phenomenon of infringing upon the interests of  peasants emerge? There are two reasons. First, some leading  comrades have only caught sight of the achievements in the rural  reform, but have not discovered in a timely manner the new  contradictions and new problems cropping up in the rural areas  when rural areas begin embarking in the market economy and have  not set forth in a timely manner the measures coordinated with  the deepening of rural reform. Second, we have overestimated the  degree of prosperity of peasants since the commencement of rural  reform and overestimated peasants' capacity to adapt themselves  to rural reform. In fact, although the province has reaped  bumper harvest in agriculture for four years running, only a  small number of peasants have truly become relatively well-off  or rich, and most peasants just have enough to eat and wear. In  the three state-level poverty-stricken counties and the 13  provincial-level poverty-stricken counties, considerably more  people are still struggling against hunger and cold. Under such  a situation, all fields ought to yield even more support to  peasants to let them rest and build up strength and then  continue to develop production in order to thoroughly extricate  them from poverty.    Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee,  stressed again and again at the just closed provincial rural  work conference that all localities should consider the  interests of both the state and the peasants when drawing up and  implementing agricultural policies and should formulate some  policies that are in agreement with the interests of peasants.  This is a key step to protect peasants' interests. In doing  the practical work at present, we should pay attention to the  following three things: The policy of reducing peasants'  burdens cannot be wavered; IOU slips cannot be given when  procuring agricultural and sideline products from peasants; and  the advantages given to peasants according to the contracts  signed between the state and peasants must be honored and no  cases of cheating and pocketing the interests of peasants are  allowed. As long as we no longer make peasants the first target  of attack in the course of deepening rural reform and actually  protect the interests of peasants, it is possible for us to push  agriculture into a new stage.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Brazil races to beat US wrath over piracy  -New copyright laws are being pushed in an attempt to avoid sanctions HAUNTED by the spectre of US trade sanctions after a three-year breathing space, the Brazilian government is rushing to push through legislation on patent and intellectual property protection. Brazil is one of the most likely candidates to face action next month under section 301 of the 1974 Trade Law for barriers to US trade. Currently on the US priority watch list, Brazil will face sanctions if it is put back in the group of worst offenders for failing to recognise patents for products since 1945 or processes since 1971. With the April 30 deadline for action looming, the Clinton administration has received strongly worded petitions from the US pharmaceutical and video games industries which claim to be losing between Dollars 300m-600m a year through piracy in Brazil. Super 301 sanctions, imposed on Brazil in 1988 for failing to provide patent protection for US pharmaceuticals, were lifted in 1990 after promises by the Collor government to introduce a new law on patents and trademarks. Although legislation was presented to the Brazilian Congress in 1991 - two years and more than 1,000 amendments later - it is still to be voted upon. Its progress was halted by special interests and the Collor corruption scandal which paralysed law-making for much of last year. The new administration of President Itamar Franco is seen as more protectionist than its predecessor and US officials say there is 'a definite lessening of support' for the legislation. But Brazil appears increasingly isolated on this issue, at a time when even China and Albania are implementing intellectual property legislation and the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is discussing a set of international norms. Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's foreign minister, has been pushing for a new law, particularly as the Clinton administration is expected to have less sympathy for Brazil than that of former President George Bush. Last week, a government proposal was concluded that, subject to presidential approval, will go before the current session of Congress. Foreign drug companies are unhappy about a proviso which would force them to seek licences if they are found charging excessive prices. The bill however does meet other important concerns such as offering 'pipeline' protection for products under development, and almost immediate implementation. The government has proposed that it come into effect from January 1994. These points are likely to be contested by nationalists who have been lobbying for a 10-year grace period. But a US official points out: 'Brazilian pharmaceutical companies have had 22 years of protection and freedom to copy, justified on the basis that it would allow local industry to build up and innovate, but in all that time they have not invented a single new product'. Although the lack of protection has deterred foreign investment, 70 per cent of the Brazilian market remains dominated by multinationals and the other 30 per cent consists of small companies which simply assemble or copy foreign products. The Brazilian government hopes that what Mr Cardoso describes as 'a very reasonable proposal' will improve trade and relations with the US. Although over the last three years, some traditional tensions - such as on the environment, debt and Brazil's ban on computer imports - have been removed, there are still strains in the relationship. There is Brazil's continuing support for Cuba and its fears over the North American Free Trade Agreement. Of all the major Latin economies, Brazil has perhaps the least close relationship with the US. Brazilian trade to the US has dropped sharply  - the US now accounts for only 19.3 per cent of its export market compared with 24.3 per cent in 1989. Pointing at the dramatic fall in Brazil's annual surplus with the US from Dollars 5bn in 1988 to less than Dollars 2bn last year, Brazilian officials say that the country has not had enough reciprocity for the progress it has made in bringing down tariff barriers. Brazil was one of the main victims of recent US countervailing duties on steel, the US still restricts transfer of sensitive technology to Brazil and slaps high tariffs on many Brazilian products, such as orange juice concentrate. The new bill on patents and trade marks faces a stormy passage through the often nationalistic Brazilian Congress. Under pressure from the national pharmaceutical company lobby and the Roman Catholic Church, which is demanding that living serum and biotechnology references be excluded from the law, the government has already decided not to ask for the bill to be voted on an expedited basis. The government is nonetheless hoping that its actions will be sufficient to ward off US retaliatory duties. Mr Cardoso claims to have received no direct threats: 'We're not doing this because of the risk of reprisals but because we ourselves want the changes.'</p>

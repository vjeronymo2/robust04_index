			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6 requires that, unless operating in compliance with an air traffic control clearance, or as otherwise authorized by the Administrator, air tour operations may not be conducted below an altitude of 1,500 feet above the surface; and closer than 1,500 feet from any person or property; or below any altitude provided by Federal statute or regulation. As noted earlier, Hawaii's unique topography often complicates access to suitable emergency landing areas. The air tour accidents in Hawaii have been characterized by insufficient time for pilots to locate suitable landing areas after engine power loss or other problems leading to accidents. The requirement to maintain an altitude of 1,500 feet above the surface is necessary for safety because it allows the pilot sufficient time to react in an emergency, to notify and instruct passengers, and to prepare for a forced landing. An aircraft operating at least 1,500 feet above the surface allows the pilot a greater opportunity to select a suitable landing site than would be the case at lower altitudes. The FAA notes that these minimum distances are consistent with HHOA's Fly Neighborly program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The accident data also show low-flying aircraft flying VFR into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). An additional benefit from the 1,500-foot minimum altitude will be the increased basic VFR weather minimums for these air tour operations. This provision is necessary in light of the numerous accidents that have occurred when the aircraft flew into terrain because of low visibility or because the pilot was flying too low. The accident data show that this is a problem for both airplanes and helicopters. For instance, on April 24, 1987, an air tour flight operated under part 91 collided with terrain in the Waimae Canyon. Marginal visual meteorological conditions were reported in the vicinity of the accident site. The pilot and three passengers were fatally injured. In the January 25, 1993, accident, in which the helicopter crashed in deep water after hovering between 100 and 150 feet above sea level, the NTSB noted that a contributing factor to the accident was the pilot's choice of a hover altitude/position inadequate to reach a shoreline in the event of an emergency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 11, 1989, a Beechcraft BE&hyph;H18, operating under part 135 on a sightseeing flight, crashed near a waterfall in the Waipio Valley of the Kohala Mountains on the island of Hawaii. After filing a VFR flight plan, the pilot had departed Hilo International Airport for Maui. The pilot entered a closed canyon and ultimately impacted the canyon wall 600 to 900 feet below the rim. The pilot and 10 passengers were fatally injured, and the airplane was destroyed by impact forces and postcrash fire. The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was the pilot's improper decision to maneuver with insufficient altitude in a canyon area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 22, 1992, a Beechcraft E&hyph;18S operating on a VFR air tour flight collided with mountainous terrain in Haleakala National Park in an area where fog had reduced visibility around the mountain top. The FAA had provided a full weather briefing to the pilot, including an advisory that VFR flight was not recommended over the interior sections of all islands, and a forecast indicating isolated areas of 3 miles visibility due to haze and moderate rainshowers. The aircraft was destroyed, and the pilot and eight passengers were killed. Weather reports and witness statements indicate that IMC existed in the area at the time of the accident. The NTSB determined that the probable cause of this accident was the pilot's decision to continue visual flight into IMC that obscured rising mountainous terrain and his failure to use properly available navigational information to remain clear of the island. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 16, 1992, an Aerospatiale AS&hyph;350B departed on a sightseeing flight even though adverse weather conditions including thunderstorms, rainshowers, and poor visibility were reported. A witness reported rainshowers and mountain obscuration about the time of the accident. He stated that he saw a helicopter flying in and out of clouds and stated that he could not understand why a helicopter would be flying so close to the mountains given the adverse weather conditions. The NTSB determined that a probable cause of the accident, which involved seven fatalities, was the pilot's inflight decision to continue VFR flight into adverse weather conditions. A factor in the accident was the pilot's inability to see and avoid the mountainous terrain due to the thunderstorms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Briefing Passengers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

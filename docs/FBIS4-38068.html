			<p>BFN     [Text] David Mishli, a 30-year-old resident of Tel Aviv,  was killed, apparently with an iron bar, in his launderette in  the Shapira neighborhood today. Police say their main suspect  is Sa'idi Khalil Jabr, a Palestinian who cooperated with Israeli  authorities and was given permission to live in the south Tel  Aviv neighborhood. They say he had announced he would do  something to return to the ranks of the Fatah organization.</p>

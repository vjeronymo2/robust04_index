			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 4 DISTRICTS WARMING TO UNIFICATION  </P> <P> The spirit of unification appeared to gain strength this week when trustees and  superintendents from four beach city school districts discussed ways to merge  their schools to produce one or more larger systems.  </P> <P> The ways were outlined by county and state experts, who met Tuesday night in  Redondo Beach with officials from the South Bay Union High School District and  elementary districts serving Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach.  </P> <P> "Unification is definitely in the wind," said high school district Trustee  Armando Acosta, "All the questions tonight were about how to do it. Nobody was  interested in the negative side."  </P> <P> Acosta's district earlier this year began promoting the idea of consolidating  all four districts as a way of dealing with drastic declines in public school  enrollment in the three beach cities in the last 15 or 20 years. Officials  there have suggested consolidating all four districts into one 12,000-student  system for kindergarten-through-12th grade students.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Need for More Talks  </P> <P> Trustees from the elementary districts agreed that the time seems right for  unification, but said much more talking and information will be needed before  they agree on the form it should take.  </P> <P> "They gave us food for thought tonight, and I'm definitely for some kind of  unification," said Redondo Beach board President Howard Huizing. "But it's  going to take a while to sort everything out."  </P> <P> His board, which was host for the joint meeting at the Redondo Beach district  headquarters, has favored a unified district in that city, possibly including  elementary and high school students from Hermosa Beach, rather than a  consolidation of all four systems.  </P> <P> Individual trustees have cited community identity and a desire to preserve  local control as important factors.  </P> <P> Kathy Campbell, president of the Manhattan Beach board, said residents of her  city are concerned about those factors, too. She also said many questions  remain to be answered, such as the division of property and the relative value  of assets that each district would be contributing to a unified system.  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach, the smallest of the districts with only one school and about 700  students, had been viewed in earlier discussions as the stepchild that would  have to be taken in by either of the much larger districts in Redondo Beach or  Manhattan Beach. But it emerged from the meeting in a potentially strong  negotiating position as a result of revenue limits.  </P> <P> Under the state funding formula, the tiny district receives nearly $3,200 for  each full-time student, compared to limits of about $2,500 in Redondo Beach and  $2,800 in Manhattan Beach. The experts pointed out that Hermosa Beach could  absorb either or both of the larger districts and contribute its higher revenue  limit to the new system -- in return for any concessions it might want.  </P> <P> Tony Turcotte, who represented the state Department of Education at the  meeting, reported several instances in which large school systems have eagerly  sought annexation by districts with only a few students.  </P> <P> "Districts do covet their neighbors' revenue limits," he said. However, he  added, the state generally imposes a 10% limit on how much more a new unified  system can cost the state, compared to the funding received by the existing  districts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pluses for Unification  </P> <P> Marc Forgy, who represented the county Committee on School District  Organization, said major advantages of unification generally are "economy of  scale" -- one board, one administration, one purchasing division and so forth  -- and smoother "matriculation," a student's transition from eighth grade to  the freshman level in high school.  </P> <P> The experts also answered a long list of questions on such issues as union and  administrator contracts, personnel reassignments, responsibility for existing  legal liabilities and how the "pencils and buses" are divided up if a high  school district is split between two unified systems.  </P> <P> Turcotte said those problems are worked out by new boards during the transition  period. "When people get their questions answered adequately, they relax . . .  and the process goes smoothly most of the time," he said.  </P> <P> Turcotte said school consolidations can begin either with a citizen petition or  through action by school boards, but the ultimate decision is made by voters  and requires a majority vote in all of the affected school districts. The  process often takes about two years, he said, depending on when it is  initiated.  </P> <P> He said unifications are going on all over the state, although state government  stopped pushing for them in the early 1980s. "It's up to the communities and  what they want," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Concern for Children  </P> <P> After a lengthy discussion about the economics of unification, Hermosa Beach  Trustee Joe Mark wondered: "What's best for the kids?" in terms of the quality  of education.  </P> <P> The experts ran out of answers at that point, noting that different studies  have produced different conclusions. South Bay High School District Trustee  William Beverly suggested that a subcommittee be formed to check out the  post-unification track records in other areas of the state.  </P></p>

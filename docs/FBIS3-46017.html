			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, January 20 (XINHUA) -- Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said today that the "market  romanticism" was over, but denied allegations that the  government will withdraw from its market-oriented economic  reform completely.    At a news conference, Chernomyrdin said the government will  only make certain changes in the tactics of reforms, which mean  a switch from purely monetarist methods pursued by Yegor Gaydar  in managing the economy.    However, the cabinet chief pointed out, his government will  concentrate on boosting production by any means.    "The period of market romanticism is over now, but we will  not permit its substitution by an obsession with production,"  the prime minister said.    He rejected rumors about the changes of the strategic course  of the economic reform currently underway in the country,  noting, "I state with all responsibility that this is not so."    Yeltsin's program towards a deep transformation of Russian  society "was, is and will be carried through," Chernomyrdin said.    But, he added, "We plan to correct the methods of reform."  It means a switch from purely monetarist policies to other  measures tested in many European countries, he explained.    These measures envisage the creation of true competition on  the Russian market and in the economy between Russia and foreign  producers. This signals "a big opening of the Russian economy  to the world economy," the prime minister added.    At the news conference, Chernomyrdin also announced the line  up of his new government, saying that deputy prime ministers  Aleksandr Zaveryukha, Anatoliy Chubays and Yuriy Yarov will  retain their current posts. He also announced that Oleg  Soskovets will remain as first deputy.    Under an order signed by President Boris Yeltsin in January,  the number of deputy prime ministers will be cut from nine to  four or five.    In the new government, Aleksandr Shokhin becomes economics  minister, Viktor Khlystun, the agriculture minister, while  Sergey Shakhray will head the ministry of nationalities and  regional policy.    Boris Fedorov was offered the post of the finance minister,  but "he has not yet responded," Chernomyrdin told reporters.</p>

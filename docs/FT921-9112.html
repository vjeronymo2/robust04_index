			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / MPs quiz Midland over 'supergun': Bank officials admit weakness of their policy on arms exports to Iraq SENIOR officials of Midland Bank yesterday admitted to MPs that the bank's policy of not dealing with arms exports to Iraq could easily have been 'subverted by deception'. They told the House of Commons trade and industry committee, however, that the bank had no record of having been involved in financing the export of components for the Iraqi 'supergun'. The activities of Midland's secretive defence equipment finance department were first disclosed in a Financial Times investigation last summer. Mr Charles Bryant, managing director of international banking services at Midland, said the bank had a policy in the 1980s of refusing to 'advise or confirm letters of credit' if they related 'overtly' to arms exports to Iraq. He conceded it might have been possible to get round this by misdescribing the items to be exported and disguising their true nature. Mr Menzies Campbell, a Liberal Democrat MP, said this made the policy 'not worth the paper it was written on'. Between 1985 and 1989, Midland arranged Pounds 871m in credit facilities for exports to Iraq backed by Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department. Mr Bryant denied that any of these had been used for arms exports other than 'soft' defence items such as communications equipment. The officials said there were no records to support allegations made to the committee that Midland financed the export to Iraq of components for the 'supergun' project: steel tubes from Sheffield Forgemasters, the UK steel company, and propellants from the Belgian munitions company, PRB. Mr Bryant admitted Midland was Sheffield Forgemasters' bank when the contract was signed but said he could not explain why Midland was referred to in papers connected with the contract. The officials were also questioned about Mr Stephan Kock, a former consultant to Midland's defence equipment finance department and non-executive director of Astra Holdings, the UK defence group which discovered in 1989 that PRB, its newly acquired subsidiary, was supplying the 'supergun' propellants. The committee has heard allegations that Mr Kock visited Baghdad in 1988 to negotiate finance for the propellants. Mr Tom Robson, former director of Midland's trade and export finance department, said Mr Kock had never travelled abroad on Midland business. He also said there was no record to support the allegation of Mr Gerald James, former chairman of Astra, that Mr Kock had been brought on to the Astra board on Midland's recommendation. He admitted he was aware that Mr Kock had produced a gun during an incident near his home in Scotland, and that during a subsequent trial Mr Kock's solicitor said his client carried a gun because the nature of his work made him concerned for his safety. 'Is it normal for consultants of Midland Bank to carry guns?' asked Mr Doug Hoyle, a Labour MP. Mr Robson said: 'No.'</p>

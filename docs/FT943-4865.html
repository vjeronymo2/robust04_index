			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Blair refuses to back rail strike: TUC warms to works councils - Union chiefs attacked on pit closures Mr Tony Blair yesterday refused to throw his support behind the rail signal workers' strike in a move calculated to distance the party from industrial conflicts. He called on the government to free both sides - the RMT transport union and Railtrack - to negotiate a settlement of the 13-week conflict. If this failed it should go to arbitration under existing agreements for the railway industry, Mr Blair said. The Labour leader said he had 'considerable sympathy' for the justice of the signal workers' cause, but had to look at the dispute from 'the public interest'. However, Mr Blair's suggestion of arbitration has not found favour on either side of the rail dispute. Both the RMT and Railtrack are strongly opposed. Moreover his refusal to intervene on the side of the signal workers has disappointed union leaders. Mr Blair emphasised that politicians should not become involved in industrial disputes. 'If I started intervening or interfering I would be doing precisely what I have criticised the government for doing.' There was widespread support for the RMT and its general secretary Mr Jimmy Knapp at the TUC congress yesterday. He secured 1.6m votes in his first election for the TUC general council in the smaller-union section. A congress debate on the RMT strike will take place today. The TUC plans a mass rally of support tomorrow, when the signal workers will be on strike for 24 hours. Mr Paul Gallagher, general secretary of the AEEU engineering and electrical union and a member of the Health and Safety Commission, said he was calling on the Health and Safety Executive to investigate the training of British Rail staff who will be working in signal boxes on strike days. Mr Gallagher said: 'I want to know how, after less than two weeks' training or retraining, it is possible for Railtrack to say a person is competent to work in a signal box when it takes nine months to train a signal worker.' A growing number of train operating companies have stopped making automatic ticket refunds to travellers affected by the dispute because of the increased frequency of special strike-day services. In some areas ticket staff have been making refunds to season ticket holders in spite of the fact that travellers have been able to use the reduced services on strike days. BR said a decision on refunds was up to train operators. Rail users' groups said refunds should still be paid on routes where services started late or finished early.</p>

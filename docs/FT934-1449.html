			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / British Gas unveils radical changes in regional make-up British Gas yesterday announced a sweeping corporate reorganisation to prepare its UK operations for future competition. The changes will lead to the break-up of its traditional regional structure and create five specialised business divisions. Mr Norman Blacker, director responsible for the UK gas business, said the plan would lead to 'the most fundamental changes in organisation and culture . . . for more than 40 years'. The restructuring announcement was to have followed a government decision on the future of the gas industry. But Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday failed to make an expected statement to parliament before it rose for Christmas. The government was thought to have reached agreement on the industry's future as early as Wednesday. But last-minute objections, said to have come from Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, apparently delayed the announcement. The DTI said a decision might still be announced next week. British Gas has made no secret of its frustration over the uncertainty that has surrounded the company since the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the industry was published in August. Mr Heseltine must decide whether to accept or modify MMC recommendations that British Gas's trading arm be sold off by 1997, followed within three to five years by the lifting of its monopoly in supplying 17m mainly residential users. British Gas yesterday said the new structure, to be implemented next March and phased in over two years, could be 'adapted' to any government decision. The restructuring plan stems from a 1992 agreement with the Office of Fair Trading and a commitment to the government that British Gas would introduce greater transparency into its operations. It also conforms to an MMC recommendation that the company construct Chinese walls between the various operating groups to enhance competition. The five new business units are: Public Gas Supply, which will cater to residential and small business users; Contract Trading, which will sell gas to industrial and commercial customers using more than 2,500 therms; Transportation and Storage, through which gas will be shipped from shore terminals to meter outlets; Retailing, overseeing a remodelled and re-styled network of shops selling gas appliances; and Service and installation of gas central heating. Company officials say the restructuring will make it easier to implement the 20,000 job cuts the company plans over the next three years. The restructuring does not affect the worldwide exploration and production division or Global Gas, the other main international arm specialising in distribution and gas-fired electricity generation.</p>

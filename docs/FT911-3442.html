			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (8): Pudong - gamble for growth A NEW word has appeared on the lips of almost every Chinese official discussing the country's hopes for the future - Pudong, writes John Elliott. It is the name of a 350 sq km area of Shanghai, China's second city, which is to be developed over the next 20-30 years with a series of special industrial and trade zones. But Pudong - or Pudong New Area as it is called - is not just for Shanghai. Backed by the country's top leaders, it is the symbol of China's plans for economic development into the next century. Dong means east and Pu is an abbreviation for Shanghai's Huangpu River, so Pudong lies on the eastern bank of the river across from the current city centre. Mr Zhu Rongji, the city's mayor who has just been promoted to be a vice premier in Peking, is the driving force behind the development which was announced last year. Some yuan 12bn projects are planned but total expenditure could reach yuan 30bn. 'Pudong will be a place for experimenting in new policies which maybe we can later apply elsewhere in China,' says Mr He Gaosheng, director of the Shanghai Office of Economic System Reform. 'It will not be capitalism but we will bring market mechanisms into a planned economy, with public ownership remaining the mainstay. With Pudong we can develop the whole of Shanghai and promote development throughout the country.' But it is difficult to envisage the plans materialising. At present Pudong, which lies between the Huangpu and Yangtze rivers, is an uninspiring area of broken roads, 2,000 (mostly small) factories, ramshackle chemical and gas plants, shabby flats, and traditional-style houses. The aim is to double the present population of 1m. The yuan 12bn expenditure will be spread over five years or longer on a free trade zone and 10 infrastructure projects, some already started, including a four-berth deep water port, two major river bridges, an 8km inner ring road, and new plants for water, electricity, gas and sewage treatment. Officials say yuan 5bn will come from Peking, yuan 4bn from domestic bank loans, and yuan 3bn from the Shanghai government. They are looking for foreign finance - for example from the Asian Development Bank - but do not expect substantial international investment until the infrastructure projects are completed. Currently there are about 40 factories with foreign investment. They include one of China's most successful joint ventures - a float glass plant started with Pilkington of the UK four years ago when Pudong had no special significance - and a Dollars 25m agricultural chemical plant planned by Du Pont. A showpiece multi-storey financial and trade centre is to be built across the Huangpu River from the old Bund (or promenade). This is intended to help Shanghai's drive to boost its service sector from 30 per cent of GNP. China's first foreign-owned wholesale and retail businesses are also to be admitted - Yaohan, a Hong Kong-based Japanese department store group, plans a HKDollars 780m joint venture to open in 1995. An area has been designated for an international airport. It is difficult at this stage to assess how much of the grand Pudong scheme will actually materialise. But whatever happens in the longer term, Shanghai will at least benefit from the infrastructure projects.</p>

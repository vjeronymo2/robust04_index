			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / People: Sir Peter Imbert tails Kroll Sir Peter Imbert, who retired as commissioner of the Metropolitan Police earlier this year, has picked up his second new assignment, as a consultant to Integrated Security Systems. He is also a non-executive director of Securicor. ISS, founded by ex-SAS officer John Wick nine years ago, advises governments and companies on a variety of security issues from crisis management to the design of large integrated security systems. It has just three executive directors with eight retained associates and a handful of consultants. Eighteen months ago the management bought itself out from Lloyd's managing agents PW Kininmonth. Wick says Imbert will be spending one or two days a week at ISS in the first six months. One of his first tasks will be to advise on how to expand the corporate investigation side. 'It irritates me immensely sitting as an Englishman in the middle of the City that most investment banks think of Kroll Associates (which is American) and not us,' Wick fumes from his office in Lovat Lane. Sir Peter feels strongly about the need for ISS's type of work. 'Companies and other organisations are just not well enough prepared to handle the kinds of crises they face today - anything from armed robbery through kidnapping to terrorist activities . . . Put bluntly, companies will either survive or be defeated according to their readiness to deal with such events.'</p>

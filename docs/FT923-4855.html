			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Recyclers set sights on load of rubbish PRAWNS, Christmas trees and electricity could be the by-products of a council's ambitious scheme to recycle or re-use virtually all of the domestic rubbish in its area. Halton Borough Council in Cheshire yesterday announced that it had signed a 20-year joint venture with Biomass Recycling, a recently-formed waste management group, to re-use 98 per cent of the contents of household dustbins by 1995. The contract is the most radical response to the Environmental Protection Act, which set councils a target of recycling 25 per cent of refuse by the turn of the century. Mr Tony Barratt, the council's development manager, said: 'We thought the 25 per cent rule would require us to put in Pounds 500,000, which we haven't got. The Biomass scheme will save the council Pounds 10m over 20 years.' Halton council claimed that the scheme would 'totally eclipse' the government targets, but the Department of the Environment said only material that was strictly recycled - as opposed to used for energy generation - would count towards the quotas. Many recycling schemes have been uneconomic, given the cost of sorting rubbish, but Biomass said it expects to make 'rapid profits' from Halton's 40,000 tonnes of annual domestic waste. Recyclable material - mainly metal and plastic - will be sorted centrally, avoiding the costs of collecting different types of rubbish separately. Biomass has signed a 20-year contract with Norweb, the regional electricity company for north-west England, to sell it the gas from the decomposition of waste. Norweb will use the gas to generate electricity. Mr Tim Midgeley, a Biomass director, said 'the technology we're using is as old as the hills'. He added: 'It's crackers no one has done this before.' Biomass will use water warmed by the decomposition to farm prawns and crayfish. It wants to use the eventual compost for enriching soil to grow Christmas trees. Set up by the Jardine Matheson Group to help local authorities meet the Environmental Protection Act, Biomass will invest Pounds 1.6m in the first year on the central sorting technology. Mr Midgeley said: 'Each tonne of waste is worth around Pounds 40 to us, including about Pounds 5 from reclaimable plastics, Pounds 10 from metals, and around Pounds 12 from energy.'

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: JAL plans to increase air fleet by 33% JAPAN Airlines (JAL), the Japanese national carrier, plans to increase the size of its fleet by a third to 134 aircraft by 1996-97, Reuter reports from Tokyo. This forms part of the airline's five-year business plan which it updates every year and under which it aims for sales of Y1,600bn (Dollars 13bn) in the year starting April 1 1996, against Y1,120bn in 1990-91. It plans to increase its fleet to 110 aircraft by end-1992-93 with the introduction of 15 aircraft and retirement of eight-year-old aircraft. To cope with a shortage of pilots, JAL plans to train and use about 300 foreign pilots by 1994-95. JAL plans to expand its overall business by 6 per cent a year during the five-year period. It wants to expand domestic passenger operations by 9 per cent, international passenger operations by 6 per cent and international cargo operations by 4 per cent. Among its business management goals, JAL aims to secure a one-third share of the domestic passenger market and strengthen cost competitiveness. In spite of a current downturn in air transport both at home and abroad, the airline expects demand to pick by 1993-94 at the latest. As part of JAL's business plan, the airline plans to open at least four domestic routes from Osaka and at least five domestic routes from other regional cities.</p>

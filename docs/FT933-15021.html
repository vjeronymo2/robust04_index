			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Bring your own drink - Nicholas Lander finds some inspiration from Australia who after all wants to be seen in the wrong restaurant? - but its role today seems disproportionately large. In recent years we have experimented with small bistros, Italian trattorias, and haute cuisine. We have seen attempts to import the French brasserie and enjoyed the vogue for British food cooked by British chefs. Today, we favour big, noisy restaurants - which, acoustically, may have reached their nadir at Quaglino's in London - serving gutsy Mediterranean food. So where to next? This is a question being asked by many restaurateurs and chefs, displaying that mixture of characteristics - part businessman, part gambler - which they need to survive. There is a shift towards Far Eastern cuisines and food which incorporates Thai and Indian spices and techniques from Japan and China. The hotter, more aggressive style of cooking that originates in South America, but is heavily influenced by the Caribbean, is also in vogue and is the rage in the US where the restaurants of Miami, close to Caribbean influences, are capturing the culinary headlines. But it is possible that the single most dramatic change to British restaurants in the late 1990s may not come from any of these exotic places but rather from an EC directive which came into force on January 1. This had, for once, nothing to do with food preparation or hygiene but a great deal to do with the way we buy one of a restaurant's staple commodities - wine. The increase in personal allowances for British shoppers travelling across the Channel has already seen several British wine merchants set up shop along the northern French coast (see the article above by Jancis Robinson). Merchants are supplying not only those who want to stock up with a few cases of house wine to store in the garage, but also those who are taking advantage of potential savings to reduce the cost of holding a dinner or party in their local UK restaurant. These customers are making their bookings on the condition that they can bring their own wine: many restaurants, unwilling to lose business in what are still difficult trading conditions, are saying yes. This phenomenon was explained to me by Ros Turner, managing director of David Burns Fine Wines, near Southampton, in Hampshire. She has already lost a number of private clients and is now seeing some of her restaurant trade eroded. Those in the south of England may be the first to be affected because of geography but this new shift in wine purchasing habits could produce a wonderful opportunity for restaurants to reduce the cost of eating out and win new customers if they are brave enough to embrace it. For inspiration, British restaurateurs will have to look to Australia where the concept of the BYO - bring your own - restaurant has flourished for years. It exists because of ludicrous licensing laws but has resulted in that happy combination of a restaurant being situated close to a 'bottle shop'. You take your wine or buy it on the way, hand it over to a waiter to open it, pay the corkage and concentrate on the menu. Everyone has profited. The restaurants are busy, the domestic wine market has flourished and the cost of eating out has remained relatively low. The system even produced this bizarre statistic - at one stage 90 per cent of wine in Australia was consumed within 30 minutes of purchase. Restaurateurs would obviously be the first to complain at the disappearance of a potential source of profit but the savings they would make - no stock, no wine lists to be printed, no sommeliers to be trained and no bottles sent back as 'corked' - could be substantial. If they were to embrace this concept wholeheartedly and explain to the public the reasons behind it, their net profits may not be seriously impaired. Nothing in the restaurant business produces as large a profit as a corkage charge. All the necessary equipment - glasses, corkscrews, decanters  -has to be provided anyway and the costs involved, cleaning and polishing glasses, are minimal. Restaurateurs will complain that withdrawing their right to choose the wines that they serve with their food may destroy a part of their raison d' etre. But there would be no stopping any restaurateur offering his wine list alongside the BYO facility or liaising with the nearest off-licence. Consumers would appreciate the reasons behind the move and understand why restaurateurs must charge sensible but fair corkage. I would suggest a maximum of Pounds 5 per bottle of wine (Pounds 10 for champagne) while the restaurant continues its normal policy on spirits and after-dinner drinks. Fashion and the law may persuade restaurateurs that operating a BYO policy is a new way of attracting extra customers and making eating out less expensive. Restaurants which already offer a BYO service in London are: Adams Cafe, W12, (081-743-0572), Bedlington Cafe, W4, (081-994-1965), Diwana Bhel-Poori, N1, (071-387-5556), Le Petit Max, Hampton Wick, (081-977-0236), Phillies, W4, (081-995-5104). Melbournes in Bristol (0272-226996), Pophams in Winkleigh, Devon, (0837-83767) and Chinese Home Cooking in Edinburgh (031-2294404) are also BYO.</p>

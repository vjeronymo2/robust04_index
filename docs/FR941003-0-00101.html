			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Cost-Benefit Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA has determined that this final rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'', as defined by Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). The anticipated costs and benefits associated with this final rule are summarized below. (A detailed discussion of costs and benefits is contained in the full evaluation in the docket for this final rule). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule for unmanned rockets consists of provisions that specify what persons operating certain model rockets (rockets using not more than 125 grams of propellant; made of paper, wood, or breakable plastic; containing no substantial metal parts, and weighing not more than 1500 grams including propellant) would be required to do. The final rule is designed to accommodate the advancement of model rocketry with regulations that will also provide an adequate level of assurance that such rockets will not jeopardize the safety of aircraft in flight. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that the changes in the final rule will have a no cost impact to users of model rockets. In fact, the changes might produce a cost savings. The savings associated with these changes, however are considered negligible and unquantifiable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 101.22(a)(2), however, may impose minor costs on the FAA. Persons operating model rockets will have to provide the information required in existing &sect;101.25 to the manager of that airport and to the FAA ATC facility that is nearest the place of the intended operation. The FAA would then incur costs associated with receiving, recording, and evaluating the material that has been received. The FAA believes that these costs will be minor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Benefits <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule will provide benefits, in that the FAA has determined that the final regulations will accommodate the advancement of model rocketry and simultaneously provide an adequate level of assurance that such rockets will not jeopardize the safety of aircraft in flight. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based upon the fact that there are little or no compliance costs coupled with the potential benefits, the FAA concludes that the final rule is cost beneficial. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Determination <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have ``a significant cost impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regards to this regulatory evaluation, there is no cost associated with any of the amendments. The FAA has determined that the amendments contained herein will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> International Trade Impact Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amendments apply to users of model rockets in the United States only. There is no economic impact resulting from any of the amendments and the FAA has determined that these regulations will not have an impact on international trade. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Federalism Determination <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information collection requirements of part 101 were previously approved under OMB Control No. 2120&hyph;0027. This amendment makes only minor changes to those requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> International Civil Aviation Organization and Joint Aviation Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In keeping with the U.S. obligations under the convention on International Civil Aviation (ICAO), it is FAA policy to comply with ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARP) to the maximum extent practicable. The FAA has determined that this regulation complies with the ICAO SARP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination and the International Trade Impact Assessment, the FAA has determined that this regulation is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. This rule is not considered significant under DOT Order 2100.5, Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). In addition, the FAA certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A regulatory evaluation of the final rule, including a Regulatory Flexibility Determination and Trade Impact Assessment, has been placed in the docket.

Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 101 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 101) as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of International Capital Markets (9): Pace may slow down - United States FOR THE third consecutive year, Wall Street is asking itself: how long can the good times last? Two years ago, investment banks and securities houses were enjoying buoyant markets and surging profits, but doubting whether the momentum could be sustained for another 12 months. In 1992, business got even better, and again Wall Street was unsure whether it could last. But it did. Now, two thirds of the way through a record-breaking 1993, much the same question is back on people's lips. Is 1994 going to be the year when profits come down from the stratosphere? While no one is predicting that the financial markets or Wall Street's earnings will fall into a serious slump next year, a slowdown from a record-breaking pace of growth is expected, if only for the reason that it is hard to imagine that the pace of earnings growth in the securities industry can be maintained for another year. Whatever happens, matching the performance of 1991-1993 will be difficult. Since 1990, when New York Stock Exchange member firms posted a loss of Dollars 106m, the industry's after-tax profits have improved in leaps and bounds. In 1991, profits jumped to Dollars 3.8bn. In 1992, they climbed to Dollars 4.1bn. So far this year, many of the biggest US investment banks and securities houses have announced record quarterly earnings. In the first half of the year, NYSE member firms profits reached Dollars 3.08bn. Barring a market crash or a big surge in domestic interest rates in the final months of this year, industry profits for 1993 should break last year's record comfortably. Although a variety of factors have fuelled Wall Street's earnings juggernaut, including heavy demand for securities from individual investors and strong growth in the asset management business, the key to firms' successes in the domestic capital markets has been the very low level of US interest rates. Nowhere have low interest rates had more of an effect than in proprietary trading and investment banking. Traditionally, Wall Street firms make a lot of their profits by borrowing heavily against their securities holdings and investing or trading that money in the markets. Over the past three years, low interest rates have made this leveraged business even more profitable than usual. By borrowing cheaply on the short-term markets, and using that capital to speculate on rapid swings in securities, interest rates or currencies, or to invest in higher-yielding long-term assets, securities houses and investments have earned billions of dollars in profits. On Wall Street over the past few years, trading revenues (especially in the fixed-income markets) have been growing at a faster rate than any other form of revenues. In 1992, they totalled Dollars 16.3bn, up from Dollars 9.9bn four years earlier. The success of proprietary trading has led to one particularly interesting development - the rise of the trader as manager. Over the past year executives who made their reputation on the trading floors of Wall Street have been appointed to key management positions at a number of leading firms, including Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, and Lehman Brothers. In many cases, the traders have earned promotion at the expense of the investment bankers and dealmakers, who for more than a decade have ruled the roost on Wall Street. This trend has led some observers to claim that the industry is undergoing a fundamental shift in the balance of its business, away from corporate finance and advisory work and towards a greater emphasis on proprietary trading. Yet the changes appear more cyclical than structural in nature. Trading revenues are strong primarily because interest rates are so low. Once rates pick up again, trading revenues will probably suffer, and traders will eventually lose their spot at the top of Wall Street's food chain. Although traders may be grabbing more of the limelight these days, their counterparts in investment banking have been no slouches either. Revenues from stock and bond underwriting have been extremely buoyant over the past 18months. Again, low interest rates are the key. Eager to raise money to refinance old, expensive debt, to pay for much-needed restructurings, or to fund expansion, companies have been rushing to the public markets to take advantage of the lowest borrowing rates in 30 years. Last year, companies raised a record Dollars 851.7bn through debt and equity offerings, shattering the previous record, set in 1991, of Dollars 589.6bn. So far this year, volume has been even heavier, with Dollars 532bn raised in the first six months. At the end of June, many observers felt that the market may have peaked because it looked as if interest rates had bottomed. Since then, however, fresh declines in long-term rates have kept the momentum going, and could push public securities offerings through the Dollars 1,000bn barrier this year. And it is not just US companies that have been issuing record amounts of debt and equity. Foreign companies have been coming to the US capital markets in increasing numbers, not just because raising funds in the US has been so inexpensive, but because US investors, traditionally so reluctant to invest outside their country, have been buying more foreign stock and bond issues in their search for big returns. Low interest rates have also helped boost the equity underwriting business, because investors, looking for something better than the 3 per cent they get on short-term assets, have been snapping up new share issues in record amounts. This, combined with the steady rise in stock prices, has sustained a long and profitable boom in equity issuance. As for what happens to the capital markets next year, much hinges on the movement of interest rates. Analysts have been surprised that interest rates have fallen so far (the yield on the long bond fell below 6 per cent this summer for the first time in 16 years, and short-term yields have been trading at 30-year lows), so they have become wary about predicting where rates are headed next.</p>

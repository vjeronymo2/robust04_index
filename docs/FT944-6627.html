			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Waldegrave says EU agreement on animal journey times unlikely Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, said yesterday it was highly unlikely that his European Union counterparts would agree this year acceptable limits on journey times for animals being transported to slaughter. He said he did not expect agreement, although the best hope lay with the German presidency, which concluded at the end of this year. It was even less likely under the French presidency next year, given that France would be preoccupied with elections, he said. Leading British ferry companies have stopped transporting live animals to the Continent following protests from animal welfare groups. They say they will reconsider their bans only if there is EU-wide agreement on shorter journey times. Mr Waldegrave said at the Royal Smithfield Show in London that the government was ready to introduce its own code of practice for hauliers if no EU deal emerged, and would seek help from other member states to police it.</p>

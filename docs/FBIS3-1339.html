He addressed an audience of  150 people attending a National Party [NP] campaign meeting in  the Sommerset West town hall and elaborated on the precise role  of the TEC.    Mr Meyer also explained the events around Bophuthatswana and  Ciskei and called for South Africans to give their moral support  to the security forces as the only guarantee of everyone's  safety. "It is important to note that the TEC is not the  government, nor a government in waiting or in training," he said.    The government still dealt with the day to day  administration  of the country while the TEC had limited powers to level the  political playing field and ensure a free and fair election in  the transition to a democratic South Africa.    He asked his audience to imagine the chaos which would have  resulted without the TEC in dealing with the crisis in  Bophuthatswana and kwaZulu. "Without the TEC they would all  have been the government's sole responsibility and used against  the government by all the other parties. Now all the other  parties are co-responsible and the government's responsibilities  are shared by the other participating parties in preparing for  the elections. If the ANC is seen to play too big a role then  it is so much hot air with one eye on the elections and the  other personal aspirations," he said.    Mr Meyer said it was sometimes not easy to be the government  representative on the TEC which consisted of 19 other parties,  each with their own approach to a problem.    He said the SAP [South African Police] and SADF [South  African Defense Force] were the security forces of all South  Africa's people. "It is the responsibility of every political  leader to give their full support to the security forces. Our  safety depends on it."    Regarding the latest Goldstone Commission report alleging  third force activities backed by high-ranking police officers,  he said the just thing to do was to ensure there was a quick,  efficient and impartial investigation to establish whether there  were grounds for further investigation and action.    The government would in consultation with the TEC and  possibly with international assistance see to it that such an  investigation was constituted as swiftly as possible. "But  irrespective of this, we have a responsibility to stand by the  police and the commissioner (of police) and to support them that  they may protect us."    Reviewing the situation in Bophuthatswana, he said the  events  there had been tragic and unnecessary. "He (former Bop  [Bophuthatswana] President Lucas Mangope) was swallowed by  history because he would not make the correct decisions in time  to be part of the future."    State President F W de Klerk had invited Mr Mangope and his  cabinet for discussions more than a year ago to join him in  planning for the future in order to ensure that Bophuthatswana  would become part of South Africa and participate in elections.  "Mr Mangope's answer then and consequently every time  afterwards, remained the same: `I will die for independence'".  "Politically, unfortunately he did die," Mr Meyer said.    There was no way Bophuthatswana could remain an independent  state. In the 1993/94 budget year 71 per cent of its income was  derived from South Africa. "Democracy arrived in South Africa  and democracy often plays hard with those that stand in its way."    On the Zulu quest for an independent sovereign monarchy, Mr  Meyer said it could be accommodated within the new amended  constitutional structure but not in terms of a sovereign king  ruling without elected representation of the people.    On the issue of international mediation, he said he would be  meeting representatives of the ANC and IFP on Thursday morning  and as yet had no confirmation as to whom they would be  proposing. "What is important, however, is that whatever they  wish we will consider in terms of such a mediation panel."    The government would look at its scope and final intentions  but could not consider it unless it was certain that mediation  could make a contribution to resolving the issues.    The two parties have decided on international mediation ?o  determine the federalist content of the transitional  constitution.</p>

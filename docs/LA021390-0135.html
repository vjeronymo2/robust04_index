			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WESTENDORF LEADS ST.MARGARET'S INTO SMALL SCHOOLS PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> St. Margaret's High School is the second-seeded team in the Southern Section  Small Schools Division boys' basketball playoffs.  </P> <P> The Tartans (17-4) have 14 consecutive basketball victories dating back to  mid-December.  </P> <P> They are led by center Ryan Westendorf, who is averaging 25 points and 19  rebounds.  </P> <P> All four of the Tartans' losses came against 1-A schools and three were in the  La Jolla tournament.  </P> <P> "We had just gotten several of our players out from football," Coach Rick Bauer  said. "We had only had two practices with the entire team."  </P> <P> Westendorf has been one of the most dominant players on the Small Schools level  this season. However, the Tartans don't rely completely on him. Guard Dan  Campaigne is averaging 17.3 points per game.  </P> <P> Three other Orange County teams -- Claremont, California Lutheran and St.  Michael's -- will compete in the Small Schools division.  </P></p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Lending up sharply but money growth sluggish LENDING BY banks and building societies to the private and corporate sectors rose sharply last month, but the underlying growth of broad money was sluggish, pointing to low levels of inflation for some time. Bank of England figures showed that bank and building society lending, known as M4 lending, rose by Pounds 2.9bn last month after falling Pounds 1.3bn in March as the private and corporate sectors continued to repay debt. M4 lending has been erratic in the past few months. Economists said much of the the sharp rise in April represented a bounce back from the March figure. Broad money - notes and coins in circulation plus bank and building society deposits - grew a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent on the previous month to give a year-on-year growth rate of 3.5 per cent, slightly weaker than expected. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said: 'The underlying trend in broad money growth is consistent with at best a very modest economic recovery.' The 3.5 per cent increase in provisional M4 was at the bottom of the Treasury's 3 per cent to 9 per cent monitoring range set in the March Budget. Data from the British Bankers Association showed that sterling lending by the nine big high-street banking groups to the private sector (about 70 per cent of total bank lending) rose almost Pounds 2.5bn in April. This compared with a revised fall of Pounds 1bn in March. The association said a similar pattern occurred last year with a big fall in March followed by a larger rise in April. It said the most likely explanation was the exceptional size of the public sector borrowing requirement in March of both years which allowed the temporary repayment of bank borrowing by companies. A better idea of the trend is given by averaging out the March and April figures. The result, monthly growth of Pounds 733m, is only slightly higher than the trend figure for the previous three months.</p>

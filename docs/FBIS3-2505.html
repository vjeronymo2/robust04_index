The 21st plenary meeting of the Sixth Workers Party of Korea  Central Committee, which opened toward the end of 1993, decided  that the following three years [as heard] would be a period of  adjustment in economic construction, clearly presented a need to  implement a new economic strategy of directing primary efforts  to agriculture, the light industry, and foreign trade, and  decided to increase state investment in agriculture and pursue  agricultural development.    The Korean National Agriculture Meeting, which was convened  this 25 February, summed up experiences and presented tasks and  measures to develop agriculture based on those experiences.    An important task in developing agriculture in Korea is to  increase rice and corn production per chongbo [one chongbo  equals 2.45 acres] to eight or 10 tonnes and, thus, reap 15  million tonnes of grain a year in a few years. To fulfill this  goal, the Korean National Agriculture Meeting presented various  measures, and a noteworthy measure, among them, is to improve  the peasants' cultural and technological standards and  vigorously carry out a technological revolution in the rural  areas.    The meeting noted that constantly improving the peasants'  standards of agricultural technology is a key task to develop  agriculture. The meeting demands that the higher education  system be strengthened in rural areas, that many farm  universities and agricultural colleges where students work and  study open, that technical personnel necessary for agricultural  production be trained en masse, that various technical study  teams and special training courses be established to ensure that  peasants learn latest agricultural science and technology.    Another important task in the Korean technological  revolution  in agriculture is to build irrigation systems, use electric  equipment in farming, mechanize farm work, and use chemical  fertilizers in farming.    The Korean National Agriculture Meeting noted that Korea had  brought about great achievements in its efforts to build  irrigation systems and use electric equipment in farming and  that it must give priority to mechanizing farm work and applying  scientific knowledge to farming.    Therefore, the meeting demanded that the industrial sector  strengthen its assistance to agriculture and produce more  agricultural equipment of various sorts to ensure that  cooperative farms in various areas do farming in a timely manner  without receiving assistance from the city labor.    The meeting demanded that chemical fertilizer plants in  various areas produce efficient chemical fertilizers in  abundance. It also encouraged those plants to produce  biochemical fertilizers [saengmul hwahak piryo] and plant growth  control materials [singmul songjang chojolchil] in abundance to  supply them to rural areas.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Brent Walker hit by sharp rise in interest costs BRENT WALKER, the leisure and property group which completed a Pounds 1.65bn refinancing in March, incurred a retained loss of Pounds 411.4m in 1991. The loss compares with a loss of Pounds 367.7m in 1990. It was mainly caused by a sharp rise in interest costs from Pounds 116.2m to Pounds 235.8m, and exceptional costs of Pounds 201.3m compared with Pounds 116.9m a year earlier. Provisions for falls in property values accounted for Pounds 142.5m against Pounds 97.7m of the exceptionals. Fees and costs involved in the refinancing were Pounds 39.8m, up from Pounds 14m. There were reorganisation costs of Pounds 19.1m compared with Pounds 1.5m. Lord Kindersley, chairman, said: '1991 was by any standard a most trying year for the group.' As well as the financial restructuring and the losses, Mr George Walker, the group's former chairman and chief executive, is claiming compensation for loss of office, and a Serious Fraud Office investigation into the company's affairs was launched. Lord Kindersley said Mr Walker had 'gone quiet' and he could not comment on the SFO investigation. There was a loss per share of 763.09p compared with 299.77p and no dividend on the ordinary or preference shares will be paid. Brent Walker's share price fell  1/4 p to 6 1/2 p. The group published a pro-forma post-restructuring balance sheet, prepared on a going concern basis, which showed negative net worth of Pounds 177.1m. Before the refinancing, which involved swapping Pounds 250m of debt into equity, net assets were negative at Pounds 455.8m at the end of 1991. He said a slight improvement in trading conditions after the election had now faded. However, following the restructuring the group was seeing interest from potential buyers of assets up for sale. Lord Kindersley and Mr Alan Clements, a non-executive director, are to retire at the group's annual meeting next month. Both were appointed to assist the refinancing process. The company did trade profitably in 1991 with operating profits of Pounds 48.4m down from Pounds 107.2m. The William Hill betting shop business suffered as gamblers cut back in the recession, but had had a better start to 1992. The Pubmaster division, which is being expanded through deals to lease brewers' pubs, held profits in 1991. Lord Kindersley said the expansion would begin to benefit profits in the second half.

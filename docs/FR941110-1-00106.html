Upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification, the Administrator will deduct from the person's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> balance of Article 5 allowances the amount equal to the class I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance exported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A person must submit a notice to the Administrator of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exports to Article 5 countries (except transhipments, exports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting in transformation or destruction, or used controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances) at the end of the quarter that includes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The identities and addresses of the exporter and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipient of the exports;

 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The name and telephone numbers of contact persons for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferor and the transferee;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The type of allowances or authorizations being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferred, including the names of the controlled substances for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which allowances are to be transferred;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) The group of controlled substances to which the allowances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or authorizations being transferred pertains;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) The amount of allowances or authorizations being transferred;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (F) The control period(s) for which the allowances or authorizations are being transferred;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (G) The amount of unexpended allowances of the type and for the control period being transferred that the transferor holds under authority of this subpart as of the date the claim is submitted to EPA; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (H) The amount of the one percent offset applied to the unweighted amount traded that will be deducted from the transferor's allowance balance (except for trades from transformers and destroyers to producers or importers for the purpose of allowance reimbursement).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The Administrator will determine whether the records maintained by EPA, taking into account any previous transfers and any production, allowable imports and exports of controlled substances reported by the transferor, indicate that the transferor possesses, as of the date the transfer claim is processed, unexpended allowances sufficient to cover the transfer claim (i.e., the amount to be transferred plus, in the case of transferors of production or consumption allowances, one percent of that amount). Within three working days of receiving a complete transfer claim, the Administrator will take action to notify the transferor and transferee as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) If EPA's records show that the transferor has sufficient unexpended allowances to cover the transfer claim, the Administrator will issue a notice indicating that EPA does not object to the transfer and will reduce the transferor's balance of unexpended allowances by the amount to be transferred plus, in the case of transfers of production or consumption allowances, one percent of that amount. When EPA issues a no objection notice, the transferor and the transferee may proceed with the transfer. However, if EPA ultimately finds that the transferor did not have sufficient unexpended allowances to cover the claim, the transferor and transferee will be held liable for any violations of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or in conjunction with, the improper transfer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) If EPA's records show that the transferor has insufficient unexpended allowances to cover the transfer claim, or that the transferor has failed to respond to one or more Agency requests to supply information needed to make a determination, the Administrator will issue a notice disallowing the transfer. Within 10 working days after receipt of notification, either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> party may file a notice of appeal, with supporting reasons, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Administrator. The Administrator may affirm or vacate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disallowance. If no appeal is taken by the tenth working day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after notification, the disallowance shall be final on that day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) In the event that the Administrator does not respond to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a transfer claim within the three working days specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the transferor and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferee may proceed with the transfer. EPA will reduce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferor's balance of unexpended allowances by the amount to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferred plus, in the case of transfers of production or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption allowances, one percent of that amount. However, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA ultimately finds that the transferor did not have sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unexpended allowances to cover the claim, the transferor and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferee will be held liable for any violations of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conjunction with, the improper transfer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Effective January 1, 1995, any person (``transferor'') may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer to any other person (``transferee'') any amount of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferor's Article 5 allowances. The transfer proceeds as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The transferor must submit to the Administrator a transfer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim setting forth the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The identities and addresses of the transferor and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferee;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The name and telephone numbers of contact persons for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferor and the transferee;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The type of allowances being transferred, including the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances for which allowances are to be transferred;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) The group of controlled substances to which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances being transferred pertains;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

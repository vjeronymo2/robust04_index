Jose Ramon Fernandez, Council of Ministers vice president,  signed the document on Cuba's behalf. Fernandez called the  agreement mutually beneficial due to the activities planned to  promote and exchange goods.    Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina and the delegation  accompanying Hermoso during his six-day official visit to Cuba  were present for the ceremony at the Foreign Ministry.    Prior to signing, the officials chatted. Hermoso reaffirmed  an invitation for Robaina to visit the Canary Islands in the  near future, as part of his scheduled tour to Spain.    During a news conference, the president of the autonomous  community of Spain said the letter of intent is the completion  of talks held during his stay on the island. During that time,  Hermoso met with Cuban President Fidel Castro on two occasions.    Hermoso said he would meet with President-elect [title as  received] Rafael Caldera during his visit to Venezuela and will  sign several agreements with banking institutions, Fedecamaras  [Venezuelan Federation of Associations and Chambers of Commerce  and Industry], and with the cultural sector.    Strong historic ties hold us close to Venezuela as well, he  said. He said President Caldera himself is of Canary descent  and, during a recent visit to the archipelago, was declared a  son of Santa Cruz de Tenerife.    Fernandez, Deputy Foreign Minister Isabel Allende and  Spanish  Ambassador Jose Antonio San Gil were at the airport in Havana to  see off Hermoso Rojas and his entourage, which comprises a score  of government officials and businessmen.

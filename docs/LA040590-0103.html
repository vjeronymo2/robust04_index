			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WAIVED BY RAMS, IRVIN SAYS HE WANTS TO PLAY AGAIN  </P> <P> The rocky relationship between the Rams and cornerback LeRoy Irvin officially  ended Wednesday when the team waived the 10-year veteran. But Irvin says he  isn't ready to sever ties with the NFL.  </P> <P> Irvin, left unprotected by the Rams after the 1989 season, said last week that  if he wasn't satisfied with offers from other NFL teams, he would retire after  the Plan B free agent signing period, which ended Sunday.  </P> <P> But he apparently changed his mind after a conversation with his wife, Roxanne,  earlier this week.  </P> <P> Irvin was in Phoenix Wednesday and could not be reached, so he issued a  statement through his wife:  </P> <P> "By no means does this mean the end of LeRoy Irvin. I realize the nature of  this business is that you can't play forever. But right now, I intend to pursue  my football career for another one or two years with another club."  </P> <P> Irvin, 32, had one year remaining on a three-year, $1.65-million contract.  </P> <P> "It came as expected," the statement continued. "I've had 10 great seasons with  the Rams and have enjoyed myself. I have great respect for the team and the  organization and only hope the best for them. I leave them with a lot of good  memories and friends."  </P> <P> There were good and bad times. Irvin played in two Pro Bowls and was a mainstay  in the Rams' secondary for most of the 1980s, starting 104 of 142 games and  pulling in 34 career interceptions.  </P> <P> A third-round draft choice from the University of Kansas, Irvin played his  entire career with the Rams and scored five touchdowns. He intercepted four  passes in 11 playoff games.  </P> <P> But Irvin was suspended for 30 days for violating the NFL's substance abuse  policy prior to the 1989 season. He missed the first three games of the regular  season but returned and started in 10 games.  </P> <P> In November, 1987, Ram Coach John Robinson suspended him for "conduct  detrimental to the team." The suspension lasted only one game.  </P> <P> Irvin had spent off-season time working on the edge of boxing, and has said  that he had an interest in promoting fights. He held a conditional promoter's  license in California and promoted a recent Tony Tubbs-Orlin Norris fight in  Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Irvin also applied for a promoters' license in Nevada but was turned down in  March by the Nevada State Athletic Commissioner.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Earl Gustkey contributed to this story.  </P></p>

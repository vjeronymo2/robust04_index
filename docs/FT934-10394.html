			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / End of Manoplax pulls Boots down by 6% A Pounds 35m CHARGE to cover the cost of withdrawing the heart drug Manoplax pushed interim profits at Boots, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group, down 6 per cent to Pounds 174.6m. There was a further Pounds 14m charge in Boots Pharmaceuticals division to cover redundancy costs and the completion of clinical trials, although there were matching savings on aborted research and marketing costs. Boots also wrote off Pounds 5.1m relating to Asilone, an antacid product purchased for Pounds 12.5m, following a review of brand strategy. Sir James Blyth, chief executive, said Boots was conducting a 'fundamental reappraisal' of its pharmaceuticals business following the withdrawal of Manoplax and no options were ruled out. He refused to say when this might be completed. 'This is not something we are going to rush.' He was confident Boots' gross margins, which increased 0.5 points in the first half, would not be affected by the escalation in price competition between UK grocery retailers. Boots' strength, he said, was its own-label products, which accounted for about 45 per cent of sales. 'That means our ability to protect our margins is greater. It gives us the opportunity to price tactically when we need to.' Group turnover increased from Pounds 1.85bn to Pounds 1.99bn in the six months to September 30, in spite of what Boots called 'dull market conditions'. Exceptional items pushed Boots Pharmaceuticals' profit down to Pounds 2.1m from Pounds 58.4m last year. Sales increased 9.5 per cent to Pounds 252.8m, but when adjusted for devaluation of sterling, they fell 2.8 per cent. There was further bad news at Do It All, the DIY joint venture with WH Smith, where Boot's share of losses increased from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 7.9m, on sales down from Pounds 113.1m to Pounds 107.4m. Elsewhere, the outlook was brighter. Boots the Chemists lifted sales 5.8 per cent to Pounds 1.3bn, and profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 132.7m, while profits at Halfords, the motor accessories chain, almost quadrupled to Pounds 5.8m from sales up 9.6 per cent to Pounds 174.1m. The overall figures also included an exceptional gain of Pounds 9.8m on the disposal of Sephora, the French perfumes chain, and Boots print packaging business. The interim dividend was lifted from 4.6 to 4.9p, although the exceptional charges resulted in an 8 per cent fall in earnings to 11.5p. Stripping out exceptionals, the results were broadly in line with forecasts, and Boots shares gained 6p to 511p. Lex, Page 20</p>

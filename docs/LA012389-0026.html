			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> A federal appeals panel has cleared the way for hotel managers to rent movies  to guests to watch in their rooms, without having to worry about legal action.  The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court decision in a  copyright infringement case filed by Columbia Pictures Industries, Paramount  Pictures, Walt Disney Productions and four other studios. The movie makers  filed suit against La Mancha Private Club and Villas in Palm Springs, claiming  it was staging public performances of copyrighted material by allowing guests  to rent movies in a hotel gift shop to show in their rooms. Public showings of  films without licensing agreements violate federal copyright laws. The appeals  court affirmed an earlier ruling, saying that "while the hotel may be 'open to  the public,' a guest's hotel room, once rented, is not." ALEENE MacMINN and  VICTOR VALLE  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Stuttgart/Karlsruhe (DPA) -- During the search of  an apartment in Baden-Wuerttemberg in early May, police seized  what is probably 60 grams of plutonium 239. For several weeks  the authorities in southwest Germany obviously did not have any  idea how dangerous this find was. Only on Thursday [27 May] did  investigations by the Land Office for Environmental Protection  in Karlsruhe show that the material, which is in a small  cylindrical container, is probably this kind of plutonium, the  Environment Ministry in Stuttgart announced.    According to the Ministry, the amount seized is "highly  dangerous" and is so far the largest amount found in  Baden-Wuerttemberg. However, the amount is not sufficient to  produce a nuclear bomb. The material probably comes from an  East European country. The Stuttgart Land Office of Criminal  Investigations has taken over investigations.    Information about the occasion, the place, and the exact  date  of the search was not given for "tactical reasons." In  addition, the Ministry announced that "following initial  suspicion, the local fire brigade did not register any  radioactive radiation outside the container."</p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo active A mixture of US buying and a run to catch the bull market proved a powerful cocktail which pushed oil stocks ahead amid substantial turnover. Action was greatest in the secondliners with Lasmo reaching a hefty volume of 9.5m. After a recent run of large daily trading volume and steady price gains and recurrent bid rumours, one analyst said that a professional and concerted bull raid appeared to be taking place in the stock. 'Bid rumours and options talk have been feeding the frenzy,' he said. Lasmo climbed 7 1/2 to 153 1/2 p and marketmakers looked towards the US for buyers. American investors have increasingly viewed the UK oil sector as undervalued compared with their own domestic stocks. Enterprise Oil also benefited from transatlantic interest boosted by a very positive stance from SG Warburg. The broker sees Enterprise as one of the soundest based stocks in a sector expected to bounce after underperforming the buoyant market. Enterprise, a tightly held stock, moved up 29 to 480p in turnover of 2.5m. Cairn Energy had a successful day with Strauss Turnbull going positive and it added 5 to close at 60p. Burmah Castrol went up 13 to 785p ahead of interims next Thursday. The larger oil stocks were slower off the mark, with BP losing a penny to 320p and Shell pushing up 4 to 678p. News that Zeneca had received a UK licence for its heart drug Zestril attracted investors and the shares firmed 5 to 714p. US buyers early in the session, together with a lack of stock later in the day, saw Glaxo jump 16 to 588p, as 4.8m shares were dealt. Shares in chemicals company Brent International fell 7 to 116p, as the market reacted to an 86 per cent slump in interim profits, a warning from the chairman about full year profits and the departure of the company's chief executive. The success of Reuters' Pounds 350m share buy-back offer boosted trading in the stock yesterday. The shares jumped 32 to 1552p. This week's good results from Guardian Royal Exchange reverberated through the market, pushing the stock up 9 to 222p. Among transports, a positive review on the sector from SG Warburg benefitted NFC, and the shares moved 8 ahead to 277p. Speculation of a cut in French interest rates boosted several stocks with French interest. That list included channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel, whose shares gained 11 to 477p. General investment support was seen for UK airport operator BAA and the shares moved 19 ahead to 818p. Securities house UBS was said to be positive on Inchcape ahead of interim figures next month. The shares firmed 8 to 568p. Bass lost 9 to 502p as James Capel turned negative. Allied Lyons, which in the previous session made solid gains, continued upwards with a rise of 5 to 633p. Hopes that consumers would play a leading role in the recovery helped maintain a firm stores sector. Kingfisher pulled back ground lost in the previous session and moved ahead 13 to 678p while Marks and Spencer consolidated an already strong position with a rise of 4 1/2 to 377 1/2 p. Dixons gained 4 to 237p as did Dunhill Holdings which reached 401p. Good holiday bookings pushed Airtours upwards, adding 20 to the stock which reached 399p. Investor confidence was enlivened by Airtours out-performance of the sector in package bookings. The recent honeymoon with the market enjoyed by Barclays after the appointment of Mr Martin Taylor as chief-exectutive designate began to crumble with Smith New Court advising a switch from the stock into Lloyds. But Mr Martin Green of the broker said that the position was born out of a warming to Lloyds as opposed to a cooling with Barclays. In an almost straight reversal of fortunes Barclays gave up 6 to 508p in moderate turnover of 3.5m while Lloyds added 9 to close at 559p with 1.6m shares changing hands. TSB, which announced the sale of its car rental business EuroDollar, gained 3 to 203p. Further appreciation of this week's sale by international mining group RTZ of most of its Pillar business for around Pounds 800m brought a further advance in the shares. They gained another 10 to 734p. MB-Caradon, the purchaser of the businesses, appreciated 4 to 340p. Other statistics, Page 9</p>

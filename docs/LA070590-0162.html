			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> EARTHWATCH;  </P> <P> SAFER BUG TRAPS;  </P> <P> THE SON ALSO RISES AS AN ENVIRONMENT-CONSCIOUS BOY TEACHES ADULTS ABOUT NATURAL  PEST CONTROL.  </P> <P> The other day our friend Randee came over to show off her new baby. After the  requisite oohing and aahing, we asked her how she was doing. She burst into  tears. We assumed it was a postpartum mood swing, but we were astounded to  discover that the cause of her outburst was not sleep deprivation or feeding  woes. It was fleas.  </P> <P> Seems she'd bought her older child a puppy, an irresistible ball of fluff who,  it turned out, had an equally irresistible flea population.  </P> <P> My initial reaction was, why the tears? Just call an exterminator, or buy some  of those flea bombs and zap everything in sight. But before I even opened my  mouth I realized what a bad idea that was. We're all too environmentally aware  these days to calmly accept the idea of bombarding the air with DDT and the  like. As Randee was quick to point out, even the tiniest amounts of toxic bug  killers are a threat to a newborn baby.  </P> <P> What to do? My 12-year-old son provided the answer. He's a junior entomologist,  with a room full of forbidding-looking specimens in jars and display cases. He  had read in a bug club bulletin about a natural way to get rid of fleas and  proceeded to demonstrate.  </P> <P> First, he set out a shallow pan, like a baking pan, and filled it with water to  which he added some liquid soap. Next to it he placed a goose-necked lamp,  arranged so the light shone into the water. He explained that fleas are  attracted by heat and light, and they can't swim when the surface tension of  the water is broken by soap.  </P> <P> By leaving his contraption in the middle of a flea-infested room at night, the  bugs are attracted by the lamp, causing them to jump into the water and drown.  </P> <P> Well, we were skeptical, but Randee was desperate, so she tried it. The next  day, she called up to report that her first attempt resulted in a container  full of dead fleas. By repeating the experiment for a week, she got the flea  problem under control -- without having to bail out of the house.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, another bug crisis broke out, this time in our kitchen, where  someone (accusing fingers were pointed, but no guilty party was found) let a  half-eaten peach rot behind the stove. By the time the offending peach had been  found, the kitchen was full off fruit flies.  </P> <P> Again my son came to the rescue, this time with a two-quart plastic soda bottle  (the kind that looks as if a green or black bowl has been glued to the bottom)  and a bread knife. He energetically sawed the bottle through the middle. When  he was done, he poured some honey-water into the bottom half (he said any sweet  liquid would do) and stuck the inverted top half, spout pointing downward, into  the bottom half.  </P> <P> This, he announced, was a fly trap. Sure enough, the next morning the thing was  full of fruit flies. They had gone down the spout to get at the honey-water,  and then couldn't figure out how to get out again.  </P> <P> This set me to thinking. Without resorting to the disgusting rolls of flypaper  that used to hang from people's ceilings when I was a kid, I figured there must  be other ways to kill bugs without causing indoor pollution.  </P> <P> Well, there are. Locally, feed stores, pet stores and some health food stores  carry safer flea- and pest-control products for pets.  </P> <P> Traditional flea collars are problematic, it turns out. They emit a gas that,  when overused, can damage your pet's nervous system. And we throw away 50  million annually, posing a long-term pollution risk to soil and water. Some  hardware stores offer electric gizmos that zap bugs or repel them  electronically. But the proud parent in me somehow prefers my son's Rube  Goldberg bug machines. His bug club bulletin cited successful lab tests, but  had no data on home use.  </P> <P> All we know is it worked for us.  </P> <P> Last week's bad news about the ozone layer (more damaged than we thought)  indicted cleaning solutions along with the usual CFCs. And we already know  about pesticides in the food supply. Our obsession with "powerful" products for  banishing dirt and bugs now ironically threatens to louse up the air and land.  </P> <P> My son's "brain intensive" bug killers -- using knowledge rather than nukes --  are, I hope, an example of a good new trend. Randee thinks so. She's an author,  and she's now at work on a children's book: "Eco-Commando."  </P> <P> * THE DETAILS: Ventura Bookstore, (805) 643-4069, carries "Nontoxic and  Natural: How to Avoid Dangerous Everyday Products and Buy or Make Safe Ones" by  Debra Dadd. The Wharf, (805) 648-5035, carries a wide range of safer products,  and the staff is knowledgeable. For a series of pamphlets, "The Least Toxic  Pest Management Series," that provides information and recommendations on this  topic, send $1 to The Bio-Integral Resource Center, a private nonprofit  organization, at P.O.

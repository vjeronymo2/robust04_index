			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / International Company News: Hafnia extends bid deadline by a week HAFNIA, the troubled Danish insurer, has extended by a week the deadline before which potential bidders can make offers to buy the group because of the emergence of new interest. Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned French bank, yesterday refused to comment on speculation suggesting that it was the new party considering a bid. Potential bidders have until January 29 to submit their bids. Hafnia said the deadline had been extended to allow interested parties more time to conduct due diligence examinations. Several insurers have expressed interest in buying Hafnia's Danish general insurance and banking business. Skandia of Sweden, Scandinavia's biggest insurer, yesterday confirmed its interest. Mr Johan Bergenstjarna, Skandia chief of staff, said yesterday that Skandia was one of the companies conducting due diligence at Hafnia. Two Danish companies, ALM Brand and Codan, in which Sun Alliance of the UK has a 65 per cent stake, have expressed an interest. Two other companies, Tryg Forsikring and Germany's Allianz, Europe's biggest insurer, have been mentioned as possible bidders, although Allianz said yesterday that it had 'no comment whatsoever on such rumours'. Hafnia suspended payments to its creditors last year, after sustaining heavy losses in its portfolio of investments. The group owns nearly 34 per cent of Baltica, a rival Danish company, and 14.8 per cent of Skandia, Mr Steen Parsholt, Hafnia executive in charge of selling off the company's activities, told Reuters there had been great bidder interest in taking over the insurer. Hafnia's UK life insurance operation, the Kendal-based Prolific, was sold late last year to Scottish Provident, the mutual life insurer. Transamerica Corporation, the large San Francisco-based insurance and financial services conglomerate and Sedgwick, the London-based insurance broker, are to pump Pounds 12m (Dollars 18.24m) into their jointly-owned London market insurance subsidiary, River Thames Insurance. The cash injection, which is in proportion to the two companies' equity holdings, increases the net worth of River Thames to Pounds 26m. Transamerica and Sedgwick respectively own 51 per cent and 49 per cent of the group. River Thames will adjust its strategic direction to focus more tightly on specialist and treaty reinsurance business. Pre-tax losses at River Thames amounted to Pounds 9.5m in 1992 and Pounds 3.6m in 1991, with underwriting losses jumping to Pounds 16.4m from Pounds 10m. Premium income increased to Pounds 90.7m in 1992 from Pounds 85.4m in 1991</p>

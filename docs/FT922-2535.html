			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / E Midlands increases 41% EAST Midlands Electricity, the first regional electricity company to announce results for the year to March 31 1992, yesterday reported a 41 per cent increase in historic cost pre-tax profits to Pounds 150m. This was close to the 40 per cent average increase expected for the regional companies, and coincided with a warning from Offer, the electricity industry watchdog, that it would be watching the companies closely. East Midlands earnings per share also rose 41 per cent to 50.1p, and the dividend was up 13.7 per cent at 17.1p. Turnover rose 16 per cent to Pounds 1.54bn, and operating profit was up 38 per cent at Pounds 157.5m. Nearly Pounds 150m of this was earned in the core distribution business. The main reason for the high profit level, which was anticipated by the City, was that prices to consumers rose 11 per cent in April 1991. The main surprise in the results was a Pounds 4.6m profit in the electricity supply business, which is responsible for the bulk purchase and sale of electricity. This was in spite of a sharp increase in 'uplift', a charge the business pays to the pool, or electricity wholesale market, and it inspired City confidence in the company's purchasing strategy. Before uplift, the supply business made nearly Pounds 20m. Meanwhile, costs throughout the company fell Pounds 5m, as 231 jobs were lost over the year. The energy services businesses, acquired for Pounds 40m during the year, did better than expected, making a modest operating profit but a loss after financing costs. The new generating business, which invests in power stations, made a Pounds 0.4m loss while the retail division made a small Pounds 1.3m operating profit compared with Pounds 0.5m last year. The outlook for the coming year is for modest growth in the main business. Unit sales are likely to rise more than 1 per cent but below this year's 1.9 per cent. Costs will continue to fall, and the company has set aside Pounds 5.9m in provisions for further job losses. The energy services businesses are expected to move into profit. Analysts forecast pre-tax profits in a Pounds 160m-Pounds 175m range, giving earnings per share of 55.0p to 59.0p. Dividends, Mr John Harris, chairman, suggested, would be progressive, but were unlikely to increase as sharply as this year. Analysts' dividend forecasts fall between 18.7p and 19.3p.

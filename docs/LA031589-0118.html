			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GRAPES' TWO-WEEK TRAIL  </P> <P> According to Food and Drug Administration officials, the case of the tampered  grapes from Chile -- two berries among 335,976 cases of red seedless grapes  that reached the United States last weekend, began at the end of last month.  </P> <P> A chronology:  </P> <P> Feb. 27 -- The refrigerated freighter Almeria Star, loaded with Chilean grapes  and other fruits, steams toward the Port of Philadelphia.  </P> <P> March 2 -- The U.S. Embassy in Santiago, Chile, receives a telephone message  from an anonymous male caller warning in Spanish that export fruit would be  poisoned. The FDA and the State Department confer, rule it a "probable hoax,"  but FDA and USDA inspectors are put on alert.  </P> <P> March 8 -- The embassy receives a second call with the same message, similarly  ruled a "probable hoax," but government inspectors intensify their monitoring  as the Almeria Star sails up the Delaware River toward Philadelphia.  </P> <P> March 10-13 -- A total of 335,976 cases of grapes arrive in the Port of  Philadelphia. Inspectors examine 6,859 of these -- a far larger sample than  normal -- and select six "suspicious" berries from the Almeria Star's cargo.  </P> <P> March 12 -- Lab technicians in the FDA laboratory in Philadelphia detect traces  of cyanide in two of the suspicious berries, which show puncture marks.  </P> <P> March 13 -- After intense discussions, the FDA urges consumers to avoid  consumption of all Chilean fruit and recommends destroying any grapes on hand.  </P> <P> March 14 -- U.S. officials, exporters and importers ponder their next move  while ordering shipments now heading for the United States to be placed in  "detention" at U.S. ports.

			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> HAMMOND WINS BY SEVEN STROKES  </P> <P> Donnie Hammond completed a blitz of the Oak Hills Country Club course Sunday  with a six-under-par 64 for a seven-shot victory in the Texas Open at San  Antonio.  </P> <P> Hammond earned his second PGA title with a tournament-record 258, 22 under par  for 72 holes.  </P> <P> The seven-year veteran secured the victory when he rolled in a 30-foot eagle  putt on the 10th hole to open a five-shot advantage.  </P> <P> Runner-up Paul Azinger, after starting slowly, closed with a flurry of birdies  for a final-round 69 and a total of 265.  </P> <P> Bob Lohr and Duffy Waldorf, both with 71s, shared third place with Mark Wiebe  at 267. Wiebe closed with a 67.  </P> <P> Gary Player took advantage of a putting lapse by Rives McBee to gain a  one-stroke victory in the RJR championship at Clemons, N.C., the richest event  on the Senior PGA tour.  </P> <P> "He was playing in pain," McBee said of Player, who suffered a back spasm while  playing the fifth hole. "My hat's off to him."  </P> <P> Player, who crouched awkwardly to retrieve his ball from the cup and twice  almost lost his balance swinging, played down the condition.  </P> <P> It was "like a sheet of lightning," when the spasm hit, he said, but after  that, "it was not excruciating, just irritating, like a toothache."  </P> <P> Player, 53, who hit only three greens on the back nine, had to work hard for  his final-round 71 that gave him a 54-hole total of 207.  </P> <P> McBee lost a share of the lead when he missed an 18-inch, par-saving putt on  the 16th. He finished with an erratic 73 that included three birdies, four  bogeys and a double bogey.  </P> <P> Bernhard Langer of West Germany shot a bogey-free 68 to win the $540,000 German  Masters tournament at Stuttgart, West Germany.  </P> <P> Langer made four birdies to beat American Payne Stewart, the third-round  leader, and Spaniard Jose-Maria Olazabal, the defending champion, by one stroke  for his second European PGA victory of the year. He finished at 276.  </P></p>

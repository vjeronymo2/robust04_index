			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We recognize that, at this time, not all specialties have board certification programs. In at least one specialty, certification programs are being developed. To allow additional time for boards to request HHS approval, for us to review the requirements for appropriateness, and to ensure that laboratory directors can continue to meet the requirements as boards apply, we are extending the time period in &sect;493.1443 from September 1, 1994, to September 1, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Agency Approved by HHS To Certify Cytotechnologists (&sect;493.1483(b)(2))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the personnel requirements in &sect;493.1483(b)(2), an individual may qualify as a cytotechnologist if he or she is certified in cytotechnology by a certifying agency approved by HHS. In response to the regulations published February 28, 1992, numerous commenters suggested that the American Society of Clinical Pathologists (ASCP) be recognized by the Department since it is a national certifying agency for cytotechnologists in the United States. The ASCP applied for approval and provided materials in support of its request for recognition as a cytotechnologist certifying agency. The qualifications used by ASCP to qualify an individual as a cytotechnologist include both educational and training components that are similar to, or more stringent than, the current CLIA requirements for cytotechnologists. In addition, ASCP requires successful completion of a competency examination to measure skills in cytology. Since the ASCP's requirements for certifying individuals in cytotechnology meet the CLIA requirements, we are announcing that, effective on the date of publication of this rule, we have approved the ASCP as a certifying agency for cytotechnologists. Cytotechnologists certified by ASCP now meet the CLIA cytotechnologists personnel qualification requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Waiver of Delayed Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by the Administrative Procedure Act, we generally provide for final rules to be effective 30 days after the date of publication unless we find good cause to waive the delay. We believe that these revisions are essential to the effective implementation of the CLIA program and should be implemented immediately. Delaying the effective date of this regulation would potentially disrupt public access to laboratory services and create unnecessary confusion among laboratories in understanding the standards they must meet. Accordingly, we find good cause to waive the delayed effective date as contrary to the public interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Regulatory Impact Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all laboratories are considered to be small entities. Individuals and States are not included in the definition of a small entity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final rule may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule extends the date by which an individual must enroll in an approved cytology proficiency testing program, the date by which an individual with a doctoral degree must obtain board certification to qualify as a director of a laboratory that performs high complexity testing, and the expiration date of the phase-in for quality control requirements for unmodified, moderate complexity testing cleared through the FDA 510(k) or PMA processes. Because controlling components of the regulations (for example, approved PT programs and approved board certification programs) are not yet fully in place, compliance with these existing regulations is unachievable for most laboratories and their personnel. Extending the phase-in periods will result in continuation of previously published requirements and will not result in changed costs, savings, burden or opportunities to manufacturers, laboratories, individuals administering tests, or patients receiving them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule also announces the approval of ASCP as a certifying agency for cytotechnologists. The February 28, 1992 regulation added certification by an approved certifying agency as an optional method of qualifying as a cytotechnologist. The majority of those who commented on the cytotechnologist qualification requirements specified in the February 28, 1992 rule identified certification by ASCP as the preferred alternative method of qualifying and recommended that ASCP be approved by HHS as a certifying agency. The ASCP's certification requirements have been shown to meet or exceed CLIA requirements; therefore, the announcement of ASCP's approval should be well received by all affected entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are not preparing an analysis for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final rule will not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and will not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW: A SKID ROW BEACON ASKS FOR HELP  </P> <P> In its six years, Transition House, the place that provides the homeless with  support and tools to make the transition to mainstream society, has had a 63%  success rate in its program graduates. Thus, the Skid Row Development  Corporation and Charles C. Reed, president of Ahmanson Services, are asking for  greater support Feb. 23 at the party they host at the Los Angeles Athletic  Club.  </P> <P> Skid Row chairman Alden McKelvey and president Martha Brown Hicks hope for  generous donations, pointing out that Transition House is a permanent solution  to homelessness, not astopgap.  </P> <P> The cocktail affair will honor Ralphs Grocery Co. Mayor Tom Bradley and  Councilman Gilbert Lindsay are honorary co-chairmen. Sue Laris, Bruce Corwin,  Andrea Van de Kamp, Catherine Hearst, Charles Hathaway, Jim Hill, Hugh Loftus,  Morris Newman, Stephen Mellinger and Norman Dreyfuss are expected to be on  hand.  </P> <P> DOWN-HOME: Italian opera will be followed by an "Americana Party" (Virginia  ham, Vermont turkey, apple pie and cherry cobbler) at the black-tie opening of  the Music Center Opera's "Tancredi" (all-American cast) at the Dorothy Chandler  Pavilion Feb. 17. That evening, the Los Angeles Music Center Opera's 1988-89  season resumes with Marilyn Horne the star in her debut with the company.  </P> <P> Gala and Patron subscribers including Doug Cramer, Tara Colburn, Nicholas and  Sandra Costla, Nicholas and Janet Ciriello and Milt and Rosemary Okun are  expected for the party in the Pavilion Restaurant.  </P> <P> DRIVING FORCE: For two decades customers and friends alike have dashed to San  Juan Capistrano to see Gep (G. R.) Durenberger's new antiques shipments and  have tea with the popular antiquarian. When he established Gep's Folie at his  residence, a folly of a building where he brought the decorative arts leaders  of the world together for seminars, supporters flocked to his lectures.  </P> <P> Then Durenberger was asked to establish the cultural support for San Juan's  Michael Graves-designed library; he formed the support group Libros Y Artes  (Books and Arts). Now, he has given his incredible antiques shop to the city of  San Juan Capistrano for the new Center for the Study of Decorative Arts he's  directing.  </P> <P> Friends from around the United States and all over California were in San Juan  Capistrano last weekend to celebrate with Gep at a black-tie gala and to  premiere the inaugural exhibition, "California Style: Collectors and  Collections," which is open to the public Tuesdays through Saturdays until May  6, when the exhibits change.  </P> <P> Leading the admiring crowd at the opening was Stanley Barrows of New York, dean  emeritus at Parsons School of Art and former chairman of Interior Design at the  Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. Gep's old pal from Notre Dame, New  York and Montecito, designer John Saladino, was in the crowd, bringing Lyn and  Norman Lear, whose house he's redesigning. Gothic collectors and former  Pasadenans Jack and Jody Pike, now of San Juan Capistrano, beamed over their  decorative contributions to the evening.  </P> <P> Party chairman Electa Anderson and Gaye Birtcher, Joyce MacRae, Kay Evans and  Bettie Auerbach made sure the overflow crowd got juggled. Philip and Sandy  Jacoby, who are building the Marbella Golf and Country Club, donated $25,000 to  underwrite the night, creating a lot of fun for everyone including Kay (she was  chairman of exhibits) and Don Evans, Bud Sampson and Freda Weegar, Tom and Lucy  Hartford, Harrison Negley, Judy and Steven Smith of La Jolla, Sandi and Tom  Ewing, Dorothy and Don Koll, Gavin and Ninetta Herbert, John Benecke, Barbara  and William Steinwedell, Marily and Schuyler Haskell and Bob and Lori  Warmington.  </P> <P> SOCIAL SCENE: Lee Minnelli hosted a luncheon at the Bistro Garden for her New  York friend Mary Lou (Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt) Whitney.

Rodeo Dr.  </P> <P> IN THE BANK: Chairman Pat Smith says Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy in La  Canada is richer from the Mardi Gras fund-raiser at La Canada Country Club.  </P> <P> off  </P> <P> CELEBRATING LIFE: The late Joan Orr, wife of Verne Orr, former Secretary of the  U.S. Air Force, succumbed in 1988 to Lou Gehrig's Disease, but before she died,  she discovered a passion for creative dance -- and its therapeutic value. She  reassembled the dance class she had led before the Orrs' departure to  Washington. She also had been president of the Pasadena Arts Council and became  the first chairwoman of the famed Bella Lewitzky Dance Company.  </P> <P> Thus, the Light-Bringer Project, in association with the Pasadena Arts Council,  paid tribute to her at Polytechnic School's Garland Auditorium last week,  documenting her work on videotape ("A Question of Balance: The Life of Joan  Orr"), showing her conducting classes from her wheelchair just two weeks before  her death. Jess Marlow, Mrs. Lewitzky, Scripps College President John Chandler  and Carole Babcock were all on the program.  </P> <P> KEEPING UP: Paulist Boy Choristers of California benefited from the California  wine festival this week at St. Paul's in Westwood.

He discussed state affairs with other NPC deputies.  After the meeting, Jiang Zemin agreed to an interview with our  station correspondent. The following is a related report from  Beijing by special correspondent Zhu Mei:    [Begin recording] [Zhu Mei] From assuming the post of  Shanghai mayor to becoming general secretary of the CPC Central  Committee, Jiang Zemin has always showed great concern for the  shopping basket issues of urban residents. He often said the  situation can be determined from what is in citizen's shopping  baskets. Jiang asked cadres at various levels to place the  shopping basket issue on their important daily agendas. Today,  he once again mentioned the topic of shopping baskets.    [Jiang Zemin] I am concerned about commodity prices. I had  been in Shanghai for many years and roughly knew the prices of  foodstuffs in all the markets. I am also (?interested) in  commodity prices in Beijing. Regretfully, I cannot go there to  ask about prices. However, family members often go to the Xidan  Food Market. [words indistinct] Eggs were 2.8 yuan in Shanghai.  Right? Now the price seems a little cheaper, something like  2.7 yuan. Generally speaking, the masses still have complaints  about commodity prices, feeling they are too high. However, now  the capability and income level of the masses have also  increased somewhat. [words indistinct] The residents are very  concerned about the price of foodstuffs, such as preserved eggs,  meat, and [word indistinct]. Their main concern is their  shopping basket and (?food grain).    [Zhu Mei] In his talk, General-Secretary Jiang Zemin  stressed the dialectics of speed of our country's economic  development.    [Jiang Zemin] Development is the final word. This is  totally correct. Comrade Xiaoping has made a series of  important expositions on the issue of development. He asked us  to seize opportunity in order to accelerate reform and  development. In short, if you have conditions for development,  you should be able to development in a relatively rapid manner.  In areas lacking the conditions for development, you should  create conditions for development; but you must not be too  hasty, and must not insist on development if you clearly do not  have the conditions for development. It will eventually create  problems. I am talking about the situation of the entire  country, including Shanghai. Every county and every district  cannot develop in a balanced manner based on the same model. We  all want to be rapid. Concerning speed, Comrade Li Peng put  forward a figure of 9 percent. Of course this 9 percent cannot  be applied to all locales because the situation in various  regions is different. We cannot demand the same speed. We must  not blindly seek output value and expand the scale of  investment. We also must not solely depend on beginning new  projects. In my opinion, Shanghai has very good conditions,  including the quality of workers and level of management and  market. The main conditions are all very good. Therefore we  have great expectations.    [Zhu Mei] Comrade Jiang Zemin had in the past worked at  large and medium enterprises for a long time. He has great  expectations in the improvement of large and medium enterprises  in Shanghai, and has established a modern system for socialist  enterprises.    [Jiang Zemin] [Words indistinct] We should use a third eye  to look at a book [as heard]. We should (?analyze the  situation) from social and political angles. Whoever grasps the  leadership of large and medium enterprise will have gripped the  lifeline of the state. There is reason for it, because they are  the backbone of the socialist ownership system. Therefore, we  must do an effective job in developing state-owned large and  medium enterprises, and must not fail in this work. We must  only strengthen our efforts, and not weaken them. As to how to  do a good job in this respect, I am willing to discuss this with  you. For example, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee called for establishing a modern enterprise  system. [words indistinct] The level of development of  state-owned large and medium enterprises is different in various  localities. For instance, the level of development in Shanghai  is relatively high. Even in Shanghai, the situation is not the  same. It is necessary to make an analysis. Under the  leadership of the CPC, state-owned large and medium enterprises  must still give full play to the administrative leadership of  plant directors; party committees should adopt the role of  political core. We should also develop the initiative of the  broad masses of staff members and workers in production as the  masters of the country. The trial of the joint stock system at  selected units will not annul their position of being masters of  the country; it will not annul their position. Therefore, we  may have to give some assistance to state-owned large and medium  enterprises which suffer from serious economic losses [words  indistinct], but not those enterprises which have no future in  development [words indistinct].    [Zhu Mei] Jiang Zemin talks with zest about refined art,  popular songs, cultural accomplishments, and other light  subjects.    [Jiang Zemin] Concerning Shanghai's philharmonic orchestra,  music, and related topics, in an earlier period there were [zui  xin zu] and (?four great heavenly emperors) [si da tian wang].  In regards to them, we should give people guidance. So many  people enjoy them, but are not allowed to watch. The  Constitution has no such stipulation. In addition, some are  fond of these things. Talking about popular songs, some are  very good. But it seems a little bit too much if they indulge  their passion in those things. If the great Chinese people do  not know anything about Beethoven's 9th Symphony and (?happy  song) [huan le song], [words indistinct] it is not good. I  heard that our comrade (Min Huifen) has a large audience [words  indistinct], and erhu [two-stringed bowed instrument] can be  developed. Those things need support by (?performers), the  state, and various departments. China is a nation with an  outstanding culture; we also have several thousand years of  history [words indistinct].    [Zhu Mei] At 1745 this afternoon, soon after the discussion  with the Shanghai delegation, Shanghai reporters immediately  rushed toward Jiang Zemin. I was the first to step forward and  make a request of the general-secretary.    [Zhu Mei] General Secretary Jiang, please say something to  us. We are all from Shanghai.    [Jiang Zemin] Of course. I hope Shanghai will develop more,  and people will have a happier life. As a resident of Shanghai,  I am convinced Shanghai has much talent and outstanding  conditions. For instance, Pudong is developing quite well. I  repeatedly said last year that the principle and policy for  Pudong will be implemented in a firm manner. I am very grateful  to you for asking me to come here and speak.    [Zhu Mei] When a reporter asked the general secretary when  would he see Shanghai's Yangpu Bridge, Jiang Zemin said:    [Jiang Zemin, in Shanghai dialect] I wish I could go there  tomorrow.

We have come in response to an invitation from brother  President Abu-'Ammar, he said. He added that President 'Arafat  will address an appeal concerning the democratic national  dialogue with all Palestinian forces and factions, and  immediately afterward he ['Arafat] will begin this dialogue.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi also said: We hope this invitation will  receive good responses and understanding from everyone and  contribute toward the realization and entrenchment of the  overall national unity.    He added: During those meetings with President 'Arafat, we  emphasized the necessity to recall the qualified Palestinians in  various fields to build the Palestinian objectives, a matter  that requires the existence of an actual democratic practice,  and this is what our memorandum stressed.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi added that the response to the proposals  of  the group was that some of those proposals were already in  practice, and that there was a council that planned and  exercised this required role. [sentence as heard] We have  requested the activation of this body, and with regard to human  resources, we expressed our desire to be selected according to  qualifications and competence.    Concerning the Construction and Economic Development  Council,  the response was that there was a special bureau that was in  charge of that matter.    Concerning the consultative committees within and outside  the  occupied territories, the response was that the national  authority will be composed from people inside and outside [the  occupied territories], and the authority council will undertake  whatever was necessary -- such as the setting up of committees  and dealing with other questions, such as municipal affairs.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi stressed that during these deliberations,  the need to firmly establish the democratic concept and begin  the national dialogue were emphasized in order to realize  comprehensive national unity.</p>

Some experts are asking why the prosecutor  general was not given these intelligence reports before the  communique was issued by the Higher Council of National Security  and Defense. Here is a report by Miriam Ortiz:    [Begin Ortiz recording] The Security Council based its  decision on intelligence reports to prohibit the transfer of  some Medellin Cartel members to the maximum security section at  the Itagui prison. According to authorities, Carlos Alzate  Urquijo, a.k.a. Arete, is Roberto Escobar's successor. After  the attempt on his life, Roberto Escobar, a.k.a. Osito,  delegated to Arete all of the functions he inherited from his  brother Pablo Escobar. Roberto Escobar did this because he felt  that with Alzate's leadership qualities, his family ties, and  the respect he commands among his cohorts, there was no one  better than Alzate to recover lost ground, prevent front men  from taking over their properties, and prevent the dominance of  the Cali Cartel.    According to intelligence reports, Arete is followed in the  hierarchy by Luis Carlos Aguilar Gallego, a.k.a. Mugre; Jose  Fernando Posada, a.k.a. Jaime Eduardo; and Gustavo Adolfo Arrula  [name as heard], a.k.a. Maxwell.    The intelligence reports add that there is proof of links  between the Medellin Cartel and the guerrilla groups based in  Antioquia Department, especially with the Urban Militias led by  the ELN [Army of National Liberation]. According to a statement  by Pipe Perez [not further identified], Alzate Urquijo was the  direct contact between the cartel and guerrilla leaders. The  state intelligence agencies also report that Otto [Ottoniel  Gonzalez Franco] and Popeye [John Jairo Velasquez] have, for the  time being, moved out of the organization's spotlight and now  want to make peace with their enemies.

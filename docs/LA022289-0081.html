			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> SLOW-GROWTH MEASURE UPSET  </P> <P> An Orange County judge ruled unconstitutional a slow-growth measure approved by  San Juan Capistrano voters in November that would have banned major new  developments. Superior Court Judge William F. McDonald found that the city's  Measure X -- virtually identical to a countywide initiative that failed in June  -- placed an unfair burden on future developers to correct problems with  traffic, sewer and other public works caused by previous developments. "This  means that the slow-growthers will finally have to recognize the limitations  that the Constitution and state law put on their ability to restrain  development," said Jeffrey Thomas, an attorney for developers. Leaders of the  slow-growth movement, frustrated by what they said was the judge's  misinterpretation of the ordinance, say they now will be forced to seek new  options for slowing development. Among those options, they said, could be  case-by-case referendums on major projects.  </P></p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Blair claims survey shows cuts in training provision UP TO 60,000 school-leavers could find themselves without Youth Training scheme places in the coming months in spite of government guarantees that all young people would be provided for, the Labour party claimed yesterday . A survey of the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils carried out by Labour showed that, in real terms, the YT budget was being cut by Pounds 50m or 7 per cent in the current year, said Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary. In addition, the budget for Employment Training for adults was being cut by Pounds 65m, or over 15 per cent, even though unemployment was continuing to rise, he said. Mr Blair challenged the government to 'confirm or deny' the figures and to explain why ministers 'have consistently denied that cuts are taking place and that waiting lists exist, when the evidence that we have uncovered proves precisely the opposite'. Mr Patrick McLoughlin, employment minister, said the guarantee of YT provision was being met 'broadly speaking' and that funding this year was also 'broadly in line' with last year's allocations, in spite of more young people staying on at school. The government would discuss with individual Tecs any problems about funding or meeting the guarantee, said Mr McLoughlin. He added that some waiting lists were largely administrative because some courses started only at particular times of the year. Sixty out of the 82 Tecs replied to Labour's survey. London Tecs are still negotiating over funding.</p>

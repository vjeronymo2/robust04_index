			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Gardening: Why I no longer panic about primulas - After 30 fear-filled years, Robin Lane Fox discovers the truth about a hardier-than-expected family THIS early spring is giving us an advance ticket to heaven. Crocus Cream Beauty has never been better; early camellias are in their element; the beads of yellow flower on the admirable Stachyurus will reassure anyone who may be wondering why the FT chose it recently as its Plant of the Week. Admittedly, there has been one unwanted takeover: moss has overrun the gaps which two dry summers have caused in the lawn. Never mind: in Japan, they grow whole gardens of it. Meanwhile, my eye is fixed at ground level, where there is early movement among the primulas. Primulas are not the natural friend of gardeners with my dry, stony soil. They like Scotland, cool conditions and plenty of rain in the growing season. However, I have been too scared for too long. In early spring, all the varieties of Primula Marginata appear to flourish locally although the soil is not exactly wet. They are enchanting plants whose leaves are fringed at the edges and whose flowers are usually a shade on the scale from lilac to violet. Linda Pope is the most famous, but there are a dozen others which are every bit as good. They seem to grow so easily without running water or peat. I have been slow to realise their easy nature, but you might be quicker, especially if you sent for the reasonably-priced list of them from Potterton and Martin, Moortown Road, Nettleton, Caistor, Lincs LN7 6HX. The company supplies by post but likes three first-class stamps for a copy of its list. These easy varieties have only just dawned on me, but my most acute blindness lies elsewhere: for years, I have also thought that all auriculas were awkward, too. I used to believe that they needed damp shade and had to be covered with glass in winter. This false impression derived from my grandmother's garden, which was turned into a cold frame in late autumn when auriculas were all given sheets of glass, like an umbrella. The impression of difficulty was confirmed by exhibitors. They would show rare auriculas with flowers ringed in green and black: their leaves were dusted with a silver film which would never tolerate winter outdoors. The art of breeding lay in minute details, such as the clarity of the edge between the flower's centre and its contrasting outer rim. One great grower even told me that he would never handle his plants, except with the brush of badger-hair which he used when shaving his face. Nowadays, badgers have to be handled quite differently, but so do auriculas, because I realise that all these rules apply only to one part of the family. There are plenty of others which do not need glass hats; they do not need shade; they do not even need moisture. They seem to grow perfectly well in full sun in my dry and stony soil where their only shelter is the shade cast by other plants. They are thick with buds and I look back on 30 years, wasted under a misapprehension. The next 30 years will not be wasted on false economies. It is easy enough to grow ordinary auriculas from seed or find them in any old nursery. Typically, the flowers are a dark maroon and have a cream ring smudged in their centre. The result is not very attractive, although it performs quite well. Named forms, however, are a different matter. Like delphiniums, auriculas are one of those families whose selected forms make the seed-raised varieties look very inferior. You may have to pay up to Pounds 3 a plant for the best colours, but you can see them going through their paces in the next month or so and realise that you are buying quality. The modern queen of the auricula is Brenda Hyatt, at Bluebell Hill, Chatham, Kent: she and her daughter delight the public every year at Chelsea with the finest forms in shades of green and black. These varieties will never survive outdoors in a garden, but others in the Hyatt stable are tougher. Alternative sources are Field House Nurseries, Leake Road, Gotham, Notts, or Craven's Nursery, Windsor End, Beaconsfield, Bucks. All three will send properly-packed plants by post, but do please send them three first class stamps if you write to ask for a full catalogue. Everyone has their favourites, but the four which have given me most pleasure recently are Blue Velvet, Old Irish Blue, Paradise Yellow and Old Yellow Dusty Miller. I must emphasise that I have given them all a place in full sun, without any peat or winter protection. They have had a dash of explosive pig manure but nothing further. The past winter has savaged many of the silver-leaved plants nearby but the auriculas are all set up for heavy flowering, refuting the old idea that they are only fit for cool, northern gardens. Of course, you can then move up and join the experts. Anything marked S Aur in the Plantfinder is a challenging show auricula which must be kept carefully under glass for most of the year. In their way, they are wonderful and not really very difficult, so long as they avoid rain or direct, continual sun. Nonetheless, they are not the primulas which are now in my daydreams. As my gang of four increases, it will be divided, sub-divided and built up into a continuous ribbon of flower. Making up for the lost years, I aim to end up with hardy auriculas edging entire flowerbeds in the sun.</p>

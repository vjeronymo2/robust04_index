			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / City is criticised on 'green' reporting City institutions have shown little interest in environmental reporting, Mr Ian Taylor, junior minister for trade and technology, said yesterday. He told a seminar organised by the Advisory Committee on Business and the Environment that retailers had become nervous that any stigma associated with poor environmental performance by suppliers would attach to them. This was 'feeding through the supply chain' in demands for better management. Mr Martin Scicluna, a partner of accountants Touche Ross, said accounting standards were adequate for companies to start disclosing environmental costs and liabilities in balance sheets and profit and loss accounts. He said there was likely to be increasing demand for accountants to provide independent verification of environmental reports, as his firm had done for Coats Viyella, the UK's largest textiles company.</p>

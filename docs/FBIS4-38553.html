			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe June 1 TASS -- A total of 11 big  underground ammunition depots were found in Tajik Pamir  highlands during a joint raid carried out by the local security  units and Tajik interior troops. Field engineers removed a  large number of explosives, ammunition, rocket shells,  unexploded air bombs and spare parts for them, mostly of foreign  origin, ITAR-TASS learned from the headquarters of the Tajik  Defence Ministry today.    The aim of the search operation conducted at the end of May  was to inspect whether army units of the Defence Ministry were  ready to cut short possible attempts by the Tajik opposition to  destabilise the political situation in the area of Pamir  highlands and confiscate weapons illegally kept by the local  population.    The Tajik Defence Ministry admitted the presence of anti-  government formations in gorges located in hardly accessible  areas of Pamir highlands, including in the Tavildarinsk and  Darvas regions. However, military sources said that the groups  were not big and posed no serious threat. The local population  does not support anti-government formations, since the majority  of the Tajik residents support the present constitutional  government and its efforts to stabilise the political situation  both in the Pamir region and in the entire republic.    Tajik defence minister, Major-General Aleksandr  Shishlyannikov, dismissed rumours spread by some Western media  alleging that there are areas in the Pamir region offering  serious armed resistance to the authorities. In a recent  interview to Russian journalists the Tajik defence minister said  in his usual sharp manner that "the alleged presence of  thousand-strong detachments of fighters of the opposition in  Tajik mountains is pure imagination of the irreconcilable  opposition and some journalists."    At the same time the general pointed out that the Tajik  Government does not intend to remain indifferent to incidents of  terroristic attacks launched by Tajik militants both against  lawful representatives of the military, local authorities and  peaceful civilians. According to the general, detachments of  the Tajik government forces keep the situation in the Pamir  region under control and heavily guard the Khaburabad mountain  road, ensuring the safety of cargoes on a highway connecting  central Tajikistan with the Gorno-Badakhshan autonomous region.</p>

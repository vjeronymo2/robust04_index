			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 26 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Japan  will agree to exchange goodwill Naval fleet visits and military  flight schedules over the open seas.    The agreement is being sealed by Defense Minister Yi  Pyong-tae, who left for Tokyo Tuesday morning as the first South  Korean defense minister to visit Japan, when he meets his  Japanese counterpart for one and a half hours later in the  afternoon, a Defense Ministry official said.    Under the pact, South Korean Naval vessels will call at a  Japanese port in the fall and a Japanese fleet will make a  return call sometime thereafter.    Yi and his Japanese counterpart will also discuss regional  security in Northeast Asia, including the international row over  North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program, and ways to  increase bilateral military exchanges, the official added.    During his stay in Tokyo, Yi will pay a courtesy call on new  Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and his foreign minister.    He will fly to Moscow on Thursday -- also becoming the first  South Korean defense minister to visit Russia -- and remain  there until next Tuesday. He is scheduled to meet with Russian  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev to discuss increasing personnel  and other military exchanges and sign the Korea-Russia 1994-95  memorandum of understanding on military exchanges.    From Russia he will proceed to Germany to meet with his  German counterpart on expansion of the Korea-Germany military  technology exchange program and to visit major military  installations.    Yi will return home on Thursday next week, winding up his  11-day tour of the three countries.</p>

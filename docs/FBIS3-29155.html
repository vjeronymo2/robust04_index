Hosokawa said he has not yet directed the taking of concrete  steps to arrest the yen, which closed at 102.02 yen to the  dollar in Tokyo the same day, up 3.67 yen from Monday's close.    "It seems the yen is being bought on speculation. I want to  deal with the problem after carefully watching further  developments," he told reporters at his official residence.</p>

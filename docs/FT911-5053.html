			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Schoolmasterly approach to encouraging exporters - Ralph Atkins talks to trade minister Tim Sainsbury IF CONSERVATIVES are more concerned about export promotion under Mr John Major, the difference is in emphasis rather than substance of policy - at least if Mr Tim Sainsbury, minister for trade, is the guide. His list of priorities for promoting exports is headed by the breaking down of international trade barriers and the creation of the right framework for traders worldwide. Any Thatcherite would agree eagerly. It is a free market strategy in keeping with the Department of Trade and Industry's reputation as the driest in Whitehall. From Mr Sainsbury that is something of a revelation. Out of the five DTI ministers, he is part of the minority of two who are not members of the deeply-Thatcherite No Turning Back Group. His early political experience was in the shadow of Mr Michael Heseltine, now environment secretary, and regarded as more of an interventionist than most in the Cabinet. Mr Sainsbury was his unpaid parliamentary private secretary for four years in the early 1980s, before coming to the DTI via junior ministerial jobs at the Ministry of Defence and Foreign Office. In piloting through parliament the bill to privatise part of the Export Credit Guarantee Department, however, Mr Sainsbury has displayed little willingness to appease those anxious for a more pro-active export strategy. Removing much of the ECGD from the state sector is in keeping with his vision of government as an 'enabler'. Aged 58, he is not a high-profile politician. He is careful and thorough in his choice of words; he could never be accused of indiscretion. At times he has the air of a schoolmaster, more at home on the DTI's cream ministerial settees than on the green Commons benches. In his office, he fondly explains ECGD privatisation in terms of a company selling widgets, wrapping his mouth around the word 'widgets' as if it was a boiled sweet. Officials find he quotes Sainsbury's repeatedly when searching for examples of business practice. Mr Sainsbury prefers the life of a minister to that of a businessman. It is a vocation rather than a job; his wealth almost certainly putting him in the category of multi-millionaire. The Sunday Times recently estimated the Sainsbury family's fortune at Pounds 1.85bn. He gave up executive responsibility at the supermarket group in 1974. But, ask him exactly how rich he is and he bristles: 'I have never disguised the fact that I have a substantial personal equity stake in J. Sainsbury and it has been a very successful company.' In practice, much of the headline-grabbing work of the minister for exports has been dominated by Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary. During his first eight months in the job, Mr Sainsbury admits there has been 'a lot of activity' on the international scene in attempting to break down trade barriers. 'Before you can actually start selling anything you have got to have a framework in which you can do it,' he says. Only after that does he believe a trade minister should turn to looking at the effective use of government resources and staff - including his own role as a salesman. Recently Mr Sainsbury announced the setting up of Overseas Trade Services, a joint body spanning the DTI and the Foreign Office. On top of that is the British Overseas Trade Board, within the DTI, comprising 180 businessmen who advise the government. The BOTB's forward plan, launched last month, says priorities for export promotion should remain western Europe, Japan, the Pacific Rim nations and North America. Small and medium-sized companies in particular are to be encouraged to tackle export markets. Mr Sainsbury denies there is duplication between the BOTB and the joint directorate. 'The first advice you want about the priorities is from the practitioners of the art. That's where the BOTB come in.' In the areas of 'the direct working with exporters', the government runs multifarious schemes offering advice and assistance. He travels to get businessmen access to foreign governments and raise the profile of British business. But he is adamant that exporting is only something companies can do. 'The message you are trying to get across is that exporting is not as difficult as you think it is, if you haven't tried it.'</p>

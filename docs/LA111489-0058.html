			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Dataproducts Faces Another Foe: David J. Greene &amp; Co., a New York  investment firm, raised its stake in Dataproducts Corp. to 5.5% and threw its  support behind another group's effort to oust Dataproducts' directors. In a  filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Greene said it now owns 1.1  million shares of the Woodland Hills-based maker of computer printers. Greene  also said it favors a proposal by DPC Acquisition Partners to take over  Dataproducts' board and then liquidate the company. DPC also had made a  $10-a-share tender offer to buy the company, which Dataproducts rejected.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kharkov, 6 June -- Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk said a new government must be formed as soon as next  week. He was in Kharkov today, speaking at a meeting of leaders  of agricultural machine building enterprises. He said that  first and foremost it is necessary to confirm the prime  minister, who is to submit to the Supreme Soviet a list of  cabinet ministers. The president said that he has held  consultations and meetings with members of standing commissions,  factions, and parliament. The meetings considered approaches to  the way the Cabinet of Ministers is to be formed and proposed  possible candidacies.    Those invited to the meeting, apart from Leonid Kravchuk,  were leaders of nearly 200 enterprises and more than 30  organizations involved in science and design. The most  important issues concerning relations between enterprises and  the state were raised. It was noted that these are now on the  brink of crisis. Because of the disruption in economic links  with countries of the CIS, shortage of resources and transport,  some enterprises have been standing idle for several months a  year, having no money to pay their workers.    "State factories must be given the opportunity to use  civilized methods to sell their goods," according to Valentin  Boblik, director general of the Kharkov tractor works. "It is no  longer possible to use barter deals exchanging tractors,  combines, and sowers for rice, buckwheat, sugar, and gasoline."    Speaking at the meeting, Leonid Kravchuk said that Ukraine  has a rather well-developed production and scientific base to  produce machinery. However, a critical situation has arisen,  because of a number of instances of poor coordination, the  stalling of economic reforms, and the disruption in economic  links in most branches of industry and agriculture. He said  that he has signed a decree on urgent measures to improve  financial and credit provision, and to form state food resources  for 1994-95. The president said he is happy with the position  taken by some leaders of enterprises who said that they no  longer need credits. This position is correct, he said. In  their opinion, these resources must be urgently channelled into  agriculture so as to enable collective and state farms to buy  technology. Leonid Kravchuk said that the decree provides for  precisely such mechanisms.</p>

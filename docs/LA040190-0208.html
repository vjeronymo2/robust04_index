			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'KEEP IT PRIVATE'  </P> <P> Funny how unimportant matters cause The Times' staff so much grief. Your  editorial "Gay Bashing and the GOP" (March 17) opines that the California  Republican Party can now "get on to more important matters" after the party had  opted to affirm the heterosexual ethic, while Dianne Klein writes (March 18)  that she "has far more important things to take up (her) time." No doubt,  Dianne -- but then, why write about it?  </P> <P> Could it be that the public policy issue of homosexuality is only interesting  to The Times' staff in direct proportion to the political successes of the  homosexual movement?  </P> <P> I feel confident that if homosexuals would have carried the day in Santa Clara  it would have been front page news, bold headlines and all. The fact is that  the Times' staff writhes in pain every time the homosexual movement takes a  political beating (remember Irvine, Concord, San Francisco and now UC Irvine?).  Assurances of disinterest cannot hide the frustrations.  </P> <P> All people are welcome in the Republican Party under at least two conditions.  First, all members should support party platforms. And second, all members  should check their sexual preferences at the door.  </P> <P> Klein takes umbrage that I define the homosexual quest for social acceptability  as seeking "special privileges" rather than "civil rights." Homosexuals have  the same civil rights as other Americans. What they do not have are special  social privileges that many other Americans have.  </P> <P> For instance, two men do not have the special privilege of a legally recognized  marriage. They do not have the special privilege of adopting children. They do  not have the special privilege of unlimited military service. They do not have  the special privilege of filing a joint tax return. Most significantly, and  fortunately all Americans lack this privilege, they do not have the right to be  grossly offensive in public.  </P> <P> The message which fails to penetrate the homosexual pathology is: Keep it  private, keep it consensual, keep it among adults and nobody will bother you.  The rest of the world seems able to live by these rules, and they are  stigmatized when they don't. Why should homosexuals have the "special  privilege" to forgo these rules?  </P> <P> WILLIAM E.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 16 Jun (NA) -- President Carlos Menem  denied today that it could be considered a defeat that the  chiefs of state participating in the Ibero-American Summit had  not issued an opinion against abortion, as "only three or four  countries" had opposed his proposal, for which reason the  required unanimity was not obtained.    Menem also indicated that he "absolutely" was not bothered  by  the demonstration, called the Federal March to Plaza de Mayo,  announced by state unions in the interior of the country, as  long as they do not "create any kind of disturbances."    The president made these remarks upon arriving at the  Metropolitan Airport from Colombia just before 0800.</p>

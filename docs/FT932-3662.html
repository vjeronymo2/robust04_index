			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A passion for perfect cheeses - Giles MacDonogh meets a woman on a serious food mission MORE THAN any other foodstuff, with the possible exception of meat, cheese requires the most careful handling on the part of shops and supermarkets. In the smaller supermarkets cheese presents a problem: swaddled in plastic and kept at maturation-inhibiting temperatures, the cheeses are robbed of any qualities they might have ever had. They might as well be used for cooking, for as often as not, attempts to coax them back to life by keeping them in a warm room fail absolutely. Few things depress me as much as the sight of a secretary scurrying back to her office from the local supermarket clutching a piece of 'Brie' (generally from the Allgau in Germany); a cheese which has never ripened and which never will, and which resembles in no respect the rare and remarkable cheeses which are still made in the Brie province in north eastern France. From the depths of the these black thoughts, it is wonderful to learn that there are still a few people who feel passionately for 'real' cheese and who are ready, even in these times of cheese-stifling health regulations, to open a shop dedicated to the very best of European cheeses. One such person is Patricia Michelson of La Fromagerie in Highbury, north London, a shop which opened just two weeks before Christmas last year but which has already proved the most exciting new cheesemonger to appear in the capital since the launch of the Neals Yard Dairy in Covent Garden more than a decade ago. This is not the first time that Patricia Michelson has come to the attention of this page. A few years ago she started a wholesale business which she operated from her garden shed. This tiny, 10 ft square shop, however, has been her first chance to offer a selection to the public as a whole. They have certainly taken her up on it: as I sat interviewing her on a weekday evening, desperate cheese-lovers scratched anxiously at the door. On a normal day she can accommodate them: she is often open as late as 9pm. The minuscule shop is already under sentence of death, as the authorities want to turn the site into sheltered housing. Patricia is unworried. She already has her eyes on another premises across the road, and once the building work is finished she will get her old shop back, which she will turn into a charcuterie, selling hams and sausages. Even now La Fromagerie finds space for good bread (including the tooth-shattering loaves of Lionel Poilane); Tuscan and Umbrian olive oils; pulses; sun-dried vegetables; honeys; and delicious raw-milk butters from Normandy and the Charentes. She also has a wide selection of olives which she makes up herself using recipes from around the Mediterranean. Naturally the chief thing is cheese. Patricia was switched on to cheese by skiing holidays in the Savoy where she met the great cheeses of Franche-Comte as often as not made from the milk of the wonderfully named Abondance cow. French cheeses are her first love, but the shop has much more besides. She is a hard woman to catch out: there are pungent, washed-rind cheeses from Belgium; mountain cheeses from Italy; Dutch and Swiss cheeses; great blue cheeses from the British Isles; all arranged in such a way as to encourage their ripening, so that here, as in a great French cheese-shop, you may stipulate the precise day on which you intend eating your cheese. Nothing is bought from the London trade. The purchases are all made in the country of origin. This ensures that many of these cheeses are available nowhere else. Here are a few of Patricia's specialities: Parmigiano Reggiano (Parmesan) from Italy. The 'Stravecchio' or 'very old' is a white, winter milk cheese of the sort valued in Parma itself (Pounds 9.30 per lb). This should be placed on the cheese board and not grated. For grating there is a 1990 Parmesan (Pounds 7.30). Asiago from the Veneto in Italy. This hard cheese is often confused with Parmesan. It has a nutty flavour and a good tangy finish (Pounds 5.70). Truffle cheese from Piedmont in Italy. This is half goats' milk and half cow with a natural rind. This is a remarkable cheese with a very powerful truffle aroma. Patricia thinks it is best crumbled over risotto or scrambled eggs and eaten with a glass of champagne. It costs Pounds 16.60 per lb if you want real pieces of white truffle, or Pounds 14.60 for the cheese made with truffle-essence. Beaufort from Savoy (France). This two-year-old cheese is Patricia's pride and joy. The texture is already granular. This is a highly pungent cheese and requires a good glass of wine (Pounds 10.40). Bruzl from Belgium; a washed rind cheese of the Maroilles type. These cheeses are not for the fainthearted. A similar cheese from Lille goes by the name of 'Le Puant' (the stinker). Eat with real ale (Pounds 7.50). Wensleydale from England. This cheese is made from half ewes' and half cows' milk just outside the famous Dales region but using traditional techniques which made the Dales famous (Pounds 6.10 lb). Gabriel from Ireland. A cows' milk cheese made to a Swiss recipe. Very nutty with a long finish (Pounds 7.50 lb). Crottin de Chavignol from the Berry (France). Many Crottins are rather hard by the time they get here, but this is young and fresh with a lemony acidity. She has older cheeses if you prefer. Pounds 2.50 each. La Fromagerie, 1A, Highbury Park, London (tel: 071-359-7440) is open weekdays from 10.30 until around 8pm, and on Sundays from 10am-2pm. It closes on Monday mornings.</p>

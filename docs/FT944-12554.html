			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / MPs call for stronger controls on out-of-town superstores Further construction of out-of-town shopping centres and superstores should be restricted to protect the environment, a report by an all-party Commons select committee is expected to recommend today. The findings by the House of Commons Environment Committee will mark another attack on large developments in the countryside, which encourage greater use of cars by locating shops far away from residential areas. Last week the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution proposed doubling petrol tax and halving spending on new roads in an effort to avoid unacceptable environmental damage in the early decades of the next century. The environment select committee's inquiry, Shopping Centres and their Future, began in the spring and will call for stronger curbs against out-of-town developments which take trade away from existing town centres. It recommends that planning guidance issued by the government be amended 'to include a presumption that superstores are best located in or on the edge of town centres unless there are very strong indications to the contrary'. This proposal would go further than a guidance note issued to local planning authorities last July by the Environment Department, stressing the importance of stemming the decline of town centres by encouraging high street development. This said that out-of-town developments should not be refused, 'unless there is clear evidence to suggest that the result would be to undermine the vitality and viability of that (town) centre'. If adopted, the select committee's proposals would add to the pressure on large retailers, which have been finding it increasingly difficult to receive planning permission for out-of-town sites since the guidance note was issued. Tesco, the UK's second-largest supermarket group, says that while it used to win about 60 per cent of planning cases that went to appeal, the percentage has dropped to 10 or 15 since last year's guidance note. The UK's three largest food retailers, J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Argyll, owner of Safeway, have recently cut back out-of-town expansion in favour of town centre developments. Mr David Sainsbury, chairman of the grocery chain, said recently: 'We are now taking a different view about the closure of town centre stores, believing that by remodelling and refurbishing these stores, we can give them a new lease of life. We also believe that as an industry we should seek to locate more of our stores near high streets while making certain that they have good car parking.' The select committee's recommendations are likely to be welcomed by environmental groups such as the Council for the Protection of Rural England, which has lobbied for stricter controls on out-of-town development.</p>

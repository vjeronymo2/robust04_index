Eastern Germany Secures  Russian Gas Supplies Till the Year 2014"]    [Text] The question of implementing the so-called Orenburg  Agreement under which Russia is supposed to deliver annually 2.8  billion cubic meters of gas to eastern Germany seems to have  been finally settled.    In the wake of the reunification of the eastern and western  parts of the FRG, gas deliveries within the framework of the  Orenburg Agreement remained a subject of fierce argument about  terms of its fulfillment, which as a result took the form of the  most serious conflict when on 15 January 1994 the sides failed  to agree on the price of Russian gas.    On 20 January the conflict was squelched by raising prices,  and the reconciliation process was continued by the signing in  Leipzig on 31 January of a long-term contract between the  eastern Germany company V NG and the trading house VIEKh [both  firms as transliterated] (a joint enterprise of the Russian  Gazprom and the German Wintershall).    The contract that entered into force on 1 February 1994 will  run for 20 years. In accordance with the document, between 1994  and 1998 V NG will be getting 3.5 billion cubic meters of  Russian gas (at a cost of nearly 1.25 billion Deutsche marks  [DM] to the end consumer) annually, inclusive of the delivery of  2.8 billion cubic meters under the Orenburg Agreement.  Beginning in 1999, the amount of deliveries under the VIEKh-V  NG contract will be around 7 billion cubic meters a year (DM2.5  billion).    In addition to what it gets under the new contract, V NG  will  get from Russia every year 3.5 billion cubic meters directly  from Gazprom.    The long-term treaty is supposed to rule out the repetition  of conflict situations like the one that took place in  mid-January. The contract designates V NG as the buyer of  Russian gas, and a revision of prices is possible once the  situation on the fuel market changes. The document is also  supposed to put an end to uncertainties in eastern Germany's  fuel market and better ensure the provision of energy supplies  to that part of the FRG.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Ranger Oil profits fall Ranger Oil, the Calgary-based oil and gas developer and producer with interests in Western Canada, the US, North Sea and South West Africa, reported net profit of USDollars 20.2m, or 21 cents a share, for 1993, down from Dollars 23.5m, or 24 cents in 1992. The decline was due to lower tax recoveries stemming from reduced North Sea exploration, partly offset by lower expenses. Daily oil output was little changed at 13,800 barrels, but gas output rose to 113m cu ft daily from 94.1m, due to the start-up of the Markham gasfield in the southern North Sea and new finds in North America. Net capital spending was Dollars 111m in 1993, down from Dollars 61m in 1992, including an acquisition. Ranger has just announced results from a successful well 115 miles east of Aberdeen. Another well is planned late this year directly to the north. Homestake Mining of the US is to develop the Eskay Creek gold-silver mine in northern British Columbia for about CDollars 75m (USDollars 55m). Start-up is planned for next January.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] San Pedro Sual TIEMPO in Spanish on 4  March on page 3 reported that the Board of Directors of the  Central Bank of Honduras, BCH, decided yesterday to reduce  purchases of foreign currency within the financial system and at  exchange offices from 30 to 20 percent in an attempt to  stabilize the price of the dollar. BCH President Hugo Noe Pino  said the state had been buying 30 percent of the approximately  $20 million entering the banking system each week but decided to  reduce such purchases to 20 percent to leave more dollars at the  disposal of banks and exchange offices to sell to the general  public and to ensure a more stable exchange rate; this is a  temporary measure, he added.</p>

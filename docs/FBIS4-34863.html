			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Nestor Nunez from the "First Thing" program] </F>   [Text] The phenomenon of the dollarization of the Cuban  economy is leaving its mark at home, and I believe no one with  any brains will disagree. I believe this is a necessary side  effect. Yet, this does not mean we ought to let it be so, nor  lie to ourselves and see the world through rose colored glasses  when the street reality is not so.    The truth is that the possession of dollars in the midst of  a  widespread shortage crisis, such as the current one, opens the  door to consumption options, that until now have been rare for  the common citizen. And on occasion, this blinds the senses to  the point that people put aside important values in order to  attain hard currency.    It is a reality, at least that is my opinion. I based this  on, among other things, the noticeable increase in prostitution  and the transfer of qualified labor force to sectors where  attaining hard currency is easier. It does not matter if it  means going from being a professional to being a gardener or a  chauffeur. Some of these people have told me that the bottom  line is that right now a college degree does not get them what  four or five dollars -- attained in a job with a much lower  level of qualification -- do.    In diverse ways, this phenomenon continues to spread and  corrupt. We must not forget, even for a moment, that there are  people who assume certain attitudes forced by the need to, for  example, buy a bar of soap or some milk to solve domestic needs.  That the person who regularly sells export rum, such as the one  that shocked me at the entrance of a shopping store, dressed in  the latest fashion, is not the same as the housewife who,  nearby, was selling a bottle of a lower quality liquor in order  to buy -- she told me -- some cooking oil. Although their  motives are different, both converge on efforts to attain hard  currency which as the people say: Opens the door and eases  today's difficult conditions.    I believe that this is a necessary side effect. Yet, I  believe it is important that this phenomenon be seen in social  terms and we should work as fast as possible to find  alternatives more closely attuned to our goals to allow people  to make a living according to their efforts and contributions,  and not on the basis of other harmful criteria.    I believe we are going through a difficult and risky period.  Undoubtedly, overcoming today's slump will leave negative scars  on many people as a result, precisely, of the unavoidable steps  we have had to take. Among these, the dollarization is one of  the most worrisome. Once this bitter economic gulp is over, we  will have to charge against the harmful habits and attitudes  which this hour is spreading and which has resulted in certain  people rendering ludicrous worship to fetishes and mechanisms  incompatible with our overall goals.</p>

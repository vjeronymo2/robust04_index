			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MIDEAST CONTESTANTS RACE TO BUILD MISSILE ARSENALS  </P> <P> The Middle East, where tanks and air power ruled the battlefields in hostile  decades past, has entered an unsettling era of mushrooming missile arsenals.  </P> <P> Over the last weeks and months, regional military machines have been flexing  their missile strength at an accelerating pace. The contestants give identical  rationales for the buildup: to match strides with their rivals.  </P> <P> Both Israel and Iraq have test-fired powerful new rockets. Egypt is working on  an intermediate-range missile, and Saudi Arabia has placed in desert silos a  long-range, nuclear-capable heavyweight bought from China.  </P> <P> Other Middle East nations have stocked a range of battlefield rockets over the  years. Even Lebanon's beleaguered Christian forces, once armed mainly with  artillery and hand-carried grenade launchers, are reported to possess a handful  of Soviet-made short-range missiles, supplied by Iraq.  </P> <P> "We have a missile race," affirmed Heino Kopietz, a Middle East specialist at  London's International Institute of Strategic Studies, in an interview Dec.15.  "Everybody is on their toes now."  </P> <P> Mordechai Gur, a former Israeli army chief of staff, added: "We have to deter  the use of missiles, full stop."  </P> <P> Technology is bought, adapted or home-developed, and increasingly beyond the  capability of the United States, the Soviet Union and other major powers  uncomfortable with the Middle East arms race to restrain. The reduction of  big-power tensions in Europe has yet to spill over to the region, and Third  World producers are helping fill the demand for new weapons.  </P> <P> U.S. Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams, commenting on this month's  Iraqi test, warned that the burgeoning arsenals are "a serious and growing  worldwide concern." In the taut relations of the Middle East, he said, missile  proliferation "undermines regional security and peace."  </P> <P> Officials in the Soviet Union, whose southern territories are within range of  Middle East missiles, have expressed similar alarm.  </P> <P> According to military analysts, only Israel among Middle East powers is capable  of arming missiles with nuclear warheads. But Iraq, Iran and Libya are  reportedly seeking nuclear technology, and they and several other countries in  the region are believed to have the potential to develop chemical warheads,  dubbed by analysts as "the poor man's atomic bomb."  </P> <P> Strategically, the development of missile forces by Iran and the Arab countries  threatens to upset the regional military balance characterized by superior  Israeli air power. To keep its foes at bay, Israel had long relied on its  ability to strike at installations deep in enemy territory without fear of  immediate retaliation. Its 1981 bombing of an Iraqi nuclear reactor outside  Baghdad was a celebrated example.  </P> <P> Now an Israeli preemptive air strike can be countered with the push of a  button, although Israel's nuclear capability still poses a telling deterrent.  </P> <P> Hedging their bets for a non-nuclear confrontation, the Israelis have embarked  on a U.S.-supported program to develop an anti-missile missile system called  Arrow, another notch on the gear of escalation.  </P> <P> Outside the Arab-Israeli tensions lies the threat that missile proliferation  poses to the Arab States and Iran themselves. While battlefield missiles were  first used in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, long-range missile warfare was  introduced to the region during the nine-year conflict between Iraq and Iran  which ended in a fragile truce in the summer of 1988.  </P> <P> Each side threw every available type of missile, from every possible source, at  the other. Soviet-made Scud B rockets, adapted for greater range by reducing  the weight of the warhead, fell on both Baghdad and Tehran. The Iran-Iraq war  also reintroduced another ominous weapon, poison gas, which had not been used  so extensively since World War I in Europe.  </P> <P> "The use of missiles was legitimized during the Iran-Iraq war," said Shai  Feldman, a researcher at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv.  </P> <P> French-supplied Iraqi fighters pounded Iranian shipping in the Persian Gulf  with French-made Exocet missiles (and accidentally hit the U.S. frigate Stark  in 1987, with the loss of 37 American lives). The Iranians countered by  deploying Chinese-made Silkworm anti-ship missiles along the gulf's strategic  Strait of Hormuz.  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia, alarmed by the buildup, went on the market and bought the  ponderous Chinese CSS-2 East Wind missiles, which have an range of up to 1,800  miles, depending on the warhead. The East Wind can carry nuclear warheads to  the maximum range, but the Saudis insist they have no intention of becoming a  nuclear power. Independent observers say the missiles are being retrofitted  with conventional warheads, which would limit the range to 1,000 miles, still  sufficient to hit targets in Iran, Israel or elsewhere in the Middle East,  though without pinpoint accuracy.  </P> <P> Few Restraints  </P> <P> Kopietz, the London analyst, labeled the Saudi weapons a "psychological  cosmetic," but added that that is what spurs proliferation.  </P> <P> "The Saudis are telling Iran, 'We can buy these and we can use them,' " he  explained. "The Iraqis are building their own because neither the Soviet Union  nor the United States will sell them a missile."  </P> <P> In the race to match missile for missile, there have been few restraints except  price and availability. And even those restraints are being evaded by the  ambitious development and adaptation programs in Iraq, Iran and Egypt, which  reportedly is receiving technical help from Argentina.  </P> <P> In 1987, seven Western industrial nations, including the United States,  Britain, Japan, France and West Germany, formed the Missile Technology Control  Regime, with the aim of curbing the spread of missiles with a range of 180  miles or more. The signatories are committed to block the sale of missile parts  and related equipment to Third World countries. But the commitments have proven  less than airtight.  </P> <P> According to the chief prosecutor in Munich, a West German company has sold  components for a rocket valve to Libya. An official with the French firm  Aerospatiale told a reporter at this year's Baghdad air show that his company  was prepared to "respond to any need of the Iraqi defense production." The  official was quoted as saying that negotiations for the transfer of missile  technology were under way.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, according to press reports, Libya's Moammar Kadafi is shopping in  the missile market, reportedly for the Brazilian-made Oteiba, which has a  375-mile range.  </P> <P> Iraqi Strides  </P> <P> Iraq's claim on Dec. 7 that it had launched a 48-ton rocket into Earth orbit  and developed two models of 1,200-mile-range military missiles surprised even  analysts who had closely followed its wartime and postwar efforts.  </P> <P> "We achieved a complicated scientific leap," Military Industries Minister  Hussein Kamel, brother-in-law of President Saddam Hussein, told Baghdad Radio.  " . . . We successfully tested the launching of the a three-stage rocket to  outer space."  </P> <P> Not until 48 hours later did U.S. officials authenticate the claim.  </P> <P> "I can confirm that the Iraqis have launched a rocket powerful enough to put a  small payload into space," said a Pentagon spokesman. Another Defense  Department official said the North American Aerospace Defense Command had  tracked an object "for four or five revolutions" of Earth, although it was not  clear whether it was the final rocket stage or a payload.  </P> <P> Kamel said the test was the first phase of a space program, presumably aimed at  putting a spy satellite into orbit over the Middle East.  </P> <P> The 1,200-mile-range missiles that Iraq claims to have developed would have  direct military application.  </P> <P> At United Nations headquarters in New York Dec.14 Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq  Aziz said of the intermediate-range rocket: "We have to take into  consideration, for defense purposes, that our country is still being threatened  by Iran. We are in a position of no war and no peace."  </P> <P> Threat to Israel  </P> <P> The same weapon could reach Jerusalem, as can the Scud B rockets fired at  Tehran during the war. They have a range of about 570 miles, boosted by more  than 150 miles through alterations reportedly designed with the help of West  German engineers. Syria, Egypt and the Saudis also own missiles capable of  hitting Israeli targets, and the Soviet-supplied Syrian SS-21 Scarab missiles  have a high degree of accuracy.  </P> <P> There has been no Iraqi claim that their new intermediate-range missiles have  been tested. Intelligence reports on Iraq have focused instead on development  of an advanced version of the Argentine Condor rocket, reportedly in  collaboration with the Egyptians and the Argentines. In the Middle East, the  rocket has been dubbed Badr 2000, and has a projected range of about 600 miles.  </P> <P> More alarming than Iraqi success with a mid-range rocket would be the potential  of the tested space booster, which could put Iraq in a satellite-launching club  with Israel and developing countries such as India and China. Theoretically,  the booster could be adapted for use as an intercontinental ballistic missile,  some Western experts noted.  </P> <P> The U.S. Senate is considering further legislation to combat the spread of  ballistic missiles, although the effort seems to be aimed primarily at Syria  and Libya rather than Israel, an ally of the United States.  </P> <P> "I don't believe that the likelihood of Great Britain, France or Israel  engaging in atomic/biological/chemical weapons is anything but remote," said  Arizona Sen. John McCain, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee,  speaking on a television hook-up to a recent conference in Tel Aviv. "I don't  have confidence" about Hafez Assad, the Syrian president, or Kadafi. "So the  legislation and the effort I have been engaged in have clearly tried to  differentiate those countries I have mentioned and those which are less stable  and are in fact more aggressive."  </P> <P> However, Kopietz, the International Institute of Strategic Studies analyst,  argued that Israeli power is the problem.  </P> <P> "To end this race," he said, "America will have to get Israel to step down  first" in any disarmament program.  </P> <P> "For the time being, these weapons are being sought by people for essentially  defensive purposes," Don Kerr, another IISS analyst in London, declared before  the Iraqi test. "These states want to be listened to."  </P> <P> Israel, meanwhile, has moved ahead with its own rocket program. In September,  in a report that Israeli officials refused to confirm or deny, the Soviet news  agency Tass said Israel had test-fired a surface-to-surface missile from an  area near Jerusalem 900 miles west into the Mediterranean.  </P> <P> Other reports identified the missile by the code name Jericho 2, the same  rocket that put a satellite into orbit in September, 1988. The Israeli Jericho  1, current kingpin of their missile force, has a range of 375 miles and can be  fitted with chemical, conventional or nuclear warheads.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, nuclear technology is also being sewn throughout the region. A West  German company and China are said to have provided Iraq with technology to  produce enriched uranium, the key ingredient for building nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> Israel has reportedly helped South Africa build a long-range missile in return  for guaranteed supplies of enriched uranium and facilities to test booster  rockets in South Africa.  </P> <P> The State Department, in response to reports of Israeli-South African missile  and nuclear cooperation, pressed Israel to sign the international Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty, but Israel has refused. The Israeli government does  not confirm that it has nuclear weapons, and compliance with the treaty would  open its nuclear facilities to international inspection.  </P> <P> At the U.S.-sponsored conference on arms control two weeks ago in Tel Aviv, Jed  Snyder, a Pentagon consultant, said that Israel should drop its non-nuclear  pose to make its nuclear threat "credible."  </P> <P> Nick Williams reported from Nicosia and Daniel Williams from Jerusalem.  </P></p>

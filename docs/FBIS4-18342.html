			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Harald Stanghelle] </F>   [Text] The voters are stable: Several weeks of intense  attention to the EU [European Union] talks have not affected  Opinion's party preference poll for March.    The poll was conducted by telephone with 1,002 persons from  Monday [21 March] to Wednesday, that is, in the middle of the  hectic final talks in Brussels. To the question of which party  they would vote for if the Storting election were now, 72.7  percent of the interviewed gave a reply.    For the first time in a very long time there are no  fluctuations beyond what the normal margin of error would allow  for.    The Center Party advances by 0.9 percent, but in February  suffered a considerable decline, so that the March progress may  signify an adjustment upward to what the party's real level is.    Another thing to note is that the number of undecideds is  increasing. The background data indicate that this is true for  voters from all parties. The Labor Party, in spite of a decline  of 0.8 percent, is stable at a very high level; it is clear that  they benefit from a very high mobilization of their voters.    The Conservative Party's decline has stopped. The party has  stabilized at a level very close to the election outcome of last  September. All the attention the media has given to the  Conservatives' search for a leader does not appear to have  caused the party's faithful to waver. This will be a good  foundation for the party's new leadership to build on.    There are two other parties it will be exciting to follow in  the coming months: the Christian People's Party and the  Socialist Left. The former is struggling at an alarmingly low  level and is having problems holding on to its voters. With  regard to the Socialist Left, we can see from the background  data that there are clear warning signals for this party also.  Loyalty has dropped by 20 percent, and even though the March  poll figures are almost identical to the election results last  September, there are indications that the Socialist Left voters  have become less stable.    Time will tell whether the Socialist Left and the Christian  People's Party will be able to do anything about their problems  with the voters. Today's poll prompts these questions, but we  cannot draw any firm conclusions.     -  Poll results 16 March: Labor 39.3, Conservatives 17.4,  Center Party 16.8, Socialist Left 8.0, Christian People's 6.1,  Progress 5.6, Liberals 3.1, Red Electoral 1.0, Others 2.7.    -  Poll  results 9 February: Labor 40.1, Conservatives 17.0, Center Party  15.9, Socialist Left 9.1, Christian People's 6.2, Progress 5.3,  Liberals 3.5, Red Electoral 1.4, Others 1.5.    -  Poll results 12  January: Labor 41.6, Conservatives 16.0, Center Party 18.1,  Socialist Left 7.4, Christian People's 6.6, Progress 5.7,  Liberals 2.9, Red Electoral 0.6, Others 1.2.</p>

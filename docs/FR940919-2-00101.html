			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Claimants will be able to fully participate in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative appeals process with or without a representative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SSA will ensure that claimants are fully advised of their right  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to representation and SSA will routinely provide the appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referral sources for representation. SSA will also encourage the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> early participation of a representative when the claimant has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appointed one and will give the representative responsibility for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developing evidence necessary to decide a claim. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision whether to appoint a representative must remain with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimant and SSA will neither encourage nor discourage claimants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in seeking representation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative appeals process will instill public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confidence in the integrity of the system. To instill such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confidence, SSA will provide an initial decisionmaking process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is thorough and results in fully developed records with fair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and accurate decisions. Additionally, the claimant will be given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the basis of a decision in clear and understandable language.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, SSA will ensure that its policies have been consistently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied at all levels of administrative review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted previously, the initial disability determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will use a ``statement of the claim'' approach which will set forth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the issues in the claim, the relevant facts, the evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered, including any evidence or information obtained as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of the predecision notice, and the rationale in support of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the determination. The statement of the claim will be part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on-line claim record and will stand as the basis and rationale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the Agency's action, if the claimant seeks further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative review. SSA will standardize claim file  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation and assembly, including the use of appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronic records, at all levels of administrative process until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such time as the claims record is fully electronic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> First Appeal Level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Because the initial determination will be the result of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process that ensures fully developed evidentiary records and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ample opportunity for the claimant to personally present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional evidence prior to an adverse determination, there will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be no need for any intermediate appeal (e.g., reconsideration)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to the ALJ hearing. If the claimant disagrees with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial determination, the claimant may, within 60 days of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receiving notice, request an ALJ hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Adjudication Officer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> When a claimant requests an ALJ hearing, an adjudication  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officer will conduct an interview in person, by telephone, or by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> videoconference, and become the primary point of contact for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimant. The adjudication officer will have the same knowledge,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skills and abilities as the adjudicators who decide claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initially. The adjudication officer will also have specialized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> knowledge regarding hearings procedures. The adjudication officer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be the focal point for all prehearing activities but will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work closely with the ALJ, medical consultants and the disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim manager, when appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The adjudication officer will provide the claimant an in-depth understanding of the hearing process, with particular focus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the right to representation. To prevent delays caused by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lack of understanding of this right, the adjudication officer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will again provide the appropriate referral sources for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representation; give the claimant, where appropriate, copies of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary claim file documents to facilitate the appointment of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative; and encourage the claimant to decide about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need for and choice of a representative as soon as is practical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The adjudication officer will be available to answer the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimant's questions and concerns regarding the hearing process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The adjudication officer will also identify the issues in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dispute and whether there is a need for additional evidence. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the claimant has a representative, the representative will have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the responsibility to develop evidence. If the claimant has a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative, the adjudication officer will also conduct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informal conferences with the representative, in person or by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> telephone, to identify the issues in dispute and prepare written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stipulations as to those issues not in dispute. If the claimant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submits additional evidence, the adjudication officer may refer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the claim for further medical consultation and opinion, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The adjudication officer will have full authority to issue a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised favorable decision if the evidence so warrants. This will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that allowance decisions are expedited and not delayed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until a formal hearing before an ALJ. If the adjudication officer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues a favorable decision, the adjudication officer will refer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the claim to a disability claim manager to effectuate payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The adjudication officer will consult with the ALJ during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the course of prehearing activities, as necessary and appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the circumstances in the claim. As a preliminary matter, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjudication officer will also routinely schedule a date for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing that is a standard number of days after the hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request. Standardizing the hearing date process will facilitate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimant understanding and reduce the possibility of non- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appearance at the hearing. It will also enable representatives to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan their schedules when taking on a case. The adjudication  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officer may exercise discretion in establishing an earlier or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> later hearing date depending on the individual circumstances and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ALJ's calendar. Electronic access to ALJs' calendars, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established by individual ALJs, will facilitate timely and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate scheduling of hearings. The adjudication officer will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refer the prepared record to an ALJ only after all evidentiary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development is complete and the claimant or a representative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agrees that the claim is ready to be heard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ALJ will retain the authority and ability to develop the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record. However, use of an adjudication officer realigns most, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not all, prehearing activities so that the burden of ensuring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their completion rests with other members of the adjudicative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> team. With completely developed claims before them, ALJs will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to concentrate their efforts on conducting more hearings and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rendering decisions faster.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Hearing Proceedings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The ALJ hearing will be a de novo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  proceeding in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ALJ considers and weighs the evidence and reaches a new decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de novo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  hearing is consistent with the role of an ALJ  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> envisioned under the Administrative Procedure Act. Under that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheme, the ALJ is an independent decisionmaker who must apply an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's governing statute, regulations and policies, but who is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not subject to advance direction and control by the agency with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to the decisional outcome in any individual claim. ALJs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are independent triers of fact who perform their evidentiary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factfinding function free from agency influence. At the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time, the Administrative Procedure Act ensures that an ALJ's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision is subject to later review by the agency, thus giving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agency full authority over policy. Policy responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remains exclusively with the agency while the public has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assurance that the facts are found by an official who is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to agency influence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A hearing before an ALJ will remain an informal adjudicatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceeding as it is under the current process. The claimant will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have the right to be represented by an attorney or a non-attorney  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the decision regarding representation made by the claimant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alone. An informal, nonadversarial proceeding is consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the public's strong preference for a simple, accessible hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process that permits, but does not require, a representative. An  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informal process facilitates the earlier and faster resolution of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the issues in dispute, thus promoting more timely decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

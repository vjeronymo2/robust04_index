			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'I KNEW I WAS ALIVE,' OFFICER TELLS OF BEING SHOT POINT-BLANK  </P> <P> On her off days, Ramona cowgirl Diane Hall prefers light pink denim, but at  work she wears a police officer's shield and a bulletproof vest.  </P> <P> On Sunday, that vest saved her life.  </P> <P> "I don't know how it stopped them," said Hall, referring to the vest that  stopped two 9-millimeter bullets fired at point-blank range.  </P> <P> "I just remember hearing pops," Hall said during a press conference Tuesday in  Ramona, an equestrian center in the background. "It was gunfire, but it wasn't  a real sound to me. Then I remember getting hit in the chest, like with a  baseball bat, but it didn't feel like getting shot.  </P> <P> "It's almost like it happened to another person, it's so blurry."  </P> <P> Hall and two other San Diego police officers responded to a burglary call at  8:54 p.m. Sunday night in the City Heights area. They spotted Jimmie Ray Reeves  Jr., 23, hiding in a cardboard box. When he tried to flee, a scuffle ensued.  </P> <P> Police said Reeves pulled a gun from one of the officers' holsters and began  firing wildly, striking Hall in the stomach and right collarbone, and hitting  her gun.  </P> <P> Officers wrestled the gun from Reeves and, when he ran, all three officers  fired their weapons, killing him.  </P> <P> Reeves didn't say anything to the officers during the fracas, he was just  "grunting and groaning," Hall said.  </P> <P> "I didn't even know he had a gun at the time, I just knew he was acting awful  wild," Hall said. "I was grabbing his arm, and that's the one he shot me with."  </P> <P> The incident took less than a minute.  </P> <P> "I'm still remembering things. I remember rolling away and screaming for help,"  Hall said. "I understand I emptied my gun, but I don't know how many times I  hit the suspect."  </P> <P> After it was clear the danger had passed, Hall slumped against a wall to take  stock of the situation.  </P> <P> "I knew I was alive, but I didn't know how bad I was hurt. I really didn't know  what my injuries were," said Hall, 40, who has been with the force for five  years.  </P> <P> Hall called to her partner, officer Cheryl Dean, to help out.  </P> <P> "I wanted her to see what my wounds were, because I didn't want to check  myself," said Hall, who suffered bruises, abrasions and powder burns.  </P> <P> Hall and her husband, Ron, who is also a San Diego police officer, haven't had  time to reflect on her brush with death, and instead have been answering phone  calls from well-wishers.  </P> <P> "We've been so busy answering the phone, I haven't had a chance to stop the  wheels and think about it," said Hall, who won't be going back to work "until I  feel like going back."  </P> <P> Ron Hall was patrolling in Kearny Mesa when he heard the radio call that his  wife had been shot.  </P> <P> "I went out there at about Mach 3," said Ron Hall, 40. "I knew she was injured,  but I could tell by her voice that she wasn't hurt too bad."  </P> <P> Now, Diane Hall's stomach muscles are sore, and she can't sit up without help,  but she misses her horses most.  </P> <P> "I can't wait to get back to riding," said Hall, who keeps three horses in the  back yard of her Ramona home.  </P></p>

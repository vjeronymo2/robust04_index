			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / New Supreme Court faces watershed cases The second youngest US Supreme Court this century opened its autumn term yesterday with a case load light even by recent standards, but including some important political, social and business-related judgments. Probably the most widely watched ruling will centre on the constitutionality of imposing term limits on members of Congress. At issue is the opinion of the Arkansas Supreme Court which invalidated a 1992 state referendum imposing limits on congressional representatives while upholding them for elected state officials. Article one of the US constitution stipulates age, citizenship and residency requirements for members of congress. The Supreme Court must decide whether additional requirements may be added, such as ceilings on the number of years that may be served, with little legal precedent as a guide. Term limits are a populist cause and 15 states have adopted variations on them since 1990 for local officials. Were the Supreme Court to find them unconstitutional at the congressional level, the Republican party is likely to press even harder for a constitutional amendment making them mandatory. The Court will also hear arguments on a number of desegregation, discrimination and congressional redistricting cases. But the most politically controversial ruling, already exciting the gun lobby and its opponents, stems from a clause in the 1990 Crime Control Act prohibiting the knowing possession of a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school. A federal appeals court ruled that this provision interfered with commerce and should, in any case, be a matter of local not federal jurisdiction. No far-reaching business cases appear on the Court docket, with the possible exception of Bentsen vs Coors Brewing, which involves commercial free speech. The government is seeking to uphold a 1935 Prohibition-era ban on brewers advertising the strength of their product, unless state law requires the information be placed on bottles and cans. The Court will also determine a longstanding dispute between the banking and insurance industries rule over whether banks may act as agents or brokers in selling annuities to their customers. At issue is whether annuity contracts constitute 'insurance' under the terms of the National Banking Act. Among judgments held over from the summer but announced yesterday, the bench refused to overrule a lower court ruling setting aside civil racketeering charges against Mr Michael Milken, the convicted financier. The policies of the new court are not easy to discern in advance beyond the presumption that its consensus-seeking centre has been strengthened by the arrival of Justice Stephen Breyer. The retirement of Justice Harry Blackmun leaves only Justice John Paul Stevens as a classic liberal, but the conservative flank also appears more marginalised, with only Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas consistently in the right-wing corner. The arrival of Justice Breyer, 56, brings the average age of the nine member bench down to 60, the youngest in over 50 years. The Chief Justice, who was 70 last Saturday, is the longest serving member.</p>

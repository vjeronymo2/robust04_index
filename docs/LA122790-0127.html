			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NOISE, TRAFFIC EXPECTED FROM SEWER PROJECT  </P> <P> A proposed $9.2-million sewer expansion project in North Hollywood will  generate noise and traffic congestion during the nine months of its  construction, an environmental study has concluded.  </P> <P> "Construction noise would reach significant levels at points along the proposed  project alignment and could disturb small mammals and birds," the city report  said. But the report said any disruption caused by the project, which is now  scheduled to begin in 1991, will only be temporary and will end when the  project is finished nine months later.  </P> <P> The environmental report covering the North Hollywood Interceptor Sewer project  has been sent to the City Council, which has not yet scheduled a debate on  whether to authorize construction.  </P> <P> City public works officials, who proposed the project last year, said the new  sewers are needed to alleviate strain that has been placed on the sewer system  by population growth in the area. North Hollywood is now served by sewers  constructed in the late 1920s and early 193Os, when the population was far less  than what it is now.  </P> <P> "Sewers are flowing above their designed capacity. There's more people living  in the area and contributing to those sewers," said Bill Briggs, a city  engineering designer.  </P> <P> Plans call for construction of 3.8 miles of new sewer lines, primarily along  Cahuenga Boulevard between Burbank Boulevard and Valley Spring Lane, and along  Burbank Boulevard between Tujunga Avenue and Cahuenga Boulevard.  </P> <P> The expanded lines, which will be made of reinforced concrete and hardened clay  piping, will be installed in cavities now used by existing sewer lines and  other underground utilities, Briggs said.  </P> <P> An environmental impact report now circulating has concluded that the project  will not cause any significant permanent environmental damage. But the report  said construction will cause tremendous traffic congestion in the area,  particularly along Burbank Boulevard.  </P> <P> In addition, the report said the construction work will generate noise, which  will disturb classes at Toluca Lake Elementary School, Crossroads preschool and  Cahuenga Nursery School.  </P> <P> Adult classes and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings that take place at Toluca Lake  United Methodist Church and services at a Jehovah's Witnesses meeting hall will  probably be disturbed by noise, the report said.  </P> <P> Some Sunland and Tujunga residents have expressed concerns that the sewer  system expansion will facilitate further growth in the area, allowing the  present population of 50,000 to double.  </P> <P> But Wallace Stokes, the city's environmental coordinator for the project, said  the community has already been zoned for a lot of growth, which will occur  regardless of whether the sewers have been improved or not.  </P> <P> The new sewer is expected to serve the area for about 100 years, Stokes said.  </P> <P> City residents have until Jan. 18 to submit comments on the environmental  impact report to the city Department of Public Works.  </P></p>

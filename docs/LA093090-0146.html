			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PIRATES WIN, CLINCH AT LEAST A TIE FOR TITLE  </P> <P> Ten days ago the Pittsburgh Pirates set a goal: clinch the National League East  championship before the final three-game series against the New York Mets.  </P> <P> That goal is definitely in sight.  </P> <P> Bob Walk (7-5) pitched a four-hitter and doubled in a run Saturday at St. Louis  to lead the Pirates to an 8-0 victory over the Cardinals and clinch a tie for  their first division title since 1979.  </P> <P> Today the Pirates, needing one more victory or a Met defeat, will send the  winningest pitcher in the league, Doug Drabek (21-6), against the last-place  Cardinals.  </P> <P> It was the sixth victory in a row for the Pirates, who appear to be reaching a  peak for the playoffs.  </P> <P> "We're excited about where we are," said Jay Bell, whose three-run homer was a  key Friday night, "but at the same time we know what we have to do. We want to  clinch it before we jump for joy."  </P> <P> In most of the Pirates' 93 victories, one or more of the trio of Andy Van  Slyke, Bobby Bonilla and Barry Bonds has led the attack. In this one, they were  a combined one for 15.  </P> <P> But Sid Bream hit his 14th home run, Bell, Mike LaValliere and Jose Lind each  had two hits and Walk came through with a key sacrifice besides his double.  </P> <P> Since Sept. 20, when Montreal swept a doubleheader against the Mets to give the  Pirates a 2 1/2-game lead, the Pirates have lost once. They lead by four with  four to play.  </P> <P> In two previous starts against the Cardinals, Walk was 0-2 with an earned-run  average of 5.17.  </P> <P> But working on eight days of rest, Walk -- bothered by a back problem much of  the season -- needed only 103 pitches. He was never in serious trouble.  </P> <P> "After today, I'll be able to go into wintertime with a little bit better  thoughts when I'm sitting around the fireplace," Walk said. "It's my best  outing in two years."  </P> <P> The Cardinals will finish last for the first time since 1918.  </P> <P> Chicago 3, New York 2 -- Once again playing without injured sluggers Darryl  Strawberry and Kevin McReynolds, the Mets reached the edge of elimination at  New York.  </P> <P> Although they had Frank Viola going for his 20th victory, the Mets couldn't  handle Cub pitchers Les Lancaster (9-5) and Paul Assenmacher. Lancaster held  the Mets hitless until Dave Magadan homered with one out in the fourth. The  Mets had only six other hits, with the left-handed Assenmacher working four  shutout innings for his ninth save.  </P> <P> Doug Dascenzo's two-out, two-run single capped the three-run second inning that  beat Viola (19-12).  </P> <P> "It's not the way we wanted to play these games," Met Manager Bud Harrelson  said. "We need Darryl and Kevin. There's not a whole lot to say. It's an  emotional letdown."  </P> <P> Strawberry has a sore back and McReynolds has an infected toe. Between them  they have 61 home runs and 190 runs batted in.  </P> <P> Apparently, about all that's left for the Mets is Magadan's drive for the  batting title. His sixth home run was his only hit in three at-bats. Magadan is  at .330, while Willie McGee -- now with the Oakland Athletics -- is at .335.  </P> <P> With four games left, Magadan, by going eight for 16, could win the title.  </P> <P> Houston 9, Atlanta 0 -- Glenn Davis doubled twice, drove in three runs, scored  three and was involved in a bench-clearing incident at Atlanta.  </P> <P> Davis, hit by a pitch in the fifth, was almost hit in the sixth by Dwayne  Henry. Davis argued with catcher Kelly Mann and both dugouts emptied.  </P> <P> Montreal 5, Philadelphia 1 -- Brian Barnes pitched a three-hitter for his first  major league victory and the Expos ended their eight-game losing streak by  defeating the Phillies at Montreal.

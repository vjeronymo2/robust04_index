He subjected his rivals to harsh criticism, in particular  Mykola Bahrov, speaker of the Crimean parliament, and also all  former communists from the present power apparatus -- Leonid  Kravchuk and Boris Yeltsin. In the opinion of Leonid Hrach,  they should be tried in accordance with Soviet laws for the  collapse of the USSR. The leader of the Communist Party of the  Crimea warned those present of the threat from Muslim countries,  especially Turkey. "The aim of my policies, he noted, is to  restore the USSR. For this the Crimea should enter the CIS  independently -- this is the path of salvation for the  peninsula. Its economic problems can only be resolved by  getting large credits from Russia."    Leonid Hrach called on Communists to be vigilant as, in his  opinion, the manipulation of votes is possible at the elections.  Replying to questions from the hall, he was not able to explain  what he had been engaged in during the last two years and why  the Communist Party had lost prestige. Observers formed the  opinion that in the event of the victory of Leonid Hrach at the  elections, then a dictatorship of the proletariat may possibly  not come, but a dictatorship of the Communist Party will be  guaranteed.</p>

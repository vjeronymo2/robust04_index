			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Financial Futures and Options (7): Talent capsized by money wave - US managed funds MANAGED FUTURES funds used to be seen as exotic, high-risk ventures, for either the brave or the foolish. But the amount of money flowing into managed futures - into public funds, private pools or individual accounts - has mushroomed in the past few years. Even pension funds, the most cautious and finicky of investors, are now putting money into them. Morton Baratz, editor of Managed Accounts Reports, a newsletter that tracks the managed funds industry, estimates that assets in managed futures worldwide have shot up from just Dollars 4bn in 1986 to Dollars 21bn today. From 1980 through 1990, the average annual compounded growth rate was about 35 per cent for managed futures. And despite considerably slower growth last year, a poor year for many markets, many in the futures industry expect that managed futures will eventually be to commodities what mutual funds are to equities - a vast, deep ocean of money. The most explosive growth in managed funds occurred after the 1987 crash, as investors became wary about equities. Also, in the last 18 months, the decline in US interest rates has spurred many to consider managed futures who would never have looked at them before. American pension funds, for example, which must contend with strict regulations as to how they invest, have begun to dabble in managed futures. While the names and amounts of most of these investments are not known publicly, industry experts guess that between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 1.5bn of pension-fund money is in managed futures. Mr Baratz estimates that a third of the Dollars 21bn now in managed futures is from foreign sources, though he says precise numbers are difficult to establish. Many foreign institutional investors, particularly from Japan, have placed money in the hands of American commodity-trading advisers (CTAs), the professional managers of commodity funds. According to Jane Martin, executive director of the Managed Futures Association, Japanese and European investors are likely to provide managed funds' next biggest burst of growth. Overall, investors appear to be changing their attitude towards managed futures. 'There are more institutions, both foreign and domestic, looking to add futures to their portfolios than I've ever seen before,' said Frank Pusateri, senior vice-president for investments at Prudential Bache in New York. The advent of guaranteed funds, in which capital is secure, has helped to overcome the old barrier of horror about commodities markets, notes Peter Matthews, chief portfolio strategist at Mint Investment Management, which has some Dollars 900m under management. CTAs have also emphasised to potential clients that they should take a long-term view rather than a get-rich-quick stance. Most institutions would be happy with returns of about 15 per cent a year. 'A 40 per cent to 50 per cent return would probably scare them off,' said Mr Pusateri. Like venture capital and international stocks, 'we are going through a period of acceptance,' observes Robert Easton, president of Commodities Corp, which has about Dollars 1bn under management. Yet the recent tide of money into managed futures funds is already presenting them with serious capacity problems. And this may slow down their growth. In the US, speculative position limits inhibit the ability of large traders in many markets, particularly in agriculture, where huge sums have been made in the past. Often, too, there is insufficient liquidity to absorb the large quantities that funds trade. The limits on American exchanges and the need for diversification have driven substantial amounts of managed-fund trading offshore. CTAs, including some of the largest, have estimated that between 20 per cent and 70 per cent of their trading is in non-US markets. One top CTA credits trading abroad for his superior returns, compared with those who trade mostly in the US. 'Our preference would be trading in the US, but we'll go where the liquidity is,' said Kenneth Tropin, president of JW Henry, which has about Dollars 750m under management, and chairman of the Managed Futures Association (MFA). There is also concern that the wave of money coming into managed futures is overwhelming the current pool of trading talent. There seems to be a limit to how much an individual can handle, and some CTAs have simply closed their doors to new clients or restricted how much more money they will accept. US futures exchanges are working with the MFA to win approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the industry regulator, to lift position limits and prohibitions on trading certain contracts. The exchanges are also seeking approval to change their rules, to favour large order executions and provide average prices for large orders. Such steps 'are helpful developments' says Mr Easton. Exchange officials and many CTAs in the US complain that the regulatory restrictions inhibit the growth of American markets, and place them on an uneven playing field with their foreign competitors. They are pressing for changes, without which the growth of managed futures is likely to be less stunning than predicted.</p>

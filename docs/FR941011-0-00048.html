			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this final rulemaking, EPA announces its approval of these revisions to the Colorado's long-term strategy of the Class I Visibility Protection SIP, including revisions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AQCC Regulation No. 3. See Clean Air Act section 110(k)(3). The revisions were made to address when subsequent long-term strategy review and revision report cycles would occur. The revision indicates that the long-term strategy report will be made available by September 1 at least every third year following the submittal of the previous report. With this final approval, the submittal of the next report by September 1, 1995 will be a federally-enforceable obligation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulation No. 3 was also revised to clarify a discrepancy with EPA requirements regarding the scope of review of the long-term strategy. The State revised the language to indicate that the long-term strategy must be reviewed, among other reasons, to determine ``[t]he need for BART to remedy existing impairment in an integral vista declared since plan approval.'' This change brings the State's program into conformance with EPA regulations. See 40 CFR 51.306(c)(7). Declaration of an integral vista allows for protection of visibility resources outside a mandatory Class I area affecting views from within the area. See 40 CFR 51.301(n). The State has not identified any integral vistas at this time, but may do so in the future at its discretion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, this SIP revision consists of replacing the original long-term strategy with the revised long-term strategy adopted by the State in August, 1992. The SIP revisions address when the long-term strategy review is to be completed, factors to be assessed in periodic long-term strategy reviews, and components of the long-term strategy plan ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , existing impairment, prevention of future impairment, smoke management practices, FLM consultation and communication, and annual visibility data reports).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Please see EPA's proposed rulemaking for further details on the above revisions (59 FR 25002&hyph;25004).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also correcting, under section 110(k)(6) of the Clean Air Act, the provision of 40 CFR 52.344(a) (``Visibility protection''). In a previous rulemaking action, EPA should have revised the provision to indicate that Colorado's visibility protection program was approved, except for visibility new source review (NSR) as it applied to certain industrial source categories. With this action, EPA corrects &sect;52.344(a) to reflect accurately the status of program approval in Colorado. (Please reference EPA's proposed rulemaking for further details on this correction (59 FR 25002&hyph;25004).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Final Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This document announces EPA's final rulemaking on the action proposed on May 13, 1994 (59 FR 25002). EPA is taking final action to approve the action it proposed. See Clean Air Act section 110(k)(3). This includes approving revisions to Colorado AQCC Regulation No. 3 to bring it into conformance with Federal requirements for the long-term strategy and to revise the reporting schedule. EPA has determined that these revisions are consistent with applicable Federal requirements for long-term strategy review under the Clean Air Act's visibility protection program for mandatory Class I Federal areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, EPA is correcting its error in failing to reflect accurately Colorado's Visibility SIP approval status in a previous action on the State's Visibility protection provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Approvals of SIP submittals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  U.S. E.P.A. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 12, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review must be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

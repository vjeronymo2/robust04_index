			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): BCI poised for new capital-raising issue - Other Companies Banca Commerciale Italiana, the Italian bank, plans on Thursday to launch its first capital-raising exercise since privatisation - an issue of shares and warrants which should raise L2,362bn (Dollars 1.51bn). In the last two months, two Italian banks - Cariplo and Mediobanca - have been forced to postpone share issues because of market turbulence. But the price of the BCI issue has been set at a discount - L3,000 a share against a market price of more than L4,400 - so should avoid the same fate, in spite of the turmoil in Italian equities last week. On the same day, shares in Telecom Italia, the new grouping of state-controlled telecommunications operators, will start trading. Telecom Italia was created in May from the fusion of five existing companies, including Sip, the domestic telecoms operator, and became the sixth largest telecoms group in the world. Following a complex share-swap, its shares will replace those of Sip on the market, while shares in Italcable will be delisted.</p>

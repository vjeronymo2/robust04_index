			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A last-minute escape from the sprouts - Giles MacDonogh is still hoping to make his escape from a traditional British yuletide There are just a few more hours to go and I still don't know where I shall spend Christmas. The important thing is to escape the traditional yuletide in Britain: arid turkey surrounded by little chipolatas and gassy Brussels sprouts; the dessicated ham; the oily smoked salmon; and that final explosive envoi in the form of a Christmas pudding licked by blue flames of brandy. I called a friend in Dublin. I had had this dream about spiced beef and Guinness. He was more than ready to help: 'Great] We'll go to somebody else's house and drink mulled wine and then back to the family for the first arguments. There'll be turkey and ham. I can't think for the life of me where you got this crazy English idea about spiced beef. Then we will have the most boring vegetables imaginable; they are as often thrown at people as eaten, but that doesn't matter because we'll all be hammered by lunch time. 'Not much gets eaten at all.' No. On second thoughts, Dublin sounds too much like home. There is always Paris, but apart from the reveillon there is little really Christmassy about December 25 in northern France. It seems to hinge more on the season than the day. I do remember with nostalgia, however, Decembers in the rue du Buci market in Paris: the profusion of furred and feathered game hanging from the butchers' awnings: pheasant, partridge and duck; and the great hairy haunches of venison and wild boar. Then round the corner in the rue Dauphine, the long queue outside Coesnon's tiny shop, waiting to buy foie gras terrines and little boudins blancs. Even in France the ugly bird has made progress; replete with chestnut stuffing it is beginning to displace the more traditional leg of lamb as the centrepiece at the Christmas lunch. One should have thought lamb a more pascal dish; when the meat is young and tender. What the French and Spanish eat at Christmas is hogget: half way to mutton. The chief advantage of the Latin Christmas, however, is that the shops stay open for the morning and there are even restaurants doing a brisk trade. In Paris, outside the main brasseries on the boulevards, the oystermen work overtime to prepare baskets full of bivalves for hors d'oeuvres. Neighbouring Belgium doesn't seem to be quite right either: a compromise between Teutonic goose-eating and the international turkey which has come in on the back of Nato and the EU. The meal is polished off with what a friend calls 'a revolting buche de Noel surmounted by a little, pink Jesus looking for all the world like the famous Manneken-Pis'] Spain is nothing special: 'We just eat a lot more of everything,' said a Spaniard. 'More lamb and more sea bass; and lots and lots of turron.' I felt a nasty jab in my stomach as I though of the indigestions borne of turron. Provence has more Christmas feel to it. Fish is favoured: grey mullet with olives, or salt cod and cauliflower; cardoons and the 13 Christmas desserts. These include nougat, quince paste (in those cases where the quince trees survived the 1956 frost), dried figs, dates and fougasse biscuits. The best of Latin Christmasses are to be found in Italy. In the north there are sweet things. Last year I received a pannetone from Gucci and was disappointed when I opened the packet not to find a pair of brogues. But pannetone can be a mite dry. Elsewhere, in Emilia Romagna, there is pane di Natale: a rather flatter version of the Milanese pannetone. The meaty side of the feast is not so special, although in Bologna they make big tortellini from different meats and at the new year, the cotechino sausage is served with lentils to represent the money that will come rolling in over the next 12 months. For an individual Christmas Rome would be a good bet. Here eels are eaten before you go on to gorge yourself on a capon. Capons cannot be produced in Britain where draconian legislation exists to protect the cock's prowess. In many ways this is a pity: a good capon knocks the feathers off a turkey and it is a more traditional Christmas bird. I once spent Christmas in Vienna. We had a huge lake trout instead of the muddy carp on Christmas Eve, served with a thick beurre blanc. The next day, after the Nelson Mass at the Augustinerkirche, I was given a Christmas Bockbier by a friend from the Vienna Philharmonic. Later a big vodka-martini was put into my hand. By the time the goose appeared I was well and truly 'hammered', to use my Irish friend's word. You find a similar scheme of things across the Inn in Germany. In her Berliner Kochbuch aus alten Familienrezepten, published by Weingarten, Maria von Treskow draws a pretty picture of a traditional Berlin Christmas. The shops filled with Pfefferkuchen from Thorn; toffeed almonds from Konigsberg; Baumkuchen from Cottbus; or Stollen from Dresden. Pomerania used to produce the smoked goose breasts and the shops were filled with carp. The last Kaiser was particularly fond of carp cooked in beer after which he favoured Christmas pudding doused in schnapps. The main feature of the Christmas lunch was a big, white, larded goose, also from Pomerania. Those from Poland were thought to be scrawny: the goose was stuffed with apples and sultanas and served with red cabbage and boiled potatoes. The sad thing is that most of these places are not what they were and, I am told, that one is more likely to find turkey these days. In the east the Russians tried to stamp out Christmas and replace it with a New Year's Eve feast. In the old days Christmas Eve was a fast day, the last day of Advent and that was why Central and Eastern Europeans were stuck with carp. The devout Russian ate ravioli stuffed with mushrooms and clear borscht followed by stuffed carp; on the day there was a Teutonic goose followed by koutia: my white Russian correspondent informs me this is 'quite revolting' - a blend of barley, honey and dried fruit. Paradise may well be in Scandinavia. The Danish solution sounds Germanic: goose with apples and a rice porridge which conceals an almond. Whoever finds it has the right to a present - a pink marzipan pig - a sweetmeat which made the fame of Lubeck and other Baltic ports, at least as far as children were concerned. In Sweden there was a copious Smorgasbord. A great mustard covered ham is the centrepiece and the table should be presided over by a boar's head. There are lots of different herrings, collared brawn, meat-balls, and lutfisk - stockfish or ling dried, split and slaked in lime. One of the oddest things is dopp i grytan: a big pot of ham broth into which Swedes dip wort-flavoured bread. Across the border in Norway there are even better things such as dried mutton ribs cooked over birch branches served with potatoes and mushy peas. It is washed down with aquavit and beer. The greatest incentive of all, however, is the dark reindeer meat culled in Lapland in the north. This is served with a game sauce flavoured with goats' cheese and crushed juniper berries. On balance I think Norway is the ticket.</p>

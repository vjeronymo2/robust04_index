			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] In his "Politics Portuguese-Style"  column in the 12 February EXPRESSO, Jose Antonio Saraiva  addresses the issue of relations between President Mario Soares  and Prime Minister Cavaco Silva. He cites the conclusion of the  prime minister's television appearance, in which Cavaco Silva  stressed, in "words lacking sincerity," that he respects Soares,  "who has served the country well in spite of some  disagreements"...and has every right to end his term in dignity  and respected by all. It is obvious from the prime minister's  words that the tactics of his relationship with the president  have changed, becoming "more sophisticated, more cynical, but  politically more effective," Saraiva writes. Until recently,  Cavaco Silva was suggesting that the president was not helping  the government in its task or that he intervened in its action.  By so doing, the prime minister was placing himself in an  inferior position, for he acknowledged that Soares possesses the  means to either facilitate or complicate the government's task  and that indeed the government depends on Soares. Grasping the  implications of Cavaco Silva's tactics, the president took full  advantage of them, Saraiva continues, "subtly threatening to  dissolve the Parliament for many months." However, the situation  changed after the municipal elections, when the PSD "cleverly"  presented the results as a "half-victory" for itself, defeating  the specter of parliamentary dissolution. Cavaco Silva's  television appearance put the final touch on the new situation,  for it promoted the idea that the president's future depends on  the prime minister's good will, Saraiva concludes.</p>

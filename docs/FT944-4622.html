			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Sentiment in US sector increasingly bullish US Treasury prices rose sharply across the maturity spectrum yesterday spurred on by short-covering, a strong dollar and speculation about asset reallocation. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 31/32 at 96 1/8 yielding 7.831 per cent and the two-year note up  9/32 at 99 21/32 , yielding 7.421 per cent. Sentiment seemed increasingly bullish as bonds reacted more strongly to good news than bad. Early in the day prices followed the dollar as it reached session highs against the D-Mark and the Japanese yen, but did not fall back as the currency pushed down below its late Monday levels. Late in the afternoon the dollar was at Y100.05 and DM1.5718 down from Y100.48 and DM1.5726 late on Monday. The market also got a boost as traders who had anticipated price decreases bought bonds to cover short positions. The moves indicate that traders now believe prices will continue to rise, which would make the cost of covering short positions increasingly expensive. Talk of asset reallocation also helped push up bond prices. Early in the day, analysts speculated that there might be some flight of investment from stocks to bonds after Fidelity Investments announced that it would not make a year-end distribution to shareholders in its Magellan Fund - the largest mutual fund in the US - for the first time since 1988. European government bonds weakened again yesterday, with the biggest losses posted among short maturities as European interest-rate futures followed their US counterparts sharply lower. The March short sterling future on Liffe fell 0.16 to 92.50; German March euromarks shed 0.08 to 94.49, and the French March Pibor contract on Matif fell 0.18 to 93.92. While dealers cited no strong reasons for the fall in the French and German interest rate contracts, the drop in short sterling futures reflected mounting fears of an imminent rise in UK interest rates. The fears were fuelled by political worries ahead of the parliamentary vote, due late yesterday, on the controversial VAT on fuel bill; many traders feared that a government defeat could prompt a base rate increase - especially with Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England holding their monthly monetary meeting today. Futures selling ahead of today's auction of Pounds 2bn of 8.5 per cent gilts due 2005 also weighed on prices. However, while dealers did not report much domestic demand for the paper, they expected some interest in next year's 10-year benchmark from overseas. Irish gilts reversed their recent out-performance of the UK market, dropping by about  3/4 points on the collapse of talks between the Fianna Fail party and its former Labour coalition partner to form a new government. The prospect of new elections or a 'rainbow coalition' comprising several parties unsettled the market, but dealers said either outcome would be palatable, so long as it was announced soon. 'The most important thing for the bond market is that this issue is resolved as quickly as possible to remove uncertainty,' said Mr Oliver Mangan, economist at Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin. The government's 6 1/4 per cent bonds due 2004 fell by 0.80 on the day to 84.00, where they yield 8.55 per cent. The recent improvement in Italian bond market sentiment was reversed as bonds tumbled amid political turmoil following the resignation of a leading anti-corruption magistrate. Before announcing his departure, he rattled the market by recommending a 10-month jail sentence for Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League, in connection with unreported funds his party received from an Italian industrial group. 'Events like this are convincing people that it's safest to stay on the sidelines,' said Mr Graham McDevitt, bond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets.</p>

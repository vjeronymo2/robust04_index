Israel will be very forthcoming in its quest  for peace, but it will not compromise on its security. As chief  of staff during the Six-Day War, I promised myself that I would  be the last commander of the Israel Defense Forces who would  have to face untenable borders... If we have security, we will  also have peace." Thus, Israeli Prime Minister Mr. Rabin,  addressing the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe  on Wednesday [26 January]. Mr. Rabin added that he was  convinced that "temporary setbacks and difficulties in our  negotiations with the PLO will not stop us from reaching an  agreement. We do not have any territorial designs in Lebanon  and our problems with Jordan could be solved fairly easily.  However, Lebanon will not budge without Syria's blessing,"  asserted Mr. Rabin, who noted that "our negotiations with Syria  have been, since their beginning, serious and open, and progress  has been made." The Prime Minister called on President al-Asad  to "walk the extra mile to meet us in the middle of the road for  peace."    Mr. Rabin also requested Europe to "increase its involvement  in the peacemaking process" because Europe's support can  consolidate peace in its real dimension: open borders, free  movement of goods and people, coexistence and cooperation. The  prime minister nevertheless said he feels a certain  "ambivalence" in the European attitude toward Israel and would  like to see more understanding concerning his country's  political positions, security concerns and economic needs. For  years, he said, "we have heard sermons and advice" but only a  small minority of European states have taken concrete steps to  eliminate the Arab boycott. In his view, no one would have  dreamt, after the progress achieved in recent months, that the  boycott would still be used as an "illegitimate weapon against  Israel." Regarding the new agreement the European Union is to  negotiate with Israel, Mr. Rabin affirmed that it must take  account of Israel's ability to contribute to the economic  activity of Europe and said "Israel's role as a stabilizing  factor and locomotive for growth in the region cannot be  minimized."</p>

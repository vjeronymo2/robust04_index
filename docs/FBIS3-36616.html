			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar, in answer to  parliament's social committee question about the possibility of  increasing social tax, told the parliament that the government  considers such a step "fatal" for Estonian economy.    Laar affirmed that the government has repeatedly analyzed  the  decrease in retired persons income due to inflation and price  rise, and has prepared a bill on increasing retirement benefits  that should reach Riigikogu by April 1. At present the pension  is approximately 300 ($21) kroons, depending on the years of  labour, per month.    Prime Minister said that increase of pensions would demand  an  additional 200 million kroons (about $14 million) to increase  pensions by 50-60 kroons ($4). He said that the situation could  possibly be solved by dividing the social tax, which at present  is 20 per cent for companies, between the employers and the  employees, a move, which is not supported by the social  committee of the parliament. Also turnover tax or excise duty  on tobacco and alcohol could be increased a couple of per cent  or the tax payment control increased by Tax Board, which,  however, demanded higher budget for the board.    Prime Minister added that it might be possible to substitute  the retirement benefits by pension insurance in the future.</p>

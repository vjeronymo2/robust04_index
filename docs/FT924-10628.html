			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Tajik police round up rebels Tajik police were yesterday rounding up rebels loyal to ousted communist president Rakmon Nabiyev as gunmen perched on tanks and armoured personnel carriers to guard the Tajikistan capital against communist attack, Reuter reports from Dushanbe. 'We do not want war, but if communists attack our town we will fight to the end,' said a teenage volunteer at a checkpoint at the northern approach to Dushanbe. Cumabey Buydukof, a commander of the Dushanbe self-defence forces, said 7,000 men were guarding the city, with co-operation from the Russians. Communist fighters were said to be 30km from Dushanbe. At least 20 people were killed last weekend when several thousand pro-communist gunmen attacked the capital of the former Soviet republic.</p>

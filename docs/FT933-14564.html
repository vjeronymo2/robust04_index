			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Dollars 1.2bn aid pledge to Tanzania Western donors yesterday pledged to give Tanzania up to Dollars 1.2bn in aid but criticised the country for not overhauling its economy fast enough, Reuter reports from Paris. After a two-day meeting, donors warned Tanzania that it would have to do better because it was competing for aid with many other countries. 'Delegates . . . expressed widespread concern that the pace of economic reform was inadequate to put Tanzania on a sustainable growth path rapid enough to reduce poverty substantially in the medium term,' their statement said. The Dollars 1.2bn pledged for Tanzania's fiscal 1993-94 year to end June 1994 includes Dollars 840m of project assistance and Dollars 360m balance-of-payments support.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Summary from poor reception] "The Congolese Armed Forces  [FAC] held a ceremonial parade this afternoon under the  chairmanship of Professor Pascal Lissouba, president of the  Republic and commander in chief of the Armed Forces." After  touching on the latest developments in the country, Defense  Minister General Raymond Damase Ngollo stated "the Army's  present position in the face of the political situation in our  country."    [Begin recording] "This situation is a challenge to the top  army hierarchy who, according to your directives, Mr. President,  should have taken control of the (?field) since the early days  of the crisis a little over a year ago." But we are prepared  today "to assume our responsibilities." However, Mr. President  of the Republic, it seems important to face the reality of our  army. Three quarters of our army are made up of commissioned  and noncommissioned officers. A divided army cannot take  control of any situation, and that is deplorable. Since 1983  there has been no (?jurisprudence) within the FAC, and the  failure of the compulsory national service has contributed to  worsening this situation. In terms of equipment and  infrastructure, our army finds itself in (?an uncomfortable  situation) in the face of lacking equipment and motivation.  "The FAC (?is now passing through) an unprecedented stage. The  commissioned and noncommissioned officers and the rank and file  are left at the mercy of alliances. This, Mr. President, is the  institution we have in hand to cope with our delicate mission  which consists in "guaranteeing the security of persons and  their property, ensuring security at the borders, and  participating in the social and economic development effort."  [end recording]    In his speech, Prof. Pascal Lissouba, commander in chief of  the Armed Forces, declared that the FAC has to be recycled. We  listen to him:    [Begin recording] Indeed, my general, as I stated a year  ago,  the Armed Forces are the only organized Congolese institution.  Indeed, my general, we were somewhat disappointed. Indeed, my  general, our country's social fabric, which disintegrated  dangerously, did not spare this institution. This is why, my  general, I urge our military attaches to work hard. The fact is  simply that we will have to recycle everyone. We will have to  review the men of your institution, because as you know it is  more than three decades since Congo formed an army. But I do  not believe that Congo could think that an army, just like an  individual, is a machine. To operate it, you need to feed it  from time to time. Surely, you do not only have to feed it with  hope and aspiration but also spiritually and psychologically,  for we should not forget that technology advances and methods  change. Therefore, countrymen, your troops must equally follow  the trend.    "How do we go about it? Perhaps, we have to hold some talks  and discussions with the military attaches of friendly countries  so that an effort may be made in order that -- like what occurs  at the military academy where many of the attaches carry out  their trade -- we may take a look at those of your colleagues  who flank you and who also require recycling. This seems  crucial when you begin to move forward at a great pace in  implementing the ideas which you yourself outlined. Indeed, we  did think of embarking on recruitment. But these will not be  like those you have been accustomed to in the past. You are  going to be in charge of these recruitments. You will do them  in a national manner. In other words, you will go to every  region of our country. I cannot spot the general in charge of  the Gendarmerie. Oh yes, he is there. He has already begun a  job which he showed to me, and I think I am expecting that of my  general. These recruitments must not be made like the ones we  were doing in the past. That is to say, we were making a  selection and then finally we were among ourselves. You will  have to recruit them from all over the republic." [end  recording]</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Mexican rebellion talks 'near' Mexican official mediators and peasant rebels last night were about to begin talks to end a 12-day-old uprising in the southern state of Chiapas, the government news agency Notimex said. It reported that the two sides would start talks 'very probably in the next few hours'. This arose after a government envoy, Mr Manuel Camacho Sols, had met Roman Catholic leaders from southern Mexico. President Carlos Salinas of Mexico yesterday ordered an immediate unilateral ceasefire in the conflict areas in the southern state of Chiapas. He did so after the army had claimed to have regained control of the former rebel strongholds. Mr Salinas offered an amnesty to rebels who had acted under duress or from desperation, and who now accept peace. He hoped the decision would be 'the first step to save lives and find new ways of conciliation'. He indicated that the government would respond to the social demands of the local population. The rebellion in Chiapas by the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, which began on January 1, has already cost more than 100 lives.</p>

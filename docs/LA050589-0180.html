			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DEFECTING SOVIET HOCKEY PLAYER IN U.S.;  </P> <P> MEMBER OF WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM SEEKS CAREER IN NHL  </P> <P> Alexander Mogilny, on the verge of stardom with the Soviet world championship  team, flew to the United States today for what he hoped would be a career in  the National Hockey League.  </P> <P> Soon after his arrival from Stockholm, the Soviet athlete was interviewed at  John F. Kennedy Airport by the FBI, according to an airport spokesman.  </P> <P> "They do that with all defectors," said Tom Middlemiss of the Port Authority.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sabres Own Rights  </P> <P> Middlemiss said Mogilny was accompanied on the flight by officials of the  Buffalo Sabres, adding that he did not know which ones. The Sabres own NHL  rights to the player.  </P> <P> A U.S. Embassy spokesman said Mogilny, who helped the Soviet Union to its 21st  world hockey title last week, was granted a U.S. visa Thursday. He reportedly  planned to fly to Buffalo, N.Y., after clearing customs.  </P> <P> The NHL was getting ready for Mogilny, but a spokesman said he had no  information "at this present moment" whether the Sabres had offered the Soviet  player a contract.  </P> <P> "We are collecting all the facts regarding Mogilny leaving his team and also  awaiting advice from United States State Department and the Canadian Department  of External Affairs as to what effect, if any, his military position places on  the situation, vis-a-vis his ability to settle in either country and travel  back and forth," said Gary Meagher, the NHL's director of media relations, in  Montreal.  </P> <P> Mogilny is a junior lieutenant in the Soviet Army. That adds a further  diplomatic complication: Soviet authorities could view the incident as  desertion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> INS Comment Declined  </P> <P> The regional director of the Immigration of Naturalization Service in Buffalo,  Benedict Ferro, said his office is aware of the situation, but he declined  further comment.  </P> <P> Presumably it would be through the immigration service in Buffalo that efforts  would be made to grant Mogilny permission to live in the United States.  </P> <P> The defection, the first by a Soviet national hockey player, cast a shadow on  U.S.-Soviet hockey relations and gave an ironic twist to the latest Soviet  championship.  </P></p>

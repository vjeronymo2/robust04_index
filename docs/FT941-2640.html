			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Jonathan Agnew gets Pounds 600,000 handshake Mr Jonathan Agnew, former chief executive of Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, received a Pounds 600,000 ex-gratia payment 'following the termination of his employment', according to the company's annual report. Mr Agnew announced last May that he intended to resign in the summer and Lord Rockley, KB chairman, said the company would look to replace him externally. In explaining the payment to Mr Agnew - which exceeds the total salary and performance-related pay earned by KB's chairmen in 1993 - Mr Peter Churchill-Coleman, company secretary, said the sum was agreed by a compensation committee consisting of non-executive directors. It does not represent a sum due under a long-term employment contract. 'None of our directors is on a long-term contract,' Mr Churchill-Coleman said. Contracts for directors at KB are typically three months long. Meanwhile, a Pounds 25,000 payment was made to the bank's pension plan to enhance the pension of Mr David Peake, the former chairman who retired from full-time executive duties in April 1993. He remains a non-executive director. The annual report also discloses that Lord Rockley earned Pounds 303,000 in performance-related pay in addition to his salary. The chairmen's salary, which for the first four months of 1993 was paid to Mr Peake, was Pounds 255,000. However, Lord Rockley was a director during that period and shared in a total of Pounds 2.6m in base salaries paid to 13 executive directors. In addition, the 13 directors shared in a pot of Pounds 2.9m in performance-related pay. The annual report says that performance-related pay to directors includes discretionary bonuses which are 'not based on any fixed or formulated arrangements especially related to profits'. Shareholder groups have called for companies to set firm criteria by which directors will earn performance-related pay.</p>

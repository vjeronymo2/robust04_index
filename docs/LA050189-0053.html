			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOST BIG-TIME JOCKEYS WILL BE ON SIDELINES;  </P> <P> PINCAY MAY BE THE ONLY WINNER OF A PAST DERBY IN SATURDAY'S RACE  </P> <P> If Houston and Laffit Pincay don't win the Kentucky Derby next Saturday at  Churchill Downs, the first-place horse will be ridden by a jockey who has never  won the Triple Crown race before.  </P> <P> While the 115th Derby will have its biggest favorite since Spectacular Bid in  1979 -- Easy Goer and his lesser-regarded entrymate, Awe Inspiring, will be the  odds-on choice -- it is also a race virtually devoid of jockeys with winning  Derby experience.  </P> <P> Pincay rode in the Derby 10 times before Swale gave him his first victory in  1984 and his overall record in the race is one for 15. Not counting the  undecided riding assignments on four of the 16 horses -- Majesty's Imp, Flying  Continental, Notation and Wind Splitter -- the announced jockeys have an  aggregate record of one victory in 41 Derby tries.  </P> <P> ABC will spend 90 minutes televising the two-minute Derby and the network could  use most of the time just introducing some of Saturday's riders. Three of the  jockeys -- Jo Jo Ladner on Northern Wolf, Chris DeCarlo aboard Faultless Ensign  and Don Pettinger with Clever Trevor -- will be riding in their first Derby and  three other riders will be making only their second appearance.  </P> <P> Name jockeys -- Jacinto Vasquez, Jorge Velasquez, Eddie Delahoussaye (twice),  Pincay, Angel Cordero, Bill Shoemaker, Chris McCarron and Gary Stevens -- have  won every Derby run in the 1980s and only Pincay appears to have a mount this  time, although there is talk at Churchill Downs Sunday that Shoemaker, who has  won the race four times, might wind up riding Flying Continental.  </P> <P> These are some of the reasons why an uncommonly high number of unknown jockeys  will become prominent names if only for a day:  </P> <P>  -- With Easy Goer such a heavy favorite, many top California and New York  jockeys are staying home and riding at Hollywood Park rather than shopping for  a Derby mount. "They can make a lot of money without leaving town, especially  if the horse they might ride in Kentucky doesn't have much of a chance to beat  Easy Goer, which is the case with most of the horses in the Derby," said Jack  Robbins, who as owner Jack Kent Cooke's West Coast adviser is shopping for a  jockey to ride Flying Continental.  </P> <P>  -- Trainers this year are showing unusual loyalty to the jockeys who rode  horses in the races that brought them to the Derby. Frank Brothers, for  example, successfully insisted that Larry Snyder ride Dansil even though the  colt's owner, John Franks, reportedly preferred a change. Snyder rode Dansil to  victory in the Arkansas Derby.  </P> <P>  -- Pat Day, who rode some other Derby horses -- including Western Playboy and  Notation -- in successful preps, had to be replaced because of his long-term  commitment with Easy Goer.  </P> <P> If Day wins he will need no introduction, although he has never won at the  Derby in six tries. Day has won many another major races, including three  victories in the Breeders' Cup and one Preakness.  </P> <P> Day's most bitter experience in the Derby came in 1987. He rode the favorite,  Demons Begone, and the colt bled profusely from the nostrils and had to be  pulled up on the backstretch.  </P> <P> "I have the feeling that there's a Derby up there someplace with my name on  it," Day said. "Maybe this will be my year."  </P> <P> Julie Krone, racing's premier female jockey, could have become the third woman  to ride in the Derby, but she turned down the mount on Wind Splitter.  </P> <P> "I don't want to finish last," Krone said. Wind Splitter is winless in five  starts this year, losing his last race on a disqualification at Pimlico after  finishing first.  </P> <P> Krone might have been more receptive had she been offered the mount on  Faultless Ensign, who won the Garden State Stakes in New Jersey in his last  start. Krone was aboard Faultless Ensign the race before that, a seventh-place  finish, but Ben Perkins Sr., the father of the horse's trainer and manager of  the syndicate that owns the colt, said the sorry performance by the colt wasn't  her fault.  </P> <P> "Julie followed our instructions to the letter," Perkins said. "But we gave her  bad instructions."  </P> <P> DeCarlo, 20, won the Garden State with Faultless Ensign and has retained the  mount in the Derby.  </P> <P> "I've got no problem using a jock who's never ridden in the Derby," Perkins  said. "Look at some of the jockeys who have won the race, guys like Bill  Boland, Ira Hanford and Steve Cauthen."  </P> <P> The only two apprentices to win the Derby have been Hanford, with Bold Venture  in 1936, and Boland, aboard Middleground in 1950. Boland was listed as a  16-year-old when he won, but he said years later that he lied about his age to  get a jockey license a year sooner and was actually 15 when he rode  Middleground. Affirmed gave Cauthen a Derby victory five days after the  jockey's 18th birthday in 1980. With Affirmed, Cauthen later became the  youngest jockey to ever sweep the Triple Crown.  </P> <P> Clever Trevor has won eight of 12 starts and Pettinger, a leading jockey at  Remington Park in Oklahoma City, Okla., has ridden the good-looking gelding  every time.  </P> <P> "We never considered anybody else to ride in the Derby," said Donnie Von Hemel,  who trains Clever Trevor. "Don is a good rider and he sure knows this horse.  Besides riding him every race, he's also been on him every time he's breezed,  even going back to his 2-year-old year, before he ever ran."  </P> <P> The Von Hemel and Pettinger families have been connected in racing for about 20  years. Pettinger's brother, an assistant trainer under Jack VanBerg, was a  jockey who rode almost all of the horses for Von Hemel's father.  </P> <P> McCarron, who rode Hawkster in his last race, a fourth-place finish in the  Santa Anita Derby, wasn't interested in riding the colt in the Derby, which  McCarron won with Alysheba in 1987. So trainer Ron McAnally came up with Marco  Castaneda, 38. A rider since 1965, Castaneda is getting his second chance in  the Derby, having finished fourth with Water Bank, another McAnally trainee, in  1982.  </P> <P> "We've got a hot (blooded) horse, so we hope a cool rider will balance it out,"  McAnally said.  </P> <P> Castaneda is known for sitting still on a horse. It's the kind of the style  that has gotten him a return ticket to Churchill Downs, where program sales  should be up this Saturday. The 125,000 or so fans won't be able to tell most  of the Derby jockeys without one.  </P> <P> </P> <P> JOCKEYS FOR THE 115TH KENTUCKY DERBY  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.10IN:2.77IN:4.09IN" WDM="ABS"

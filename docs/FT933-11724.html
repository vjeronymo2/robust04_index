			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Letter: Railways are too efficient to be dismissed Sir, I welcome the suggestion in your editorial, 'Motorway fatigue' (July 23) that the price mechanism should be used to regulate the demand for road space rather than building more and more roads. However, I do not agree with your dismissal of rail transport as a solution. The busiest parts of the M25 motorway are the sections close to Heathrow Airport, which is very badly served by public transport. Yet Heathrow Airport has all the characteristics that make rail transport highly efficient. It is a point of departure for millions of long distance flights every year and a very large, highly concentrated area of employment. A solution based on improved rail access to Heathrow Airport will be far more effective in reducing M25 congestion than you suggest. The price mechanism will influence demand, but it can only persuade people to use public transport if the quality of service is good enough. Improvement in rail services from all regions in the UK directly to Heathrow Airport must be a high priority so that people departing from or meeting flights at Heathrow can make the trip by rail as conveniently as by car. In addition, a rail equivalent of the M25 linking St Albans, Watford, Slough, Heathrow Airport, Staines etc in a full circle is needed to provide the high quality public transport alternative for journeys created by the building of the M25. But as Britain not only has the cheapest petrol in Europe, but also some of the most expensive rail fares, your editorial makes very good sense.

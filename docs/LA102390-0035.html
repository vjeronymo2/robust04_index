			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: IT'S WATER OVER THE DAM, BUT LETTER IS STILL AMUSING  </P> <P> Bob Bernhard, a retired employee of the Department of Water and Power, recently  sent me a letter written some years ago by Will Durant, the late  philosopher-historian, complaining about the size of his water bill. (Durant's  appeal resulted in a credit on his next bill.)  </P> <P> Evidently Bernhard had access to letters of complaint and saved some of them to  amuse him in retirement. He now sends me another -- written in 1971 by a woman  in San Fernando.  </P> <P> Like Durant, this woman was complaining about a bill that she considered too  high. Her style, however, is more satirical than that employed by the gentle  philosopher.  </P> <P> Her letter follows:  </P> <P> "To whom it may concern:  </P> <P> "Units of water consumed is 108, as stated on the bill. If a unit represents  100 cubic feet of water, or 748 gallons (as I was told by an employee of the  DWP) you are stating that I have used 80,784 gallons of water in the past two  months.  </P> <P> "That (according to Compton's Encyclopedia on the bathing and drinking habits  of elephants), could satisfy the needs of your average-sized elephant for four  years and 155 days. Don't ask me what size your average-sized elephant is --  Compton either didn't know or considered it irrelevant.  </P> <P> "However, I'm quite sure it exceeds the weight of my entire family several  times, which, by the way, consists of one man, who, although he bathes, hasn't  drunk water since he discovered Coors beer in 1949; one kid, who although he  drinks water, bathes only at gunpoint, and myself.  </P> <P> "I do bathe, but because I object to the Burnt Sienna tinge and the lumps in  that mud-colored liquid which dribbles from the spigots, I have become addicted  to Arrowhead Puritas.  </P> <P> "I am the owner of a small domestic establishment, not the Coliseum. 80,784  gallons could have dampened a fire (had there been a fire) at the rate of 1,800  gallons per minute for exactly 44.88 minutes, from an opened hydrant. That  amount in cubic feet (10,800) could fill a super pool, 8 feet deep and 27 feet  by 50 feet, and I don't even own a plastic kiddie play pool.  </P> <P> "With that much water I could fill 1,923 king-size water beds, so I'm told by a  friend who manufactures them. If I've used this much water, why is my lawn  half-dead from a lack of it?  </P> <P> "If you are positive you haven't confused me with someone who owns 27  elephants, then my meter belongs in the Smithsonian as the first machine to  exhibit emotionalism common only to the human species -- namely, greed.  </P> <P> "I expect to receive a reply, an explanation, and a serviceman to replace the  idiot box in my front yard with one which is capable of functioning without  these strange tendencies toward exaggeration."  </P> <P> Alas, Bernhard does not know how this case was resolved -- whether the customer  received a new meter and a credit on her bill, or both. I would like to think  that so eloquent a letter did not go unanswered.  </P> <P> I am not mathematician enough to know whether this woman's figures (about  bathing elephants and so on) are correct. She sounds positive. But I am  skeptical about her complaint that her tap water was mud-colored. The water we  have received from the DWP has always been clear, though it tastes somewhat of  chemicals.  </P> <P> I had a long running battle with the late Bob Lee, a longtime executive with  the department, over the purity of the water. I once referred to it as  "artificial water," thus provoking an indignant letter from Mr. Lee (who  remained throughout his lifetime a good friend).  </P> <P> He insisted that the water was water, and was not in any sense artificial. I  simply pointed out that the water was routinely adulterated by various  chemicals, to make it safe to drink, and that thus it was artificial.  </P> <P> Mr. Lee never conceded an inch to me and took every occasion to chastise me for  using that epithet. He was not moved by the fact that novelist Joe Wambaugh in  one of his novels referred to such expensive bottled waters as Evian and  Perrier as "designer water" -- a sly comment on the vogue use of that adjective  with every kind of consumer product from jeans to cosmetic surgery.  </P> <P> That letter-writer's note that her husband hadn't drunk water since he  discovered Coors in 1949 may seem at first glance an admirable solution to the  impending water shortage. In some parts of the world, in fact, beer is the only  safe thing to drink. I survived our recent trek through Egypt by drinking  nothing but beer and wine. But of course it takes water to make beer, and it  takes water to grow grapes.  </P> <P> I don't mean to make fun of the water shortage. It could soon be very real. One  day soon we may all be bathing, like Cleopatra, in goat's milk.  </P></p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Company News: Schering in talks over three niche sectors SCHERING, the German pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, is negotiating with 'selected potential partners' for its chemicals, electroplating and natural substances operations which last year amounted to DM1.2bn (Dollars 419m) - 19 per cent of sales. Mr Giuseppi Vita, chairman of Schering's board, said the Berlin-based company was considering everything from retaining a majority stake to an outright sale of all three activities, where production is sluggish. It is negotiating with more than 30 companies and expects a deal to be concluded by the end of this year. Mr Vita, the first Italian chairman of a large German company, said that although Schering operated in profitable niche markets in the three sectors, they could not provide adequate risk compensation for pharmaceuticals and plant protection which would absorb all of Schering's resources in the future. While pharmaceutical and plant protection sales expanded 15 per cent and 8 per cent respectively last year to DM3.6bn and DM1.5bn, industrial chemicals turnover fell 1 per cent to DM454m and electroplating rose only 2 per cent to DM329m. Schering is to pay an unchanged 26 per cent dividend on group sales last year of DM6.3bn and record earnings of DM274m. Group sales are expected to rise 5 per cent this year, while earnings are likely to remain at last year's level, the company forecast. Mr Vita said that in line with its new research strategy in the US, Schering recently bought a large research site in Richmond, California, from Chevron. Total spending on research and development last year amounted to nearly DM1bn, one reason that co-development and co-marketing with other pharmaceutical companies was gaining in importance for Schering, Mr Vita explained.</p>

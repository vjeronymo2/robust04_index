			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Letter: Politics that raise questions about state of democracy Sir, I have just come across your leader of February 8 congratulating John Smith, the opposition leader, for learning lessons from President Clinton about being in tune with 'the aspirations of ordinary people'. And about time, too. Hurrah] etc. But the aspiration of most of us ordinary people is to be free riders if we can get away with it. To have a first-rate health service and run it on peanuts. To pay the non-ordinary unemployable homeless enough to keep them from begging on the streets and turning our parks into shanty-towns, but not out of our own pockets. Democratic politics used to be thought to be about using persuasion to change other people's aspirations so as to bring them more in line with (a) one's own perception of reality and (b) one's own values. Take current aspirations as given, as your leader does, and politics is either about clever public relations deception, or about the spendthrift piling-up of American or Italian-style fiscal deficits. Is that the sort of democracy we really want? Ronald Dore, Centre for Economic Performance, London School of Economics, Houghton Street, London WC2A 2AE</p>

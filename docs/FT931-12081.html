			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Books: Spiritual dislocations - Fiction NOTHING BUT BLUE SKIES by Thomas McGuane Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 16.99, 349 pages THE MAN WHO WAS LATE by Louis Begley Macmillan Pounds 14.99, 201 pages BASTARD OUT OF CAROLINA by Dorothy Allison Flamingo Pounds 5.99, 309 pages THE LONG NIGHT OF THE WHITE CHICKENS by Francisco Goldman Faber Pounds 14.99, 450 pages OLD hippies don't die, they just fade into Thomas McGuane novels. His tenth, Nothing But Blue Skies, features Frank Copenhaver, a wealthy Montana businessman who has lopped off his pony tail and padlocked the medicine cabinet in order to become seriously rich. His flirtation with manna ends just after his 44th birthday, however, when his wife Gracie leaves him for a New Age anthropologist. Frank becomes comprehensively and hilariously unhinged, squandering his assets, embarking on bizarre erotic dalliances and, ultimately, landing himself in court. It takes his daughter's affair with a right-wing politician to bring Frank back to his senses. McGuane has never written more precisely or more hilariously about that generation which graduated from listening to Jefferson Airplane to checking up on the Dow Jones average. Frank is a fitting hero for the times, steeped in nostalgia for a better age yet wise enough to realise that the present day is all he has got. Although the book flirts with high-mindedness - such as the message that if you rape the land she will eventually press charges - McGuane keeps things moving along with a series of raucous escapades, most notably when Frank unwittingly rides a prize pig through the State Fair. The result is a funny and apt survival guide for every lapsed hippy who feels bad about selling out but does not quite know what to do about it. Spiritual dislocation of a very different sort is on offer in The Man Who Was Late. Its author, Louis Begley, could justifiably be called the novelist who was late - after a distinguished career as a New York attorney, Begley made his literary debut last year with his award winning Wartime Lies, a tale of a young boy's escape from the Holocaust. His second novel covers similar themes. This time, the hero is Ben, the son of Jewish refugees who, fleeing a traumatic if unspecified past in Hitler's Europe, reinvents himself as a suave international financier. The toll this spiritual sleight-of-hand exacts on his heart and soul is great, most tellingly on his relationships with women. Begley is a novelist of extraordinary sophistication and sensitivity, with ambitions that seem to bypass much recent writing and head straight for Proust territory. His Ben is a scarily precious creature, a man who has enveloped a troubled soul with epicureanism and eroticism, thereby refining himself to the point of non-existence. Indeed, some readers might find themselves a bit worn by Begley's occasionally cloying irony and detail. This said, his novel remains a compelling examination of the dangers of denying a damaged self. Childhood scars are examined in a more forthright manner in Dorothy Allison's Bastard Out of Carolina. The bastard in question is Ruth Anne 'Bone' Boatwright, a young member of an extended South Carolina family who could be classified as either salt of the earth or white trash. Despite being raised fatherless in grinding poverty, Bone's 1950s childhood is not without its moments of happiness and security. But then her mother marries the malevolent Daddy Glen, a darkly jealous creature who breaks Bone's bones and molests her, even as his wife is in labour. Bone's lonely battle against this man and the brutal patriarchy he represents are the meat of this powerful first novel Although Allison covers oft-ploughed territory here, she writes with sufficient passion to make this an engaging read. Her portrait of rural poverty is convincing and not without its humor, embodied particularly in Bone's hard-drinking, hell-raising uncles. But the book's real strength lies in Bone's voice, so believably rendered that the reader is willing to accompany its speaker even through the darkest parts of her journey to womanhood. Another victimised woman is the focus of Francisco Goldman's first novel, The Long Night of White Chickens. It tells the story of Flor de Mayo, a Guatemalan girl who is plucked from an orphanage to serve as a maid for a Boston family. They adopt her as one of their own, especially sickly young Roger, who loves her as a sister and perhaps more. After graduating from an elite American college, she returns to her native country to run an orphanage, only to be murdered in mysterious circumstances. Roger's attempt to find the truth behind her death forms the novel's central narrative. Goldman writes with authority about modern Guatemalan politics and culture, displaying a keen nose for the dark absurdity of Latin America, where the powers that be refuse to investigate murders yet are all too happy to change without notice the directions of all the country's one-way streets. Unfortunately, Goldman's narrative is too pocked with digressions to pull the reader along, making the novel far more effective as a rumination on failed love than as a murder mystery.</p>

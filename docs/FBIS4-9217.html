			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dj. Ognjenovic: "From Slavonia Bank-Djakovo </F> Branch: Stock Shares From Old Foreign Exchange Savings"]    [Text] Djakovo--In accordance with the decision by the  government of the Republic of Croatia under which stock in 44  companies is offered from the portfolio of the Croatian Fund for  Privatization [HFP] to people who have claims against the public  debt of the Republic of Croatia--i.e., old foreign exchange  savings--Slavonia Bank-Djakovo Branch has begun collecting bids  from interested clients.    The bank will carry out for depositors all transactions  associated with this major campaign, which began on 28 February  and will last 90 days, according to directions from the HFP.    The first auction, at which authorized brokers will buy  stock  on behalf of buyers, is scheduled for 28 March.    Depositors who decide to use old foreign exchange savings to  become stockholders in one of the proposed companies can get all  the information they need at the Djakovo Branch, Ulica Hrvatskih  Velikana 4. They will be provided with an explanation of all  details connected with the transaction and the relationship with  the HFP, and if they decide to be represented on the Zagreb  Stock Exchange by one of the bank's authorized brokers, the  Djakovo Branch will give them the opportunity to talk with  brokers in order to get a more complete picture.    The Slavonia Bank brokers will not charge a fee to their  depositors, they will represent them at the public auction, and  they are contractually bound to protect their interests, to act  with reasonable care and diligence, and to apply the highest  standards of the profession.    The offered stock can also be acquired by those who do not  have old foreign exchange savings, i.e., by all legal and  physical persons who want to buy shares. They too can turn to  the bank, which in that case will be an intermediary between  them and the depositors who want to sell their old foreign  exchange savings.    The procedure is very simple. The seller of the old foreign  exchange savings submits his offer to the bank with an  indication of the amount that he wishes to sell and the discount  (concession) that he is offering. The buyer submits his offer of  the amount of old foreign exchange savings that he wishes to  buy, with the discount that he is willing to accept.    From the offered terms of buying and selling, the bank  chooses the most favorable for both the buyer and the seller. In  these deals, the bank again acts as an intermediary offering  full service.    Those who are a little more daring will recognize the  opportunity of investing their own money and the inception of  real stock exchange dealing--something that was inaccessible  until only recently, and in which this time Slavonia Bank, in  addition to its depositors, is involved.</p>

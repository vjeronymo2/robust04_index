			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 7 January (MTI) -- The Hungarian  Democratic Forum (MDF) continues to exclude the possibility of  forming coalitions with any successor parties of the former  Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, MDF Vice-President and  Parliamentary Group Head Ferenc Kulin told reporters in Budapest  on Friday [7 January].    During the 1994 electoral campaign, Hungary's main coalition  party will do its utmost to prevent the Hungarian Socialist  Party (MSZP) from having the chance to form a government, he  said.    The MDF does not want to enter into coalition with parties  which disagree with its nationally-committed policy and do not  recognize the values of a conservative center-right policy,  Kulin asserted.    Asked by MTI, the politician thought it impossible for the  MDF to make a coalition with the Alliance of Free Democrats.  Any further guesses were meaningless -- the MDF would not look  at alliances with other parties before knowing election results.</p>

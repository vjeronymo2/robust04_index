			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;600.123(f) under Cost sharing or matching, ``expendable equipment'' has been deleted because it is an example that does not fit the subject of the paragraph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 600.124(a) under Program income has been rewritten to improve the syntax.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;600.124(b)(1), (2) and (3), ``program'' has been deleted to reflect that DOE is limiting the use of program income to the project on which it is earned, not more generally to undefined programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 600.124(d) has been rewritten to improve the syntax and to add the applicability to commercial organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 600.125(a) on budget plans has been rewritten to improve the syntax.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 600.125(e)(2) on budget period extensions has been rewritten to improve the syntax.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;&sect;600.128, 600.151(b), and 600.161(a)(3), ``grant'' was changed to ``award'' to be consistent with DOE usage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;600.134(c) under Equipment, ``Federal awarding agency which funded the original project'' has been deleted and replaced with ``DOE.'' The word ``awarding'' between ``Federal'' and ``agencies'' has been deleted as unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;600.134(g) under Equipment, the following has been added: ``Equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of less than $5000 may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to the awarding agency.'' This makes explicit what is intended but not directly stated in Circular A&hyph;110. This policy, it should be noted, is consistent with Section  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .32(e)(1) of the A&hyph;102 Common Rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 600.134(h) under Equipment and its subparagraphs have been renumbered from Circular A&hyph;110, in which it was listed as Section  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .34(g)(4). Subparagraph (g)(4) was a different subject from the rest of the paragraph (g). Also, the language ``the recipient shall apply the standards of this section, as appropriate'' was deleted and replaced by ``the provisions of 600.134(g)(1) apply'' to give a more precise cross-reference to the applicable standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;600.144(a)(2) under Procurement procedures, ``for the Federal Government'' is deleted as an inappropriate standard for financial assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;600.151(h) pertaining to performance reports, ``applicable'' was added to emphasize that not all provisions of 5 CFR Part 1320 apply in requesting performance data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 600.152(a)(1)(i) under Financial reporting has been rewritten to improve syntax.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;600.153(b)(4) pertaining to record retention requirements, ``etc. as'' is deleted and replaced by ``and related records, for which retention requirements are'' to provide more specific examples.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;600.153(g) pertaining to record retention requirements, the first sentence in the A&hyph;110 text was deleted because it had the appearance of a subparagraph title, which the rest of the subparagraphs did not have.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;600.153(g) (1) and (2), ``awarding'' was deleted and replaced by ``responsible for negotiating the recipient's indirect cost rate'' in (g)(1) and ``cognizant'' in (g)(2) to emphasize the role of cognizant agencies in indirect cost rate negotiation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix A, No. 8 has been rewritten to more accurately state the circumstances under which Executive Orders 12549 and 12689 apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Explanation for ``Interim Final'' Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Observer: Tomed down Could it be that the best way to get the public to turn down a historic proposal is to make it a long one, and get them to read it? Certain Danes, reflecting on the rejection of the Maastricht Treaty, are beginning to think so. Well before the June 2 referendum their government printed the 120-page legal text and handed out 500,000 free copies, one for every 10 of the population. The result, it seems, was that a good many of them took one look and decided they could never vote for anything so incomprehensible. What price, then, the chances for the Norwegian government? Its bill presenting the European Economic Area Agreement between the European Community and the Efta countries, just issued, runs to 4,707 pages and weighs in at 16lb 1 1/2 oz.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian aluminium production outstrips demand THE INDIAN aluminium industry closed the 1991-92 season last month with unsold stocks of more than 50,000 tonnes; and the total would have been twice as high had the industry not exported more than 50,000 tonnes at a loss. According to Mr AK Agarwala, president of Hindalco Industries, India's largest private sector producer of aluminium, the unsold stocks are largely attributable to reduced demand from the cable and conductor manufacturers. The electrical sector accounts for nearly 45 per cent of the Indian aluminium consumption. Demand for the metal from the other major sectors - transport, construction, packaging and domestic appliances - was sluggish because of the general recession in the economy. Domestic offtake of about 425,000 tonnes in 1991-92 fell short of the expected level by about 45,000 tonnes. Indian aluminium consumption in 1990-91 was 450,000 tonnes. In spite of the infrastructure bottleneck, the Indian industry produced 512,000 tonnes last year, beating its target of 500,000 tonnes and 1989-90's actual production of 449,328 tonnes. The installed capacity of the industry is 610,000 tonnes. Mr Agarwala points out that demand growth has been deterred by the high duty on aluminium, which constitutes nearly 40 per cent of the final price of the metal, much higher than is paid on other non-ferrous metals, like copper, zinc and lead, which are mostly imported. The Federal Ministry of Mines has backed the aluminium industry's plea for the duty to be reduced, but the Ministry of Finance has to agree. A strong case is also being made for lowering import duties on hard pitch and calcined petroleum coke, two important inputs for aluminium production. Aluminium Industry officials expect that following the launch on April 1 of the eighth five year plan, which lays considerable stress on the creation of new power generation capacity, there will be strong growth in demand for aluminium. The working group on the plan projected 8 per cent annual growth in aluminium demand during the plan period. Mr Agarwala believes that if the primary metal producers undertake market development work in earnest domestic aluminium demand could easily be raised to 1m tonnes by the end of the century. At present Indian per capita consumption of the metal, at 500 grams is one of the lowest in the world. It is only recently that the Indian authorities have come to appreciate the value of aluminium's recyclability. Being highly dependent on fuel imports, India is expected to encourage the use of this light metal in the transport sector. Mr Agarwala thinks that transport, packaging, automobile and construction sectors will provide the main surge in demand in the future. But, as there is not much new capacity in the pipeline, India will once again be a net importer of the metal in a few years' time. In 1987-88, India imported nearly 65,000 tonnes of aluminium. In the current year, however, it is planning to export 70,000 tonnes of primary metal and semi-fabricated products. To be a successful exporter, India will have to improve the quality of 'semis', which will mean importing technology. HINDALCO INDUSTRIES, India's largest private sector producer of aluminium has decided to build a 200,000 tonnes-a-year smelter on a greenfield site, writes Kunal Bose. A 500,000 tonnes-a-year alumina (aluminium oxide) plant is also to be set up to feed the proposed smelter. A decision on the location of the project will be taken once Hindalco has signed a lease agreement for mining bauxite (aluminium ore). According to Mr AK Agarwala, Hindalco's president, the company is looking at bauxite reserves in Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. The cost of setting up the smelter and alumina plant will be about Rs40bn (Pounds 870m). Although Hindalco has been producing aluminium for nearly three decades, for the proposed new plant it will be seeking the latest technology from the west. Mr Agarwala, has identified Pechiney of France, Hydro of Norway and Kaiser and Reynolds of the US as possible sources of the technology. The supplier of the technology is likely to be asked to participate in the equity capital of a company being floated to implement the project. Meanwhile Hindalco is raising capacity at its Renukoot plant in Uttar Pradesh by 55,000 tonnes to 210,000 tonnes a year. Alumina capacity is also being stepped up from 294,000 tonnes to 350,000 tonnes a year. The total cost of the expansion will be Rs7bn.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Bank denies conspiring to stop DTI investigation of NatWest THE Bank of England yesterday denied allegations that it had conspired with National Westminster Bank to prevent the Department of Trade and Industry launching an inquiry into the clearer's role in Blue Arrow's Pounds 837m rights issue of shares. 'The most that we did was to encourage the DTI to delay any inquiry until it had the conclusions of NatWest's own investigation,' the Bank said yesterday. It was responding to a suggestion made in this week's Economist magazine that the Bank 'tried hard to persuade the DTI not to open a formal inquiry'. The Bank said: 'On April 13 (1988) the DTI told us it was considering launching a formal investigation . . . They then agreed with us it was sen-sible to await the outcome' of NatWest's own inquiry. The Bank said evidence that the Economist gathered from the recent Blue Arrow trial was capable of a different interpretation from the one put on it by the magazine. It confirmed that it gave advice to NatWest on how to present the conclusions of the bank's investigation into the Blue Arrow share issue. The investigation was supposed to uncover why NatWest failed to comply with Companies Act requirements that it should disclose its huge exposure to Blue Arrow shares, which it acquired when the rights issue flopped in September 1987. The Bank said its advice was not that NatWest should absolve itself of blame. It said it advised NatWest that the report should say there might have been a deliberate attempt to circumvent the act. An earlier draft of the internal report, according to the Bank, had concluded that NatWest had merely made an 'honest mistake' in not disclosing the exposure. 'We wanted the report to leave open the question' of whether the non-disclosure was deliberate or accidental, the Bank said. Separately, NatWest yesterday refused to make any comment in response to the Economist's detailed analysis of the role played by its chief executive, Mr Tom Frost, in the months before the DTI launched its formal inquiry in December 1988 and during the DTI inquiry. 'There is still the possibility of a second Blue Arrow trial', the bank said. 'Our lawyers tell us it would be inappropriate to comment'.</p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Arts: Satirical bark from Bulgakov - Regional Theatre Bill Paterson as a dog? No, not really. The laconic limner of wry scepticism or understated intensity is happier once Professor Preobrazhensky's scalpel has worked its miracle and the stray pooch, human testes and pituitary gland firmly implanted, is transformed into Poochikov. Nothing becomes Mr Paterson's portrayal of the titular canine in this adaptation of Mikhail Bulgakov's novel The Heart of a Dog so much as his leaving of it. As Pooch he wears long-johns, a Mickey Mouse nose and what appear to be trainers covered by socks for front paws. Doggy characteristics, even by the standards of clowning, are perfunctory. As the 'complete humanisation' of the professor's experiment he dons white spats, a shocking pink tie and a filthy suit whose bagginess makes Chaplin's tramp look like a Saville Row model. This louche, leering Frankenstein of the early Soviet system uttered his first satirical bark in 1925, waiting incredibly until glasnost for publication in Russia itself. The scientific optimism lampooned by the story, a Panglossian belief that all's for the best in the most materialist of all worlds, has returned today in a new guise: genetic engineering, apparently offering the solution to society's problems. As in a moralistic fairy-tale by E. Nesbit, the magic goes horribly wrong, the fantastic and grindingly mundane in sometimes hilarious conjunction. No loveably earthy proletarian innocent - Panza, Papageno, Schweik - Poochikov is a drunken, thieving lecher who betrays his creator. 'The real horror,' as the professor realises, 'is that he no longer has a dog's heart but a human one.' The brave new world that had such people in it also produced J. Stalin. Mark Wing-Davey's production at Edinburgh's Royal Lyceum theatre favours bold physical strokes which tend to bulldoze over the words of Stephen Mulrine's adaptation. Mulrine's translation of another Russian play also seen in Edinburgh, Moscow Stations, showed a gift for haunting bittersweet irony. There are some signs of subtlety here too, as when bureaucracy inevitably requires documents for the humanised canine, and an identity is created from scratch. And the newly-disillusioned of the liberated eastern bloc may smile bitterly at lines like 'Once you've tasted the good life who needs freedom?' The production's taste for Expressionist grotesquerie excels with the trio of apartment-block apparatchiks, all doll make-up and cartoon hairstyles, and the operation itself, performed to a sound-track from Aida - 'Ritorna vincitor]' mimes the nurse, proffering a pair of testicles to the doctor. The differing styles may gel in time. As yet Angus Wright's passionate naturalism as the professor's disciple stands out, balanced by Caroline Harker's stylised, wide-eyed nurse. Bill Paterson's creditable Rab C. Nesbitt impersonation perhaps seeks another context.</p>

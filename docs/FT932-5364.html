			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Sihanouk in power grab snub for UN PRINCE Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia yesterday announced the immediate formation of a new coalition government with himself as head of state, prime minister and chief of the armed forces. The prince's declaration was made without consulting the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) and was given a lukewarm welcome by Mr Yasushi Akashi, the Untac chief. One Untac official said privately that Prince Sihanouk's announcement - which did not say the government was temporary and made no mention of Untac's continuing mandate in Cambodia - could be seen as a constitutional coup d'etat. Prince Sihanouk appointed as deputy prime ministers his son Prince Ranariddh, who leads the royalist party Funcinpec, and Mr Hun Sen, who was prime minister in the communist Phnom Penh government, abolished yesterday. With most of the votes counted after last week's UN - organised election, Funcinpec has emerged as the strongest political party in the future Cambodian assembly, which is to draft a new constitution and form a government within three months under a 1991 Paris peace plan. The Cambodian People's party (CPP), the old government communist party, came a close second. Mr Akashi, summoned to the palace to be told of the new government described the initiative as 'extremely important' and said it 'could be a necessary instrument for stability' provided the two main parties supported it. Funcinpec's reaction was not immediately known last night although Prince Sihanouk assured Cambodians that his son had given his 'full agreement and unconditional support.' The administration remains in the hands of the CPP and a Funcinpec-CPP coalition is probably the best recipe for peace in Cambodia. The CPP, which controls the armed forces, discussed the new government with the prince yesterday. It also seemed ready to drop its challenge to the election results based on alleged 'irregularities.' 'The CPP wishes to appeal to all compatriots, public servants and all categories of the armed forces to remain calm and to be pleased with and optimistic about the national Cambodian government under the high leadership of his royal highness Norodom Sihanouk,' the party said. One problem for the CPP could be Prince Sihanouk's suggestion that he wanted to make peace with the Khmer Rouge, the guerrilla faction which reneged on the Paris accord and has long fought against the CPP government.</p>

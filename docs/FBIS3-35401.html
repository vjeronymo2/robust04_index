			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Oil in Sanctions Wheel"] </F>   [Text] It is common knowledge by now that whenever Iraq  gets closer to meeting its obligations under the relevant United  Nations Security Council resolutions, new conditions spring up  to frustrate its bid to end the international punitive measures  against it. The addition of conditions in such cases is called,  generally in the West, deliberate moving of the goalposts.    We have a better term for it: international blackmail. By  this we mean that there are definite economc reasons behind the  constant orchestration of new conditions against that Arab  country. These reasons have roots in the world oil market glut.    There are several oil producing countries which would give  or  do anything to keep Iraqi oil out of the international market  for the simple reason that oil prices have dropped considerably  in the past few years and are hovering now about $16 per barrel.  Keeping Iraqi oil out of circulation would at least keep the  already depressed prices where they are. The reintroduction of  Iraqi petroleum products into the market stands to lower even  further the current price ranges. The Arab oil producing  countries alone saw their revenues drop from $180 billion in the  early eighties to a mere $75 billion in 1993. And what applies  to the Arab World applies also to other producers from various  regions of the world. This is a colossal economic crisis, which  would only be exacerbated by lifting the oil embargo on Baghdad.    The Western industrial countries, which count on the  revenues  of the oil producing countries to grease their economies by  selling them more and more aircraft, tanks and guns, have a  stake in keeping the pockets of these countries full and ready  enough in order to be able to perform exactly such a task.    We would have thought there is a better way to stabilise the  oil market than by continuing to punish the Iraqi people.  Sooner or later, Iraqi oil will enter the market. It would be  wiser and fairer if a global solution could be found for this  problem based on sound economic considerations for both the  exporters and importers of this basic commodity. The real issue  now lies with OPEC countries themselves, which have not been  able or willing to heed their own agreements. In the long run,  a more equitable quota system could be applied that could  satisfy the global economy in a balanced manner. Meanwhile, the  persistent ostracisation of Iraq by the international community,  even after it has gone more than 95 per cent of the way to meet  its obligations, makes little sense besides being totally unfair  and unjust. Gradual easing of the sanctions against Baghdad  commensurate with the extent of its fulfilment of its  international obligations must become the mainstay of the new  policy towards it instead of the current arbitrary and unethical  direction being followed now.</p>

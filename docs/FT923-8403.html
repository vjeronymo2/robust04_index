			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: Cambior's output up while profits decline CAMBIOR, a fast-growing Canadian gold producer, raised output in Quebec and Alaska in the first half, but lower prices and heavy depreciation cut final earnings, writes Robert Gibbens. Output was 180,665 oz, up 26 per cent from a year earlier, but net profits were CDollars 9m (Dollars 7.6m), or 29 cents a share, down from CDollars 10.7m, or 38 cents a share.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of </F> Komeito, by TOKYO SHIMBUN reporters Shigeo Ishii and Ryoji Tateo  at the Diet building; date not given; first two paragraphs are  TOKYO SHIMBUN introduction]    [Text] The ruling coalition party has become a minority  government due to the Social Democratic Party of Japan's [SDPJ]  pullout from the government, and is in the largest crisis ever.  The "Ichi-Ichi line," the duo of Komeito Secretary General  Yuichi Ichikawa and Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa,  has played a "control tower" role of the coalition government.  How will the Ichi-Ichi line react to this difficult situation?  Also, was the formation of [parliamentary group] "Kaishin,"  which triggered the SDPJ's pullout, a miscalculation? We asked  Mr. Ichikawa, who has just become the acting chairman of  Komeito, to talk frankly about the future course of the chaotic  political situation.    The interview was held in Komeito's waiting room in the Diet  building. Mr. Ichikawa said, while laughing: "At the meeting  of presidents of the mass media, I said that one who becomes a  president from a reporter is not good at conducting business  because he has not gone through the hardships of sales and  getting advertisements. I said this while especially looking at  the face of Nabetsune (the nickname of YOMIURI SHIMBUN President  Tsuneo Watanabe)." Mr. Ichikawa, who used to be managing editor  of KOMEI SHIMBUN and had a very hard time not being able to sell  advertisement, gave an impression that he takes pride in being  familiar with both sides of the mass media.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Following your appointment as the party's  acting chairman, is the next step the chairman's post?    [Ichikawa] Oh no. It [my appointment] was not carried out as  part of preparations for the next personnel changes at the  November party convention. We just sincerely followed Prime  Minister Hata's policy that, "if a party leader joins the  cabinet, I want him to concentrate on his job as a member of the  cabinet." I do not feel that I will be the next chairman, nor  is there such an atmosphere within the party.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Is strengthening the party's organization  important for the present?    [Ichikawa] Since the SDPJ left the Hata Cabinet, party  leaders' entering the cabinet has become more significant. Then  it is only natural that the secretary general stay within the  party. Komeito has been promoting the reorganization of the  political world early on, and is the first party to say that it  does not matter if its name disappears. In addition, I was at  the center of the electoral system reform.    It is very irresponsible of me to join the cabinet while the  [political realignment] plan is not completed. To say that  there is no one other than myself [to do the job of political  reorganization] may sound arrogant, but I think it is my duty to  take responsibility for carrying it out.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] You did not know about the forming of  "Kaishin?"    [Ichikawa] Basically, I did not know about it because we  were  not asked to join the group. Since I have been saying the Diet  dissolution and general election under the new electoral system  should be fought by organizing a new new-party, I think the  formation of a parliamentary group is necessary to that end.  But, (immediately before Kaishin's establishment) there was a  call from then Prime Minister Hosokawa regarding the group's  formation, and when I made sure that "You have informed the SDPJ  about the plan thoroughly," he answered, "the Democratic  Socialist Party [DSP] is responsible for obtaining agreement  from the SDPJ, and labor unions and Rengo [Japanese Trade Union  Confederation]."    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What you were worrying about came true?    [Ichikawa] Although those excluded (from "Kaishin") may feel  unpleasant, the parliamentary group issue is trivial compared to  destabilizing the political situation. I understand that there  were various problems with the way the group was formed.  However, it cannot be a reason (for the SDPJ) to leave the  government.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Do you think the forming of the  parliamentary  group without informing the SDPJ was wrong?    [Ichikawa] Both the SDPJ and Sakigake [Harbinger] say they  are determined to oppose the idea of making a new new-party, and  they will fight separately in an election under the new system.  Because they say they want to form a coalition again if the  parties win the election, it is not reasonable to discuss the  issue of maintaining the coalition in relation to the issue of  the parliamentary group before an election. Their judgment to  agree with the LDP's no-confidence motion depending on the  situation, is too much swayed by party interests.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] There is talk about canceling "Kaishin"  among the DSP and the Japan New Party [JNP].    [Ichikawa] If the DSP is going to propose disbanding  "Kaishin," it has to make clear its leadership's responsibility.  Political responsibility is to be severely questioned. At  least, the leadership of the DSP and the JNP will be held  responsible.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] While process and time are important in  politics, is not the Ichi-Ichi line rushing too fast?    [Ichikawa] The LDP uses words like "high-handed" or  "hardline" to try to split the ruling coalition party. The mass  media is reporting that as something funny, which is totally  different from reality. SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo  said, "the Ichi-Ichi line does not exist in the meeting of  coalition representatives. Everybody is involved in the  decisionmaking." [The Ichi-Ichi line] is a false image made up  by the mass media.    The relationship between chairman and secretary general  varies from party to party. When things go wrong, the Ichi-Ichi  line is held responsible for everything while this difference is  being neglected. For example, there is a party that is divided  between the left and the right, while there is a party in which  mutual understanding between its chairman and secretary general  is lacking.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] There is also criticism of the Ichi-Ichi  line's high-handed methods.    [Ichikawa] The fact that both Mr. Ozawa and I were  constantly  on the sidelines making decisions as the ruling party gave the  impression that we were taking the leadership. I think the  criticism is the reaction against it. The mass media is to  blame too. To make up for the insufficiency in its coverage,  the press holds the Ichi-Ichi line responsible for anything it  does not know.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What do you think of Mr. Ozawa's criticism  of  the mass media?    [Ichikawa] Mr. Ozawa has a streak of shyness. That is why he  tends not to talk about himself, and the mass media  misunderstands him. Diet members do not talk the same way with  reporters as they do with their colleagues. However, Mr. Ozawa  speaks frankly. So if there is a bad reporter around him he  could be caught (laughs). (Referring to the ASAHI SHIMBUN report  that Ozawa said: "It does not matter with which woman you  sleep," at the time of forming the lower house parliamentary  group "Kaishin").    Nobody will think good of the content of Mr. Ozawa's remark  itself. But, men in general say things like that a lot when  they drink. Well, Mr. Ozawa murmured that as he was walking.  Usually, it is a rule not to report that, and moreover, a  reporter of the news agency that covered the news was not  actually there.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] If the person who is moving the political  world will not disclose his real intention easily, it is only  natural to report what is as close as possible to his intention.    [Ichikawa] I think it is a question of the press ethics of  editors that a report based on secondhand information gets a  four-column heading. I am saying that the news agencies lack a  sense of ethics considering their public responsibility, and  this is not meant to be a criticism of TOKYO SHIMBUN. I do not  intend to defend the content of Mr. Ozawa's remark, but, I am  saying there is a problem with the press' attitude.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Does not Komeito's pacifism stand and Mr.  Ozawa's military expansion policy conflict? Also, there seems  to be criticism from Soka Gakkai.    [Ichikawa] That is your story. Saying that "Mr. Ozawa is for  the expansion of the military" is wrong. To argue that Mr.  Ozawa and Komeito are different by assuming Mr. Ozawa is an  expansionist, without the grounds for saying so, is very  prejudiced. I think Japan should advocate world security  centering on the United Nations. However, there are differences  between Mr. Ozawa and myself on the procedure for gaining public  consensus.    Mr. Takemura (leader of Sakigake) deliberately says that Mr.  Ozawa's "normal country" vision is scary. Does Mr. Takemura  have any plans for international contributions? Nonmilitary  contribution is deceptive. Calling oneself by a neat name, such  as SDPJ-DSP liberals or pro-Constitution liberals, while  labeling others with a name that makes a bad impression is a  really dangerous method. To talk seriously and firmly is  regarded as "rigid," and someone who says things with an  irresponsible vision is regarded as "soft." This is ridiculous.  Politicians must compete using their brains.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] We heard that you gave an uncommon name to  your dog.    [Ichikawa] I tell my wife and kids that you cannot keep an  animal unless you think of it as your child. Our dog is a  female Japanese midget Shiba. Since she looks obedient, I named  her "Naoko" [a name for girls that shares the morpheme "nao"  with the word "sunao" meaning "obedient"]. She has a good  personality, or shall I say "dog"-ality (laughter). Everything  should be treated with great affection.</p>

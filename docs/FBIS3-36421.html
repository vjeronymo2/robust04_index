			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rudkowski] </F>   [Text] Today is the last working day of the week for our  legislature, while the coming week will be a sort of holiday for  our people's deputies. At today's session, several deputies  delivered reports on miscellaneous issues. Belarusian Supreme  Soviet Chairman Myechyslaw Hryb told deputies about the course  of negotiations with Russian experts on the merger of the  Belarusian and Russian financial systems. Then, Myechyslaw Hryb  expressed his opinion on yesterday's increase in prices for  bread and baked goods. He said that the question of who had  adopted this decision is being clarified because the government  had earlier promised that there would be no price increases in  February.    [Begin Hryb recording] We are currently clarifying this  issue  along with the government. Why has the production of bread and  baked goods been cut and who is to blame? We will later discuss  this issue. In my opinion, we should control all prices. [end  recording]    Later, Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich took the floor and  said that the new prices for bread and baked goods will be  suspended and those guilty will be punished. Then, the  lawmakers continued to discuss draft laws. They discussed the  draft Supreme Soviet decree on limiting the state's foreign debt  and on the use of foreign credits. This issue is very  complicated, some financial violations and official abuses have  been discovered, therefore the decree should foresee that in the  future these negative tendencies be excluded. The deputies  decided to continue work on this document.    Later, the deputies introduced some amendments and  supplements to the law on investments in Belarus. Then, the  Supreme Soviet dismissed Minister of Justice Leonid Dashuk in  connection with his appointment to a new job.    I spoke with People's Deputy Gennadiy Lovitskiy, acting  chairman of the Belarusian Committee for State Security [KGB].    [Begin recording] [Rudkowski] Gennadiy Mikhaylovich, you had  to examine the resolution of the Republican Strike Committee  [BZK] on holding an indefinite political strike. What did you  learn?    [Lovitskiy] According to the Supreme Soviet decision, the  general prosecutor of Belarus has issued a warrant to  investigate this issue. The examination of the BZK resolution  from 26 January, adopted at a joint session of the leadership of  the BZK Council and its Executive Bureau is being conducted.  This resolution ends with the following words: All of you  should fight against this regime! The resolution is signed by  BZK Chairman Zimin. I want to remind everyone that this  examination is being performed legally, without any political  background, I am categorically against it; we will assess its  legality and take corresponding measures.    [Rudkowski] What will happen if the strike is held?    [Lovitskiy] If the strike is legal, it will be held.  Currently, there are different approaches to this issue. I do  not want to draw any conclusions, we require a legal  investigation of this document. [end recording]</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Cardiff Bay barrage THE government has taken over the bill to promote a Pounds 77m scheme for a barrage across Cardiff Bay after the project's opponents held up the passage of its final stages in the Commons yesterday. A group of MPs, most of them Labour, led by Mr Rhodri Morgan, Labour member for Cardiff West, have fought the private bill at every stage of its passage through parliament since it was introduced in 1988.</p>

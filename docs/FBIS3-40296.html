			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Bosnia-Herzegovina President Alija </F> Izetbegovic in Geneva by Mirko Munda; date not given: "Alija  Izetbegovic and the 200,000 Soldiers of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Army Were Not There Then"]    [Text] Last week one more round of negotiations on  the fate of Bosnia-Herzegovina ended in Switzerland. Once again  the negotiators did not make any progress. President of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency Alija Izetbegovic, when he gave  our newspaper an interview, also told us in Geneva, after the  very first day, on Tuesday evening, that he did not expect  anything special.    [Munda] Peace is the first and most sacred principle. Is it  possible to achieve it in Bosnia-Herzegovina? What are the basic  conditions under which you would consent to it, Mr. President?    [Izetbegovic] Our principle is not peace, but rather a fair  peace. After all these countless and unsuccessful negotiations,  I am no longer convinced that it will be possible to achieve it  at the negotiating table, at least not with the present balance  of power and not with the people who are now sitting at the  other side of the table, since they are the ones who launched  the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    We Muslims will probably have to prove for a while longer  that they cannot conquer us. Only when they realize that will  they be prepared to offer us a fair peace.    [Munda] And what should that offer include?    [Izetbegovic] The basic thing is preservation of the borders  of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the survival of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a  state. In the kind of form that is being proposed by the  emissaries of the European Union and the world organization,  Owen and Stoltenberg, i.e., as a union of three republics, which  of course is not even close to being a happy and good solution,  it is possible and it would be possible to accept it.    In that case the Serbs and Croats would have to leave the  areas that they have now occupied, and in which the Muslims were  the majority population before the war. The Muslim republic  would thus be a solid entity with access to the Sava in the  north and to the sea in the south. In the east and west, it  would be adjacent to the Drina River and the Una. That state  would be able to live and function.  <H5>  Saving What Can Still Be Saved </H5>   [Munda] Is that feasible? Are you still convinced that  Bosnia-Herzegovina can remain a unified state within the borders  that were recognized by the international community with the  three peoples living together in it, or have you already  reconciled yourself to the partition of your state?    [Izetbegovic] You obviously have doubts, as I sometimes do  myself. I can turn your question around, however. Is there any  other way? For the time being we do not see one. Can we drive  Mladic's army out of Bosnia-Herzegovina? According to our  estimates there are about 100,000 people in it, and they still  have 700-800 tanks and 2,000 cannons. During the war to date we  have already destroyed 300-400 of their tanks, and also some of  their personnel, but above all it is important that we have  crushed their morale. The morale of Mladic's soldiers is very  low, and technical superiority is all that their side still has.  The relationship between our army and theirs is an inverse one:  our people are highly motivated, their morale is high and is  still growing stronger, but they are too poorly armed. On the  other side, there are well-armed people with very low morale,  behind whom crimes of the worst sort stretch like a shadow.    [Munda] After all the crimes and inconceivable horrors, is  coexistence even still possible?    [Izetbegovic] When we talked about this, the following idea  arose: by partitioning the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina into  three republics, we would at least prevent the advance of the  occupying army, which is also spreading classic fascism,  actually a mixture of the worst in both fascism and Bolshevism.  And we are firmly convinced--and it is also confirmed by  history--that neither fascism nor Bolshevism can last forever,  and that they cannot survive either in peace or in war. Fascism  was defeated in war and in peace in Spain, and Bolshevism  collapsed on its own. One thus just has to have enough time and  patience and wait for them to end.    Let me be completely clear. We are convinced that neither  the  fascism on the Serbian side nor on the other one--I am thinking  of Boban's Croatian parastate in Bosnia-Herzegovina--can  survive. Our strategic concept is therefore to save what it is  possible to save in Bosnia-Herzegovina, to establish a  democratic system, to rebuild "our" part of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  and then, through the reputation of our political model, to  defeat the fascism of the left and the right. Of course, the  decisive factor in this is time, which means 20 to 30 years.    [Munda] Is it still possible to stop Karadzic, when he has  already announced publicly the merger of Serbian Bosnia with  Milosevic's Serbia? Boban is also obviously aiming at the same  thing, the annexation of his Herceg-Bosna to the Croatian state.    [Izetbegovic] The international community would not accept  anything like that. Milosevic will not become involved in  anything like that without our consent. It is not possible to  legalize that, just as it is not possible to enter something  stolen in an enterprise's ledgers, if I can make what is perhaps  not the best comparison. Karadzic consequently cannot break up  Bosnia-Herzegovina and secede without our consent, because we  are an internationally recognized state, and that recognition  only guarantees certain rights which cannot be simply ignored.    [Munda] Are you also convinced that Serbian President  Milosevic and Croatian President Tudjman already agreed on a  partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina years ago, when you and Kiro  Gligorov were still firmly advocating an asymmetric Yugoslavia,  or Yugoslavia as a confederation?    [Izetbegovic] I was convinced of that since day one. Only  blind people did not see what was already clear from day one. We  opposed it as much as we could. Thus, for instance, we neither  recognized that secret agreement or accepted it as a fact; we  acted outwardly as if that plan did not exist, and we organized  against it, because we of course knew about it.    A while ago Mr. Franjo Tudjman reminded me of 1939, when  Bosnia was partitioned by the Serbs and Croats, and he asked me  whether I was convinced that something like that was no longer  possible, saying "You know, it is a real danger." Although I am  usually a tactician, that time I answered him undiplomatically:  "You know, Alija Izetbegovic and the 200,000 soldiers of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina army were not around then."    [Munda] Then you statesmen also speak in that undiplomatic  language....    [Izetbegovic] I do have calm nerves, I know how to control  myself and be a tactician, but during that conversation Franjo  Tudjman reminded me of something that always upsets and affects  me. He should not have brought up certain historical disgraces,  the fragmentation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, when Cvetkovic and  Macek agreed that they would divide up Bosnia according to the  majority principle: wherever there are more Serbs should belong  to Serbia, and wherever there are more Croats should belong to  Croatia. When one of them asked what would happen where the  Muslims were in the majority, the other one answered, "We will  act as if there are no Muslims."  <H5>  The HVO Conducted the Most Brutal Ethnic Cleansing </H5>   [Munda] What is actually happening in central Bosnia? Are  the  intensified battles in that section perhaps the result of an  assessment that the Croats are militarily more vulnerable than  the Serbs? Are you attacking there, or defending yourselves?    [Izetbegovic] Don't forget that every action by our army in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is legal, as long as it is in accordance with  the laws and no crime is involved. That is all that it is not  permitted in its own state. The Bosnia-Herzegovina army is  acting there against the rebel HVO [Croatian Defense Council],  which tried to establish a Croatian parastate. Furthermore, the  broader public does not know that the HVO, where it had power  and superiority, i.e., in central Bosnia and Herzegovina,  conducted the most brutal ethnic cleansing. Thus, for instance,  it "cleansed" Mostar, and it did the same thing in the  traditional Muslim center Stolac and in central Bosnia. There  are no more Muslims in Vitez, even though they were about 50  percent of the population previously. They are also no longer in  Busovaca. The HVO consequently not only acted legally, since it  is a paramilitary force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also  criminally. The Bosnia-Herzegovina army's actions there are  legal and legitimate; our army cannot be a conquering one, but  only a liberating one.    [Munda] Are you seriously disappointed in the world  community, which seems to have completely turned its back on you  and is indifferently watching the slaughter in your state?    [Izetbegovic] I think that all well-intentioned people in  this world are disappointed or at least richer by an extremely  bitter experience. Perhaps in the beginning we Muslims really  were badly mistaken, since we were convinced that the world  community would help us, especially since it kept adopting  promising declarations and resolutions and constantly citing  documents on human rights. One day we had to rid ourselves of  these illusions, and we did.    Bosnia is a model example of what the international  community  seriously intends to do and of where it does not go beyond  declarations. Bosnia is a sort of test, not only of good will  but also of the world's seriousness and moral strength. Many of  Europe's values lie under the rubble in Bosnia. What Europe  represented for the world community has also been destroyed.    After all of these bitter experiences and disappointments,  we  can also wonder whether Europe really is what we thought it was,  and as we imagined it--a symbol of progress, peacefulness, and  human rights. Let me remind you that in this century alone this  continent of ours has "given birth" to great evil twice: fascism  and Bolshevism. Europe really is the French Revolution, it  really is the declaration on human rights, but it is also Hitler  and Stalin, with purges and concentration camps, gas chambers.  Europe has borne within itself a great deal of evil, which we  Europeans do not like to remember.    [Munda] Wouldn't another possible explanation be that you  Bosnian Muslims are the victims because Europe supposedly did  not want to have an Islamic state within its bosom? Furthermore,  Islam, possibly because of Iran and Iraq, represents something  negative in the eyes of the public....    [Izetbegovic] I think that it primarily has to do with  passivity and indecisiveness, since that is primary in human  nature. For instance, if Milosevic invites Europe and all of the  West not to do anything and to take care of their own economy  and profit instead, and we cry out to them and ask them to send  their people here to help us, if citizens of the West are dying  here, of course they listen to Milosevic first and more.    If a Muslim republic would really be disruptive, one has to  ask why the West was also indifferent when the Serbs destroyed  Vukovar and fired on Dubrovnik. Believe me, Europe does not see  Serbia as a bulwark against Islam, as one hears from that  country. It is quite clear to the vast majority that it is a  question of Serbia's policy of naked conquest, although I am not  ruling out a completely different possibility, namely that a  certain number of states are really secretly counting on  something like what you hinted at in your question.    I can proudly tell you that my people behave in a much more  European manner than some big Europeans. They have destroyed and  are destroying our mosques, bridges, and libraries, but such  buildings and institutions are sacred to us, and we would never  touch them.  <H3>  "The Weapons That Janez Jansa `Discovered' in Maribor Are  Ours" </H3>   [Munda] People who are not familiar with the background in  which diplomacy usually operates are convinced that everyone has  turned his back on you except for the Muslim countries. What  about Slovenia?    [Izetbegovic] Slovenia is proof that it is not true.  Slovenia  is not big and it is also not a strong state, but from the very  beginning it has given us political and moral support.  Furthermore, it has received almost 70,000 of our people. The  position of our refugees in Slovenia is considerably better than  in Croatia. In our country we speak with great respect about  Slovenia, which, even though it has just left Yugoslavia itself,  has managed to help us.    [Munda] You are speaking very nicely and pleasantly about my  young state. It seems that a shadow has just fallen between  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Slovenia, however. What I have in mind is  the scandal you know of at the Maribor airport, when 120 tons of  what were obviously your weapons were discovered, and you also  had to speak up in defense of one of your citizens, with the  statement that from the beginning the suspect Hasan Cengic was  an authorized representative of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Izetbegovic] Hasan Cengic was an employee of ours, an  authorized representative of the Bosnia-Herzegovina government.  Bosnia-Herzegovina was attacked, and we had to defend ourselves  and arm ourselves. We could only obtain weapons from abroad.  When Croatia closed the roads to us, we only had Slovenia left.  The weapons that Janez Jansa "discovered" in Maribor are ours;  we bought them in a certain other country and were bringing them  to Bosnia through Slovenia. That is the truth, and nothing else.  Hasan Cengic was not any sort of private arms dealer, but rather  our representative for those affairs, not just in Slovenia but  also in several countries.    [Munda] Why was it done so surreptitiously?    [Izetbegovic] Because an embargo was imposed on importing  weapons into our country. It is paradoxical that the  international community recognized the sovereign state of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and also recognized that we are a victim of  aggression, but at the same time did not allow us and is not  allowing us to be able to defend ourselves, even though we have  a right to do so even under the Charter of the UN, of which we  are a member. Every state has the right to defend itself in two  ways, but we were not defended by other states, nor did we  supposedly have the right to self-defense.    The fruit of that policy on the part of the international  community is a devastated and to a considerable extent occupied  country, and a refugee population, because at the beginning of  the war we did not have weapons and we did not have anything to  defend ourselves with. That is why we had to fend for ourselves  and open up some other channels in spite of the embargo. Thank  God, we succeeded, since otherwise we would have been literally  trampled.    We saved and are still defending what is certainly not a  large, but nevertheless significant part of our state's  territory: the valleys of the Bosna and Neretva Rivers, along  the Drina Gorazde, Zepa, and Srebrenica, Krajina in the west,  Sarajevo has already been defending itself for 20 months, and so  on. That is all thanks to weapons brought from elsewhere, since  one cannot defend oneself against tanks and artillery with bare  hands.    [Munda] And how will you survive if Serbia and Croatia  completely close you off?    [Izetbegovic] Our people have shown extraordinary vitality  and the ability to defend themselves. For some time Serbia and  Croatia will still surround us; they are surrounding us now and  furthermore are still attacking. But we have survived, and we  are still holding on.    [Munda] In the eyes of the public you are--forgive me if I  am  also a bit provocative--a sort of symbol of the defeated  Bosnia-Herzegovina, but Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic seems to  represent something new and uncompromising.    [Izetbegovic] I only know that Haris Silajdzic is younger  and  more handsome than I am.    [Munda] Sooner or later you will see peace. What is your  view  of the future and the rebuilding of Bosnia, Mr. President?    [Izetbegovic] Even if the Western countries have not helped  us to defend ourselves, I am convinced that they will help us in  rebuilding our country. Perhaps in that way they will somehow  ease their consciences; and I am completely convinced that the  Muslim countries will help us. A people that has been hardened  in war, "purged," and has passed life's test, will quite  certainly cope in peacetime. After these wartime experiences, I  am not afraid of the future.</p>

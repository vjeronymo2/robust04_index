			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Karpenko: "The Future of Privatization in </F> the Estimation of American and Native Experts"]    [Text] U.S. Experts evaluate the situation which has taken  shape following the parliamentary elections in Russia far more  pessimistically than our reformer democrats. Leading specialists  of the American Heritage Foundation, Jeffrey Gainer, Kim Holmes,  and John Robson, see the reform course corrections as a real  threat for the revival of the command-administrative system,  which could bring Russia to the brink of economic catastrophe.  Despite a certain difference in approach, the Americans draw one  common conclusion: It was not the "shock therapy" and "wholesale  privatization" which brought the reformers to economic crisis  but, on the contrary, the all-too-slow reform development caused  the failures and setbacks in both economy and policy.    "Yeltsin's economic  policy appears radical," John Guardiano,  Heritage Foundation policy analyst, maintains, "but in reality  it is quite moderate. Far from being `shock therapy,' it  destroyed the old economic system without having created any new  one in exchange." The expert offers his harsh prescription: "To  go much further than the relatively timid Yeltsin policy of  price liberalization and privatization. This essentially means  destruction of the monopoly system of industrial sectors  subordinate to the state, the establishment of `iron' laws, and  the creation of a system for social protection of the people who  have lost their jobs."    In Yegor Gaydar's opinion, Russian reform and privatization  could not have been of a different character: The reformers were  faced with abandoning the reforms altogether or accepting the  compromises that were imposed by the Supreme Soviet. Only by  agreeing to the imposed rules of the game did they acquire an  opportunity, albeit in distorted, crude form, to undertake the  "standard, mass circulation" of private property. Three of the  four main tasks--internal liberalization of the economy and its  openness to the outside and privatization--were accomplished at  the first stage of the reform. Just one of the set  tasks--financial stability--was not accomplished. "Public" check  privatization is now being completed, private property and the  stock market have become a reality, and it is possible to embark  on the next stage--the restructuring of enterprises and sectors.    At the new stage, Gaydar believes, it is necessary to switch  from universal to individual methods of privatization and from  the distribution of property free of charge to its sale. The  general political task is to create a strong social stratum of  property owners and market mechanisms ensuring the impossibility  of the revenge of the administrative-command system. The  "romanticism of a return" to a communist regime is a forlorn  hope, for that matter--even at the state-owned enterprises today  not one director wants a return to the State Planning Committee  and the party district committees, which would once again  command them and, as earlier, "set the wages of his secretary."  Only rightwing extremism and "radical nationalism," which could  incite a mass protest with dangerous consequences, might  represent a real threat today. This problem, however, as Yegor  Timurovich joked, "has no solution within the framework of the  privatization procedure." Only economic growth, the surmounting  of the sharp differentiation in income, and legality and law and  order in the state could be effective weapons here. Then there  would be a real chance of "private property not being bulldozed  one more time."    More specific tasks at the next stage of privatization were  outlined by Dmitriy Vasilyev, deputy chairman of the State  Property Committee. By July we need to have completed check  privatization, and not simply to have "collected" the vouchers  from the public, what is more, but to have sold as large a  proportion of state property as possible--only the substantial  weight of the private sector can "really make Russia a bourgeois  country." The enlistment in the privatization process of land  and nonresidential property--this is the basis of small- and  medium-sized business, without which, essentially, there is no  market--will be of immense significance at the next stage.    Petr Filippov, leader of the president's analytical office,  set forth at the conference his view of the mechanism for  surmounting such monopolism, proposing, specifically, the  introduction of a progressive payroll tax prompting the breakup  of economic structures into small units. Government tax policy  in relation to small business and enterprise today is just about  the main reason why they are being wound up.    The question of investment policy, the attraction of foreign  investors included, was raised repeatedly at the international  conference devoted to problems of privatization in Russia. The  opinion of the American expert John Robson is eloquent in this  respect: "Money is cowardly, it goes only where there is  political stability, a prospect of economic growth, and real  hopes of a multiplication of capital."</p>

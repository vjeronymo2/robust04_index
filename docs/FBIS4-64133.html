			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 27 TASS -- Sergey Shakhray on Friday said  his resignation as vice-premier is no longer on the agenda. "The  president did not accept my resignation and I found it incorrect  to insist further," he said in an interview with ITAR-TASS.  Shakhray added that republics and other regions within the  Russian Federation had sent many appeals to the president not to  accept his resignation.    Shakhray said he discussed with President Yeltsin different  aspects of the regional policy, including the signing of the  agreement with Kaliningrad, the regulation of relations with the  Chechen Republic and a mechanism implementing the treaty with  Tatarstan.    Explaining his recent moves, including the announcement of  his resignation, Shakhray referred to the breach of office  ethics in dismissing him from the post of the minister of  nationalities and regional policy. According to Shakhray, "it  is not ethical to work on the president's team and announce  one's disagreement with things. I do not want to repeat the  behavior of some politicians". These were the motives behind  his announced resignation.    As concerns his relations with the newly appointed Minister  Nikolay Yegorov, Shakhray said he would "help the new minister  of nationalities and regional policy. I wished him well when  introducing the man to the ministry collective. Now everything  will depend on himself".</p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / International Company News: Philips launches cost-cutting drive PHILIPS, the electrical and electronics group, has launched a worldwide cost-cutting drive aimed at saving 'hundreds of millions of guilders' during the remaining four months of the year, Reuter reports from Amsterdam. The company declined to specify the precise amount it intends to save, but said it was likely to be less than one billion guilders. 'It is a general cost-cutting exercise that will take place in all divisions all over the world,' said Mr Eef Brouwers, a Philips spokesman. Philips acknowledged that the fresh cost-cutting drive, which comes on top of a restructuring launched in 1990, was prompted by the depressed state of many of its markets, particularly consumer electronics from which the company derived almost half its revenue. 'Economic forecasts are also not so good in many countries that are important for our business. And there are no signs of a short-term improvement,' said Mr Brouwers. Since 1990, the group has tried to change its bureaucratic corporate culture, improve productivity and revitalise its businesses through a group-wide restructuring programme known as Operation Centurion. Last year, the company disposed of non-core businesses which represented Fl 2.2bn (Dollars 1.39bn) in annual sales and involved 10,000 employees. The exercise led to provisions totalling Fl 73m. However, Mr Brouwers said the latest cost-cutting exercise would not involve lay-offs or financial write-offs that might negatively affect the group's results in the current year. Philips, which has been struggling to recover from big losses in 1990, last month reported a fall in second-quarter net profit to Fl 82m from Fl 187m a year ago. The company has warned that net profit for the current year will be below the level of 1991.</p>

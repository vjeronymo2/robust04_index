			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: When the Central Statistical Office published its estimate of the UK's third-quarter gross domestic product, it indicated a slowdown in the manufacturing sector, with the service sector showing faster growth. Today's figures are expected to reveal that manufacturing output rose by 0.5 per cent in September. But after the fall in August, that means third-quarter growth will only be about 0.5 per cent. Consumer credit figures for September will also be published today, in both the UK and the US, with the UK figure expected to drop to Pounds 485m, from August's record figure of Pounds 632m. Wednesday: The UK's world trade figures for August are expected to show a continuation in the recent improvement, with the deficit falling to Pounds 600m, from July's Pounds 704m. Thursday: The Bundesbank council meets for its routine fortnightly review of monetary tactics. Interest rate cuts remain on the agenda, just. President Hans Tietmeyer said on Friday that the bank needed a clearer overview before it could tell if its rates were still appropriate - and he added a warning to the effect that they could go up as well as down.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Zyanon Paznyak, leader of the Belarusian </F> Popular Movement, by unidentified correspondent; place and date  not given]    [Text] [Correspondent] Clinton's visit to Belarus has some  peculiarities, one of which is the controversial refusal of  Zyanon Paznyak, leader of the Belarusian Popular Movement [BNF],  to accept an invitation by the U.S. Ambassador in Belarus David  Swartz, to meet with the American President at his residence.  The BNF leader thinks that the U.S. Embassy invited to the  meeting organizations that are against Belarusian independence  and oppose the BNF rather than the Supreme Soviet or the Kebich  government. We made a phone call to Mr. Paznyak and asked him  to explain what actually happened at the Embassy and what would  be the BNF's next moves.    [Paznyak] Well, I was presented to members of the National  Accord Party and former party hacks who once opposed the  referendum and the Popular Movement. A very strange lot of  people. This is why I thought that I was put in an awkward  position here. What kind of opposition would this be? So I  expressed my doubts as to the relevance of my participation at  that meeting, which, I heard, even spilled over to the press  pages. However, Embassy officials have again brought me the  invitation today. I think that the Embassy's mistake is one  thing, but it is a completely different thing that I should  attend that meeting out of respect for President Clinton and the  United States. This is why I certainly will go there. And I  would like to assure everyone that I am not going to make any  controversial statements there. Since President Clinton offers  such an opportunity, I will be glad to accept it.    [Correspondent] And there will be no face-to-face meeting of  Paznyak and Clinton?    [Paznyak] No. After all, this may not be so important  because the meeting will take place in Kuropaty [burial place of  victims killed by the Soviet security police in the 1930's].  But in Kuropaty we will talk about Kuropaty, of course.    [Correspondent] What questions is the opposition going to  bring up during this meeting?    [Paznyak] This will be a short, 15-minute meeting. So  considering the presence of many political party activists, I  don't think any serious questions will be raised. I think that  the conversation will touch upon the delayed democratic  processes in Belarus, and on assistance from a democratic state  such as the United States for those processes. This is going to  be the main issue. I consider it a crucial fact that President  Clinton is going to visit Belarus, seeing it as an independent  state. This proves that Belarus managed to attract the  attention of the United States.</p>

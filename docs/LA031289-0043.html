			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BENNETT THE DRUG CZAR'  </P> <P> Bennett's statements that he would advocate suspending our constitutional  rights are the natural progression of an ever-more fascistic approach by our  government to the drug problem.  </P> <P> Elected officials are playing on people's legitimate fears about the horrible  crimes associated with drug gangs and dealers. They are advocating increased  police force against the problem because that is an easy and immediate thing to  do. However, the cure these officials are advocating could be more untenable  than the disease.  </P> <P> People seem to forget that there is a demand side to the drug problem. There  are millions of regular users of marijuana, cocaine, and other drugs. Most of  these drug users are not violent people. They are escapists and pleasure  seekers, just like the guy at the local bar downing beer after beer.  </P> <P> Until the drug users in this country can be somehow persuaded to give up their  habit, there will continue to be a booming drug market and low-life  entrepreneurs cruelly competing for business in this illegal arena.  </P> <P> If you want someone to blame for our drug problem, look at your friends at  parties who are smoking a joint or sniffing cocaine. These are the people who  ultimately will be responsible for you having to dump out the contents of your  luggage for inspection, or you having to take a drug test to get a job. Or, as  Bennett would have it, for being stopped and searched on the street without a  warrant by a military policeman.  </P> <P> As someone who does not use drugs, I am alarmed that my civil liberties and  those of my friends may be endangered by a government blindly charging ahead in  a misguided war on drugs.  </P> <P> Before unwarranted force against civilians is unleashed, the true root cause of  the problem -- a great number of people anesthetizing themselves against  reality -- should be faced and dealt with.  </P> <P> All the dogs, barbed wire and guns in the world are not going to prevent the  transaction between junkie and dealer if both feel they have something to gain  from the experience.  </P> <P> LAURA BROWN  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

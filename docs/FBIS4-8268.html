			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 10 (CTK) -- Defense Minister Antonin  Baudys announced on NOVA TV today that had completed a list of  former army "political officers" who, on the basis of a December  1989 order by then Czechoslovak Defense Minister Miroslav Vacek,  were "dispersed and camouflaged by a wide variety of methods"  throughout the army. The list took six months to compile,  Baudys said.    "A range of personnel measures are only now before us," he  said, adding that 1994 would be the most significant year for  the transformation of the armed forces. Units are finally being  reorganized, at last creating "the right situation" for  replacing some officers, he added.    Baudys also said the army was prepared to launch a  recruiting  campaign in search of leaders at the company and platoon level  for drilling soldiers and strengthening discipline, especially  in the handling of weapons.</p>

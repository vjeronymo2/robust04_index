			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO PUTS HURT ON CRAWFORD  </P> <P> Before Tuesday's boys' basketball game against Crawford High, San Diego Coach  Dennis Kane assessed his team's injuries.  </P> <P> Junior forward Clark James (6-feet 4-inches) is scheduled for a root canal this  morning, compliments of an elbow that knocked his front tooth loose Friday in  San Diego's game against St. Augustine.  </P> <P> Junior forward Raynard Wells (6-3) is recovering from the flu.  </P> <P> Senior center Milton Miller (6-6) has a sore foot.  </P> <P> Against Crawford, James responded with 22 points, including 14 of 14 free  throws, and grabbed 11 rebounds. Wells added 21 points and 6 rebounds. Miller  had 15 points and 4 rebounds.  </P> <P> They led San Diego to a 77-59 victory over rival Crawford, giving the Cavers  (12-3, 3-1) sole possession of second place in the City Central League. Lincoln  (19-1, 4-0) defeated Christian Tuesday to remain in first. Crawford fell to  12-6, 2-2.  </P> <P> In the first quarter, Crawford scored the first 6 points and the last 6, and  with the score 15-8, it looked as if Crawford would run away. The Cavers did  not score until 4 minutes 38 into the game on a Miller layup from a Jerome  Young assist. Its next two points were James' free throws after a technical  foul was called on Crawford Coach John King.  </P> <P> But a check of the first-quarter statistics showed a trend that would continue  throughout the game and ultimately decide it. Crawford made only 5 of 10 free  throws, and San Diego hit 6 of 6. For the game, San Diego made 24 of 29 (83%),  Crawford just 12 of 28 (43%).  </P> <P> In the second quarter, the home team took over. San Diego scored the first 17  points and outscored the Colts, 22-2, going from a 7-point deficit to a  13-point lead at the half. While San Diego made 6 field goals, including a  3-pointer by Wells, and 9 of 12 free throws, Crawford managed only 2 free  throws by Chris Johnson (23 points, 9 rebounds).  </P> <P> "We certainly didn't do anything to resemble an offense in the second quarter,"  King said. "But I didn't think we were out of the game by any means."  </P> <P> The third quarter was basically even (20-18, San Diego) and the Cavers led,  50-35. But in the fourth quarter, Crawford got hot (making a 13-4 run), things  got tight and tensions erupted into a scuffle between San Diego's J.R. Greer  and Crawford's Marc Carter.  </P> <P> Greer and Carter were given technicals and ejected for fighting, and both  coaches were given technicals because their players left the bench.  </P> <P> After Johnson made 3 of 4 technical shots, Crawford trailed, 54-48. But James,  who had made his first 10 free throws in the first half, made all 4. San Diego  then outscored Crawford, 19-11, during the final 4:17.  </P></p>

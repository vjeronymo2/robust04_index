			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (2): A double-edged sword - The Bank of Spain THE story about the meeting between Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, Spain's finance minister, and Prof Luis Angel Rojo, Governor of the Bank of Spain, late in the afternoon on May 12, says a lot for the de facto independence of the Spanish central bank. Three weeks ahead of a general election, the men had met in the prime ministerial compound outside Madrid to discuss the collapse of the government's four-year effort to hold the peseta among the leading currencies of the European Monetary System. The next day, they would have to devalue. The Bank of Spain is not yet officially independent so it was up to Mr Solchaga to tell the prime minister the bad news. The decision was taken quickly, whereupon Prof Rojo is understood to have said the Bank would be prepared to accompany the devaluation with an sharp interest rate cut. 'That,' Mr Gonzalez is reported to have replied, 'is entirely up to you.' The peseta was devalued 8 per cent in the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS the next day and the Bank of Spain cut its benchmark intervention rate by 150 basis points to 11.5 per cent. Three weeks later, his political luck having, incredibly, survived, Mr Gonzalez was re-elected. Parliament was already discussing draft legislation to make the Bank of Spain independent of the Finance Ministry when Mr Gonzalez called an early election. The draft law was withdrawn and, later, Mr Gonzalez lost his overall majority in parliament, making the main parties in the country's leading autonomous regions, Catalonia and the Basque Country, power brokers in the new parliament. It seems likely, then, that while a new coalition or minority government headed by Mr Gonzalez will try to revive the Bank of Spain statute as rapidly as possible, it may have to be rewritten. The main opposition, the conservative Peoples Party (PP), had already made its position clear before the election campaign; that it was unhappy with the way the independence statute automatically appointed the present governor and deputy governor to the same jobs in an independent bank. The PP did not have much against Prof Rojo but made clear it wanted some consultation to take place over the appointment of the people who run the new bank. Most importantly, though, Mr Gonzalez may come under pressure to allow regional representation on the board of the independent bank; something not provided for in the pre-election draft law but which the regions want - and have the political muscle to achieve. Regional representation on the central bank board could take many forms  - permanent Catalan and Basque seats, perhaps, with two or three others rotating. At present, the Bank is captive to the Finance Ministry and Treasury on exchange rate policy and, in theory although less and less in practice, on interest rates. Once control over the peseta passes to the Bank, with the regions represented, the fight to narrow stark economic differences between rich regions such as Catalonia and poor ones such as Extremadura could come to play a very strong role in Bank decision-making. Independence is, anyway, a double-edged sword. Prof Rojo sometimes wonders whether the way EC governments are approaching central bank independence may not be just a little lacking in courage. Central bankers like himself may soon find themselves not only the masters of their exchange rates but also responsible for the fights their countries are waging against inflation. In theory, inflation would have to have been beaten in order for European Monetary Union to occur in the first place but the statute drawn up for the Spanish Bank, possibly because it is broadly modelled on the Bundesbank, places a considerable anti-inflationary burden on its shoulders. The problem with this is that in Germany the Bundesbank is much aided by the fact that it was established long ago in the public consciousness that inflation is a bad thing. This is not the case with Spain, where such a consensus does not exist and where Mr Gonzalez' governments for the past 11 years have failed to make any effort to tell people about the evils of inflation for fear of bursting the growth-and-spending bubble which Spaniards have lived and voted in for so long. The next few months will be an interesting illustration of how Spain works as the new government - still to be formed at the time of writing - goes about redrafting a statute of independence for the Bank. Mr Solchaga had always wanted to rush a statute through parliament because he maintained that doing it in a coalition government - which he correctly predicted 18 months ago would be the result of the June 6 election - would be difficult. He is not likely to be in the next cabinet and the problem will be his successor's. The previous government had promised to have the law in place during 1994 so there is not much time left. Prof Rojo, in the meantime, can relax. He has more freedom than most of his counterparts and the hard part has not yet been thrust on his shoulders.</p>

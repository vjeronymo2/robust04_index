			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirko Sajler: "The Serbs Are Preparing To Conquer </F> Bosnian Posavina"]    [Text] Osijek -- Vice president of the Croatian People's  Party and member of parliament Ivica Vrkic has sent another open  letter to Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Mate Granic  warning him of possible new "war games" of the Bosnian Serbs,  and plans in connection with Croatian territories. Vrkic's  claims are at the same time interesting and frightening.  Precisely because things might well turn out the way Vrkic  predicts, we carry the letter in full:    ``Mr. Granic!    ``Prompted by the latest events around Gorazde, and in the  interest of protecting the Croatian state interests, I propose  that your government draft and submit to the UN Security Council  a proposal suggesting the passing of a special decision --  resolution -- that would expand the area of protected zones in  Bosnia-Herzegovina to include Bosnian Posavina, or more  precisely, the free enclave around Orasje.    ``It is more than obvious that the Serbs intend to expand  their corridor in Bosnian Posavina militarily (their generals  discuss this openly) and are bringing in large quantities of  heavy arms in order to carry out preparations for the final  conquest of all of Posavina. This game includes sporadic attacks  on Zupanja and the region along the Sava River on the Croatian  side, aimed at provoking the Croatian Army, which would give the  Serbs an alibi for the final assault on the free territory of  Posavina.    ``Our government's proposal, together with one  simultaneously  submitted to the UN Security Council by the Bosnian Government,  would reveal the goal of the Bosnian Serbs in time. If the  Security Council were to accept the initiative proclaiming a  protected zone around Bosnian Posavina (the enclave of Orasje),  this would prevent the Serbs from carrying out their plans and  conquering Posavina until the Security Council, the European  Union, the United States, and Russia agree on how to protect  Croatia and the Bosniaks from the Serbian onslaught.    ``The loss of Posavina would not only mean the loss of  territory populated by Croats, it would also be free territory  through which the Serbs could unite Serbs in the occupied  Croatian and Bosnian areas with Serbia. The loss would moreover  result in a new wave of refugees in Croatia, which is further  reason for alerting the relevant factors in international  politics,'' reads Ivica Vrkic's letter addressed to Mate Granic.</p>

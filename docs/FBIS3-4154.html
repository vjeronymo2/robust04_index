			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Yong: "Canadians Seek To Bolster </F> Trade"]    [Text] A high-level Canadian Government delegation will  arrive in China on Sunday looking for a bigger share of China's  lucrative market.    The mission, which includes about 30 business people, is led  by Canadian Minister for International Trade Roy MacLaren.    The entrepreneurs represent such industries as  telecommunications, power generation and aerospace.    MacLaren is the first Canadian cabinet minister to visit  China since the Liberal Party assumed power.    "Asia-Pacific is the most dynamic region in the world today,  with average annual growth rates between 6 and 9 percent," the  minister said before he left for China.    After leaving China on Thursday, MacLaren will visit South  Korea and Japan.    "China, South Korea and Japan are among Canada's top six  trading partners, together accounting for $20.3 billion worth of  trade with Canada," he said. "Increasing trade and investment  with these countries is of vital importance to economic growth  and job creation in Canada."    Canada's Power Corp and two other companies have joined  hands  to set up a special $1 billion fund for power projects in China.    Canada has also pledged to provide China with close to $2  billion worth of loans, at favourable terms, for its postal  service, telecommunications hydraulic power stations,  petrochemicals, paper-making and urban construction.    By September 1993, Canada had promised to invest $1.4  billion  in 1,321 projects in China. But the actual amount spent was  only $177 million.    China's actual investment in Canada amounted to $400 million  by the end of last year.    Sui Hui, an official in the Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation (Moftec), said MacLaren's visit will send  bilateral trade and investment to new highs.    On his visit, MacLaren will confer with Moftec Minister Wu  Yi.    Wu has expressed hopes that Canada could increase its  investment in China, which is attracting more capital from many  other countries and regions.    Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju has noted that the city approves an  average of two foreign-funded projects per day, but so far only  one Canadian company has invested in the city.    Bruised by competition from other international  corporations,  Canada's Northern Telecom, which has sales of $300 million in  China, is negotiating for a joint venture with a Chinese partner  in Guangdong Province. But the details weren't available.    The Quorum Co, which helps finance smaller Canadian  enterprises that want to enter China's hi-tech markets, is  scheduled to open investment forums in Beijing, Shanghai and  Guangzhou in the summer .    Sui Hui, the Moftec official, said Canada is China's 13th  largest trading partner, with $2.57 billion in bilateral trade  in 1993.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREE ENTERPRISE AND SUBSIDIES DON'T MIX  </P> <P> James Flanigan's ("Pro Sports Wins Big With Taxpayer Assist," March 18) brought  to mind a thought that I have harbored for years: Why are non-leftists so  innocent in their use of language.  </P> <P> For example, as an advocate of individual initiative, why not use "freedom of  enterprise" instead of "free enterprise?" To a large part of the public, free  enterprise connotes a vague concept, something gratis, bestowed by government  on rich people.  </P> <P> It does not come across as one of the freedoms, like speech, religion, press,  etc.  </P> <P> As for Al Davis of the Raiders, he is negotiating for a government grant for a  private business monopoly, which partakes of the mind-set of mercantilism. It  may be private enterprise, but in no way is it freedom of enterprise. His  business mentality is closer to Sir Francis Drake and other  government-sponsored freebooters than to Henry Ford or Steve Jobs.  </P> <P> "Taxpayer-subsidized free enterprise" is an oxymoron.  </P> <P> ALBERT J.

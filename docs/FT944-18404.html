			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Hoverspeed refit to suspend all Channel services Hoverspeed, which operates cross-Channel passenger services, yesterday announced plans for a refit of its entire hovercraft and catamaran fleet, leading to the loss of up to 50 out of 410 jobs. The decision to carry out the simultaneous refurbishment of all three of its craft will completely shut down its ferry operations in January and close the Folkestone to Boulogne service for the first three months of the year. The company said this move was timed to coincide with the quietest period in the year for ferry operators. Hoverspeed normally staggers refurbishments to ensure that at least one craft is in service, but while the entire fleet is out of service the craft will have a full-scale refit, the company said. Hoverspeed plans a complete Pounds 2m refurbishment of the interiors of its two 25-year-old hovercraft, the Princess Anne and the Princess Margaret, as well as a refit of their mechanical parts. At the same time it will upgrade its high-speed SeaCat catamaran. The SeaCat, which normally plies between Folkestone and Boulogne, will resume operations between Dover and Calais in February. The hovercraft will return to service at the end of March. Hoverspeed said most of the redundancies would be on the continental side of the Channel and that staff would be re-employed when services resume. The company denied that the refit is related to the start of Channel tunnel passenger services, but it runs the only service that can match the tunnel for speed. The tunnel launched a limited car passenger shuttle service yesterday and expects to be operating at close to full capacity by next spring. The British government might not have 'met its commitments' towards the tunnel, the project's former co-chairman claimed last night. Hesitations about the building of the high-speed rail link between Folkestone and London were 'deeply to be deplored', said Mr Andre Benard, co-chairman of Eurotunnel until earlier this year, contrasting the British and French approaches. Speaking at a Chartered Institute of Transport lecture in London, Mr Benard said that although there was no commitment from the British government to build the link, 'there was a clear commitment that the railways would provide all the required capacity. 'In that respect, we have very serious doubts that her majesty's government has met its commitments.' Private-sector consortia are bidding to build and run the Pounds 3bn link but it is unlikely to be in use before the year 2002. The French high-speed link is already in place and the Belgian one will be in service by 1997.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [English abstract of article by Hideo Sugai and Masashi </F> Yamage, Department of Electrical Engineering, Nagoya University]    [Text] Plasma-assisted coating of boron thin films,  so-called ``boronization'', has been recently used in magnetic  confinement fusion devices. This technique is a very powerful  means to reduce contamination of a hot fusion plasma by oxygen  and metal impurities released from vessels. On a technical side,  however, some difficulties remain:    1) the use of highly toxic and explosive gas diborane  (B[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]6[/]) requires considerable efforts for  safe handling;    2) boron films are not uniformly coated because of extremely  large devices;    3) removal of degraded boron films is necessary after  long-term use.    In this paper, we present new methods of boronization  developed in a small-scale laboratory experiment. First of all,  we have proposed the use of a much less hazardous boride,  decaborane (B[.sub]10[/]H[.sub]14[/] 99.7C mp,  213C bp)[.sup]1,2[/] and the technique has been  successfully applied to the JT-60U, one of the largest three  fusion devices in the world. A hydrogen atom content in boron  thin films was measured by [.sup]15[/]N resonant nuclear  reaction and the analysis revealed a rapid decrease in the H  content with increasing deposition temperature (150-300C).    Secondly, a scaling law for nonuniformity of boron film  deposition has been investigated with a pressure and a discharge  current as parameters. The measured dependence of the e-folding  length for the nonuniformity agreed with a prediction in a  one-dimensional fluid model for plasma chemical vapor deposition  (CVD).    Thirdly, boron thin films were deposited by thermal  decomposition (pyrolysis) of decaborane in the absence of a glow  plasma. High deposition rates on a hot wall ( 350C) were  obtained with the activation energy of 39 kcal/mol.    Finally, we proposed in situ boronization by injecting a  decaborane pellet into a hot fusion plasma. A small pellet of  solid decaborane can easily be fabricated by warming up and  pressing a decaborane crystal into a small hole.  References    1. M. Yamage, T. Ejima, H. Toyoda, and H. Sugai, J.

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Watchdog admits BNFL action THE POLLUTION Inspectorate confirmed yesterday that it told British Nuclear Fuels last month it could not start putting uranium into its Thorp plant at Sellafield to complete commissioning the Pounds 2.8bn plant. It denied that it had told BNFL that it could not start operation of the plant, which is intended to reprocess nuclear fuel. It said: 'The Thorp plant cannot start operation without an authorisation and no decision on authorisation will be taken until all the representations from the present eight-week public consultation period have been considered.' Earlier in the week, the director of the Thorp plant had expressed surprise at the delay in authorisation. Pending authorisation to start full operation, BNFL wants to put material in the plant to finish testing the monitoring systems.</p>

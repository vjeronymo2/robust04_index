			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With regard to the fluorescent ballast test procedure, Advance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transformer and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is presently no test procedure for electronic ballasts. (Advance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transformer, No. 25 at 2; National Electrical Manufacturers Association, No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 41 at 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department used the present test procedure for magnetic ballasts to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure the ballast efficacy factor of electronic ballasts. The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notes that the 60 hertz input power measurement and the light output  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurement are the same, regardless of the type of ballast (low or high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequency). The Department believes that the existing test procedure is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate to measure the ballast efficacy factor of electronic ballasts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three manufacturers provided energy savings estimates for various design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> options. Energy Advantage stated that 20 percent savings from electronic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ballasts, compared to energy-efficient magnetic ballasts, are possible. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, this energy savings can be accomplished with up to a 50 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase in lifetime. (Energy Advantage, No. 27 at 1). Magnetek said that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> losses for a two lamp F40 electronic ballast can be reduced from 5&hyph;6 watts to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about 3.5&hyph;4.5 watts, for a savings of 1.25&hyph;1.5 watts out of 56&hyph;58 watts, by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitution of an integrated circuit for discrete components. (Magnetek, No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 35 at 1). One other company, Valmont, provided energy savings tables for five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ballast product classes, their maximum technologically feasible efficiencies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the costs of achieving those efficiencies. (Valmont, No. 16 at 4&hyph;7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department used some of the above data in combination with data from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directories and other published data <FOOTCITE>36</FOOTCITE>  to determine energy savings for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various classes of fluorescent ballasts. (See Technical Support Document,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Volume B). The Department found that 10&hyph;15 percent energy savings from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronic ballasts, relative to energy-efficient magnetic ballasts, are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible. The Department developed data that indicated larger energy savings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are possible with electronic ballasts than were estimated by Valmont. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulted in higher maximum technologically feasible efficiencies for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ballast product classes than provided by Valmont. The Department used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incremental manufacturer costs that were specific to the energy efficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gains estimated for each ballast product class studied, and, therefore, did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not use the cost data provided by Valmont. A more detailed discussion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumptions and analysis used for this product class are provided in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Support Document. As for lifetimes of ballasts, the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumed the lifetime for an electronic ballast to be equal to that of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> magnetic ballast, since no experimental data were received or found to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differentiate their lifetimes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 36 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> R. Verderber, O. Morse, and F. Rubinstein, ``Performance of Electronic Ballast and Controls with 34 and 40 Watt F40 Fluorescent Lamps,''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , Vol. 25 No. 6, November 1989 and A. Loruss and K. Bowes,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Harmonic and Power Characteristics of Electronic Ballasts for Fluorescent Applications <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , Northeast Utilities Service Company, Lab Test, June 1990; Directory of Certified Fluorescent Lamp Ballasts and Certified Luminaire Manufacturers, CEC, March 4, 1991. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three manufacturers suggested that some combination of education and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls would be superior to standards in saving lighting energy use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advance Transformer contended that fluorescent ballasts do not belong in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rulemaking, and that improved education about lighting will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplish more than standards. (Advance Transformer, No. 25 at 1). Magnetek  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Certified Ballast Manufacturers both stated that controls, i.e., occupancy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sensors, light feedback, daylighting, and automatic timers, can save more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy than can more stringent ballast standards. (Magnetek, No. 35 at 1;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certified Ballast Manufacturers, No. 47 at 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

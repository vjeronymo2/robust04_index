			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Managers' training 'insufficient' MORE than 50 per cent of managers say they receive insufficient training, a survey published today by the Institute of Management says. The report, which the institute says is the most comprehensive to date, is based on a survey of training undergone by more than 2,000 managers. The institute undertook the research with the Economic and Social Research Council. Concern has been expressed recently by a number of organisations, including the Confederation of British Industry, about the quality and quantity of training for managers and supervisors in the UK. Un-favourable comparisons have been drawn with other countries such as Germany. The study concludes that training of managers should be directed at reaching national standards. The report, by Professor Peter Warr of the University of Sheffield, says 88 per cent of managers undertook some training in 1991, with an average of five days a year on work-time training and three days training during their own time, including home study. Many managers had little opportunity to train, the survey says. One third of the managers surveyed said their organisation did not have a formal training policy, and one in eight received no training in 1991. Managers were convinced of the business case for more training - 81 per cent said they would be more effective if they had had more training. The survey reinforces the belief of many involved in training, including the Training and Enterprise Councils, that government efforts to improve training should be directed at small companies. The survey shows that managers in companies employing fewer than 25 people were the least likely to have had training in work time and had the most negative attitudes to it. Training for Managers.

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Private View: A detective on the trail of life - A whizz-kid of the palaeobiological world, Conway Morris is a man who has a prehistoric surprise or two up his sleeve . . . Mankind's ancestor - or something very close to it - is lying quietly in a drawer in Simon Conway Morris's study. Pikaia is two inches long, scarcely more than a dark, minnow-shaped indentation in a flake of blue-grey shale. It does not look like much. But Conway Morris has spent 20 years studying this and other weird little sea creatures crushed in a Canadian mudslide some 525m years ago. To him Pikaia is clearly a primitive chordate, a precursor of the fish and, thus, of all vertebrates, including homo sapiens. Conway Morris is perhaps more sapiens than most of us. At 42 he is a lively, approachable and humorous sort of academic, with something of the scruffy, fossil-hunting schoolboy about him. But he is a whizz-kid of the palaeobiological world, one of a trio of Cambridge University scientists - the others were fellow graduate student Derek Briggs and their supervisor Harry Whittington - whose exploits were dramatised in Wonderful Life, a prize-winning science book by Stephen Jay Gould. According to Gould, the trio's revelations about the multiplicity of strange body-plans found in the Burgess Shale of the early Cambrian period - long, long before the dinosaurs - should shatter Man's last illusions about his special place in the universe. We have been in psychological retreat for several hundred years. First we were removed from the centre of the solar system, then we were exposed as parvenu animals, then we were relegated to an obscure corner of the cosmos. Now, argued Gould, it should be clear that we people are an extraordinary fluke, the lucky survivors of an evolutionary lottery. And if you re-ran the tape it would all turn out very differently indeed. Well, not quite. The hero of this palaeontological detective story disagrees profoundly with that kind of interpretation of his work. Would you say, I asked him, that evolution is in some sense progressive? 'Yes, I would. This is not something which is popular. Gould makes the fair point that we are one twig of an enormous tree of evolution, and in that way we are no more privileged than the millions of other planets which are meant to have life on them. Presumably on at least some of them something close to what we identify as consciousness has arisen. It would be strange if it hadn't' So Conway Morris is not surprised that animal consciousness and big brains emerged on earth. Indeed, he thinks that was indicated as far back as the Cambrian when neural tissue was already evident and creatures had developed enough nervous apparatus to escape their predators. A bigger puzzle, he said, was why homo sapiens had been sitting around for 50,000 years doing practically nothing before his mental life took off. Nor was evolution such a great lottery. The appearance of any particular species, such as homo sapiens, could be called a big surprise, but a bipedal omnivore was not wildly unlikely. 'It is a lottery only in the sense that I wouldn't be sitting here if my parents hadn't met. But almost certainly this building would be here, and you can take things much further back.' For although the body plans of the fossil creatures in the Burgess Shale were very diverse, their mechanisms tended to converge. (He does not believe, either, that the variety of creatures alive then was any greater than it is today.) 'If there is air, you would expect flyers, if oceans, swimmers,' he explained. 'And you can only move through water in about four different ways. You can row, or you can have a sinuous movement like an eel, or you can 'fly', or you can have jet propulsion.' Can evolution tell us about our future? 'No, of course not, no. It was always clear that potentially the sky's the limit. Very seldom is it achieved. I think you can't say more than that. But at one level I feel we have almost progressed as far as we can.' Our technical ability is outrunning our evolutionary development? 'Oh yes] Our ability to run social systems seems to be perilously awry. I know that doom-gloom is the fashion, but . . .' Does this view come from your palaeobiology? 'I think it has a negligible influence. That's just what I do extremely well, in the same way as a woodworker or a potter.' It was important for us to know our history. 'But it is no good appealing to that as a justification for our behaviour, because it's been made perfectly clear how we ought to behave.' To argue that the size of the universe reduced us to insignificance was nonsense, he continued, precisely because we had the ability to comprehend it. 'We have the privilege to understand our biological history - and don't misunderstand me, I'm a dyed-in-the-wool neo-Darwinian when it comes to evolution. Its a fascinating story and it's fun to work out. But - and I'd better be careful what I say - it really doesn't make a great difference now we're here, because the experiment we're engaged in of rampant consciousness is evolutionarily unique.' Technically Conway Morris is at the peak of his trade; philosophically he appears out of the mainstream. I was reminded of Teilhard de Chardin, the French palaeontologist and Jesuit who tried to synthesise evolutionary biology and Christian teleology. Did Teilhard's idea of a 'noosphere' make any sense? 'That I'm much less sure of. It's very difficult. This is really my private thing and I have to be very careful what I say, But my own sense is that consciousness is much more than simply the sum of the parts plus a bit: it's much more than epiphenomena. 'I think that there is something about consciousness which actually involves one making contact with something. In other words, I don't think it's entirely in one's head. 'But this is a completely unscientific thing to say. It's impossible to justify. When someone dies their brain stops working and in so far as we know they lose consciousness. So far as we know. My strong sense is - not thinking in necessarily a Jungian or Christian way, let alone any other religion - is that you are effectively making contact with something outside yourself.' With something more than, say, a collective unconscious? 'I suspect so.' What makes you say that? 'Hunch. Total hunch.' You're an odd biologist, then. 'Indeed, yes.' He pointed to a book among the heaps of papers stacked about the room. It was entitled Mithras. 'You see, I'm quite interested in theology,' he said. Conway Morris hopes to spring another prehistoric surprise. With the freedom he now enjoys as Reader in evolutionary palaeobiology at Cambridge, he has been working in Greenland with John Peel of Uppsala University on a fossil find about 10m years older than the Burgess Shale. 'Would you like to see?' He dragged out a blown-up drawing of what looked like a woodlouse. This was Halkieriid, a sort of hard-topped slug which Conway Morris believes will show how different body plans, or phyla, can develop from a common parent. 'We think that we have more or less cracked the problem of the origin of phyla,' he said. 'This sounds very hubristic. I've been wrong in the past.' (He got one of his Burgess Shale creatures, Hallucigenia, upside down). 'But if our ideas are accepted, it would mean we have cracked what has been regarded as a fairly significant problem - the origin of a large number of separate designs over a short period of time.' This discovery, if so it be, coincides with the latest thinking of Cambridge's molecular biologists who have found similarities in the genetic instruction mechanism for creatures as different as mice and flies. I asked him: Doesn't your engagement with these creatures from an unimaginably distant age make you feel your own existence is pathetically short? 'Hubristically, one would say you can always play it at two levels. By now one knows one's own mortality. It isn't that one has some privileged or special destiny - rather the reverse - but the very fact that one can get such intense enjoyment from things like music, because you are carried out of yourself, those sort of concerns shrink to nothing. But the fact that we are apparently so contingent . . ? 'We have to grow up. I agree with that. But we are responsible for our actions - that's never been denied. 'I dont think our 'contingency' makes a big difference. Some people may seek a very high and noble vision through science - science acting as a substitute for a spiritual crutch. I don't think that is achievable by science alone . . . 'You may say our deep notions of purpose are just defence mechanisms, that the whole thing is a complete joke - there's nothing out there, we're on a small planet, we're all going to die, our species may last, maybe, a million years. You could say we are just an awful mistake and the sooner we go, the better. One doesn't want to believe that. And, as it happens, I don't'</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Brussels probes cash injection for Air France The European Commission yesterday opened an official inquiry into the French government's plan for a FFr20bn (Pounds 2.3bn) capital injection into Air France, the loss-making national carrier. Officials hope to reach a decision on the restructuring plan by the end of July, mainly because of the political sensitivity of the case. Yesterday's announcement means Brussels has decided the capital injection amounts to state aid, but it has not yet judged whether the restructuring plan violates competition rules. The next step is for the Brussels authorities to examine whether the amount of aid is justified on commercial grounds, and whether it could disrupt the market. Officials will also attempt to clarify whether the rescue plan is the last of its kind, rather than a means of funnelling money into the purchase of stakes in other EU carriers. Observers predict approval for the state aid plan, albeit with conditions. The French government is to change Air France's legal status to make it easier for the airline to offer shares to staff in return for voluntary pay cuts, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister said yesterday. Mr Christian Blanc, the airline's chairman, said that staff shareholdings in the company could rise to between 15 and 20 per cent of the company's capital, compared with just a few per cent at present.</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Called to account It is perhaps a pity that yesterday's coup against the auditors at the Trafalgar House AGM was overturned by the big battalions' proxies. Shareholders were, to say the least, bemused by the way a Pounds 122m profit in 1991 had been transformed to a Pounds 38m loss at the stroke of an accountant's pen. They may also have been irritated that it took the Financial Reporting Review Panel to encourage the board to second thoughts. Still, the chairman, Mr Alan Clements, and the auditor, Touche Ross, doubtless got the message. Such desire for the ritual sacrifice of auditors grows out of concern about the abuse of accounting rules and unease over the independence of auditors. The new financial reporting standards go some way towards providing a more robust framework, though the irritation of Professor David Tweedie at firms which ignore the spirit of his changes shows that no structure is proof against determined creativity. And while the Cadbury committee seeks to encourage the independence of auditors by strengthening audit committees, that may not be enough. Even the alternative - rotation of audit firms - could degenerate into an elaborate Buggin's turn. Possibly the best way to distance auditors from finance directors is to widen the auditors' duty of care to shareholders. To balance the increased risks of legal action against them, auditors might bear limited penalties. Such economic pressure would undoubtedly focus minds. It would however, require the Caparo judgment, which severely limits the liability of auditors, to be overturned. That might prove the hardest task of all.</p>

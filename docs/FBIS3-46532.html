The documents were preserved by the former head of the State  security organs J. Baatar who was relieved of this office the  other day. L. Sanjaasuren demanded to deliver them copies of  the papers, preserve all the information kept in the memory of  the computers in this respect and to cease temporarily any staff  shifts in this office.    L. Sanjaasuren stressed the significance of forming a  service  for struggle with corruption.    Ensuring guarantees for not imposing punishment on those who  was forced to give bribes.    We are planning measures to be implemented lest this demand  is accepted, L. Sanjaasuren said.</p>

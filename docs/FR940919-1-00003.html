Particularly, comments and supporting reasons are requested on the following questions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. What are appropriate performance based criteria that should be included in the steam generator proposed rule to address steam generator inspection scope and frequency, nondestructive examination (NDE) equipment capabilities, NDE data analyst capabilities, performance demonstration and qualification of NDE systems, steam generator water chemistry requirements, flaw acceptance criteria, and steam generator tube repair methods?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. What are the appropriate performance based criteria that should be incorporated into the proposed rule to define adequate tube integrity (vis-a-vis 10 CFR 50 Appendix A GDC 14)?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. What information should be part of the steam generator proposed rule, and what information should be addressed in a Regulatory Guide?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. How should the proposed rule be structured to assure that licensees make use of available operational experience and data applicable to steam generator integrity, and that licensees can establish and readily update steam generator programs?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. How should the proposed rule address new or replacement steam generators versus degraded steam generators?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Should the Regulatory Guide be prescriptive in terms of the methods to be used to ensure that the proposed rule's performance criteria are achieved?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Should the proposed rule require licensees to submit their programs to NRC for review and approval before implementation?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. What requirements should be instituted to provide improved or additional monitoring of primary-to-secondary leakage as a means to enhance defense-in-depth relative to steam generator tube degradation?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. What changes should be made in the NUREG&hyph;0800 radiological calculation guidance used to address the safety significance of steam generator tube leakage and rupture?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. What beyond design basis considerations related to steam generator tube integrity should be addressed during the rulemaking process (e.g., the potential for containment bypass)?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. How should tube failure prevention and mitigation measures be balanced in the proposed rule?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. What interim measures are appropriate to allow continued operation of a unit in which new degradation modes are discovered?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Is the proposed rulemaking action considered a necessary or preferred course of action for addressing steam generator maintenance and surveillance issues, or are there other alternative regulatory mechanisms that are equally effective for addressing these issues? If alternatives to rulemaking are preferred, describe the preferred alternatives, including the pros and cons of pursuing the alternative course of action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. How should the steam generator rule or associated Regulatory Guide address the following technical issues: (1) Calculation of tube leakage following postulated events such as the main steam line break and the potential for this leakage to exceed the make-up capacity of the refueling water storage tank (supply source for the emergency core cooling system), (2) application of eddy current parameters such as voltage that are indirect measures of tube structural or leakage integrity (as compared to more direct measures such as crack depth or crack length), and (3) calculation of radiologically significant isotope concentrations in released materials (I&hyph;131 equivalent) following postulated events such as the main steam line break with steam generator tube leakage where there is a paucity of data on fission product iodine release rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preliminary views expressed in this notice may change in light of comments received. In any case, there will be an opportunity later for additional public comment in connection with any proposed rule that may be developed by the NRC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Antitrust, Classified information, Criminal penalties, Fire protection, Intergovernmental relations, Nuclear power plants and reactors, Radiation protection, Reactor siting criteria, Reporting and record keeping requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Secs. 102, 103, 104, 105, 161, 182, 183, 186, 189, 68 Stat. 936, 937, 938, 948, 953, 954, 955, 956, as amended, sec. 234, 83 Stat. 1244, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2132, 2133, 2134, 2135, 2201, 2232, 2233, 2236, 2239, 2282); secs. 201, as amended, 202, 206, 88 Stat. 1242, as amended 1244, 1246 (42 U.S.C. 5841, 5842, 5846).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 50.7 also issued under Public Law 95&hyph;601, sec. 10, 92 Stat. 2951 (42 U.S.C. 5851).

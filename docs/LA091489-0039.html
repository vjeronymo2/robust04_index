			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: BEVERLY HILLS;  </P> <P> NEW SCHOOLS BUDGET OKD  </P> <P> The Beverly Hills Board of Education on Tuesday approved a $28.3-million budget  for the 1989-90 school year, about $389,000 more than last year.  </P> <P> The budget, which will not affect property taxes, will leave reserves of about  $1.3 million. The largest expenditures include $18.9 million for salaries,  including $14.9 million for teachers, $4.4 million for fringe benefits, $2  million for utilities and operating expenses, and $1 million for books and  supplies.  </P> <P> Most of the district's revenue comes from the state. About $5.7 million comes  from local sources, including $4.6 million from the city of Beverly Hills and  income from oil wells at Beverly Hills High School.  </P> <P> The budget is based on current salaries, although the district has not  completed salary negotiations for the year. Each 1% of salary increase will  cost nearly $200,000, said Don Fox, assistant superintendent for financial and  business services. If increases are negotiated, the district will have to use  reserves or cut other expenditures, he said.  </P> <P> The district and the teachers union are using a state mediator after they  failed to agree on wages and benefits for the third year of a three-year  contract. The district is offering to increase the teachers' 1989-90 salary  3.05% and to continue the contract another year with a 5% increase for 1990-91.  </P> <P> The Beverly Hills Education Assn. is proposing an 11% raise for 1989-90, or a  20% increase over two years.  </P> <P> Generally, custodians, administrators and other employees get the same  percentage salary increase that teachers get, Fox said.  </P> <P> The next mediation session has been scheduled for Sept. 21.  </P></p>

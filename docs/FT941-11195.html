			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Lasmo pulls out of talks on Markham sale Lasmo, the oil explorationand development company, is pulling out of talks to sell its interest in the Markham gas field in the North Sea, which was put up for sale in March last year. The company said that it had been able to raise sig-nificant funds from other sources, including the Pounds 123m from the sale of offshore assets to PowerGen in December. Lasmo had been talking to Wintershall, the German gas company. Mr Joe Darby, chief executive, said the company would only sell if a full value could be realised. It did not think the offers received represented this value. He added that the value of the field, which straddles the UK and Dutch sectors, had increased through improved performance and lower than expected costs.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of statement by the Presidential Press Service in </F> Baku; date not given]    [Text] Armenia's mass media outlets have recently  intensified their frantic behavior against Azerbaijan. This  approach is aimed at provoking interethnic discord and creating  a negative image of Azerbaijan's people and an inaccurate  impression of the nature of the dispute between Armenia and  Azerbaijan.    The reports published by Armenia's news agencies, stating  that the Azerbaijani people are to blame for the destruction of  the natural gas pipeline in Georgia's Marneuli Rayon, are  typical of the unhealthy and insidious Armenian propaganda  activities. These reports are an example of the information  disseminated against Azerbaijan.    It is true that the pipeline, which supplies natural gas to  Armenia, was sabotaged in Marneuli Rayon on 18 December.  However, it is common knowledge that the Armenian military  units control that (?pipeline). Furthermore, the pipeline is  protected by mines that were laid by the Armenian side. In  fact, several Georgian workers sent to repair the damage to the  pipeline were seriously wounded by an exploding mine. Thanks to  the measures taken by the leading officials in neighboring  Kazakhskiy Rayon in Azerbaijan, urgent medical aid was given to  the wounded workers in Kazakh City. The workers were then  transferred to Georgia.    The matter has nothing to do with Azerbaijan carrying out  destructive activities and taking hostages. On the contrary, it  is related to Armenia's harmful activities against the citizens  in Georgia, which is a sovereign republic, and Azerbaijan's  humanitarian approach toward those who have been harmed as a  result of provocative activities [words indistinct].    Undoubtedly, Armenia's provocative activities have not been  effectively condemned. Unfortunately, [words indistinct] radio  and television company in Russia have created favorable  opportunities for the broadcasting of Armenia's completely  unfounded information without attempting to verify it.</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Unionist blow to Sinn Fein MR JAMES MOLYNEAUX last night dealt a heavy blow to Sinn Fein's hopes of being brought into the Northern Ireland peace process, while giving an equally big boost to the Anglo-Irish peace initiative. The Ulster Unionist leader said Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, would have to wait until at least five years after agreeing to a permanent cessation of violence before it could be considered for admission into the democratic process. Other criminals were 'not usually considered for parole until they have served five years of their sentence'. Sinn Fein would also have to consent to the handover of IRA weapons and the identification of IRA explosive dumps. Interviewed on the BBC, Mr Molyneaux said it would not be difficult to establish a workable Northern Ireland assembly 'in the fairly short term'. This body would start with 'modest administrative powers', but as the constitutional parties became accustomed to working together 'they would acquire trust and confidence . . . and then who knows where it would end'. In a positive response to the six points set out recently by Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, Mr Molyneaux said that while some 'clarification' was needed, Dublin was 'moving in the right direction'. Asked whether he had an effective veto over proposals put forward by Mr John Major, the British prime minister, Mr Molyneaux said: 'If quite obviously they were going to suggest that they would transfer Northern Ireland lock stock and barrel within say three years to an Irish Republic, well nobody could expect us to live with that situation.' Under such circumstances, the UUP - on whose nine MPs Mr Major depends to swell his precarious majority - would 'terminate the lifetime of this parliament prematurely'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ranka Kovacevic-Jelic: "Wendt Did Not Play </F> Tennis With Jansa"]    [Excerpts] We could say that nowadays in Slovenia one of  the behind-the-scenes battles for power has resulted in a story  of two chairs. Figuratively speaking, Milan Kucan, Slovene  president and commander in chief of the armed forces, "nearly  fell" out of his chair when he heard about the presence of four  high-ranking U.S. military officers in Slovenia during a  conversation with Allan Wendt, U.S. ambassador to Slovenia. Now  the "diplomatic chair" is shaking under Wendt. There are rumors  of his recall because of alleged "special relations with the  Ministry of Defense."    According to the Ljubljana paper REPUBLIKA, U.S. Ambassador  Wendt is to leave Ljubljana in May, before the end of his term.  The news is mentioned in the same context as the early recall of  Lieutenant Colonel G.E. Lich, head of the U.S. officers group.    The Slovene public learned about the presence of four  high-ranking U.S. officers, members of the "liaison group" who  have for some time been guests of the Slovene Ministry of  Defense, in the middle of last week when Lieutenant Colonel  Lich, before his departure, paid a visit to a secretary of the  Defense Ministry. President Kucan was not any better informed  since he learned about it only a day earlier.    During the talk with Wendt, Kucan expressed interest in  details of the "Partnership for Peace" program. He was told that  Slovenia meets most political and military requirements, except  for technical questions which are being resolved in the Slovene  Defense Ministry with the aid of the four high-ranking U.S.  officers. President Kucan had no idea this was going on, nor did  Prime Minister Drnovsek, who was informed by the commander in  chief about the U.S. officers' presence in Jansa's ministry.  [passage omitted]    The Slovene power struggle has also divided U.S. officials  in  Slovenia. Some feel closer to Drnovsek's Liberal Democrats,  others to Defense Minister Janez Jansa, who, according to a  February DELO poll, is the most popular politician. Regarding  DELO, it is interesting that this daily did not report this  affair until recently. "Malicious persons" have found an  immediate answer, namely, that the Ministry of Defense is trying  to solve the housing problem of Tit Dobersek, DELO editor in  chief.</p>

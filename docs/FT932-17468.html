			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Besieged Bosnian Moslems lose faith in UN AT LEAST three people were said to have been trampled to death yesterday in a desperate surge to crowd on to United Nations lorries leaving Srebrenica, the besieged Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia. 'We have confirmation of three people dying before the convoy left Srebrenica . . . We have information about some more deaths en route to Tuzla,' said Mr Jose Maria Mendiluce, special envoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). 'The level of panic is at an all-time high. The local community has lost all confidence in the ability of the United Nations to protect them,' said Ms Lyndall Sachs of the Belgrade office of the UNHCR. 'It was worse than ever before. Absolute hysteria - the people were killed in the crush. Many of them were already in a weakened condition,' said another relief official. Six Moslems died in a similar incident on Monday when UN lorries evacuated more than 1,300 people to Tuzla, the biggest government stronghold about 70 miles north-west. They risked the arduous journey to escape the advance of Serb forces on Srebrenica, besieged for almost one year. Meanwhile, in Pale, the Serb stronghold outside Sarajevo, Mr Vitaly Churkin, the special envoy of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, urged Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to endorse the plan of international mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, which envisages the division of Bosnia into 10 ethnic provinces. 'He did not insist we sign the maps in this form. But that we approve the Vance plan in general,' said Mr Nikola Koljevic, vice-president of the self-proclaimed Serb state, which covers 70 per cent of Bosnia. Radio Belgrade said Mr Churkin, the deputy foreign minister of Russia, will attend a parliamentary session of the Serb state on Friday, when the deputies will vote on whether to adopt the peace plan. Mr Koljevic said he believed that the Serb parliament would approve the plan on the condition of negotiations among all three sides over the maps.</p>

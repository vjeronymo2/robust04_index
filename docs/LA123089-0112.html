Sill, Okla., dismissed charges against two  soldiers accused of causing the Sept. 27 artillery accident that killed three  soldiers, including Spec. Thomas P. Boyle of Ventura, Calif. Maj. Gen. Raphael  J. Hallada said he concluded that the accident, in which a round overshot its  target and struck a group of soldiers, was the result of human error and not  the result of a criminal act. Sgt. Edward C. Tyler of Washington, D.C., and  Spec. Nickoles W. Holly of Canton, Ohio, had been accused of dereliction of  duty and negligent homicide.  </P></p>

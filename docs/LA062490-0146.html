			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA'S LEADER ANSWERS CAL POLY STUDENTS: THE 'INCIDENT' IS BEHIND US  </P> <P> In March, nine political science students at Cal Poly in Pomona wrote to  China's Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, posing an array of questions about  the society and politics of China. On June 11, Jiang replied. It should not, of  course, be surprising to find both the studied absence of truth and the bald  display of reality in Jiang's letter.  </P> <P>  The truths Jiang denies are manifold: the machine-gunning of unarmed  protesters on the streets of Beijing; the collapse of the party's legitimacy in  much of the country; the failure of socialist planning as a tool for economic  development; the extraordinary growth of the country's fledgling, and now  suspect, private sector. His insistence that the "incident" of June 4 "is now  behind us" borders on the grotesque; so seared in the minds of Chinese is last  year's slaughter that it is now talked of as a seminal event in China's  20th-Century history.  </P> <P>  Then there are the realities. Jiang makes it quite clear that he foresees only  a China led by the Communist Party down a road of socialism. In his world,  there is only "socialist democracy" (read: no democracy), socialist development  (read: continued poverty and corruption) and "letting a hundred flowers bloom  and a hundred schools of thought contend" (read: no freedom of thought, no  freedom of expression, no freedom of speech).  </P> <P>  Following is an excerpt of Jiang's letter.  </P> <P>  -- Edward A. Gargan Council on Foreign Relations  </P> <P> Last year's disturbances in Beijing were by no means spontaneous. There were  indeed a handful of people, both inside and outside China, who attempted to  overthrow the constitutional people's government and the socialist system in  China through unlawful means and by exploiting the student unrest and the  errors and problems in our work . . . . Protecting the socialist system was the  fundamental reason why we resolutely quelled the disturbances and rebellion . .  The incident is now behind us, and we believe that its impact will recede  before long.  </P> <P> To realize the modernization of China, it is essential for the Chinese people  to work hard. China's social system guarantees the workers, peasants and  intellectuals the full right to determine their own destiny by participating in  the administration of state and social affairs as citizens of the country and  society. They enjoy the right to democracy and freedom as provided for by the  constitution and law, enjoy the fundamental human rights as protected by the  constitution and laws, and have the opportunity and channels to express their  views fully, including differing opinions. To enliven and enrich science and  culture, we have all along implemented the policy of "letting a hundred flowers  bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." We have encouraged  constructive discussions and contention among different schools of thought and  artistic views. Of course, we do not tolerate activities carried out by a tiny  number of people to subvert China's socialist system, or give them "freedom" to  break the law.  </P> <P> Quite a few foreigners fail to understand our struggle against "bourgeois  liberalization." It should be explained that the term "bourgeois  liberalization" has a specific political meaning to us, that is, the erroneous  trends of thought and political tendencies to negate in China the socialist  system and the leadership by the Chinese Communist Party . . China's political  restructuring is focused on improving socialist democracy and the socialist  legal system, to ensure effectively that the people enjoy status and rights as  citizens of the country. The past decade saw marked progress in this  connection: improvement in the system of the people's congresses; formulation  of a series of important laws and regulations and intensified supervision over  the implementation of the constitution and laws. There has been improvement in  the democratic election process, including direct elections held for people's  deputies at the township, town and county levels and competitive elections for  people's deputies at all levels and for some government leaders. Various  channels have been opened for all forms of participation in political affairs  and decision-making on the basis of improved multiparty cooperation and  political consultation under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.  </P> <P> In order to prevent social shocks, the development of the economy, building up  of democracy and the legal system, as well as economic and political structural  reforms, should all proceed in the light of China's realities and in a guided,  systematic and orderly way. In China, stability is of paramount importance.  Without it, our modernization drive, reform and opening-up efforts would be  empty talk.  </P> <P> In introducing political structural reform, we will not only draw experience  from countries with similar social systems, but also from capitalist countries  when it serves our purposes. However, in no circumstance should we merely copy  them. The basic conclusion derived from years of historical experience is that  we must base ourselves on China's realities, pursue our course independently  and build socialism with Chinese characteristics. . . In spite of the drastic  changes that have taken place in the world, the common interests between China  and the United States are still there. So people with foresight have wisely  realized that the interests we share are far more important than our  differences.  </P> <P> The rapid development of Sino-U.S. relations during the past decade is based on  the principles set forth in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, that is,  mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity; mutual  non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs; equality and  mutual benefit; and peaceful coexistence. Facts show that as long as these  principles are observed by the two sides, their relations will develop on a  sound basis. Otherwise, they will come to a standstill, suffer setbacks or even  move backward.  </P> <P> The changes in East Europe only indicate a setback in the course of socialist  development. One should not conclude from this that socialism has failed or  collapsed. A new system with innate vitality, the socialist system is not a  weak system; it is capable of withstanding the test of frustration.  </P> <P> China has chosen socialism not because of external reasons but because of its  own national conditions and needs. What the Chinese people want to do now is  not to choose another social system, but to find out how to develop a socialist  system that is already in place. They want to further promote China's economic  development and all-round social progress and keep raising the people's  material well-being and cultural life.  </P> <P> In the past, we suffered enough from foreign interference and bullying. While  we have no intention whatsoever of imposing our values and ideology on others,  we do not wish to see someone act as a "school master" or make irresponsible  comments on China's affairs . . . . Since the founding of New China, multiparty  cooperation has all along been carried out under the leadership of the  Communist Party of China. This proves to be an effective exercise in China, an  exercise that we shall continue.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAKING CENTS OF FINE FAILS TO PAY OFF  </P> <P> Randall Cornelius wanted to put in his two cents' worth about a parking ticket  he got in San Gabriel recently. Actually, he wanted to put in his 2,000 cents'  worth.  </P> <P> He did so last week, when he ambled into the San Gabriel police station with a  box full of loose pennies to pay his $20 fine.  </P> <P> Paula Bock, Police Department records clerk, said Cornelius is not the first  person to try to pay in pennies. In fact, it happens often enough that the  department has instituted a policy against accepting loose change. "We don't  have time to stand here and count pennies," Bock said.  </P> <P> Cornelius, 28, who lives in Upland, maintains he was unfairly ticketed for  overnight parking  </P> <P> on a San Gabriel street. He said the city should post warning signs about the  law. Bock said San Gabriel, like other cities with restrictions on overnight  parking, posts signs at major entrances, but not on every street.  </P> <P> Bock said Cornelius -- who is so far refusing to budge -- has a choice of  paying his fine in easy-to-count money, or ignoring the citation, which would  then be reported to the Department of Motor Vehicles, preventing Cornelius from  renewing his car registration.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman at the Bureau of Printing and Engraving at the U.S. Treasury  Department said the city can legally refuse to take pennies.

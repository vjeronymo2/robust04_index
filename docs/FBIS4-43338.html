			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rwanda: Italian Forces Ready, </F> Defence Minister Say"]    [Text] (ANSA) Taranto, June 10 -- Italian troops are ready  to leave for Rwanda, "as on other occasions," if the situation  is clarified internationally and a programme for a peace  intervention is drawn up, Italian Defence Minister Cesare  Previti pledged here today.    Speaking at ceremonies and events for Navy Day, he said the  UN had so far not approached Italy on the timing or modalities  of an Italian contribution. "The only request we have received  so far is for a C-130 transport plane, which we sent at once,"  he reported.    According to Previti, Foreign Minister Antonio Martino is  pursuing policies whereby there will be a greater Italian  involvement in peace operations. "Naturally," he added, "they  could never be unilateral or fail to take account of the  international context in which they are being promoted."    Previti also recalled that, at the Group of Seven summit in  Naples, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will be proposing a UN  task force for humanitarian missions such as those needed in  situations such as Rwanda's.    "The idea is to rationalise the possible forms of  humanitarian intervention the world can make in the most  tortured situations of war and calamity," he asserted.    In other points, in his official speech and a later press  conference, Previti said he would be trying to reverse the past  trend towards defence cuts, saying the objective remains to  modernise and re-shape the armed forces on the principle of  "more quality, less quantity."    "The Cold War is over," he said, adding that the use of the  Italian armed forces must now be only a "function of the  country's international presence."    Previti also said military service would be reduced in  favour  of an increase in the number of volunteer servicemen.</p>

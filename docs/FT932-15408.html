			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Report to veto big reforms of ERM SENIOR central bankers and treasury officials from the European Community yesterday finished their report on the workings of the European exchange rate mechanism after a 12-hour meeting. Members of the EC monetary committee, meeting in Brussels, refused to give details but confirmed that their analysis and recommendations would be presented to Community finance ministers at a three-day informal council in Kolding, Denmark, at the end of May. 'All's well that ends well,' said the Bank of England representative, Mr Andrew Crockett, as he left the meeting. The committee was asked to examine the workings of the exchange rate grid following last September's currency crisis, during which both sterling and the lira were forced out of the ERM. Yesterday's meeting was held, as always, in secret, but the committee is expected to recommend that there should be no fundamental reform of the system - in spite of calls from member states, notably Britain, that alleged 'fault-lines' in the ERM should be treated. Instead, the monetary experts believe existing rules - for example, those which allow for more frequent technical realignments of European currencies  -should be applied more strictly, and earlier, to avoid speculative pressure on member currencies.</p>

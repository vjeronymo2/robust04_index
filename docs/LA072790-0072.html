			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> MOTHERS' TREATMENT PROGRAM GETS GRANT  </P> <P> The Ventura County Health Care Agency has received a $1.8-million federal grant  to establish a counseling and treatment program for chemically dependent  pregnant women and recent mothers.  </P> <P> The five-year grant from the Health and Human Services Department will pay for  day care and live-in treatment for 20 women and their children at a time, said  Stephen Kaplan, director of the county's alcohol and drug programs.  </P> <P> He said as many as six of the women and their children will live in a safe  house as part of the program. The rest of those in the program will continue to  live at home.  </P> <P> "This is a major thrust for our agency and the county," Kaplan said. "Everybody  is concerned about chemically dependent women at childbearing age.  </P> <P> "This will be the county's first attempt to pull all the necessary components  together to work with these people from a health-care perspective."  </P> <P> Kaplan said the county is negotiating a lease for the program's day-treatment  facility. A location has not yet been chosen for the live-in shelter, he added.  JACK SEARLES  </P></p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Arts: Houghton Hall plans winter sale - Auction should raise Pounds 25m Furniture, pictures, silver and other works of art from one of the grandest houses in the country, Houghton Hall in Norfolk, will come under the hammer at Christie's on the evening of December 8. The Marquess of Cholmondeley is organising the greatest clear out from an important stately home since 1984, when the Duke of Devonshire sold Old Master drawings from Chatsworth for Pounds 21m. Christie's estimates that 160-odd lots from Houghton will bring in at least Pounds 15m. This is unnecessarily modest. The quality and provenance of the goods, which include William Kent chairs, a conservation piece by the French 18th-century artist Jean-Francois de Troy - estimated at up to Pounds 5m - and a pair of Queen Anne silver ambassadorial cups valued at Pounds 1m, should ensure the total take reaches Pounds 25m. It is believed that Lord Cholmondeley, who is 34 and unmarried, plans to split the money raised equally between personal expenditure and trusts to maintain and restore Houghton Hall and his other family seat, Cholmondeley Castle in Cheshire. Ironically he can only achieve this end by accumulating a tax debt. Since inheriting his estates in 1990 he has been attempting to sort out the family fortune. He sold the greatest treasure of Houghton, a Holbein portrait of a lady with a squirrel, to the National Gallery for Pounds 10m, and a Gainsborough self-portrait to the same gallery for around Pounds 2m. But Houghton costs perhaps Pounds 500,000 a year to run, and the Marquess has been examining ways of cashing in on his greatest asset, the Hall, and in particular its furniture, which was supplied by William Kent when Houghton was built by Sir Robert Walpole in the 1720s. The Marquess has attempted to set a precedent by offering the furnishings to the nation for Pounds 10m. They would, of course, have remained in situ. The Department of National Heritage would not bite, but it is believed to be more interested in a deal whereby Lord Cholmondeley's tax liability on the money raised from the December auction is taken care of through an acceptance-in- lieu arrangement, which comes with a tax sweetener. If after the sale the Marquess owes, say, Pounds 10m in tax, this could be written off in return for at least some of the furniture at Houghton. The charm of the idea is that not only will his home remain exquisitely furnished but, by selling off two sets of two chairs from the original furnishings at the auction, he will also have achieved a market value (likely to be a high one) for the remainder. Houghton Hall is one of the most outstanding houses in England. The Treasury, always suspicious of deals in which works of art are accepted by the nation to pay off tax, may buy this one. But it will not want all the aristocrats in the land creating tax liabilities and then trying to force the hand of the heritage department to accept the contents of their homes in lieu. In planning this move Lord Cholmondeley and Christie's have been shrewd. Most of the antiques to be sold come from the collection of Sir Philip Sassoon, who left them on his death in 1939 to his sister, the current Marquess of Cholmondeley's great aunt. They are mainly 18th-century French decorative items and never fitted comfortably into Houghton. Few were displayed and they will not be missed by visitors. The loss of more paintings is serious. Sir Robert's marvellous collection was sold to Catherine of Russia in 1778 and Houghton has never had great pictures since. But the best of the rest have been sold in recent years. But at least Houghton will survive. Its existence has been parlous for almost two centuries. The family did not live there and three times tried to get rid of it - to the Duke of Wellington, at auction (when no one came to bid), and to the future Edward VII, who rejected it because of its poor shooting. The 3,000 acres of land surrounding it are also not rated highly. Lord Cholmondeley's only asset is the house, designed by Colin Campbell and James Gibbs, and the furniture. Through this auction he has enabled Houghton, himself, and his sisters, to continue to live in some style.</p>

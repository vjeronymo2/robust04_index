			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Maksim Sokolov: "Tilsit: When This Arrogant </F> Sound Is Heard Now, a Russian Does Not Turn Pale"]    [Text] In analyzing the latest Bosnian topic regarding the  NATO bombardments of Serbian artillery batteries, Russian  columnists prepare this subject in a remarkable manner. At the  center of the analysis turns out to be only the fortunate  outcome brought about by Russian diplomats, while the prologue,  the beginning, the development of the operation and even the  culmination (i.e., bringing the NATO bombers into combat  readiness) prove to be, as it were, outside the topic. In other  words (in an especially striking manner, this distinctive  feature is manifested in the analysis given by USSR President  [as published] Mikhail Gorbachev on February 22), the Western  ultimatum and the Russian shuttle diplomacy are regarded not as  interconditional details of one design, but as the opposition of  completely autonomous models of conduct. On the one hand, the  Serbs are handed by the West an ultimatum insulting to their  national honor, on the other--"again in the foggy north one  could hear the thunder prophesy: Then, with the cross as his  martial armor, the older brother of the Slavonic peoples, stood  up."    It is possible that the unwillingness to examine the events  that have taken place in interdependence is explained by the  general principle of the approach to international conflicts,  according to which turning to the prehistory is unproductive and  only confuses everything and aggravates the problem.  Psychologically it is understandable that the desire to get away  from a one-sided (or seemingly one-sided) etizatsiya [perhaps  etnizatsiya for ethnization] of the conflict: First, in the  concepts of guilt and responsibility, then--even completely  extra-moral cause and effect categories.    As a result, the analysis begins to acquire visible  characteristics of an anecdote. In making an expert assessment  of the crisis, the deputy editor-in-chief of MOSKOVSKIYE  NOVOSTI, Aleksey Pushkov (one of the most restrained and  conscientious analysts) pointed out, on the one hand, that "the  most reasonable and constructive forces" in NATO itself were  opposed to a solution by force, on the other--that, without a  doubt, the reasonable and constructive Russian mediation could  not have succeeded, had it not been supported by the real threat  of force in the form of the NATO ultimatum. If the two  statements are reduced to one, it is easy to understand that,  had the "reasonable and constructive forces" in NATO prevailed,  nothing would have come from the no less "reasonable and  constructive" mediation of the Russian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, and this means that the whole Russian "reasonableness  and constructiveness" would not have been worth a nickel had it  not been supported by the "unreasonable and non-constructive"  ultimatum.    The paradoxical character of the analysis can be explained  if  we make a transition from international to criminal law. Russia  conducted itself as a juridical subject, bailing out the  juvenile hooligan Radovan Karadzic. The reeducation of young  hooligans by means of bailing them out in certain cases is quite  appropriate. Only it must be remembered that in the absence of  the police (i. e., the NATO bombers), which in the beginning was  able to stop the hooligan, and inn the future may also interfere  if the person bailed out does not justify the trust put in him,  the institution of bail loses all meaning. Criminal punishment  exists only to the extent to which it has a potential for  completely unconditional sanction; if the latter is absent, the  former also disappears.    Probably, the desire to pretend that this bail was assumed,  as it were, per se, and not as the result of the sanction being  expected is explained by the deep patriotism of the analysts. In  a situation where the threat of force is a decisive factor, the  role of a mediator who cannot or does not want to oppose  anything serious to this threat usually does not bring great  honor, and that is why the desire to suppress for clarity the  decisive significance which the threat of military sanctions in  reality had, is entirely understandable.    Mutatis mutandis, the great successes of  Yeltsin--Kozyrev--Churkin are reminiscent of the Peace of  Tilsit, when Alexander I also also engaged in the forceful  defense of his traditional and very loyal ally, the Prussian  King Frederick William. "An ignoble king, an ignoble nation, and  an ignoble army, a power, which has deceived all and does not  deserve to exist," this is what Napoleon told Alexander about  his friend, to whom the Russian czar in his time so touchingly  swore eternal alliance and love on the grave of Frederick II. In  response, Alexander smiled affectionately and only asked the  French emperor "to leave nevertheless something of Prussia, in  spite of all of these reprehensible qualities." The monarchical  historians, because of the complete uselessness, did not even  make special efforts to embellish the sour position in which  Alexander I had found himself in Tilsit. The newest historians,  in praising the mission of Churkin, are clearly guided by the  revisionist poem of Pushkin: "Tilsit! When this arrogant sound  is heard, a Russian does not grow pale now."    The difficulty of the position of the newest historians lies  in the fact that the true significance of the effectively  utilized NATO threat of force can be concealed once, while the  given method of the pacification of the warring Slavs was very  much to the liking of the West, and a repetition is by no means  out of the question. To declare that every new Tilsit is a new  and still more glorious success of Russian diplomacy will be  difficult for the keenest political scientists.</p>

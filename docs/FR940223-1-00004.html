			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A second witness spoke on behalf of Darigold Farms, Western Dairymen Cooperative, Inc., Farmers Cooperative Creamery, Northwest Independent Milk Producers Association, Tillamook County Creamery Association, and Magic Valley Quality Milk Producers, Inc. He indicated that in July 1991 these cooperatives represented 88 percent of the producers for the Pacific Northwest market (Order 124) and 84 percent of producers for the Southwestern Idaho-Eastern Oregon market (Order 135). This witness discussed how the proposed multiple component pricing (MCP) system would work, why it should be adopted, and the form it should take for these two markets. He stated that in order for a MCP program to work well it needed to be mandatory under the Federal order. Currently, just over 90 percent of the producers for Order 124 and just over 88 percent of the producers for Order 135 are eligible to receive some component pricing premium. He further stated that the premium programs result from inadequacies inherent in the current butterfat and skim pricing programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The witness indicated that another reason why MCP is needed is because of increasing interest by consumers in their diet, especially noting concerns about cholesterol and fat levels in dairy products. He said that consumers now prefer milk products with lower fat content. He went on to say that over the years there has been a general emphasis on the value of fat, but that so far there has been only a general offset of this as values of the nonfat fluid portion of milk, which is largely water, have increased. He stated that the values of specific nonfat components should be recognized and increased so that consumer preferences could be more directly translated into indicating the milk components that dairy farmers should be producing for the market. MCP would achieve this and at the same time promote more orderly marketing for both producers and handlers, according to Darigold's spokesman. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Darigold's witness stated that MCP would contribute to orderly marketing by providing more equity among plants making Class II and Class III products because their raw milk costs would be more uniform. Also, marketing organizations would have more options in marketing individual loads of milk. He explained that plants would be less reluctant to receive a low-testing load of milk because they would pay only for the components received rather than for water that must be removed from the milk. He said that, in turn, producers in effect will have more options in choosing marketing organizations or plants to take their milk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The witness also pointed to the changing relationship over time between the values of the butterfat and skim portions of milk. For example, he noted that during the 1960's butterfat accounted for about 75 percent of the total value of milk, while the skim value was only about 25 percent. Currently, over 70 percent of the total value of milk is associated with the skim component because over time the value of butterfat has declined and the Commodity Credit Corporation has changed the support prices of butter and nonfat dry milk. He expected that the trend to lower fat values will continue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed MCP program was modeled after the one now in effect in the Great Basin Federal milk order. It was chosen because it would maintain the current Class I price structure, while applying MCP to Class II and Class III uses of milk where there is a direct relationship between the component content of raw milk and its yield of manufactured milk products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the principal product manufactured from milk not needed for Class I or Class II uses in the Order 124 market is nonfat dry milk, the proponents proposed that the MCP program for that market should be based on butterfat and nonfat milk solids. On the other hand, in the Order 135 market the principal use for surplus milk is in hard cheeses. For that reason, the proponents proposed that the MCP program for that order should be based on butterfat and protein. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As proposed, MCP would not apply to Class I milk, which would continue to be priced to handlers as it now is. Handlers would account for the components (butterfat and nonfat milk solids or protein) used in Class II and Class III at prices per pound as specified in the order. Each producer would be paid a weighted average of the Class I and Class II differentials, plus the value per pound for the components in the producer's milk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Butterfat would be priced on a per-pound basis. The butterfat price, as proposed, would be the sum of the skim milk value (based on the basic formula price) divided by 100 plus the butterfat differential for the month multiplied by 10. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The prices per pound for nonfat solids or protein, as the case may be, would be determined by subtracting from the basic formula price the value of the butterfat, and dividing the remainder by the market average test for nonfat milk solids or protein in producer milk for the current month.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

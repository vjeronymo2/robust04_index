			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Rogoshin, information chief of the </F> Russian Nuclear Inspection Agency, by Olga Sitnikova; place and  date not given: "How About a Bomb?"]    [Text] Sitnikova: According to a report  prepared by the Russian Nuclear Inspection Agency, there were  20,000 violations of safety regulations in nuclear facilities  last year. When will there be a danger of another maximum  credible accident a la Chernobyl?    Rogoshin: The 20,000 incidents included a number  of serious violations that led to the shutting down of entire  blocks in nuclear plants, but also included very many minor  administrative mistakes. Most of the facilities that had to  suspend operations have resumed working. However, there were a  few facilities that had to be closed once and for all. For  example, there were the two reactors at Krasnoyarsk 26, which  produced plutonium for nuclear weapons. Their operation  violated all environmental and safety norms: They were cooled  with water from the Yenisey, which was then released back into  the river without going through any kind of purification  process. As a result of this practice, the entire river has  suffered serious environmental damage. We have also reduced the  operation of the IR-8 research reactor at the Moscow Institute  for Energy and Technology to a minimum. The institute lacks  enough supervisory personnel to guarantee that the reactor  functions safely. The shortage of specialists is becoming an  increasingly serious problem.    Sitnikova: According to your report, safety  regulations are disregarded by every fifth employee. Why is  that so?    Rogoshin: The causes are primarily economic. The  highly qualified specialists who work in "secret nuclear towns"  earn less than the cleaning women who work for the Moscow  subway. That is why fewer and fewer young people want to  complete the complicated and lengthy training. Personnel are  becoming less and less motivated. Over the past few months,  their salaries have only been paid out with lengthy delays. To  put it simply and bluntly, they feel humiliated. However,  nuclear power stations lack money in every area: There is even  a shortage of new fuel elements. Some power stations have only  enough reserves to last a few weeks. Half of Russia's new  nuclear power stations are operating at half their capacity to  avoid shutting down because of a lack of fuel elements. Can one  talk about raising safety standards under these conditions? No,  that is impossible.    Sitnikova: Which nuclear facilities do you  consider to be particularly dangerous?    Rogoshin: Safety at nuclear power stations is not  the main problem. Following the Chernobyl catastrophe, nuclear  power stations attracted particular attention from the public  and government. However, the situation is much worse at other  facilities: uranium mines, facilities for enriching uranium,  plants producing nuclear weapons, storage facilities for nuclear  waste. For a long time, no one bothered about these facilities.  Many of the facilities come under the authority of the Defense  Ministry and there were never any state inspections. Today,  however, these are the very facilities where the most violations  occur as well as the most dangerous violations. The risk to the  population and the environment is growing.    Sitnikova: However, the Defense Ministry is  reluctant to allow the authorities to inspect those facilities.    Rogoshin: The Defense Ministry is sabotaging the  decrees issued by the Russian president. In accordance with  those decrees, our agency is responsible for overseeing nuclear  facilities throughout the entire country irrespective of the  ministry that they come under. The situation is completely  absurd, after all, the president is also the commander in chief  of the Armed Forces.    Sitnikova: Is there any reliable information on  the military complex at all?    Rogoshin: Yes, many of our experts previously  served in the Armed Forces, and some even held the rank of  admiral and general. They know very well how serious the  situation is. In the past, the Navy came some way to meeting  our requests, and we were permitted to take part in their  inspections. However, after we had criticized safety standards  on a few occasions, we were excluded. Today, we receive some  information through personal channels. Officially, however, we  are denied entry to military bases. On the basis of what we  know, the safety risks are particularly high at those facilities  where nuclear weapons are stored.    Sitnikova: There are more and more reports in  Russia about radioactive substances being stolen. How great is  the danger that nuclear warheads will also begin to disappear  shortly?    Rogoshin: I think that we Russians are capable of  everything, and that, unfortunately, also includes the theft of  nuclear weapons. That is why for a long time now we have been  calling for a uniform system of state supervision of all  strategic facilities in the country. Once again, the military  does not want to go along with that. On the other hand, in the  civilian field, an agency was recently formed to oversee nuclear  power stations. I hope that will at least rule out serious  thefts of highly-enriched uranium and plutonium. As for the  press reports, those are mainly about the theft of beryllium,  zirconium, and slightly enriched uranium. Even if one had the  appropriate technology, it would not be possible to build a  nuclear weapon using those elements.    Sitnikova: Can you rule out the possibility that  there are enough highly-enriched materials on the Russian black  market for the production of a bomb?    Rogoshin: I cannot rule out anything. Three  containers of highly-enriched uranium, which was intended for  use in submarine reactors, have disappeared from the North Sea  Fleet base. That would suffice for the construction of a bomb.  We cannot establish what has happened to the containers.    Sitnikova: What dangers are posed by the  recruitment of Russian scientists by nuclear threshold countries?    Rogoshin: There are serious dangers. We are not  only talking about specialists from secret nuclear towns. Every  highly qualified physicist who has worked in a nuclear facility  knows how to build a bomb. Everything else is only a question  of fissionable material and the appropriate technology.</p>

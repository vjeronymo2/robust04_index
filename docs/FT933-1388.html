			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / South 'will lead recovery' SOUTHERN England, the west Midlands and Wales will enjoy the fastest growth in Britain as the country emerges from the recession, according to a regional economic forecast published today by the Northern Ireland Economic Research Centre. It says recovery in these areas will be fuelled by export growth and increased investment rather than an upturn in consumer spending. The centre predicts that the most dynamic regions will be East Anglia and the south-west - areas which the centre regards as part of the south. GDP in East Anglia is expected to have grown by 3.2 per cent between 1992 and 1994, and by 2.8 per cent in the south-west against a national average of 2.3 per cent. Growth in Wales and the west Midlands is put at 2.4 per cent. GDP growth in London is put at just 1.5 per cent, although the financial services sector is set to expand for the first time since the recession. The south is forecast to see more employment, although most other areas are likely to see an increase in joblessness. Growth and job prospects in the east Midlands, the Yorkshire area and Humberside will be handicapped by pit closures, the report adds. In the north of England, growth has been been undermined by the decision of Nissan, the Japanese car manufacturer, to cut output and by the redundancies at Swan Hunter on Tyneside. Scotland and Northern Ireland, meanwhile, are said to be vulnerable because of their reliance on state employment which is likely to decline as part of the squeeze on public spending. Looking to 2002, the report says the outlook is more optimistic. National GDP is set to grow by 2.5 per cent, while job creation is likely to increase by 0.5 per cent. The authors say that the devaluation of sterling and lower interest rates should provide the long-term stimulus to finally end the recession. Regional Economic Outlook.

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / People (Names in the News): Ponzellini moves to EIB Jacques de Larosiere's European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has been raided for a second time, writes William Hall. Less than three months after Mario Sarcinelli, number three in the EBRD, left to head Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the European Investment Bank has poached another EBRD high flier. Massimo Ponzellini, 43, who helped set up the EBRD and heads its tourism and real estate department, is the youngest of three new recruits to the EIB's top management committee. The others are Luis Marti, 57, an adviser to Spain's ministry of economy and finance, and Panagiotis-Loukas Gennimatas, 45, a senior adviser in the Bank of Greece. The EIB lends roughly ten times as much as the EBRD and Ponzellini will be one of the six vice-presidents reporting to Sir Brian Unwin, the EIB's new president. The intention is that the EIB's vice-presidents will have an increased hands-on role. Ponzellini is a former personal assistant to Romano Prodi, a fellow Bolognan who has just handed in his notice as chairman of IRI, Italy's huge debt-ridden state holding company. Much of Ponzellini's early career was spent in various parts of IRI but at the EBRD he has made his mark by pioneering project-related lending and taking equity stakes. 'The challenge at the EIB will be to get closer to the private sector,' says Ponzellini, who hopes that as one of the few bankers at the top of the organisation, he can help revitalise an institution which in terms of balance sheet size is bigger than the World Bank.</p>

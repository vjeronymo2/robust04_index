			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Arts: By the Grace of Getty The long running saga of the Three Graces took a new twist on Thursday night when John Paul Getty II, the reclusive anglophile son of the oil billionaire, phoned the new Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell and told him that he would contribute Pounds 1m towards keeping Canova's neo-classical statue of the daughters of Jove in the UK. Getty's offer is a gigantic step in closing the gap between the Pounds 7.6m that his father's museum in Malibu, California has offered for the Three Graces and the Pounds 5.8m already raised by heritage bodies and museums in the UK. For Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries in Scotland, who last weekend raised the banner to save the Three Graces from imminent export, it is a dream come true.' National Gallery trustees and staff are dancing with joy,' he said yesterday.' I'm sure even the Graces are now wreathed with smiles'. It was in 1982 that the Marquess of Tavistock first tried to dispose of the statue which had lain unnoticed at Woburn Abbey for almost two centureis. An ancestor, John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford, had spotted a version of the Three Graces in Canova's studio while on the Grand Tour. It had been commissioned by the Empress Josephine, wife of Napoleon. The Duke wanted a copy and built a sculpture court at Woburn to house his prize. But taste changed, and the fortunes of the Russells dwindled. By the early 1980s the eldest son, the Marquess of Tavistock, approached the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum and offered the statue for Pounds 1m. The sum far exceeded the annual purchase grant of the the impoverished museum and the Marquess was forced to look overseas for a buyer. In 1989, the mysterious Fine Art Investment &amp; Display, a Cayman Islands registered company which is believed to be linked to the Marquess, sold it to the Getty Museum of Malibu California for Pounds 7.6m. Immediately the national heritage lobby was in uproar and successive arts and heritage ministers have delayed the export of the statue in the hope that British galleries and museums could raise a matching sum. It should have finally left Christie's warehouse (where it has languished for years) last week, but the new Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell, in his first important decision, delayed the export until November 5. The Getty Museum was furious. 'Evidently the faith we have had in the fairness of the British export licence system had been misplaced. Our efforts have been blatantly frustrated by manipulations of the export licence system', thundered its director John Walsh. He will be even more peeved to hear of John Paul's intercession. Father and son did not get on, and on previous occasions the Getty Museum, the best endowed museum in the world with an annual expenditure of over Dollars 100m a year, has been thwarted by J. Paul Getty II contributing to appeals to keep works of art in the UK. By throwing his weight behind Clifford he has created a formidable team. The ebullient Clifford loves a crisis campaign and has waged many battles against the Getty Museum, wining some (a Duccio painting and a Bernini bust), losing others (a Mantegna and a Poussin). On both occasions John Paul Getty II backed Clifford with cash. Clifford was 'totally sanguine' about keeping the Three Graces before Getty's intercession. He had secured Pounds 12,000 from Kwik-Fit, the Edinburgh based company, to finance an appeals campaign and was already leaning on whisky and North Sea oil companies and banks in Scotland to contribute funds. Getty's Pounds 1m makes his chance of success very likely. The aim is to share the statue between Edinburgh and the V&amp;A, which deserves credit for keeping the campaign alive. The V&amp;A has pledged Pounds 1.1m towards the price (as has the National Galleries of Scotland) while the National Heritage Fund has weighed in with Pounds 3m and the National Art Collections Fund with Pounds 500,000. A public appeal was not a success: it attracted only Pounds 80,000. The Three Graces has failed to touch a popular nerve. It is more loved by connoisseurs who appreciate its artistic links back through the neo-classical revival to the Renaissance, to Imperial Rome and 4th century BC Athens. Before John Paul Getty's gesture there was much sympathy with the Getty Musuem. It had been kept hanging on for years and in these days of fast travel a sculpture on show at Malibu is likely to be seen by almost as many British people as one in the UK. In the past the Getty has always played the game. It has been reluctant to poach major national treasures. It may now think its rectitude has been exploited. Ironically, later in November the National Lottery comes on stream which should ensure that in future nothing of any importance is ever lost. The Heritage Lottery Fund will have at least Pounds 150m rising to over Pounds 300m a year with which to shore up the heritage. The Three Graces should be the last fight to keep the UK chockful with treasures.</p>

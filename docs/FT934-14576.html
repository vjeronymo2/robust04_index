			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Warm reception for Chile mine deal - David Pilling talks to the successful bidder for the giant El Abra copper project IT WAS with a feeling of 'great joy' that Mr Felipe Anguita, general manager of the Chilean subsidiary of Cyprus Minerals Company, read a fax explaining that his bid for the largest copper mine on sale in the world had been successful. The fax came from Codelco, Chile's state-owned copper company. It included a list of the nine consortia that had bid for the huge El Abra mine: Mr Anguita's was at the top. After a lengthy and fierce bidding process, the US-Canadian consortium of Cyprus and Lac Minerals had seen off some of the world's biggest mining concerns. 'I was elated at the possibility of developing, alongside Codelco, one of the premier mines of the decade,' says Mr Anguita. Codelco officials were elated too, for the bid had been a generous one. In return for 51 per cent of El Abra, the Cyprus/Lac consortium agreed to pay Dollars 404m on signing the contract, expected this December, plus up to a further Dollars 151m representing Codelco's equity stake in the joint venture. In addition, the consortium intends to invest about Dollars 1bn in developing El Abra, a sum that is to comprise 30 per cent equity and 70 per cent borrowing. Cyprus/Lac has guaranteed to secure Dollars 700m in financing, a package it expects to be complete by early 1995. The Cyprus/Lac proposal estimates initial production at El Abra, perched high in the Andes in Chile's Atacama desert, of 225,000 tonnes of copper cathodes annually for 20 years - far more than Codelco's original estimate of 120,000 tonnes. 'Codelco always said there was upside potential,' says Mr Anguita. 'Our studies indicate that there are additional oxide reserves, allowing us to develop a project practically double the one originally envisioned.' Production costs are expected to be in the region of 40 to 45 US cents a lb, against a current Codelco average of 69 cents. The oxide reserves  - of 0.7 per cent grade - lie close to the surface. This 'coupled with the technical advances of the past few years relating to solvent extraction and electrowinning makes for low operating costs,' says Mr Anguita. He strongly denies that the consortium paid too much for the deposit, in spite of Codelco admissions that the Cyprus/Lac bid beat the second-placed offer from BHP Minerals/Magma Copper Company by 'an important margin'. 'We've been building a strategy from day one to come up with what we felt was the true value of the property. We arrived at our estimate after exhaustive studies,' says Mr Anguita. Cyprus, whose existing mines are not all of the highest ore grade, determined not to be outbid. In August, Cyprus realised the project was too big to handle alone and proposed teaming up with Lac. 'Due to the fact that the project had gotten so large and the financial commitments so great, Cyprus looked at the alternative of having a partner.' Lac, better known as a gold producer, was chosen 'for its strong technical and financial capabilities'. Lac is already well represented in Chile, operating El Indio gold mine and the zinc mine at El Toqui. After El Abra begins production, due in April 1997, Mr Anguita predicts that output will gradually rise, reaching an annual 320,000-330,000 tonnes of cathodes by the 11th year. It should be able to maintain this for 'eight to nine years'. There are plans to exploit El Abra's huge sulphide reserves, also starting from the 11th year of production. Eventually, the mine could be producing about 200,000 tonnes of concentrate (with purity of around 30 per cent), a two-stage expansion that would require further investment of Dollars 700m-Dollars 800m. Mr Anguita stresses that development of sulphides would be 'contingent upon the economic conditions' and that the consortium's only commitment is to exploit the oxide cap. In the event that non-leachable sulphides are exploited, the consortium will pay Codelco a further 5 per cent royalty on pre-tax profits. The El Abra deal, the first Codelco joint venture to be concluded under legislation passed last year, is being viewed as a great leap forward for the state-owned company, which has - until now - failed to develop a new mine throughout its 20-year history. Before the winning bid was announced, Mr Alejandro Foxley, Chile's finance minister, was glowing in his assessment of the joint venture. 'Codelco will not have to spend a single dollar or pound on the new venture and yet it will be a partner and carry a right to a share in the profits. That's not a bad proposition,' he said. The success of the El Abra negotiations is likely to put further pressure on legislators to change the rules regarding Radomiro Tomic, another world class Codelco mine which, because it is considered a 'replacement' deposit, is excluded from joint venture status. The project is currently postponed owing to finance ministry reluctance to release development funds. 'The El Abra result sheds new light on Radomiro Tomic,' says Mr Jorge Bande, Codelco's vice-president for development. 'It really makes one think that it might be more convenient to take on other projects under this (joint venture) scheme.' None of this debate is of immediate interest to Mr Anguita, who is already wrapped up in detailed joint venture discussions with Codelco. Cyprus, although a 50-50 partner with Lac, is responsible for day-to-day negotiations and will play a lead role in operating El Abra. Construction of mine infrastructure is due to start as early as January 1995, but all that seems a long way off. 'I feel like I'm in the middle of a hurricane,' says Mr Anguita. 'It's going to be a pretty busy few months.'</p>

Nozhikov's Pointed Action"]    [Text] Irkutsk Oblast has been forced to withhold payments  to the social insurance and employment funds, as well as the  federal budget.    Irkutsk Oblast Administration Head Yuriy Nozhikov announced  this Sunday evening.    Withholding payments to the center, the administration head  explained, will make it possible to concentrate finances so as  to remove the strain of paying wages to budget-funded employees  and resolve some other questions. "If this measure is not  taken, the consequences will be grave," Yuriy Nozhikov  emphasized.</p>

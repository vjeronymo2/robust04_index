			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Fire burns on drifting supertanker TUGS and firefighting vessels battled through the weekend to control a fire on board the Maersk Navigator (left), a 255,000-tonne, fully laden supertanker drifting between the Indonesian island of Sumatra and the Indian Nicobar Islands, Kieran Cooke writes. A spokesman for the ship's owners yesterday claimed that 'Extensive cooling of the vessel's hull is taking place and realistically it should be possible to extinguish the fire within the next 72 hours.' The ship's Danish owners yesterday said 'a few tens of tonnes per hour' of crude was leaking from the vessel, and a narrow 15-mile slick of oil had been sighted.</p>

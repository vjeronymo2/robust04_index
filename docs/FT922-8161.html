			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / UN may pull out of Sarajevo THE United Nations peace-keeping headquarters for Croatia, which is based in Sarajevo in neighbouring Bosnia-Hercegovina, has been urged to withdraw because of the fighting in the Bosnian capital. The call yesterday from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general, coincided with a lull in the fighting in Sarajevo as Serb irregulars from the surrounding hills, who have besieged the city, declared a five-day ceasefire. Shops and cafes reopened, and people emerged from their cellars. In a report to the UN Security Council, Mr Boutros Ghali said: 'I am convinced by the operational and security arguments in favour of the temporary relocation of the bulk of the force's HQ staff from Sarajevo.' His report also questioned the future of UN peace plans for Croatia. He added that he would instruct General Satish Nambiar, commander of UN forces in the former Yugoslav republics, to relocate temporarily 'pending the restoration of calm in the city'. Mr Boutros Ghali also ruled out the possibility of expanding peacekeeping operations to Bosnia, where Serb irregulars, backed by the federal army, have seized control of half the territory. But in a further apparent setback for UN operations in the region, the report cast doubt on the future of the UN peacekeeping plan for Croatia. The plan calls for the withdrawal of the Serb-led federal army, and the demilitarisation of three UN Protected Areas after the deployment of 14,000 peacekeepers, which had been scheduled for later this month. UN officials say local Serb leaders in Croatia have refused to demobilise reservists if the UNPAs are not extended to include other regions populated by Serbs in Croatia. The 11-page report said failure to demobilise would make it impossible to implement the UN operations. The recommendations were based on a fact-finding mission by Mr Marrack Goulding, the UN under-secretary, who last week met Serb, Croat and Moslem leaders. Mr Boutros Ghali warned that renewed hostilities in Croatia could not be ruled out.</p>

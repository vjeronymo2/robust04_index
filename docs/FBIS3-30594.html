			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Igor Saranovic] </F>   [Text] Ljubljana, Feb 6 (TANJUG) -- The Slovenian  Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee reports that NATO's  interest in Slovenia is waning and that pleas by the country's  political leadership that the nation soon be placed under NATO's  umbrella have not produced the desired effect. NATO has  dispatched delegations to Warsaw, Vilnius, Riga, Tirana, Sofia,  Bucharest and Prague, but not to Ljubljana, to finalise  agreements on its Partnership for Peace project. NATO's  decision to give Ljubljana a wide berth has been received in  Slovenia as a blow which has shaken even the most optimistic  advocates of an easy integration into Western Europe.    The most vehement critic of Slovenia's current foreign  policy, former Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel, admits bitterly  that the picture of untroubled relations between Slovenia and  NATO is paling around the edges. "We are wrong to believe that  Slovenia is steadily getting closer to Western European  integrations. The fact alone that our state is still under the  arms sales embargo (which is in force against all of former  Yugoslavia) puts us squarely in the context of former  Yugoslavia," says Rupel.    The Slovenian leadership has expected that association with  the world's strongest alliance would automatically usher the  national economy into the convertible currency markets by the  back door. The recent first official hint that this breakaway  Yugoslav republic might be willing to normalise relations with  Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) is not regarded here as a victory  of reason over political daydreaming, but as a logical result of  Slovenia's wobbly international political and economic position.    Last year, Slovenia spurned Yugoslavia's offer of mutual  recognition.    Slovenia, once the most highly industrialised Yugoslav  republic, is inescapably turning into an economic, commercial  and political cul-de-sac of Europe. Its leaders have recognised  this only after the slap in the face administered by NATO, and  have suddenly turned to Yugoslavia, the country which Slovenian  authorities are persistently and ruthlessly denegrating at every  turn.</p>

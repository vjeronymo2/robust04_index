			<p>BFN     [Text] The Bank of Thailand from yesterday suspended  providing credits to textile and yarn products exported to the  United States in order to boost Thailand's position in fighting  an accusation that it dumps such goods.    Bank of Thailand spokesman Phisit Li-atham said yesterday  that American industrialists claimed that Thai manufacturers of  textile and yarn products obtained subsidies from the  Government, enabling them to sell the goods in American markets  at low prices. They asked the American authorities to impose  anti-dumping duties on Thai products.    However, the Thais deny the claim. To improve Thai  exporters' position in the battle, the Bank of Thailand will  suspend providing credit for them in the form of promissory note  discounts.    Dr Phisit said the suspension would not affect the exporters  as no major companies needed such credits. Only small exporters  that borrow from the central bank through commercial bank  channels were affected.</p>

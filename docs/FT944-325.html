			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India's jute industry heads up-market - Kunal Bose on efforts to add more value to the hard fibre and to find new outlets India's jute industry is set to climb on the bandwagon of growing exports of denim to the US and Europe. Soon, much of the coloured twilled cotton material shipped from India will be blended with the hard fibre, taking it up-market from traditional applications such as sacking and carpet-backing. The incentive for using jute in denim is that it is by far the cheapest of all natural and man-made fibres. Funded jointly by the United Nations Development Programme and the Indian federal government, the Ahmedabad Textile Industries Research Association, in collaboration with the country's biggest manufacturer and exporter of denim, has perfected the technology to blend cotton and jute. Denim, according to industry officials, can take a jute content of up to 15 per cent without in any way compromising the quality of the fabric. While cotton/jute blended denim awaits commercial marketing, apparel fabrics using a higher percentage of jute than in denim have been finding favour with the garment manufacturers both inside and outside the country. Mr DJ Wadhwa, managing director of Champdany Jute, which is in the forefront of the diversification campaign, said recently that following 'the extension of multi-fibre policy to jute and the launch of the Dollars 23m UNDP programme for the jute sector with a matching grant from the federal government, the Indian jute and textile research laboratories have established that jute blends well with cotton, silk, wool, flax, viscose and polypropylene. 'What is equally significant is that the knowledge has been transferred to jute and textile mills from the laboratory.' After more than a century of producing sacks and heavy hessian fabrics, the Indian jute industry was not easily persuaded to embrace new techniques and products. Mr Bimal Pande, the country's jute commissioner, admits that 'it is only recently that the industry has started thinking positively about making new value-added jute products. Of the 73 jute mills, not more than 12 are making non-traditional products. What is, however, encouraging is that the entrepreneurs from all over the country have started showing a keen interest in making a variety of things using jute yarns and fabrics.' Until about five years ago non-traditional products accounted for just 2 per cent of India's jute goods output. Aided mainly by strong demand growth for export grade yarn (considered a non-traditional item), the share of value-added products in the industry's total production is now about 7 per cent. The rewards of further change could be great. While traditional items like sacking bags fetch around Rs15,000 (Dollars 510) a tonne and hessian cloth about Rs20,000 a tonne, the new jute products have price tags ranging from Rs25,000 to Rs100,000 a tonne. According to Mr Pande: 'A shift of 20 per cent of the industry's product mix in favour of value-added products will result in an increase of 23 per cent in sales turnover. But there are some products like blended yarn where the realisation is five to six times higher than the traditional products. I am expecting that by the turn of the century, the share of value-added products in the industry's total production will be at least 20 per cent.' The balance sheets of jute mill companies like Champdany, Cheviot, Delta, Ludlow and Birla Jute, which have undertaken product diversification in earnest will show that the 'profit margins in value added products are quite attractive', says Mr Wadhwa. Already, seeing the benefits accruing to these companies while facing growing competition from synthetics, paper and bulk-handling systems in jute's traditional stronghold in the packaging sector, other jute mills are seriously thinking of product diversification. The government, meanwhile, is sending out clear signals to the industry. In the country's new liberalised business environment it cannot insist that cement and fertiliser producers should use jute packaging; but it allows the duty-free import of second-hand machinery and equipment for making value-added jute products. The exporters of such products are also given a 10 per cent cash 'assistance' on the export value. With jute spinning mills in Europe having virtually gone out of production because of rising labour costs, plenty of second-hand machines are available, and at bargain-basement prices, according to Mr Wadhwa who has created a number of spinning units in West Bengal and Orissa with such machines. Other Indian jute mill companies have done the same. Jute yarn is considered the cheapest and best weft yarn for making machine woven carpets. Of all the value-added items, jute yarn shows most promise. However, India, a late entrant in the field, is a distant third to Bangladesh and Thailand in the export of yarn. India's export of yarn totalled 40,623 tonnes in 1993-94. Industry officials estimate that world trade in jute yarn will exceed 250,000 tonnes in 1995, compared with the present level of around 200,000 tonnes. A couple of factories equipped with imported second-hand machinery have been producing jute and jute-blended pile carpets for the domestic and export market. The installation of high-speed Sulzer and Dornier looms in jute mills, with suitable modifications, has allowed the production of light jute and jute-blended fabrics. These blended fabrics are used to make soft luggage and shoe uppers. A breakthrough in the dyeing and finishing of jute and the removal of hairiness of jute fibre will make the new jute products more popular, says Mr Pande. Jute is also being used to make non-textile products such as jute particle board, a substitute for wood, high-quality paper and door panels for automobiles. As India does not grow enough high-quality fibre, the production of many of the textile grade jute items has become dependent on the import of raw jute. The annual requirement for superior grades of jute (TD-1 to TD-3) will be 1.8m bales of 180kg each, by 1996, compared with present domestic supply of about 600,000 bales. An urgent priority for the UNDP-funded project, therefore, is to raise the country's output of high-quality jute.</p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AS OTHER EXECUTIVES LEAVE, IACOCCA DECIDES TO STAY ON  </P> <P> Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca said Thursday that he will remain head of the  nation's third-largest auto maker after his contract expires in December, 1991.  </P> <P> The announcement comes a week after his heir-apparent, Gerald Greenwald,  resigned to head the employee group bidding for the parent of United Airlines.  Greenwald's departure and the resignation of other top Chrysler officials last  month for various reasons left many unsettled questions about the auto maker.  </P> <P> "He made that statement to calm the concerns of both the people inside the  company and those on the outside," said auto industry analyst Raymond J. Mucci  at Baird, Patrick &amp; Co.  </P> <P> Iacocca, 65, announced his decision after meeting with the nominating committee  of Chrysler's board. A Chrysler spokesman said Iacocca will remain with the  company for an undetermined length of time after December, 1991.  </P> <P> "We have an outstanding management team at Chrysler," Iacocca said in a  statement. "One of my primary responsibilities is to put an orderly succession  plan in place. We're going to do that according to our own timetable, and it  won't be driven by a big X on a calendar."  </P> <P> While credited with Chrysler's dramatic turnaround in the early 1980s, Iacocca  has been accused of neglecting the auto maker in the mid- and late 1980s while  writing and promoting best-selling books and heading the effort to restore the  Statue of Liberty.  </P> <P> Iacocca, who joined Chrysler in 1979 after the late Henry Ford II fired him as  president of Ford Motor Co., had hinted in recent weeks that he might change  his mind about stepping down in 1991.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to tell you exactly what I'm going to do because I haven't made  up my mind yet," Iacocca said in response to a stockholder's question at the  company's annual meeting in Universal City last month.  </P> <P> Industry officials and analysts said it was Iacocca's indecision that triggered  Greenwald's departure. In addition to Greenwald, Chrysler's vice president of  international operations, Michael Hammes, quit to join Black &amp; Decker, and  Treasurer Fred Zuckerman said he planned to leave this summer.  </P> <P> Shortly after Greenwald's resignation, Chrysler promoted Chief Financial  Officer Steve Miller, 48, to vice chairman and, as a result, Miller became a  serious contender to succeed Iacocca.  </P> <P> Another leading candidate for Iacocca's job is Robert Lutz, 58, who heads the  Chrysler Motors division and who assumed some of Greenwald's responsibilities.  As was Miller, Lutz was an Iacocca recruit from Ford.  </P> <P> Iacocca and his newly empowered lieutenants face numerous challenges. Chrysler  saw profit for the first three months of 1990 dive 80% from the same period  last year. Sales have fallen 13% in the first five months of this year.  </P> <P> In addition, Chrysler must replace its aging line of K-cars, whose strong sales  record helped restore the company's financial health, said Mucci. "The major  challenge is the expiration of the K-car," he said.  </P></p>

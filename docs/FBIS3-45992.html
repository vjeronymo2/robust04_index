After submitting an  application to and obtaining approval from the authorities,  nonpolicy-nature banks, securities companies, trust and  investment companies, and other nonbank monetary organizations  may serve as first-class government bond dealers of the People's  Republic of China, join the 1994 national group of contract  dealers of government bonds, and directly sign a contract with  the Ministry of Finance to deal in government bonds.    First-class government bond dealers, as an important medium  of the government bond market, shoulder certain obligations in  committing themselves to marketing government bonds and  promoting the development of the government bond market. At the  same time, they enjoy the right to and precedence in dealing  with the central bank in the open government bond market.    A responsible person concerned at the Ministry of Finance  has  pointed out: To expand the experiment involving first-class  government bond dealers at selected places is an important  measure for reforming the government bond market. To promote  the work actively and properly, the Ministry of Finance, working  together with the People's Bank of China and the China  Securities Supervision and Administration Committee, has  formulated the "Procedures for Managing First-Class Government  Bond Dealers of the People's Republic of China" and the  "Procedures for Examining and Affirming First-Class Government  Bond Dealers." They will jointly examine and approve the  applications of first-class government bond dealers. Finance  organizations may, as of today, submit their applications and  their intention to deal in the first issuing of 1994 government  bonds to the State Debts Administration of the Ministry of  Finance.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading DISAPPOINTING monthly data on UK retail and trade figures, together with falls in other European markets, prompted a further fall in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. The September contract on the FT-SE opened firmly at 2,403 but selling by independent traders in the first few minutes sent it falling to 2,394. Attempts at a rally soon petered out, however, as dealers focused instead on the falls in other European markets which followed talk that the Bundesbank may soon be forced to raise its Lombard rate. Sentiment was further weakened by the release of the UK trade and retail figures, after which the September contract dipped to the day's low of 2,384. After a period of sideways trading, bargain hunting helped the Footsie future contract regain some of its earlier fall. The contract closed at 2,401, down 23 from the previous session and around 5 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 18. Turnover reached 8,637. Dealers reported a further recovery in the contract in after-hours' trading. The expiry of the July stock options provided the main feature in the traded options market, where turnover totalled 36,381 lots. Some 10,358 contracts were transacted in the FT-SE 100 option.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Olympia &amp; York ratings lowered THE VALUE of listed invest-ments owned by Olympia &amp; York, the property developer owned by Canada's Reichmann family, has tumbled by 44 per cent in the past two years, according to estimates by Dominion Bond Rating Service of Toronto. DBRS cites the drop in share values as one of several concerns about O&amp;Y's creditworthiness. Others include the slump in the North American property market, the financial problems of London's Canary Wharf, which is being developed by O&amp;Y, and the general difficulty of obtaining bank financing for projects. The rating agency said in reports published yesterday it had lowered the credit ratings on several securities guaranteed by O&amp;Y, including a commercial paper programme, a CDollars 100m (Pounds 48.5m) issue of secured debentures, and a bond issue secured by First Canadian Place, O&amp;Y's flagship building in downtown Toronto. It confirmed the ratings on three other O&amp;Y buildings in Toronto, Calgary and Ottawa. O&amp;Y is a private company and DBRS compiled its reports without access to the parent company's financial statements or cash flow data. A DBRS official said the agency had been provided with some unpublished information, such as rentals, vacancy levels and cash flows on buildings. DBRS said it was concerned about rising office vacancy rates in New York and Toronto, where 71 per cent of O&amp;Y's space is concentrated. The vacancy rate in O&amp;Y buildings averages only about 10 per cent, but is concentrated in relatively few buildings. On the other hand, the agency notes that only about 23 per cent of O&amp;Y's North American leases, measured by square footage, fall due before 1996, with only 5 per cent expiring this year. Most of its buildings are prime properties in choice locations. O&amp;Y has already committed USDollars 3bn to Canary Wharf, but DBRS says that Dollars 850m must still be found. Canary Wharf is now starting to generate cash flow, but with the project only about 60 per cent leased and many tenants offered costly up-front inducements, DBRS concludes that the cash flow 'is not large'. The value of O&amp;Y's stock portfolio has sunk to an estimated CDollars 3.9bn from CDollars 5.3bn a year ago and CDollars 6.6bn in 1990. According to DBRS, O&amp;Y's dividend income slipped to CDollars 209m last year from CDollars 234m in 1990.</p>

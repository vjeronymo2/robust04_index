			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / International Company News: Berlitz unveils Dollars 189.5m loss for final quarter BERLITZ, the language school subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC), unveiled a Dollars 189.5m loss for the fourth quarter of 1991. This follows Dollars 195.4m of write-offs and special charges created as a result of MCC's filing for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law. The partial cause of the write-offs was the default of MCC on certain payments due to Berlitz. Berlitz - which in February hired the Wall Street stockbroking firm of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette to advise on the possible sale or recapitalisation of the company - discovered last year that the late Mr Robert Maxwell had improperly pledged most of MCC's 56.5 per cent Berlitz equity stake as collateral for bank loans. MCC filed for bankruptcy protection last year. At present, most of MCC's 56.5 per cent Berlitz stake is actually in the hands of five US and European banks and companies. Injunctions have been brought by Macmillan, the MCC publisher, to prevent the Berlitz stock from being sold. Yesterday, Berlitz said its fourth quarter 1991 revenues had declined to Dollars 66.5m from Dollars 73.4m in the last three months of 1990. The company disclosed a Dollars 9.97 per share loss in the quarter, compared with a profit of 12 cents a share in the final quarter of 1990.</p>

This action also establishes Class D and E airspace at Palwaukee Municipal Airport, Wheeling, IL. Wheeling, IL, previously had airspace coverage from the full-time Class D airspace area at NAS Glenview, IL. The part-time Class D airspace area at NAS Glenview, IL, however, is not adequate for Wheeling, IL. The Wheeling, IL, Class D airspace effective hours will coincide with the associated air traffic control tower's hours of operation and the Class E airspace will be effective when the associated air traffic control tower is closed. The intent of this action is to establish Class D airspace areas when two-way radio communications with the associated air traffic control tower is required, and to provide adequate Class E airspace at Wheeling, IL, for instrument approach procedures when the control tower is closed. In addition, the airspace description for Glenview, IL, has been editorially modified to describe the airspace in relation to the Airport Reference Point (ARP). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Effective date_0901 UTC, December 8, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment date: Comments must be received on or before November 25, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Send comments on the rule in triplicate to: Manager, Air Traffic Division, System Management Br., AGL&hyph;530, Docket No. 94&hyph;AGL&hyph;25, Federal Aviation Administration, 2300 East Devon Avenue, Des Plaines, Illinois 60018. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The official docket may be examined in the Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Federal Aviation Administration, 2300 E.

This rule will become effective on the date specified in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> DATES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section. However, after the review of any comments and, if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule or to amend the regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace area at NAS Glenview, IL, by amending the area's effective hours to coincide with the associated air traffic control tower's hours of operation. Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic area (ATA) and a control zone (CZ) existed at NAS Glenview, IL. However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' The former CZ was continuous, while the former ATA was contingent upon the operation of the air traffic control tower. The consolidation of the ATA and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation makes it necessary to modify the effective hours of the Class D airspace to coincide with the control tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes Class D and E airspace at Palwaukee Municipal Airport, Wheeling, IL. Wheeling, IL, previously had airspace coverage from the full-time Class D airspace area at NAS Glenview, IL. The part-time Class D airspace area at NAS Glenview, IL, however, is not adequate for Wheeling, IL. The Wheeling, IL, Class D airspace effective hours will coincide with the associated air traffic control tower's hours of operation and the Class E airspace will be effective when the associated air traffic control tower is closed. The intent of this action is to establish Class D airspace areas when two-way radio communications is required with the associated air traffic control towers during the control towers hours of operation, and to provide adequate Class E airspace at Wheeling, IL, for instrument approach procedures when the control tower is closed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The legal description for Glenview, IL, has been editorially modified to describe the airspace in relation to the ARP rather than the current description that uses the Northbrook, IL, VORTAC. The SIAP for Palwaukee, IL, which was previously included in the Glenview, IL, Class D airspace designation, used the Northbrook VORTAC. With the establishment of separate Class D airspace areas for Wheeling, IL, and Glenview, IL, it is necessary to editorially modify the Glenview, IL, Class D airspace designation. This modification does not change the airspace. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and E airspace designations are published in Paragraphs 5000 and 6002, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D and E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediate need to modify the NAS Glenview, IL, Class D airspace area and establish the Wheeling, IL, Class D and E airspace areas in order to promote the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in the area. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only effect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Adoption of the Amendment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 71 as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 71_[AMENDED] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

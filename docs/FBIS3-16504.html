A spokesman for the Russian Space Agency (RSA) told Interfax  that a delegation led by the Kazakh Prime Minister, Sergey  Tereshchenko, is arriving in Moscow on Wednesday with this aim  in view.    According to the spokesman, "the delegation includes several  groups of experts, each specializing in definite area of  bilateral cooperation."    The talks in Moscow pose a third round of bilateral  endeavors  to work out documents to be signed by the presidents of the two  countries in late March.    "This time the Kazakh delegation inclines to conclude the  process of talks, and prepare all the documents for being  signed, even if it has to stay in Moscow till the end of this  month."</p>

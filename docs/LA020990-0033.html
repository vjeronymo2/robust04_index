			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SDSU ATHLETICS IS ACCUSED OF DISCRIMINATION;  </P> <P> TITLE IX: U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION INVESTIGATING CHARGES THAT WOMEN DO NOT  RECEIVE EQUITABLE TREATMENT.  </P> <P> The U.S. Department of Education is investigating a complaint against San Diego  State University that alleges sex discrimination in the athletic department,  Athletic Director Fred Miller said Thursday.  </P> <P> Miller said the school was asked last week by federal officials to provide  financial and other information in connection with the investigation.  </P> <P> Miller said he was confident the department would be found to be in compliance  with federal regulations but added that the probe concerned him. "It's like the  IRS; they say they're here to help you, but you get nervous," he said by phone  from Florida, where he is vacationing.  </P> <P> Miller said the complaint alleges that the department is violating federal  Title IX regulations, which prohibit sex discrimination in programs at  educational institutions that receive federal funds.  </P> <P> Several others familiar with the complaint, all of whom requested that their  names not be used, said the alleged violations include disparities in practice  facilities, locker rooms, equipment, transportation, coaching contracts and the  general treatment of female athletes and their coaches.  </P> <P> The investigation is being conducted by the Department of Education's Office  for Civil Rights, out of its regional office in San Francisco. John Palomino,  regional director, confirmed that a complaint was filed about two months ago  but said federal rules prevented him from providing details until the  investigation was complete. He said it likely will be several months before a  report is issued.  </P> <P> Miller has said several times in interviews during his four-year tenure that he  was concerned about the department meeting Title IX requirements. But he said  the complaint was not necessary and the investigation could delay efforts to  improve conditions by taking up staff time that might be better spent directly  working to correct the situation.  </P> <P> Those familiar with the complaint said it was triggered last fall by a dispute  between two women's teams, volleyball and basketball, over practice time in  Peterson Gymnasium, both teams' home for competition.  </P> <P> The volleyball team, which had been using the gym for daily two-hour afternoon  practices since late August, was told to leave when the basketball team began  practices on Oct. 15, the sources said. The volleyball team was forced to split  practice time between the Women's Gym on campus and an off-campus recreational  facility.  </P> <P> At the time, the volleyball team was in the final six weeks of its season and  contending for an NCAA playoff spot; sources said the team was upset at having  to move off its home floor at such a crucial time. The team ended up losing to  eventual champion Cal State Long Beach in the first-round of the NCAA  tournament.  </P> <P> "If this was a men's sport, do you think they would have kicked them off their  home floor in the middle of the season for a sport (women's basketball) that  wasn't even in season?" one source said. "They would have found a way to get  them the gym."  </P> <P> In 1988, Peterson Gym was divided by a net, and the women's basketball and  volleyball teams shared it for two hours before men's basketball practice  began. But this season, Beth Burns, the new women's basketball coach, was  promised use of the entire floor, sources said.  </P> <P> But while the dispute over practice time might have triggered the complaint,  other concerns are long-standing, the sources said.  </P> <P> "They knew this was coming," said one. "They brought it on themselves."  </P> <P> Miller said the department has been working to meet the needs of female  athletes and their coaches despite tight times financially, and limited and  antiquated facilities. As an example of the improvement made in women's sports,  Miller cited the addition of soccer last fall. But the program offers no  scholarships and shares its coach, Chuck Clegg, with the men's program.  </P> <P> Miller said that about 25% of the school's intercollegiate athletes are women  and that the eight women's programs receive a comparable share of the  department's $4.8-million budget.  </P> <P> Department budget problems have been exacerbated by an accumulated deficit of  $518,000, and facility shortcomings compounded by the fact that intercollegiate  athletics must share Peterson Gym with the physical education department and  other campus events.  </P> <P> "We knew when we arrived here four years ago that the infrastructure was not  there," Miller said. "In order to have a financially successful athletic  program, we had to get football and (men's) basketball in shape. Everything  else will follow in an orderly fashion."  </P> <P> Miller said a new Peterson Gym locker room for women is nearing completion and  that a new locker room for female coaches is among improvements planned for the  physical education building adjacent to Peterson Gym. The athletic department  is in the process of taking over space vacated when the physical education  department moved to recently renovated space in the Women's Gym.  </P> <P> Miller said many facility problems would be solved when a planned $34-million  arena and recreational sports facility is completed.  </P> <P> Construction on the complex is scheduled to begin in the fall, and competition  is expected for the 1992-93 school year. But the project could be delayed by a  petition filed in San Diego Superior Court in October by a neighborhood  association concerned about traffic and parking problems events at the arena  might cause.  </P> <P> Those who support the complaint say they hope it will force SDSU to address  Title IX deficiencies.  </P> <P> "Finances, finances, it's always finances, but finances never seem to affect  the men's sports," one source said. "If nothing else, maybe this audit will  mean that the time frame for these changes will be mandated."  </P></p>

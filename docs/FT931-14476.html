			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Allies face border dilemma: Iraqis hail Saddam victor of the Mother of all Battles, while tension grows along dividing line with Kuwait MAJOR-GEN Robert Frix, commander of the US task force in Kuwait, yesterday denied his 1,100 troops would have any role in policing Kuwait's northern border with Iraq. But as yesterday's reported killing of an Iraqi 'infiltrator' by Kuwaiti police showed, the newly demarcated frontier could prove more than the 249 unarmed UN observers patrolling the border can fully control. Details of yesterday's skirmish remain unclear, but the Kuwait interior ministry reported three 'infiltrators' had been accosted by Kuwaiti border police. One was killed in subsequent shooting, one arrested and one escaped. A western official said the incident occurred at Umm Qasr by the border, and the three Iraqis were policemen. The US troops have no present role on the border since it lies in a demilitarised zone extending 10km into Iraq and 5km into Kuwait. Only 45 Danish troops in the UN Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission (Unikom) are permitted side-arms, and their job is to guard Unikom's posts in Doha and at Umm Qasr. Yesterday's shooting, not the first across this border over the past year, shows Unikom is poorly placed to enforce a border the UN demarcated in November last year but which Iraq has refused to acknowledge. Formally, Unikom officers are there only to report violations of the Gulf War ceasefire pact. Capt Joe Gaffney, violations officer, says these have averaged one a day since the end of the war, mostly through Iraqi or Kuwaiti police bringing automatic weapons, rather than the side-arms they are permitted, into the area, or from military overflights. Unikom considers the four Iraqi incursions as serious violations, but they do so largely because Iraq failed to meet the procedures laid down for them to retrieve goods and structures they had been permitted to retrieve, with the notable exception of the three Silkworm missiles several hundred Iraqis took from a bunker at Umm Qasr. Unikom's officers view more seriously Iraq's persistent refusal to move six police posts from what is now Kuwaiti land, under the new demarcation which has moved the frontier between 100m and 800m north into what Iraq regarded as its territory. The six posts, there since the end of the Gulf War and manned by at least 46 Iraqi police, lie in a line stretching west from Umm Qasr along the northern stretch of Kuwait's 240km border with its hostile neighbour. Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, described the continued manning of the posts as a 'minor' matter to be worked out between Iraq and the UN. But the police show no sign of moving. If they were to move north, it would amount to Iraq's first acknowledgement of the legitimacy of the UN-designated border. If the six police buildings stay, Unikom can do little directly to move them. Maj Gen Frix said his troops, who yesterday began moving their tanks, artillery and fighting vehicles into the north-western Kuwaiti desert, are there to deal only with anything which 'threatens our forces or the Kuwaitis'. This, he said, would be 'major Iraqi troop movements in our direction'. Problems in the demilitarised zone, were, he said, 'quite frankly above us' - meaning a matter for the UN Security Council. If the UN and the allies are determined to move the police posts, and Iraq remains equally determined they should stay, the Security Council may have to study changing Unikom's mandate in Kuwait and consider turning the blue berets from observers into peacekeepers or even peacemakers. Meanwhile, a line of Kuwaiti tanks has dug in south of the demilitarised zone on full alert. By tomorrow, 1,100 troops from the US 1st Cavalry will be conducting manoeuvres behind them.</p>

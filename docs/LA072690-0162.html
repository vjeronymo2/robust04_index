			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO SETBACKS FOR PACIFIC AMPHITHEATRE;  </P> <P> LAW: A MERGER PLAN WITH RIVAL IRVINE MEADOWS FALLS THROUGH. A JUDGE IMPOSES  NOISE-LEVEL RESTRICTIONS AT THE COSTA MESA VENUE.  </P> <P> The Pacific Amphitheatre's operators have been beaten on two fronts in their  efforts to stave off noise restrictions and to eliminate profit-sapping  competition with rival Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> An Orange County Superior Court judge imposed new noise limitations on the  18,765-capacity rock and pop concert facility on Tuesday, the same day that  Pacific officials learned that they had lost their bid to acquire a controlling  interest in their longtime competitor.  </P> <P> In the wake of a U.S. Justice Department suit filed last week to stop a merger  between the two amphitheaters, the consortium of private investors who own  Irvine Meadows accepted a rival offer that will keep it out of Pacific's  control. Robert Geddes, a minority shareholder in the 15,000-capacity Irvine  facility, has teamed with Irving Azoff, a veteran record industry executive, to  buy "a substantial interest" in Irvine Meadows. As a result, competition will  continue. The deal is expected to put an end to the government's antitrust  action.  </P> <P> The Pacific Amphitheatre is owned by the East Coast-based Nederlander  Organization, which had hoped by merging with Irvine Meadows to solve both  problems. If the merger had gone through, Nederlander could have shunted louder  acts to the more remote Irvine Meadows and offered the Pacific's Costa Mesa  neighbors softer pop shows.  </P> <P> At the same time, a merger would have ended fierce bidding wars for top pop and  rock concert attractions that Pacific officials blamed for driving up the cost  of business and for losses that they said totaled more than $2 million in 1989.  According to documents filed in the Justice Department suit, combined revenues  at the facilities are $13 million to $20 million annually. Each amphitheater  has presented 35 to 55 concerts a year.  </P> <P> Under the new noise ruling, Superior Court Judge Richard J. Beacom ordered  Pacific officials to keep sound levels within five decibels of the county's  sliding-scale noise ordinance. Noise from the amphitheater will not exceed 55  decibels for more than 30 minutes, nor be louder than 75 decibels at any time,  the judge's order states.  </P> <P> Because there was only one plaintiff in the noise complaint, Costa Mesa  resident Laurie Lusk, noise levels will be measured from Lusk's property.  </P> <P> Pacific attorney Deborah M. Nesset said that she would have to consult with  Nederlander officials, but she did not rule out the possibility of an appeal of  Tuesday's decision.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the entrance of music industry magnate Azoff as a new Irvine Meadows  partner snuffs out the last chance for a merger with the Pacific Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> Azoff, former chairman of MCA's Music Entertainment Group, joins Donald Koll,  one of Orange County's leading developers, and Robert Geddes in a new business  troika that will control the amphitheater. In accepting a joint bid by Geddes  and Azoff to acquire what a press release announcing the deal termed a  "substantial interest" in Irvine Meadows, Koll, who had held a majority  interest in Irvine Meadows, rejected a rival bid by the Pacific Amphitheatre's  owners to merge the two facilities.  </P> <P> The Justice Department stepped in last Thursday to block the proposal, filing  an antitrust suit that contended joint operation would create an illegal  monopoly in the Orange County concert market.  </P> <P> Paul Hegness, an attorney for Koll, said on Tuesday that the government's  antitrust filing played a part in determining the outcome as two suitors vied  to strike a deal with Koll over Irvine Meadows.  </P> <P> Nederlander, in its bid, had teamed with Ogden Allied Services Corp., which  operates arenas and entertainment concessions around the country. After that  offer surfaced in March, Geddes and Azoff parried with a counterbid of their  own.  </P> <P> The Justice Department action "really put us in the position where in order to  go forward with the Nederlander transaction, we had to step up to a fight with  the government," Hegness said. "We felt it was a fight better avoided."  </P></p>

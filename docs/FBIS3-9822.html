During the talks with special Libyan envoy 'Ali 'Abd  al-Salam  al-Turyaki, who presented to Lilic a message from Libyan leader  Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, Lilic said that there would be no peace  in Bosnia without agreement on an equal footing between all  three warring sides and without respect of the rights of every  nation to self-determination.    A war of local Serbs, Croat and Moslems has been raging in  the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina for almost  two years. Croats and Moslems signed an agreement on a  federation in mid-March under U.S. pressure. The question of  the Serbs joining the federation has remained open, but  representatives of this people on several occasions pointed out  that the recognition of the right to self-determination of  Moslems and Croats meant that Serbs had the same right as well.  The Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina have proclaimed their own state  which covers round 70 percent of the territory of this former  Yugoslav republic.    Lilic expressed hope that peace in Bosnia was not far,  saying  it was a precondition for stability in the entire region. The  better part of the talks between the Yugoslav president and the  Libyan envoy was devoted to the promotion of the already  successful bilateral cooperation, especially in the area of  economics. The Libyan envoy was also received today by Yugoslav  Minister for Foreign Trade Relations Milorad Unkovic. Al-Turyaki  expressed Libya's readiness to send humanitarian aid to  Yugoslavia through Red Cross organizations. He said that this  was a symbolic act with which Libya wished to show good will and  understanding for its old friend -- Yugoslavia.</p>

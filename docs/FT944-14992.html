			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Clues to recovery in coming weeks / Preview of corporate Japan's results Valuable clues to the quality of Japan's economic recovery will emerge over the next six weeks, when more than 1,300 listed companies report their interim results. The government's Economic Planning Agency declared at the start of September that Japan had pulled out of its worst post-war recession, confirming what many securities houses in Tokyo had long believed. Economic indicators since then have been inconclusive, as might be expected at the bottom of a shallow growth curve. So the latest reports from corporate Japan will be the real test of optimism. It will also show whether foreign fund managers were right to cash in on the high yen and the market's high price/earnings ratios to turn from net buyers of Japanese shares in August to sellers in September. The headline profits figures for the six months to September will provide less guidance about the health of the industrial economy than what companies say about business conditions. Forecasts of recurring profits - taxable earnings before extraordinary items - the most widely used performance gauge, vary widely. This is because Japanese companies have great latitude to pad out recurring profits with sales from securities holdings, or to reduce profits by taking extraordinary charges at the moment they feel most suitable. Some heavy one-off charges are expected, such as a Y175bn (Pounds 1.1bn) securities loss from Hanwa, a steel trader, representing an estimated 3.8 per cent of the entire market's annual profits, according to SG Warburg in Tokyo. In theory, companies can bury such charges indefinitely, so coming clean now can be read as a confidence in better conditions ahead, believes Mr Tom Hill, Warburg equity strategist. Companies themselves believe that recurring profits will rise 7 per cent in the full year to March 1995, on stagnant or slightly rising sales, according to the Tokyo Stock Exchange. If they are right, this confirms an improvement on the 16.2 per cent fall in recurring profits and 5.4 per cent decline in sales for the year to March 1994. Market forecasts, in contrast, are all over the place, ranging from a steep profits decline to a dramatic recovery. Several trends are clear. Capital goods producers, including car, electrical equipment and semiconductor makers, have revised profits forecasts upwards in recent weeks, on the strength of strong demand for exports plus a mild pick-up in domestic demand for items such as personal computers. Luckily for them, the yen has risen less steeply during the current financial year than in 1993-94, giving Japanese exporters scope to adjust to the pressure on margins on overseas sales. For the first time since signs of an economic upturn emerged early this year, the current recovery is starting to resemble Japan's classic pattern of a revival from recession led by exports and manufacturing. Exports rose 8.3 per cent in the six months to September, according to the finance ministry. Yet the interim reporting season may also throw light on deep structural weaknesses not present in previous recoveries. First, there is the poor state of the financial sector, part of which will be revealed tomorrow when securities houses report their earnings, lower than expected because of weak stock market turnover. Much more important to the economy at large will be the banks' interim results, due late next month . These will confirm that weak demand for loans, as well as banks' own caution over new lending, is a constraint on economic growth, points out Mr Robert Burghart, strategist at Smith New Court Securities. Second, there is the continuing risk of deflation. Manufacturers and service companies alike have taken an axe to labour costs. They have frozen recruitment, failed to replace retired staff and cut annual bonuses, which can represent up to a third of total renumeration. This has been good for profits, because labour costs have fallen faster than wholesale prices over the past six months. But labour cost cuts have depressed consumer demand and helped to drag down prices further, so hitting consumer-related companies' profits and encouraging further cost cuts, the classic deflationary spiral. Consumers may, however, be cheered by recent income tax cuts, so popular fears of deflation are exaggerated, argues Mr Jason James, equity strategist at James Capel Pacific. Yet corporate cost-cutting still has further to go, as shown by the fact that manufacturing industry's operating margins, at 2.6 per cent of turnover last year, are still well below the 3.8 per cent average for the previous two decades. If tax cuts can hold off deflation, those cost reductions should feed through into the much more robust corporate profits rise that most forecasters expect next year.</p>

In regards to new type fuels such as  nitride and metallic fuels, viewing from the point of its  economics and safety, their future appears to be brighter than  with the mixed oxides, and consequently, it is necessary to  aggressively make feasibility studies and accumulate irradiation  results. Furthermore, concerning the technical aspects of fuel  production and recycling, the nitride fuels are technically on  the same extension line with the presently existing MOX  techniques. Therefore, it is believed that the outlook for its  application is going to be easier to attain.    2) Medium Reactors and Small Reactors. By utilizing an  appropriate size power output reactor core, it is possible to  secure the reliability for the cores passive safety  characteristics and the heat of decay removal system with ease.    In concurrence with the technical development directed  towards commercial large power generating reactors, the catching  on of the developmental movements of medium and small sized  reactors were investigated. As a result, in response to the  diversified needs in the future, the foundations to satisfy  these needs are to be built:    -- Investigation of characteristics of medium and small  sized  reactors.    -- Investigation of safety of medium and small sized plants.    -- Investigation of the conception of medium and small sized  plants.    3) Fuel Cycle. In regards to the technical development of  fuel cycling for FBRs, further sophistication and application in  fuel production, processing and recycling techniques are planned  for the exceptionally high degree technically mature MOX. Also  from the viewpoint of planning for the sophistication and  harmony for the entire fuel cycle system, the TRU combustion  technique and TRU recycling technical development are being  promoted.    Consequently, it will be necessary to coordinate and advance  the development of reactor cores and fuel with these fuel  cycling technical development movements.    In Conclusion: Before the assumed FBR commercial application  would be in effect by the early part of the 21st century, the  FBRs would concur with LWR and the possibility points to the  direction that they would become the main power generating  facilities by then.    In order for FBRs to be applied, the advancement and  fixation  of the technical development of FBRs must be made through the  construction and operation of first the model reactor followed  by the demonstration reactor. In addition, the commitments for  long term and well planned technical developments are going to  be necessary for the following.    -- Improvement of reactor core characteristics    -- Highly reliable safety setup for the heat of decay  removal  system    -- Equipment integration such as using large capacity  immersion electromagnetic pumps    -- High performing fuel    -- Elimination of secondary sodium system    -- Shock proofing    Therefore, hereafter, as in the past, under the countries'  combined drive for developmental projects, it is important the  government and the people follow each others assigned tasks and  coordinate so that an efficient technical development can be  promoted and a cooperative posture can be maintained. It is  vital that these efforts be continued into the future.</p>

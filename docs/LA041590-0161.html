			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHUTTLE'S BAY DOORS OPENED TO REMOVE BATTERIES, FIX PART  </P> <P> NASA opened Discovery's payload bay doors Saturday to remove the Hubble Space  Telescope's batteries for recharging and to replace a faulty part in  preparation for an April 25 launch.  </P> <P> Technicians took out a faulty auxiliary power unit responsible for grounding  the shuttle last week.  </P> <P> A new unit was being installed to be tested today and fired up briefly later  this week.  </P> <P> "We haven't run into any problem," said Lisa Malone, a spokeswoman for the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration. "We're looking good for the  25th."  </P> <P> Hubble's six nickel-hydrogen batteries will be recharged for 5 1/2 days in a  laboratory at the Vehicle Assembly Building. NASA decided to take the batteries  there because they can be recharged at a cooler temperature and thus retain  more power.  </P> <P> The batteries will power Hubble from the time it is disconnected from the  shuttle's power system during deployment until its energy-collecting solar  panels are unfurled.  </P> <P> Discovery was poised for launch Tuesday, but the mission was scrubbed four  minutes before liftoff when the auxiliary power unit failed.  </P> <P> NASA was not sure how long it would take to replace the 88-pound unit because  the procedure had never been performed before at the launch pad. The work went  smoothly, Malone said.  </P> <P> The defective power unit was returned to the manufacturer, Sunstrand Corp. of  Rockford, Ill., for testing.  </P> <P> The shuttle's three auxiliary power units pressurize the hydraulic system,  which is used to move wing and rudder surfaces and in the ship's braking and  steering systems.  </P> <P> NASA planned to close Discovery's payload bay doors today as soon as the  lengthy process of removing the batteries was completed. The chamber will  remain sealed to reduce the risk of getting too much dust on the telescope's  94-inch mirror.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ju. Tubinis, ``Radioactive Container''] </F>   [Text] A radioactive container was detected in the  territory of the former Severnyy camp where first a Soviet, and  later a Russian division had been headquartered for many years  at the center of Vilnius. It is reported that the source is  emitting 3,300 R/h.    It is not clear how it appeared there since after the  transfer the territory was carefully examined by experts. Much  has been written about the harm inflicted to Lithuania by the  former Soviet Army, and each case of environmental damage is  carefully documented. Lithuanian experts have long suspected  that radioactive substances may remain in the territory of  former military units, but even in the camps which house missile  divisions, nothing has been found thus far. The problem mostly  amounted to soil contamination with petroleum products. Here,  the military units indeed ``worked hard.'' In some places, the  soil was penetrated so deep that cleanup calls for enormous hard  currency outlays. A lot of petroleum products penetrated the  soil even in the territory of the Severnyy camp. This was  established by environmental experts. Yet this contamination did  not pose a serious problem for the future of this territory. The  municipal administration has decided to set up the largest  business center in the region on this spot with offices, hotels,  and banks.    I do not think that the unpleasant finding will destroy  these  cheerful prospects.</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Emerging market debt trading volume more than doubles Trading volume in emerging market debt reached almost Dollars 2,000bn in 1993, more than twice the volume recorded in the previous year, according to a survey by the Emerging Markets Traders Association. Growth was concentrated in the market for Brady bonds (LDC bank loans repackaged as bonds). Trading in these bonds in 1993 increased fourfold to Dollars 1,000bn, representing about 52 per cent of market volume, up from 34 per cent in 1992. Trading in secondary market loans reached Dollars 273bn in 1993, up from Dollars 229bn, marking a decrease in market share from 31 per cent to 14 per cent. 'Investors in 1993 responded to opportunities created by the completion of Argentina's Brady deal, progress toward debt restructuring in Brazil and other nations, widespread economic and political reform throughout Latin America and in Russia and Eastern Europe, the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), as well as low US interest rates,' said Mr Alexis Rodzianko, chairman of the EMTA. However, the rise in US interest rates in February sparked a sell-off in debt markets, which severely undermined confidence in emerging markets. As a result, the same sort of growth rate is unlikely to be achieved this year. Volume in emerging market derivative instruments rose by nearly 275 per cent last year, as trading in debt options grew from Dollars 15bn to Dollars 57bn. The survey also showed that the debt instruments have become more geographically diverse, as traders and investors searched for the next market likely to offer the sort of gains realised in Latin American debt in the early 1990s. Consequently, Russia and Eastern European debt trading rose to Dollars 86bn, or 4.4 per cent of the market, from Dollars 26bn. Africa's share also rose to 4 per cent (12 countries) from 2.8 per cent (six countries) with trading volume up 300 per cent to Dollars 79bn.</p>

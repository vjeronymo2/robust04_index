			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (3): Liberalisation is bound to accelerate the pace - European progress towards privatisation of telecoms Privatisation and liberalisation are opening up new worlds for Europe's former postal and telecom monopolies (PTTs), one where they have to compete to survive and are no longer tightly constrained by ministerial dictates Only a few years ago, three assumptions governed the provision of telecommunications worldwide: that it was a natural monopoly, that it was a national utility, and that therefore it was best managed within the public sector. Accordingly, state-owned PTTs were the norm. Almost all of them were monopolies, many of them an integral part of their government's ministry of posts, and often managed in tandem with the national postal service. In the mid-1980s, the US and the UK struck out in a different direction. The break-up of AT&amp;T in 1984 unleashed serious competition in the US long-distance market, while Margaret Thatcher's government in the UK sold off a minority stake in British Telecommunications in the same year, exposing BT to a long-distance competitor, Mercury, which built its own network. But the US and UK had few international imitators, and none of note in Europe. The US telecoms industry structure, with its divorce between local and long-distance carriers, was regarded as alien on the other side of the Atlantic; while Mrs Thatcher's passion for privatisatation was equally alien to her fellow European government leaders. And in the early years after BT's privatisation there was little to suggest that many people besides the company's shareholders, who benefited from an underpriced flotation, had gained much from the exercise. A decade later, the picture is transformed. Most of Europe's PTTs are at some stage on the privatisation road. Each country is following its own distinctive path and some have as yet barely embarked on the course. But the following milestones are frequently encountered: De-merger of the posts ministry and the PTT: This step has taken place in almost every European country. Posts and telecoms operations have invariably been transferred to a state agency with a management board separate from, though appointed by, the sponsoring ministry. De-merger of posts and telecoms: This has taken place across most of western Europe. The rationale is two-fold: that posts and telecoms are now fundamentally different businesses, employing radically different technologies; and that telecoms is more suitable than posts for commercialisation and privatisation. The Netherlands is a striking exception. KPN, the national operator, has retained posts and telecoms - and was privatised in that condition earlier this year. Some analysts say KPN is the exception which proves the rule, since the Dutch postal service is one of the few in Europe to run at a profit (one of the others is the UK's Royal Mail, which is also a candidate for privatisation). However, most analysts believe the two postal services to be profitable in large part because they are commercial. KPN's postal division, in particular, has a Europe-wide reputation for its success in exploiting the potential for competition in international mail delivery. Across the rest of Europe postal services are highly regulated, and face little external competition or pressure for reform. Whereas the EU is pressing hard on the liberalisation of telecoms, it has moved more slowly on the postal side. Commercialisation: The next step after de-merger is generally the setting of commercial targets for the new state-owned telecoms company, and the granting of a degree of commercial freedom. Such freedom typically includes the right to form international alliances, plan investments and manage resources without close ministerial supervision (in theory at least). In the case of Sweden, which has opened its telecoms market to full competition while leaving the state operator, Telia, in the public sector, the upshot is a company which in most respects except ownership resembles a private sector concern. Is commercialisation an unstable half-way house between state monopoly and full privatisation with competition? Many British and American industrial economists believe so; and their verdict appears to be confirmed by European experience. The governments of France, Germany and Italy all view their 'commercial' telecoms companies as ripe for privatisation, and only fear of a serious trade union backlash has led the Balladur government to refrain from moving to privatisation at the same time as Germany and Italy do so. The proposition is far from proven. Sweden's experience, in particular, suggests that the 'dynamic' effects of privatisation can be secured by rigorous commercialisation, while continued state ownership is not an inherent barrier to competition. Telia is also a leading member of Unisource, one of the three new European telecoms alliances. However, were Unisource to wish to integrate its operations more fully by some form of cross-ownership between its members, partial privatisation of Telia would be unavoidable. Partial privatisation: In most countries with a privatised former PTT, the company is the largest on the local stock exchange. That fact alone explains why virtually all telecoms privatisations have been phased, although political factors have also weighed heavily. All the EU telecoms privatisation carried through to date (UK, Denmark, Netherlands) have been - or are being - carried through in stages. Typically, an initial sale of 30 per cent is followed by the disposal of two further tranches. In the UK, the process took nine years to complete. A similar course is planned with the largest of the forthcoming flotations, that of Deutsche Telekom, which is scheduled for 1996. Some of Europe's smaller PTTs, with less advanced networks, are considering the sale of strategic stakes to overseas partners as part of a partial privatisation. In January, Latvia sold such a stake in its PTT to Cable &amp; Wireless, the privatised UK international operator: in return for a guaranteed Dollars 160m of investment over three years, a consortium headed by C&amp;W will take a 49 per cent stake in the company. Greece and Belgium are considering strategic partnerships. Telecom Eireann, the Irish PTT, is looking for a strategic partner without privatisation, but analysts expect that any deal might pave the way to an eventual sell-off. Liberalisation: Privatisation does not necessitate immediate liberalisation, as the experience of Singapore, Denmark and the Netherlands shows. But liberalisation tends to follow fairly soon, if not at the outset, for two reasons: First, because governments, once they are regulators rather than providers of telecoms, become more consumer-oriented. Second, because of political concerns about the straight conversion of a public monopoly into a private monopoly. In Europe another force is at work - the EU's 1998 deadline for the opening up of voice services to competition. The imminence of liberalisation is bound to accelerate the pace of progress towards privatisation, where it has not already happened. Restructuring: Privatisation and liberalisation open up a new world for the former PTT, one where they have to compete to survive and are no longer tightly constrained by ministerial dictates. Internal restructuring, including severe cost-cutting programmes, almost inevitably follow, although they are also taking place within state-owned PTTs. The degree of change depends largely upon the degree to which commercialisation had previously been taken.</p>

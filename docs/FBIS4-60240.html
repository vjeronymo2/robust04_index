			<p>BFN     [Text] Likud Knesset Member Ari'el Sharon congratulated  the Army and defense minister [for the operation in which  Mustafa al-Dirani was abducted]. He hoped it would be the start  of energetic action by which Israel would amass a bank of  prisoners that eventually would ease the release of Ron Arad and  the missing IDF [Israel Defense Forces] men.    The Tzomet party congratulated the IDF. Tzomet Chairman  Refa'el Eytan said it was the only method the Arabs understood,  and such actions should be continued with determination and  cunning.    The chairman of the Meretz faction in the Knesset, Ran  Kohen,  praised the Army for its precise and perfect execution of the  abduction. Normally he disapproves of carrying off people, but  this time it was justified in view of the callousness and  wickedness of the jailers of Israeli prisoners.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 21 May  adds:  "The Moledet faction praised the IDF for the perfect execution  of the operation."]</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Costain raises Pounds 23m from housing sale COSTAIN, the heavily indebted UK construction company, yesterday raised Pounds 23m by selling its loss-making UK housebuilding operations to Redrow, the privately-owned housebuilder and construction company. The sale of Costain Homes, which was flagged in May, means Costain is well on the way to achieving its target of raising Pounds 50m from disposals during the next two years to reduce net debts of about Pounds 200m before the latest disposal. The sale price of Pounds 23m, according to Costain, is equivalent to the net book value of the housing operation. About Pounds 15m is expected to be paid immediately, with the remainder to be paid over the next few years. Costain admitted that in present value terms it had 'marginally' not achieved net book value because of the deferred element of the deal. Redrow, which now claims to be the UK's largest unquoted housebuilder and may come to the market, said the acquisition financed by borrowings would be a platform for growth into the South East, bringing the number of its regional operations to seven. Mr Paul Pedley, deputy chairman of Redrow, said: 'This will expand our housing operations quite significantly. The one area in which we have no representation is the south east.' The company withdrew from Kent in 1988: 'We now believe it is exactly the right time to be investing in the south east,' he said. Mr Pedley said Redrow would consider floating on the stock exchange at an appropriate opportunity: 'If you analyse the group you will see that we have done everything necessary for a flotation so we can float if we want to.' Redrow expects to report profits of about Pounds 13m on turnover of Pounds 130m for the year ended June. At year end it had debt of Pounds 4m and gearing of 7 per cent. The Costain purchase will push gearing to about 40 per cent. It plans to build about 2,000 units this financial year, up 400 from last year. The deal marks Costain's departure from UK private sector housebuilding. Costain Homes made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 48.5m, after land write downs and provisions of Pounds 40.8m, in the year to end December. The company is staying, however, in social and public sector housing. Costain said the deal allowed it to raise cash from the disposal of a non-core business. Already this year it has sold development land worth Pounds 3m. Costain is keeping some investment assets of Costain Homes worth about Pounds 4m. This is mainly equity retained in various houses that have been sold and a piece of land which is being sold. The company also plans to sell a small amount of commercial property interests in Melbourne, Australia, as well as some small parcels of development land in the UK worth at most Pounds 10m, some residential property in Spain and the US. It would also like to rid itself of some of its non-coal US mineral interests such as its small gold operations.</p>

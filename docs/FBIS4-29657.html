			<p>BFN     [Text] The following is the content of the letter from the  two-headed government's interior ministers to the Party of  Democratic Kampuchea's [PDK] representatives in Phnom Penh:    The Ministry of the Interior requests that all PDK  representatives and their staff leave Phnom Penh immediately --  before 19 June 1994. The Ministry of the Interior will provide  safe escort for your group's trip from its office to Pochentong  Airport. You must inform the Ministry of the Interior at least  one day before your departure, however. The Ministry of the  Interior will not be responsible for your security beyond the  deadline stated above.    [Dated] 17 June 1994    [Signed] Sar Kheng and Yu Hokkri</p>

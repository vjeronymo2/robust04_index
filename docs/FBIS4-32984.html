			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Robert Larios] </F>   [Text] The Executive ended four years of uncertainty on tax  matters in the country's economic sectors when it issued  yesterday a presidential decree eliminating the discretionary  power of ministries and state autonomous and decentralized  entities to establish or modify taxes. Henceforth, this  authority will be centralized in the Presidency.    Article one of Decree 21-94 reads: "The authority granted to  ministries and autonomous and decentralized entities of the  Executive Branch to establish, change, or modify any tax or to  change the amounts of rates and the highest or lowest limits on  corresponding fiscal fines is repealed."    Different economic segments had been demanding for a long  time the elimination of the ministers' discretionary authority,  and this is part of the commitments the government made with the  IMF to sign the ESAF [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility].    Finance Minister Emilio Pereira and Eduardo Belli, deputy  economy and development minister, yesterday unveiled before the  local press a package of nine legal instruments that in the  opinion of these officials "establish clear rules of the game to  give confidence to productive sectors and allow them to grow at  a faster pace than the current one."    The package includes two agreements between the Finance and  the Economy and Development Ministries, two Finance Ministry  agreements, and five presidential decrees, including decrees  20-94 and 21-94. The former makes it obligatory to publish in  the official gazette all the executive decrees and  administrative provisions on fiscal matters. The latter repeals  the discretionary authorities ministers had to create, change,  or modify any tax.    Decrees 22-94 and 23-94 create the Temporary Protection  Tariff [Arancel Temporal de Proteccion] (ATP) and the Specific  Consumption Tax [Impuesto Especifico al Consumo] (IEC), which  repeal the Selective Consumption Tax (IBS) as of 1 July. In  addition, decree 24-94 establishes the tariff ceilings for  imported products, based on a timetable that establishes 37  percent as the maximum amount that can charged until 1 July  1995; 35 percent, until 1 January 1996; and 32 percent, until 1  January 1997.    The ATP falls in line with the "exceptional and unequal  treatment" the Central American governments granted to Nicaragua  in the Guatemala Protocol and protects up to 750 kinds of  products manufactured by local industries, products not produced  in the country, although the established capacity to produce  them exists. This holds true for products that may be produced  in Nicaragua based on potential agroindustrial development.    The ceilings established are 15 percent as of 1 June 1994,  12  percent as of 1 July 1995, 10 percent as of 1 January 1996, 5  percent as of 1 January 1999, until reaching 0 percent in 2000.    According to Deputy Minister Belli, the APT will allow  industrial modernization, establish "clear rules" until 2000,  let industry reap the benefits of the Central American  integration, and strengthen the competitive capacity of  industries.    "The ATP must be viewed as something that will allow the  strengthening of productive sectors and must not be translated  into [higher] prices for consumers, rather into productive  capacity and more capital to cope with industrial modernization  and penetrate new markets," Belli noted.    In addition, the IEC eliminates the peculiarity of the  "escalating" charge, which had drawn protests from merchants and  industrialists. Unlike the IBS, which was paid in customs and  in the sales prices, the IEC will only be paid on customs during  the introduction of the imported product. The same decree  establishes a special regime for imported goods of the so-called  "fiscal industry," namely, sodas, liquors, and cigarettes, which  will only be taxed on the sale price. The other decrees and  ministerial agreements complement the aforementioned decrees.    Pereira stated the agreements are the product of consensus  with the Chamber of Industry of Nicaraguan [Cain] and the  Chamber of Commerce. Cadin Vice President Jaime Bengochea and  Chamber of Commerce President Roberto Teran accompanied the  officials during the news conference and said they felt  satisfied.    "We are reaching an agreement that allows us to lay the  groundwork for a tax reform that will take us into the 21st  century," Pereira noted.    Finance Deputy Minister Rene Vallecillo explained that the  decrees seek to "influence through taxes the level and structure  of consumption to transfer resources to the productive sector by  means of public investments and loans for production."    Vallecillo added that it is not that import taxes are going  up, but that taxes for the import sector are being consolidated.  "The idea is not to raise rates in some sectors, but the  contrary, since rates on items such as home appliances, work  vehicles, and farming spare parts have experienced a reduction  or a restructuring," the official noted.</p>

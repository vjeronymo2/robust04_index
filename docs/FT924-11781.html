			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Credit Lyonnais/BfG French companies so far have been more predatory than their neighbours when it comes to preparing for the single market. But the Napoleonic ambitions of Credit Lyonnais are something special. Germany has been the big hole in the French bank's expanding European network, which is why it comes as little surprise to learn that negotiations are in hand to purchase a controlling stake in BfG. The whole saga is delightfully continental. The so far unconsummated deal would appear to have been fixed earlier in the year as a condition of French insurer AGF's successful campaign to consolidate its grip on Aachener und Munchener Beteiligung. AMB has a 50 per cent stake in BfG. Everyone is allowed to emerge with credit - not least AMB which should exit cleanly if not profitably from a costly diversification. There is even the familiar prospect of minority shareholders getting a raw deal if AGF seeks to turn influence into control by acquiring Fondiaria's allegedly loose stake in AMB. Credit Lyonnais' move will presumably reinforce fears that the French bank is overstretching itself. But the insurance implications are perhaps more intriguing. For the moment AGF's German strategy seems to be more successful than that of its domestic rival UAP, which has not yet managed to wrest control of Colonia from Groupe Victoire. But the reality remains that two of Germany's top three insurers are effectively in French hands. It is easy to carp that the problems of unification may prolong the underwriting downturn in Germany until 1994 at least. But in Paris they might well retort that the race has been won before the official starting gun for a barrier-free Europe has even been fired.</p>

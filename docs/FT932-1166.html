			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (11): Sore point of pride / A look at pensions THE French pension system has been in urgent need of reform for years, but for the past decade successive governments have baulked at the challenge of getting to grips with the problem. Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, has sworn that his administration will be the exception. Little more than a month after taking office he tabled a modest package of measures intended to alleviate the financial pressures on the system, and the best brains in the economy ministry are now beavering away on a sweeping plan for long term reform. These radical proposals are still a long way from completion. But over the next few months it should become clear whether or not Mr Balladur really has succeeded in bucking the trend and producing a long term plan to modernise the French pension system. Pensions are a point of national pride in France. The old socialist government reduced the retirement age to 60 - the same as Italy. People can now retire in France much earlier than most other European Community countries, where the average age is 65. French pensions are also reasonably generous. Under the socialists, anyone retiring at 60 who had worked for 37.5 years received a state pension equivalent to 50 per cent of their annual salary in their 10 highest-earning years, to a maximum of FFr149,820. This meant that the average French pensioner was paid FFr5,000 a month in 1991; men received FFr6,613 and women FFr3,504. The problem is that France can no longer afford such a generous system. Founded in the post-war era, the system is run on a cash management basis by the Caisse de Retraite, a public sector institution which pays out pensions to the elderly from the money received from those in employment. This arrangement worked well in the 1950s and 1960s when France had a large young workforce and a relatively small elderly population. But demographic trends have since ensured that the number of pensioners has grown, leaving proportionally fewer employees to pay for their pensions. This scenario will worsen from 2005 onwards as the products of the post-war 'baby boom' start to retire. The pension system already operates at an annual deficit of FFr20bn, with just 3.3 workers to support each pensioner. But the number of employees per pensioner will have fallen to 1.9 in 2005 and to 1.3 in 2040. This means that, for the present system to survive, each French worker would have to give up 35 per cent of his or her total income, against 18.9 per cent today. One solution is to raise the retirement age. Mr Balladur has already done so, albeit indirectly. His recent reforms left the 'right to retire at 60' intact but increased the length of time people must work to qualify for pensions from 37.5 years to 40 years after the year 2003. He also extended the period for calculating the amount of the pension from the 10 highest-earning years to 20 years, thereby slightly reducing the final tally. These measures should help to increase the revenue coming into the system, while reducing the outflow of pension payments. But they are only a stopgap. The long term solution to the pension problem will be to supplement the state system, by encouraging people to invest in private pensions. Past governments have been deterred from launching private pensions partly because of the opposition of the trade unions, which are committed to the concept of the state accepting responsibility for pension provision, and partly because of the logistical difficulties. The crux of the problem is persuading the French electorate to spend extra money on their own pensions at the same time as they are still paying contributions to the state to support those already in retirement. The late Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the old socialist prime minister, was forced by the unions to abandon his plans to introduce private pensions. The unions are still vigorously opposed to any changes to the state pension system, but Mr Balladur does have the advantage that, as a conservative, he is less vulnerable to trade union pressure than his socialist predecessor. However, Mr Balladur does still face the hurdle of deciding what form of private pensions to introduce. He also has to sell them to the French electorate, which will be particularly tricky at a time when disposable incomes are already under pressure because of the recession. The prime minister can, at least, count on the support of the financial community which is waiting with ill-disguised impatience for the arrival of pension funds in France. Private pensions, after all, do promise to provide a sorely needed source of capital for the Paris stock market, which could go a long way towards solving its long-standing liquidity problem as well as averting crisis in the present pension system.</p>

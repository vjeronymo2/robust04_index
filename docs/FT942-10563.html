			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: ABF Perhaps it was because the market was expecting an appetising deal from Associated British Foods - in the form, say, of the acquisition of Allied-Lyons' food business - that its shares fell more than 2 per cent yesterday. The restructuring of the Weston family holding has no bearing at all on the company's operating performance. Outside shareholders are being offered a 10p sweetener from the family's coffers to persuade them to read and act on the thick documentation that accompanies the deal. Admittedly, the ultimate effect on the share price may be marginally negative. After two years, family members will be free to sell their shares and the overhang may reduce their rarity value. Yet all this is still a long way off. Similarly, the recognition that the family ownership structure needs to be adjusted to meet the needs of a new and younger generation also serves as a reminder that Mr Garry Weston will not be at the helm for ever. But there is no question of the family relinquishing control. The long term approach which has characterised management decision-making in the past seems set to continue. Mr Weston was keeping his own counsel yesterday on the subject of acquisitions. ABF itself, though, will have just as much cash after the deal as it did before: the cash which is flowing back to family members comes from their GWH holding company rather than ABF. Having already accumulated Pounds 500m, ABF cannot afford to keep on piling up cash indefinitely. On the basis of April's purchase of Bibby's feed mills, the US agribusiness looks more enticing than Allied's food business which would make ABF more vulnerable to margin pressure from supermarkets.</p>

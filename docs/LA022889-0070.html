			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRUCE HOROVITZ / MARKETING: HOLY TIE-IN! BATMAN BORES CONSUMERS JUST AS  RETAILERS PREPARE FOR FILM  </P> <P> Atop research firm recently asked people across America to rate their favorite  cartoon and comic strip characters -- including Batman. But the responses were  the kind that could drive the folks at Warner Bros. and DC Comics batty.  </P> <P> After all, the film company not only plans to release a $30-million Batman  motion picture in June, but through Warner Communications' licensing arm, more  than 100 licensees have paid fees to manufacture Batman products that range  from plastic car mats to thermos bottles decked with pictures of the Caped  Crusader. Meanwhile, DC Comics also has big plans to market Batman during this,  his 50th anniversary.  </P> <P> But in the national survey of 1,800 consumers of all ages, Batman rated a real  dud.  </P> <P> In fact, the California Dancing Raisins -- who topped the list -- proved to be  more than four times more popular than Batman. Indeed, Batman couldn't even  muster an "average" score with consumers but rated about even with such  snoozers as Moon Mullins, the Incredible Hulk and Beany and Cecil. Worse yet,  Batman even fell slightly below such luminaries as Deputy Dawg, Betty Boop, and  yes, even Chicken Little.  </P> <P> "Don't buy any stock in Batman," said Steven Levitt, president of Marketing  Evaluation Inc., the Port Washington, N.Y., research firm that conducted the  survey. "In fact, if I had a chance to make a Batman lamp or an Alf lamp, I'd  run like hell to Lorimar to make an Alf lamp and run the other way from  Batman."  </P> <P> Maybe so. But don't expect these results to drive Batman back into the bat  cave.  </P> <P> In fact, one licensing expert predicts that Batman accessories could post  retail sales exceeding $150 million over the next year. And officials at Warner  Bros. and its sister company, LCA Entertainment, say Batman still has plenty of  fight left. In fact, they say, enthusiasm for Batman generally goes in  seven-year cycles -- and that the latest cycle will peak about the time the  movie starring Michael Keaton as Batman is released this summer.  </P> <P> "I'm not worried about it," said Barbara Sims, director of marketing at LCA  Entertainment. "Bat man is a long-term classic character who has his highs and  lows. Remember, this is not a character that has a theme park named after it."  </P> <P> DC Comics, which is also owned by Warner Communications, seems certain that  Batman accessories will fly. The company has even licensed Ballantine Books to  publish a coffee table book on Batman's history that is expected to retail for  more than $35.  </P> <P> "We see this as the year when Batman has evolved from a cartoon character into  a fashion statement," said Mary Moebus, vice president of licensing at New  York-based DC Comics. "Batman is moving out of the trendy under-culture into  the mass market."  </P> <P> Certainly, Batman's new popularity with teen-agers got a lift when a member of  the popular rock group U2 wore a Batman T-shirt in "Rattle and Hum," a  documentary film about the group's 1987 world tour. Even the makers of the  T-shirt were surprised because they didn't pay anything to have the shirt so  prominently displayed in the film.  </P> <P> Now, some big retailers are climbing aboard the Batman bandwagon. Both the  Macy's and K mart retail chains recently began to stock limited amounts of  Batman T-shirts and sweat shirts. And very soon, Batfans will be able to  purchase everything from Batman suspenders to Batman eyeglasses.  </P> <P> One licensing official predicts that there'll be a big demand for Batman  accessories. "I think the Batman movie will create a lot of interest in Batman  merchandise," said Murray Altchuler, executive director of the New York-based  Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Assn.  </P> <P> But Altchuler, who once worked for LCA, where he licensed the Batman TV series,  said the reaction may not be exactly what Warner Bros. expects. "If I was  seeking a license for Batman, I'd be quicker to jump on board with the old  Batman property than with the new movie."  </P> <P> It seems that the Batman in the motion picture is a far different -- if not  darker -- character than the campy Batman most people remember from the 1960s  TV series. The two even dress very differently. The motion picture Batman is  much like the comic book character, who wears a dark outfit, while Batman from  the TV show wore a bright blue outfit with a flashy logo painted across his  chest. What's more, Batman's ever-popular sidekick, Robin, doesn't even appear  in the movie.  </P> <P> That's why one computer software company has decided to create a Batman video  game that will be modeled after the comic book series and not the new film.  "We're riding the wave of Batmania, but we're not affiliated with the movie,"  said Jim Whims, general manager of San Jose-based Data East USA Inc.  </P> <P> Next week, Data East plans to ship the $25 video game to toy chains nationwide.  And Whims, who co-founded Worlds of Wonder, says he hopes to sell up to 60,000  games. "When you get past the Batman name, all the player looks for is how the  game plays," said Whims. "If it doesn't play well, it will quickly get killed."  </P> <P> As a precaution, some retailers are buying into both the old and new Batman  characters. "We basically hope that consumers who don't buy one will buy the  other," said Elizabeth Wardley, marketing services manager at Applause Inc., a  Woodland Hills company that makes novelty items from popular TV and film  characters.  </P> <P> For example, Applause is making two completely different sets of Batman key  chains. One set, which will be hung from a display with a dark background,  features the Batman from the new movie. But a second set, which will be sold  from a bright blue display, features Batman and Robin from the TV show.  </P> <P> For years -- even before the motion picture was talked about -- three stores on  Melrose Avenue have been stocking Batman accessories. Their wares, however, are  mostly tied in to the 1960s TV show that starred Adam West.  </P> <P> "Batman has been a hot item for some time," said Chuck Ware, manager of Hans  Korthoff Antiques. "We started selling the stuff because our customers asked us  to." Among the "antique" Batman items his store sells is a plastic Batmobile  that sold for $15 when it was made about 20 years ago. Today, it fetches $125.  </P> <P> Nearby, the store Wacko has been selling Batman buttons, badges and T-shirts  for some time. "It has nothing to do with the film," said Len Haynes, assistant  manager at the store. "Punk and New Wave kids like the old Batman stuff."  </P> <P> But the Melrose shop Chick A Boom claims to be one of the first stores in the  country to carry a full supply of old Batman artifacts. "When we started  stocking this stuff 10 years ago, we were nearly laughed off the planet," said  Chris Scharfman, who owns the store.  </P> <P> Among the items is a Batman talking alarm clock that originally sold for about  $15. It now retails for $125. And if you want an original Batman wastebasket,  well, that'll set you back $66.  </P> <P> "There's a new generation of kids who are just getting into Batman," said  Scharfman. "But the question is, will the new Batman stuff be made so shabbily  that it won't even be collectible?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Circuit City Decides to Review Its Agency  </P> <P> Is Circuit City changing its mind about which ad agency is "the intelligent  choice?"  </P> <P> The home electronics chain -- which calls itself "The Intelligent Choice" in  its advertising -- has apparently decided that it is not completely satisfied  with the Los Angeles ad agency, Admarketing, which created that slogan. The  estimated $25-million account was put up for review last week, according to  Jack Roth, president of Admarketing.  </P> <P> "All I know is, they said they'd talk to a few other people," said Roth, who  added that he was surprised by the review but hopes to keep the account.  </P> <P> Executives at Circuit City were tight-lipped about the move on Monday. Greg  Jones, the City of Industry-based company's new vice president of marketing,  declined to comment on the review. But some Los Angeles ad executives openly  questioned why Circuit City -- which has seen its sales nearly quadruple in the  four years Admarketing has handled the business -- would consider the agency  change. Said Admarketing's Roth: "I guess they feel they'd be remiss if they  didn't look at and listen to others."  </P> <P> </P> <P> TV Stars Just Can't Come Out for AdClub  </P> <P> Officials at the Orange County Advertising Federation will be the first to tell  you that passing the age 30 has been rough.  </P> <P> The association, which is also known as the AdClub, turned 31 this year. So  executives figured that it might be fun to use "thirtysomething" as a theme to  Friday night's awards dinner. In fact, a flashy video show prior to the awards  presentation will feature all kinds of clips from the popular TV show. After  all, two stars from the TV series happened to run a fictional advertising  agency that recently bit the dust on the show.  </P> <P> But the stars wouldn't come out for the AdClub. Nearly 1,000 people are  expected to attend the banquet at the Irvine Hilton. Yet when the AdClub asked  four different stars from the TV show to host their gala, they were turned down  flat. "The studio said they're so far behind in filming, they couldn't tear  them away," said Bob Guzman, executive director of the AdAwards ceremony.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Spots to Put New Accent on Pic'N'Save  </P> <P> For several years, Spanish-language TV advertisements have positioned the Los  Angeles discount store chain, Pic'N'Save, as a place with the lowest prices  around.  </P> <P> Last week the discounter handed its $1-million account to the North Hollywood  ad agency Castellanos Latina Advertising, which also handles Latino advertising  for the Broadway. And Julio J. Castellanos Sr., president of the firm, says a  new ad theme for the 145-store chain will begin later this year. "We want to  show people that besides getting low prices, they also get good quality," he  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Firm Says No Soap to Laundromat Billboard  </P> <P> It's not exactly the sort of ad you'd expect to see on a highway billboard. And  as far as the folks at the outdoor advertising firm Patrick Media are  concerned, you won't.  </P> <P> The subject matter is pretty tame: a woman knitting a sweater and a man sipping  coffee while seated on a bench. But there is one catch -- they're both naked.  Well, their faces and other crucial areas are concealed by black strips. But  even the headline on the billboard ad for the San Jose chain Oasis Laundry  plays off their nakedness: "Some People Who Won't Appreciate Our Laundromats."  </P> <P> But Patrick Media, the billboard company, told the laundry no soap. "The last  thing we need to do is get special-interest groups screaming at us," said  Gregory Gall, account executive at Patrick Media Group's Oakland office. "We're  losing boards every year through new ordinances."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the San Francisco ad agency that created the billboard thinks the  brouhaha is silly. Said Cathi Mooney, chairman of Mandelbaum, Mooney &amp;  Associates: "I've seen billboard ads for airlines that are a lot more risque  than this."  </P></p>

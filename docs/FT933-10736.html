			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / The ERM - Picking Up The Pieces: Welcome flexibility, goodbye simplicity - Life in the new system promises to be more complicated FOR ALL its flaws and inflexibilities, the semi-fixed version of the exchange rate mechanism, which Europe's leaders effectively abandoned last weekend, had one great advantage: simplicity. Europe's new dirty floating regime may, at last, be about to deliver cuts in interest rates that France and most of its other ERM partners desperately need. But, after one day of practice with the new 'flexible ERM', it is already apparent that life will continue to be economically complicated, as well as politically difficult, for Europe's finance ministers. Part of the new challenge of life after the hard ERM is technical: until last weekend, those European countries with narrow ERM bands had no effective power to pursue an independent monetary policy. Now, with the freedom to appreciate and depreciate by as much as 15 per cent either side of the old parities, national central banks have much more discretion to cut interest rates below the Bundesbank's. The UK, for example, has lowered interest rates well below those of the ERM countries but would still have managed to remain within the system's new and gaping bands. This new freedom should bring welcome relief to Europe's troubled economies, assuming that they take advantage of their bands and cut interest rates. Indeed, the reason for the exchange pressure on France, Belgium and Denmark, which effectively destroyed the ERM last Friday, was a belief in the markets that these economies could not sustain Germany's high rates. The right-hand chart above shows just how distorted the structure of European real interest rates had become. Germany, battling with a persistent public sector inflation problem, needs higher rates than low inflation countries like France. But measured by inflation-adjusted real interest rates this monetary squeeze was doubly severe. The result is that countries in the 'soft core' of the loose ERM - Belgium, Denmark and France - have real interest rates which are twice as high as those in Germany. The economic case for substantial cuts in French, Belgian and Danish interest rates is therefore compelling. The depressed state of their economies, low levels of inflation and falling producer prices all suggest that the inflation risk from depreciation can be ignored for now. In any case, the British experience of the past few months suggests that, once the markets become used to the floating rate and convinced that lower interest rates are delivering economic recovery, the exchange rate is at least as likely to go up as to fall further. Yet things may not be that simple. For the deal early on Monday morning did not solve the economic and political problems that German unification has bequeathed to Europe. It merely began a new, and maybe equally turbulent, period of effectively floating, rather than effectively fixed, exchange rates. The hard ERM's collapse, and the publicly expressed desire of leading governments to keep to the timetable of the Maastricht treaty and thus return to narrow ERM bands by the beginning of next year, make the monetary choices more complicated. For if the French government is to avoid the charge that it has broken its promise not to devalue and recapture the anti-inflationary credibility that the hard ERM provided, then it must seek a return to narrow ERM bands as soon as possible. But the further France cuts interest rates, the longer it will have to wait for the Bundesbank to catch up and the further the monetary union timetable will be delayed. That may help explain why France did not cut rates yesterday, even though the markets were previously selling the franc because French interest rates were too high. A second reason for concern is that the ERM's new flexibility might lead to complaints about 'competitive devaluations' of the sort that France has accused Britain, in particular, of engaging in over the past nine months. This worry would be exacerbated if interest rates cuts and exchange rate depreciation occurred in a relatively unco-ordinated fashion. Might these worries about competitive devaluations make sense? The charts above show the Financial Times's measure of price competitiveness in Europe, based on nominal effective exchange rates which are then weighted by European trade shares and adjusted for relative producer price inflation rates. In fact, the evidence suggests that France has already made substantial gains in competitiveness over the past six years. Yesterday's 3 per cent franc depreciation only goes part of the way to recapturing the losses that France has suffered since sterling and the Italian lira left the ERM last September. But if the franc fort policy was about improving French price competitiveness, then it has already been a success. The further the franc falls, the greater the gains. The UK, by contrast, has not taken great advantage of floating exchange rates to recapture its lost competitiveness. Sterling's appreciation of recent months has not completely removed the gains made since last September. But Britain's effective exchange rate, adjusted for the the UK's relatively rapid wage inflation in the late 1980s, has actually appreciated by 16 per cent since 1987 - a marked loss of competitiveness. But it is German industry which stands to lose the most from a sizeable fall in the value of the French franc over the next few months. The chart shows that the inflation-adjusted D-Mark has already appreciated by 5 per cent since last September. And the logic of the Bundesbank's high interest rate policy, the German government's fiscal problems and the softening of the ERM, all point to a further rise in the currency. Whether Europe's governments will be able to live with the diff-erential movements in interest rates and shifts in exchange rate competitiveness that the new soft ERM implies could prove to be an equally severe test of their ability to put collective concerns above national interests. That Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, used a press conference yesterday to point out that Europe's finance ministers and central bank governors have agreed 'not to abuse monetary policy to acquire artificial competitive advantages', is a worrying sign of tensions to come.</p>

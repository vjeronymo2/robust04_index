			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coal plan undermines German villagers' hopes - The people of Horno may have the ground cut from under them BERND SIEGERT had little idea what he was taking on when he was elected mayor of Horno in 1990. The village, located in the eastern German state of Brandenburg, close to the Polish border, had hoped for a better life after German unification. Its 380 inhabitants, mostly farmers, had worked in the large collective farms under the former communists. When they were broken up after 1990, these plain-speaking people bought shares that enabled them to farm their own land. But the people of Horno had hoped for something even more fundamental from unification: the right to remain in their village. In the 1970s, the communist authorities had decided that Horno, which is over 600 years old, should be flattened to make way for the mining of brown coal. Understandly, following the collapse of industry in eastern Germany after 1990, Mr Siegert and his constituents expected more than a reprieve. They assumed there would be no need to dig for coal under their village. They were sadly mistaken. The management of Lausitzer Braunkohle, or Laubag, the company that mines the giant brown coal fields straddling the eastern states of Brandenburg and Saxony, appears determined to press ahead with moving the villagers from Horno by the turn of the century. 'We have no intention of moving,' declares Mr Siegert, a tall, stocky, 42-year-old farmer. 'Of course we want the miners to have jobs, but there is no need to dig for brown coal under Horno. We don't need more energy,' he insists. 'Even if we did, why can't we have gas? It's cleaner and cheaper. We will not move. Whatever happens, we will stay here. This is our home.' In many ways, Horno's predicament exemplifies not only the difficulties of implementing an energy policy for eastern Germany but also the government's commitment to brown coal as a source of power and employment in the region. In 1990, in a move aimed at saving the industry - and jobs - the government drew up a energy policy for eastern Germany under which 100m tonnes of brown coal would be mined annually and supplied to Veag, the region's main utility company. Before 1990, lignite accounted for 62 per cent of eastern Germany's primary energy consumption. Since then, electricity demand has fallen by 40 per cent. The authorities now face uncertainty over whether there will be demand in eastern Germany for this amount of lignite, particularly since there are few signs of an emerging new manufacturing/industrial sector. If not, what will happen to its plans to upgrade or build power generating blocks with an annual capacity of 7,200MW, to be supplied by Laubag's brown coal? A further complicating factor is the possibility that more cities, including Potsdam, the capital of Brandenburg, might well opt for gas instead of brown coal. None of these problems has escaped the attention of Laubag. Laubag is owned by the Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising and restructuring eastern German industry. The Treuhand is negotiating Laubag's sale with a west German consortium led by Rheinbraun, a subsidiary of RWE, the largest of the west German utilities. In the meantime, the agency is preparing Laubag for privatisation. This entails identifying the most profitable and efficient way of mining, which includes transporting brown coal from the five pits that will remain open to feed the power generating blocks that will be modernised or built by Veag. Veag, which also comes within the Treuhand's ambit, is to be privatised as well. Before 1990, Laubag was producing about 200m tonnes of coal a year and employing over 54,000 people. Today, it produces about 89m tonnes and employs 25,000 people. Mr Kurt Hage, a member of Laubag's board, expects that figure to fall further to 14,000. To reduce costs in Laubag and make it more attractive for privatisation Laubag's management has decided to close several mines south of Horno, although they have sufficient brown coal reserves of a quality as good, if not better, as those under Horno, and there is a railway line linking them to the power plants. Essentially, the Treuhand wants to centralise the production and burning of brown coal as much as possible. 'It is about costs,' explains Mr Hage. He believes that by mining under Horno and the surrounding region, which right next to the Janchwalde power plant, transport costs will be reduced. Janchwalde, which has a capacity of 3,000MW, requires an annual supply of 24m tonnes of coal. Mr Hage calculates that mining around Horno, rather than moving brown coal from mines 25km away, will save Laubag between DM4 (Pounds 1.6) and DM7 a tonne in transportation costs. That would makes it even more attractive for prospective buyers. But in order to mine under and around Horno, Laubag requires mining rights for 40 years. The time scale is crucial because the Treuhand is insisting that the Rheinbraun consortium should agree to sell an annual 57m tonnes of lignite to Veag for 40 years. 'We have to have these long term coal contracts because it will secure the economic viability of Laubag, and we have to lock the consortium into a price structure for this coal,' explains Mr Helmut Ballon, head of the Treuhand's mining department. But it is not as simple as that. Even if the consortium agrees to these contracts, the governments of Brandenburg and Saxony have to be persuaded to grant long-term mining rights to Laubag. So far they have granted 30 and 20 years respectively. 'The mining rights pose social and political problems for these governments,' says Mr Klaus Schucht, a board member of the Treuhand. 'Long term mining rights means that people will have to be moved out of their villages,' he adds. To make up any possible shortfall between coal delivery contracts and mining rights, the Treuhand is proposing that it pay compensation to the buyers of Laubag, who in turn would have to compensate Veag for any failure to deliver. A similar formula is being worked out for Mitteldeutsche Braunkohle, or Mibrag, brown coal fields in Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony. They are being bought by an Anglo-American consortium, led by Britain's PowerGen, NRG of Minneapolis, and Morrison Knudson of Idaho, and they will supply coal over 40 years to the 1,600MW power blocks Veag is building at Lippendorf But over the next 40 years, the energy landscape in eastern Germany is likely to change. The success of the government's commitment to brown coal depends on the development of the region's manufacturing and industrial base. But in addition gas, especially for domestic heating, is likely to emerge as a powerful competitor to brown coal. This explains why the Treuhand is desperate to privatise Laubag and Veag quickly, so as to speed up investments in modernising Veag before gas becomes a player in the market. The Treuhand has the support of the miners at Laubag and Mibrag, who would resist any attempts to cut production of brown coal. But for the people of Horno, and Mr Siegert in particular, gas, or other alternative supplies of energy would be a Godsend. Rheinbraun and the Anglo-American consortium are holding their breath.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Brown &amp; Jackson criticises its restructuring bankers The directors of Brown &amp; Jackson, the Poundstretcher retail group rescued recently by Pepkor, the South African group, are poised to launch an unusually outspoken attack on their bankers. The company's annual report, which is posted to shareholders today, includes a report saying its banks 'unnecessarily placed at risk the future of the group and the interests of shareholders, other creditors and employees'. The lead bank during three years of restructuring was Midland. Arthur Andersen was appointed as investigating accountants to the company. The latest attack follows a letter in the Financial Times from Mr John Jackson, the company's chairman, last Thursday criticising the existing rules which allow investigating accountants to a company in financial difficulties to be appointed as receivers. Mr Jackson yesterday criticised the banks for charging Pounds 1.5m in 'success fees' contingent on injections of fresh equity over three years during which he said their loans fell from Pounds 27m to Pounds 7m. The company's negotiating position was made more difficult by its protracted discussions with the banks, he added. 'I found the whole experience frustrating and baffling. There was a lack of people (at the banks) with sufficient experience outside banking to enter into a meaningful dialogue with the directors.' 'It's time these sort of things were discussed. There are not many companies that have been through this and lived to tell the tale.' Some observers of the Brown &amp; Jackson restructuring, however, pointed out that the company's problems were deep and complex. It was saved by an equity injection and new banking lines brought by Pepkor. Midland said last night that banking confidentiality precluded it from commenting on its relationship with a customer.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Foreign attractions - Diary of a Private Investor For many years, I have invested directly in a number of foreign companies. With the UK stock market continuing to be jittery over political and economic prospects, investing overseas has increasing attractions. Specialist unit and investment trusts are useful for gaining an interest in a wide spread of companies, particularly in areas where it is difficult for a private investor to make direct investments. But there is still nothing like the thrill of finding an outstanding foreign company and buying shares in it. The investor has a direct relationship with the company and, if its shares race upwards, the effect on a small share portfolio can be considerable. It is also easier to find one or two good companies rather than, say, 100. This is why, even if a trust chooses a company where shares soar by more than 80 per cent, the chances are that most of the other shares in the trust's portfolio will perform less well; thus, the out-performance of one company will be watered down by the rest. This is not to say that an investor should pin all his hopes on one or two shares; even if the shares are chosen carefully, things can still go wrong unexpectedly. There are extra hazards with foreign investments, including currency fluctuations which can affect an investor's profits dramatically. My first overseas investment, many years ago, was in a small Canadian mining company quoted on the Vancouver Stock Exchange. I was working in the Sultanate of Oman at the time and there was no way I could keep completely up to date with the company's share price. Although I had a subscription to a Canadian newspaper, it took some time to arrive. The shares cost me around 45 Canadian cents each. I sold them for more than CDollars 8, only to see them rise even further before they plummeted rapidly. I had a lucky, and profitable, escape. Despite such an unforgettable experience, I have not ventured near the highly-speculative Vancouver market again. Perhaps if I lived in Canada and could monitor market sentiment, rumours and share prices closely, I might well be tempted. This highlights one of the main problems in investing overseas: following the progress of your chosen investment. Being linguistically disadvantaged (the only languages I speak are English and a bit of Cantonese), I have restricted my foreign investments to those companies where the reports are available in English. I did once venture into the Japanese market, where I invested in a company that was too small to feature in the FT's world stock markets' pages. I had no idea how its shares were performing (apart from phoning a London stockbroker) and could not read the all-Japanese report. There were also problems with the custody of the share certificate (it had to be held in Japan). I soon disposed of this aggravating investment. Most of my foreign investments have been in US, Hong Kong and Swiss companies, mainly because I have travelled extensively in those countries and subscribe to US and Hong Kong publications. It is also easy to follow the progress of many major European companies because the Investors Chronicle magazine has a section every week devoted to European company results. Their share prices also appear in the FT. A number of companies, such as Nestle, in which my personal pension scheme has a holding, also are quoted on the London stock market; thus, it is even easier to deal in their shares and monitor their progress. Many private investors continue to think it is difficult to buy shares in foreign companies. Yet, most brokers have some capability in this area and a number of them offer a highly- efficient dealing service. Although shares can be registered in a 'marking' or nominee name, it is possible to hold many foreign shares directly - in which case, the problem arises as to how to handle foreign currency dividend cheques without incurring heavy UK bank charges. The easiest solution is to open an overseas bank account. But you must be careful to keep proper records of any withholding taxes on bank interest so that, where appropriate, these can be dealt with later under any double-taxation agreements between the UK and the country concerned. At one time, my two daughters had shares in Walt Disney in the US, as I thought it would be a useful educational investment exercise. They enjoyed reading the colourful annual report - and I even took them to Disney World so they could inspect one of 'their' company's operations and spend their dividends. We sold the shares some years ago when I had doubts about the viability of Euro-Disney. Indeed, we never bought Euro-Disney shares as we felt this theme park would have had more success in the UK than France. There are other well-known non-UK companies which can be followed - especially those making products used in UK homes every day. I am, for instance, attracted to Dole fruit and juices in the US. A visit to the local reference library to look at Who Owns Whom provided me with the headquarters' address. A letter to the corporate secretary produced a copy of the annual report from which I could start an analysis of the company's investment potential. Many US companies have departments devoted to shareholder relations and are more forthcoming with information than some in the UK. Potential investors should request a copy of Form 10K, which is required of every quoted company by the US Securities and Exchange Commission; this is especially useful because it provides financial and other information, including background details of a company's executive offices. Some US company reports put to shame those produced by many UK companies. Take Knight-Ridder, the newspaper and information services group: it provides a wealth of financial and other information ranging from operating cash flow margins to highs and lows of its share price for each year over the preceding decade. It also includes biographical details of directors and senior management, a brief history of the company, and a huge amount of information concerning the company's operations. I am still digesting it all before making a decision as to whether to invest. Over the years, my US investments have been very profitable - notably Amfac (which owned more than 50,000 acres of Hawaii) and MCA, the entertainments conglomerate - both of which were taken over for sizeable sums. My interests in the US were increased after I sold my holdings in Hong Kong some time ago after becoming concerned about ludicrously high property values. It was all rather reminiscent of Japan. An investor might be attracted to a Hong Kong company because he liked its products - only to find, reading the small print of a report, that much of its profits actually came from property sales or investments in other companies engaged in share or property dealing. I believe Hong Kong shares have much further to fall. Although Wall Street is overdue for a further market correction, I still feel there must be companies worth seeking out in the US for longer-term gains. I hope I can find something attractive in case the UK market disappoints.</p>

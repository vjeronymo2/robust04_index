			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / World Trade News: US cars cost 40% more in Japan A new US-Japan government- sponsored study, to be published today, finds US-made cars are sold in Japan for an average 40 per cent more than in the US, giving Japanese cars an average 20 per cent cost advantage in their 4.3m-vehicle home market. The study, which figures in broader talks this week over a negotiating framework, was conducted by one US and one Japanese research company by agreement between their two governments. Its release, at a time when the US is demanding improved foreign access to the 4.3m Japanese car market, clarifies the obstacles facing foreign carmakers. According to the study, the cost of getting foreign cars approved and adapted in Japan costs up to 5.4 per cent of the estimated transaction price. Import, distribution, advertising, pre-delivery and construction of repair facilities also drive up costs. With land and building prices high, distribution is another obstacle. Only 40 per cent of Japan's dealers handle car imports along with their domestic models, compared to 94 per cent in the US. Only 5 per cent of the dealers handle only imports, compared with 22 per cent in the US. Demand for US cars is hurt by the relatively low trade-in value, particularly compared with European-made cars. The latter also have the advantage of having made big investments in exclusive dealerships in the early 1980s, whereas American companies used Japanese-owned dealer networks. US car companies say they are prepared to invest in the Japanese market, given some assurance of success. In the clash over car trade, US officials yesterday were insisting they are prepared to walk away from an inadequate agreement. They are insisting on numerical goals for 'steady and significant increases' in import penetration. Japan's negotiators are equally insistent that they will not agree to numerical indicators, but the numbers being put forth - 100,000 foreign car purchases a year - have been raised by the Japanese themselves in earlier negotiations. US negotiators want a significant increase in the number of direct franchise agreements between Japanese dealers and foreign vehicle makers; an increase in North American content in parts made by Japanese companies in the US; significant regulatory reform, deregulation and simplification of Japanese government standards and certification; and expansion of business relationships between US and Japanese vehicle companies.</p>

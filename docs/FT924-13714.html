			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Kone rises 19.6% to FM240.6m KONE, the Finnish elevators group, yesterday reported a 19.6 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to FM240.6m (Dollars 51.35m) for the first eight months. The result compares with FM201.1m in the same 1991 period, and was achieved on an 11 per cent increase in sales to FM6.2bn. Operating profits before depreciation rose to FM548.5m from FM499.3m. Kone said its elevators business increased sales by 10 per cent, giving it a 72 per cent share. Kone Wood lifted sales by more than 50 per cent and MacGregor-Navire, the marine technology division, by 23 per cent. New orders during the period were worth FM5.4bn, up 17 per cent from a year earlier. This took the value of the group's order book at the end of August to FM6.8bn, up 12.5 per cent. Kone said it expected a 'satisfactory' development in its financial result in the final four months, with sales and the value of orders received for the year as a whole higher than last year's levels. The company is in talks to acquire a stake in Pragolift, Czechoslovakia's second biggest lift manufacturer.</p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Economics Notebook: A time to look to the future WHETHER by coincidence or design, the approach of pre-Budget purdah for the chancellor and Treasury officials has been marked in recent years by an intensified debate about the conduct of British fiscal policy. This year is no exception. Leaving aside the pre-election war of words over income tax rates, the past week has seen an important proposal from Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, to end the UK's curious practice of splitting the revenue raising and public spending parts of the annual budget process between Budget Day in March and the Autumn Statement in November. Fiscal policy was also high on the agenda of last week's meeting of Neddy, the National Economic Development Council. There, for the first time in years, the Trade Union Congress and the Confederation of British Industry agreed on economic policy. Today Arthur Andersen, the audit and business advisory group, makes a contribution* to the debate on fiscal policy with a suggestion that UK governments should pay more attention to maintaining fairness between generations in their spending and borrowing policies. The authors of the report - Stephen Hailey, Brian Currie and Chris Osborne of Arthur Andersen - contend that Britain's existing cash-based system of public expenditure accounting and control discourages investment and fails to give adequate recognition to the importance of long term commitments in the planning of government spending. A system that paid more attention to inter-generational equity would take the short-termism out of British government spending plans. Cash-based planning has been central to British government spending policy since the mid-1970s when it was introduced in an attempt to prevent run-away government spending stoking inflation in the economy. It was refined in the 1980s and finds its expression each year in protracted negotiations between the Treasury and individual spending departments. Although some aspects of spending - such as social security outlays - are demand-determined, discretionary spending is controlled through the imposition of cash limits. Partly because of this system, the ratio of spending to gross domestic product in Britain fell from 47.5 per cent in the early 1980s to around 40 per cent by the end of that decade. The ratio has since risen under the impact of the recession and is expected to reach 42 per cent in the coming 1992-93 financial year. But according to the Arthur Andersen report, it remains the lowest in the European Community. But Arthur Andersen also notes that the UK government has spent less on investment as a share of GDP than its EC trading partners. As a share of economic output, capital expenditure in the public and private sectors combined is also lower than in France and Germany. The study avoids any contentious debate about the quality of Britain's infrastructure or transport system. But it points out that 'there is room for concern that existing policies may be preventing appropriate levels of investment from taking place'. At times of pressure on the government finances, spending ministers and the Treasury have often found it easier to keep within cash limits by deferring capital spending rather than by cutting current spending. In more normal times, cash based planning can fail to recognise the beneficial consequences of spending which yields results in a time period considerably later than that in which the spending is made. The report therefore urges the UK government to focus more on inter-generational equity when formulating its spending plans. It does not advocate an end to the present cash-based planning system. However, it suggests that government departments, when formulating their spending plans each year, should ask which current expenditure would yield significant benefits in future periods, and what significant commitments have been placed on taxpayers in future periods by current policy decisions. The answers to these questions would reveal the broad shifts in inter-generational equity that have occurred through government spending plans. If the gains and losses to future generations of today's spending decisions were divided into time blocks of, say, five years, governments would have a better idea of how to split the financing burden between taxation and borrowing. In the case of public investment, the present generation would be passing on benefits to future generations. Borrowing to cover that investment would ensure that the generation that receives the benefits carries its share of the costs rather than heaping all on to today's taxpayers. This principle is already established practice in other countries. Germany, for example, links the amount of government borrowing that is allowed to the level of investment by the state. Looking at Britain today, the Arthur Andersen report suggests that such an analysis could justify increased government borrowing to finance investment. Such a move might also be justified by the relatively low burden that future generations of UK taxpayers face as a result of existing commitments. Britain's tax and benefits system does not face the same sort of pressure caused by a rapidly ageing population as do those of Japan and some other industrialised countries. Britain also spends proportionately less than other countries on social costs, so that increases in social costs that will arise from changes to the dependency ratio should not be as severe as in other countries. So does the Arthur Andersen analysis mean that the present government, or whichever political party wins the general election, should relax cash limits on spending and consciously step up borrowing to boost investment? One expert on public spending policy sounds a note of caution. Andrew Likierman, professor of accounting and financial control at the London Business School, points out that cash planning was introduced in response to the very high inflation of the 1970s. More recent history has shown that Britain remains an inflation-prone country. Even though inflation has fallen sharply in the last 15 months and the UK is subject now to the discipline of the European exchange rate mechanism, the government would have to 'look very carefully' at the implications of moving from the existing system of public expenditure planning, he says. *Financing the Future: an alternative perspective for government financial planning.

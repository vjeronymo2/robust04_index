			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / TUC counts cost of equal pensions Equalising the state pension age at 65 will cost women aged between 20 and 44 an average of Pounds 14,756 each, says the Trades Union Congress. The pensions bill, expected soon, will introduce a common retirement age of 65 for men and women following a European ruling that the present retirement ages of 65 for men and 60 for women are discriminatory. The TUC says: 'The government is replacing direct discrimination in pension age by indirect discrimination. 'Men, and in particular relatively affluent men, are far more likely to have pension arrangements that will allow them to take early retirement, therefore a pension age of 65 will lead to more women than men having to work until the state pension age.' The change will be phased in between the years 2010 and 2020. Women now over 44 will still be able to retire at 60 but those born after March 1955 will have to wait until they are 65. Women now aged between 38 and 43 will receive a state pension when they are aged between 60 and 65. The TUC estimates the total cost to women between 20 and 44 at Pounds 139bn, and has used the last census to break down the total lost pension in England and Wales by region, county and district council. The TUC said the government had estimated that it would cost Pounds 3.5bn a year to equalise the state pension age at 60, but the unions say this rests on extremely pessimistic actuarial assumptions. They commissioned an independent projection which put the cost as low as Pounds 700m a year after taking into account savings in unemployment and other benefits from younger people moving into jobs freed by those retiring.</p>

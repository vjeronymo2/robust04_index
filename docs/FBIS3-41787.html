Deputy Chief of Kazakhstan's Sanitary and Epidemiological  Station Rufina Ivanova told INTERFAX that the final diagnosis  would be announced after the results of the tests were  available, presumably on November 9.    The condition of three patients is rather serious and of the  rest of the patients - satisfactory.    The epidemic is believed to have been caused by cattle which  had not undergone veterinary control.    This year, 22 cases of malignant anthrax have been  registered  in Kazakhstan (last year - 25).</p>

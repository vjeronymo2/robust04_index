Teammate Nikki Bodowy also had 20 points and pulled down 10 rebounds.  Freshman Anjanette Dionne had 14 points and 5 steals.  </P> <P> In another Southern Section game:  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks 70, Simi Valley 48 -- Freshman Michelle Palmisano scored a  game-high 22 points and Shani Smyth added 19 as the Lancers (13-2) ran away  with their Marmonte League opener.  </P> <P> CITY SECTION  </P> <P> Reseda 75, Poly 22 -- Aggie Garcia scored 22 points for Reseda (5-3), which  made 72% of its field-goal attempts in a Valley Pac 8 Conference opener at  Poly.  </P> <P> Kennedy 70, Taft 14 -- Felicia Stanley scored a game-high 23 points as the  Golden Cougars (5-2) romped in the Northwest Valley Conference opener at  Kennedy.  </P> <P> El Camino Real 92, San Fernando 22 -- Cathy Balint had 28 points and 12 steals  and Alex Guidi had 17 points and 10 rebounds to pace the Conquistadores (6-4)  in a nonleague game at El Camino Real.  </P> <P> North Hollywood 64, Grant 29 -- G. G. Sweet scored 20 points and Melinda Anger  added 10 rebounds for the Huskies (8-3) in a Pac 8 Conference opener at Grant.  </P> <P> Van Nuys 63, Sylmar 36 -- Stacey Toon scored 25 points and the Wolves outscored  Sylmar, 40-11, in the second half of the Pac 8 Conference opener at Sylmar.  </P></p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Legal &amp; General L&amp;G's results yesterday were not as bad as they looked. The 22 per cent fall in pre-tax profits was caused by the group's disconcerting practice of including unrealised investment losses. Excluding these, earnings growth was 61 per cent, although the figures were flattered by clement weather, which reduced claims on property insurance, and an absence of IRA bombs in the City. Nevertheless, the clouds are gathering. The general insurance business, which posted good results, will suffer as the premium cycle turns. More worrying are the prospects in UK life and pensions. The imposition of commission disclosure next year looks set to depress overall demand. A further obligation to give details about expenses will favour those with the lowest overheads. L&amp;G is battening down the hatches for the post-disclosure squall, cutting costs and increasing productivity. The long-term growth prospects for the UK market are nevertheless promising. Ageing baby-boomers will increasingly be attracted by savings products; the state's ability to fund adequate pension provision must be questioned, in which case the private sector will step in; and a low-inflation environment encourages savings. With L&amp;G's shares at an 18 per cent discount to net assets - including the embedded value of the life fund - the market has already recognised the scale of the short-term difficulties to come.</p>

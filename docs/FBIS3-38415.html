In a statement the spokesman said  it was important to put the record straight. Our political  editor Donal Kelly:    [Kelly] Mr. Molyneaux made his claim in an interview in THE  SCOTSMAN newspaper. He said that in talks with the British  prime minister he had vetoed Dublin's proposals for a  British-Irish convention which would have had power over a new  northern assembly.    However, the government spokesman said that at no stage in  the drafting of the declaration had such a body been proposed.  The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, or convention, had  always been intended as a consultative body, he said, and apart  from the name change it was in all essentials what had been  originally put forward.    The spokesman also said that the first draft of the  declaration contained eight paragraphs, not 30 as claimed by Mr.  Molyneaux. At the behest of the taoiseach [prime minister]  three or four additional ones in the final document recognized  Unionists' fears and concerns. He added that there appeared to  be some confusion with the draft of the leaked Irish paper,  which had never been submitted to the British Government, and  which had been intended for the entirely separate talks process.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Worm may turn India's exports - Kunal Bose on moves to revolutionise the country's silk production and limit imports India, a distant second to China in silk production, is hardly able to use 15 per cent of the indigenous silk yarn for making exportable silk goods. While there is a big domestic market for silk saris and dress materials in India, much of the local yarn is not good enough in terms of strength and lustre for producing exportable items. 'Our export of silk goods is pathetically dependent on imported yarn,' says Mr S. Shah, spokesman for the Silk Association of India. 'We are importing over 3,000 tonnes of yarn to sustain the production of exportable goods. Our principal source of import is China,' In spite of the structural weakness of the Indian silk sector, the export of silk goods was up 7.8 per cent to Rs7.92bn during the year to March 31. In the past few years, however, India had recorded a much higher rate of export growth. The most important destination for Indian silk goods was western Europe, with a share of 43.5 per cent, followed by the US (39.4 per cent) and Asia (15.4 per cent). The structural weakness resulting from over-dependence on the import of silk yarn cannot be overcome in the immediate future. The Central Silk Board is, however, banking on a Japanese government-funded project to develop a race of acclimatised bivoltine silkworms producing a stronger fibre than India's multivoltine worms. The richness of Chinese silk is due to the practice of bivoltine sericulture on a large scale. China produces nearly 55,000 tonnes of silk yarn a year, of which as much as 85 per cent is exported. Mr PSS Thomas, secretary of CSB, says: 'The laboratory work on the development of bivoltine silkworms has been quite encouraging and we should be ready for field trials later this year.' In India, the cocoon created by multivoltine worms has a silk content of about 17 per cent. But the silk content could go up to 24 per cent if it is formed by bivoltine worms. But a breakthrough in sericulture cannot be taken for granted until the field trials are over. Bivoltine silk worms do well in temperate zones, but most of India has a tropical climate. For the the bivoltine project to succeed, the sericulturists must also be exposed to sophisticated rearing and reeling practices. In spite of the many uncertainties surrounding the project, Mr Thomas says it should be possible to produce 1,000 tonnes of bivoltine silk in 2 1/2 years. Self-reliance in raw silk is not a high priority in a regime of free trade where the import of silk yarn is allowed on condition of the export of silk goods (after a high degree of value addition). Nevertheless, the industry believes that if India is able to produce 'a respectable quantity of good-quality bivoltine silk', then its silk trade will become stable. According to industry officials, the past 18 months have shown how much the Indian trade in silk is influenced by Chinese prices. When China made a drastic cut in silk prices early last year, the bottom fell out of the Indian trade and growers started losing interest in silk. Fortunately, the cocoon and yarn prices have once again become remunerative. But this is also seen as a reaction to the revision in silk prices by China.' While the Central Sericulture Research Institute at Mysore is responsible for the development of bivoltine silkworms, the Indian Institute of Science at Bangalore has created the country's first genetically engineered silkworms. The scientists behind the IIS project say a proper selection of genes 'could revolutionise the Indian sericulture'. The genetically engineered silkworms should be able to withstand a virus attack, and it should be possible to produce coloured silk from them. But Mr Thomas is not expecting a breakthrough overnight. 'Anything to do with biotechnology needs time and investment,' he says. 'What the CSB is planning to do is to involve a number of national and foreign institutes to work on the development of new races of productive and disease resistant silkworms.' The challenge before India is to improve the growers' return from sericulture. With the productivity of raw silk stagnating at less than 40kg a hectare (2.471 acres) compared with more than 80kg in China, the growers may switch to crops such as sugar cane, cotton and oilseeds, industry officials fear. Because of the comparatively high returns from the other crops, sericulture, under a six-year project funded by the World Bank, could make little headway in non-traditional silk-growing states such as Rajasthan and Gujarat. But progress in the five traditional silk producing states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Jammu &amp; Kashmir, as well as in some non-traditional areas, in bringing new areas under sericulture and changing silk growing practices is encouraging. The CSB is hopeful that by 1996-97 when the World Bank project is over, India's production of mulberry silk will have increased to 16,000 tonnes. When the project was launched in 1988-89, India's production of mulberry silk was only 9,500 tonnes and much of it of inferior quality. This year, India is expecting a mulberry silk production of 14,425 tonnes.</p>

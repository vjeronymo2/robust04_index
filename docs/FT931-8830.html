			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Late closing bourses feel effect of US weakness BEFORE Wall Street opened yesterday, Frankfurt was showing relative strength in a dull Europe and strategists were saying that the Netherlands, Switzerland and Spain looked like better value, writes Our Markets Staff. Afterwards, the late closing markets - including the Netherlands, Switzerland and Spain - were more obviously marked by the Dow's setback. PARIS had generally been inactive ahead of Wall Street but then lost 2 per cent quickly before recovering a little in the last few minutes of trading. The CAC-40 index finished the day 21.32 lower at 1,878.17 in turnover of FFr2.4bn. There was little fresh corporate news to arouse interest. CarnaudMetalbox, which resumed trading after Monday's suspension, closed 6 per cent lower, down FFr12.90 at FFr197.10 while CGIP, a major shareholder, dipped FFr49, or 4 per cent, to FFr1,036. On Monday MB-Caradon of the UK said that it wanted to dispose of its 25 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox and yesterday the stock market regulator said that it had no objection to CGIP raising its stake by 7 per cent without making a full bid. ZURICH, which was promising a strong performance before Wall Street showed its weakness, came back late on the Dow and the lower dollar to close with the SMI index 14.4 down at 2,130.4. Multinationals and banks were the chief victims. Nestle bearers eased SFr15 to SFr1,095 and Brown Boveri by SFr30 to SFr3,930 as CS Holding fell SFr40 to SFr2,130. The chocolate maker, Lindt &amp; Sprungli, was active on continuing takeover speculation and the bearers rose SFr600 to SFr17,700. MADRID took one of the biggest European tumbles on theWall Street slide, the general index closing 3.25, or 1.4 per cent lower at 233.45. Repsol went down with the market, losing Pta40 to Pta2,800 on the day that it heralded an international institutional placement of its equity as a further step in its privatisiation process. FRANKFURT refused to consolidate gains seen in London on Monday afternoon, and the DAX index eased by 0.49 to 1,664.22 in turnover up from DM5.6bn to DM7.3bn. Yesterday afternoon was a different matter, as blue chips reacted individually, rather than en bloc to the slide on Wall Street. Volkswagen was the most serious casualty, dropping DM6.90 to DM284.10 on the official session following the DB Research downgrade last Friday, and then tumbling again to DM278 in the post-bourse. AMSTERDAM declined towards the close, the CBS Tendency index falling 0.8 to 98.3. Royal Dutch lost Fl 2.10 to Fl 152.30 as the Opec meeting remained stalled while Oce-van der Grinten fell Fl 2.40 to Fl 41.00 on a 13 per cent decline in its 1991/1992 earnings. Elsewhere Akzo shed Fl 1.00 to Fl 149.20 and Unilever was Fl 2.20 weaker at Fl 195.00. DUBLIN, with the latest close in Europe, reflected renewed sickness in the Dow at Wall Street's midsession with the ISEQ overall index 24.32, or 1.9 per cent lower at 1,277.68. BRUSSELS weakened with Petrofina giving up some of the gains it has made over the last six sessions. The Bel-20 index closed 3.48 lower at 1,207.57 in turnover of BFr873m as Petrofina shed BFr40 to BFr7,980. MILAN again featured Fiat on a day which saw mild profit-taking. Fiat, continuing to deny reports that it might be considering reorganisation plans or the sale of some of its assets, fixed L141 lower at L5,099 before L5,075 on the kerb. But the group's chemicals division, Snia, attracted interest, gaining L85 to L1,130 before rising to L1,150 on the kerb. The Comit index eased 0.02 to 500.27 on the first day of the new account. STOCKHOLM, which extended the session by 90 minutes following earlier technical problems, was strong in banks on hopes that proposed accounting rule changes would benefit the sector. Handelsbanken B shares gained SKr2.50 to SKr53.00 and S-E Banken rose SKr2.50 to SKr14.50. The Affarsvarlden general index rose a modest 0.9 to 984.6 in turnover of SKr724m. Skandia went against the trend, falling SKr8 to SKr109 after announcing that it would pass its 1992 dividend. VIENNA rose on the day with a gain in the ATX index of 13.85 to 815.18. Lenzig was one of the best performers, rising Sch16 to Sch570. ATHENS, once again, seemed to acknowledge that some of its recent enthusiasm had been misplaced, the general index dropping another 15.46 to 776.75. This left it 12 per cent down from last week's 1993 peak, but still registering a gain of over 15 per cent on the year so far.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- February 16                                        THE EUROPEAN SERIES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                 Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1130.07    1127.57    1127.57    1128.13 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1182.17    1180.24    1179.73    1183.20  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1128.11    1127.44    1125.09    1123.14 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1182.33    1182.27    1179.83    1179.54  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         Feb 15    Feb 12    Feb 11    Feb 10     Feb 9  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1132.97   1129.97   1126.71   1121.50   1124.14 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1184.15   1181.05   1175.45   1171.08   1177.40  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1130.07; 200 - 1183.55 Low/day: 100 - 1122.64 200 - 1177.22  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOEING'S BILLINGS MAY BE SUBJECT OF PROBE  </P> <P> A federal grand jury is investigating allegations against a Boeing Co. division  and at least one mid-level company official of overcharging the Air Force  millions of dollars, a newspaper reported.  </P> <P> The government contends that Boeing Military Airplanes of Wichita overcharged  the Air Force $11 million during the past decade on contracts to replace the  aluminum skins of KC-135 transports and refueling tankers, the Wichita Eagle  reported.  </P> <P> Because the five-year statute of limitations expired on some of the contracts,  the felony criminal investigation is limited to alleged overcharges of $3  million to $5 million.  </P> <P> The Defense Department is considering civil action to try to reclaim all $11  million, according to Defense Department sources who requested anonymity, the  newspaper said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Company Cooperating  </P> <P> Any convictions could result in a possible maximum penalty of 10 years in  prison and $500,000 in fines. The company could be fined $1 million in addition  to repayment of overcharges.  </P> <P> The newspaper quoted Defense Department sources as alleging that the Boeing  division charged the government 12% to 13% more for aluminum than it was paying  its suppliers, a markup not allowed under such military contracts.  </P> <P> Boeing Military spokesman Richard Hill said the company has been cooperating  fully with the investigation.  </P> <P> "The issues pertain to the pricing of certain raw materials used in the  performance of the contracts, and it involves complex regulatory and accounting  principles," Hill said.  </P> <P> He refused to explain Boeing's position further.  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors plan to present a draft indictment to the grand jury before  the statute of limitations expires early next month, the Eagle reported.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni </F> Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of the  Yemeni Socialist Party, by unidentified AL-WASAT reporter  "during his stopover in Abu Dhabi;" date not given]    [Text] [Reporter] How do you interpret the clashes and  security incidents that occurred immediately after the signing  of the Accord and Pledge Document? Does it mean that a major  defect is still there?    [Muhammad] First, I would like to briefly explain that the  conflict in Yemen has not ended. It is common knowledge that  this conflict is taking place between two major orientations.  The first is leading a drive for modernization, building the  institutions and the state of law and order, and creating a  system of domestic and foreign relations. The basis of this  orientation is the emerging democracy and its ideas. Democracy  has become one of the phenomena of the age. The first  orientation aspires for change, leaving the 20th century and  entering the next century, and creating new circumstances for  the coming generations. The second orientation is the  conservative orientation, represented by the General People's  Congress, the Reform Grouping, and their allies. Those  supporting this orientation are ready to do anything to maintain  the current situation and the existing system. In sum, they  want to return Yemen to the situation which existed in the  former Yemeni Arab Republic. Hence, this orientation views  changes and evolution with fear and caution. They fear that  they might lose certain interests, which they grabbed after they  controlled the existing institutions, especially the tribal and  military institutions. Therefore, they do not want to permit  the emergence of civilian institutions in accordance with a  modern democratic system.    [Reporter] What has made matters often escalate to a  military  confrontation, and sometimes to security disorder?    [Muhammad] There has been systematic and premeditated  terrorism. Terrorist operations have been pre-arranged.  Assassinations, explosions, highway robberies, lootings, rapes,  and other forms of terrorism occurred. Moreover, these  operations took a serious turn and began to include domestic and  foreign investments. Besides, foreign experts have been  kidnapped and companies, especially oil companies, have been  threatened. Tourists and foreign embassies have been  threatened. The main objective is to destroy the unity process,  abort democracy, and hinder any attempt for change. This is in  order to maintain their control of the country and to bring  everybody under their authority.    [Reporter] Do you believe that a final solution has been  provided by the signing of the document, or is the country and  its unity still in danger?    [Muhammad] Let us be frank, certain parties inside the  General People's Congress and the Reform Grouping are not  satisfied with the document. Their signing of it does not mean  that everything will proceed well. Some influential parties  reject the contents of the document. This explains the  continued military confrontations and military incidents. Those  parties will continue their attempts to exacerbate the security  situation and create problems in order to keep people  preoccupied, evade implementation of the document, and, at the  same time, put the blame on us. This is evidenced by the fact  that the other party has no desire or intention to take to  justice those pepole involved in cases of assassinations and  explosions, they have no intention of making reforms, and they  continue military provocations.    [Reporter] Some say that al-Bid's failure to come to Sanaa  gives the other side a justification for not implementing the  document?    [Muhammad] I want to ask: Who guarantees al-Bid's life if he  goes to Sanaa? Who can go to Sanaa when he feels that his head  is wanted? We say that they must implement all items of the  document before al-Bid goes to Sanaa. The guarantee is  implementation of all clauses of the document, especially since  we are still witnessing assassinations, houses and offices being  blown up, and other practices which cannot be approved by any  norms or laws whatsoever.    [Reporter] Do you deem the signed agreement an absolute  guarantee for maintaining unity and removing the threat of  separation? What are the external effects on the situation in  Yemen?    [Muhammad] The agreement is not a medical prescription.  Having it signed does not mean that it has become the only  guarantee for maintaining unity. The threat of separation is  still there. Although the agreement has been signed, nothing has  changed yet. This agreement provides guidelines and programs  which need political will to be implemented. They also require  balanced internal and external support. This is what we are  trying to do through our recent and current tours. We want a  presence by our brothers in Arab Gulf states. This covers, for  example, neighboring states, such as Saudi Arabia and Oman, as  well as the Gulf Cooperation Council states. Eritrea, Egypt,  Syria, and then the Arab League and the world, such as the  United States, some European countries, and even Russia are also  needed. These countries can help Yemen's peaceful unity  process. This is because we have common interests. Besides, we  must reassure our neighbors that our unity does not threaten  them if it is based on reason, good-neighborliness, good  relations, and cooperation. Why should our relations with our  neighbors not be excellent? It is not in our interest to be  anyone's enemy. This is what we believe in and work to see  happen. Hence our tours.</p>

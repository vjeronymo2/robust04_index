			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Kinshasa, 17 Jun (AFP)--The government of Etienne  Tshisekedi, leader of the Zairian radical opposition, today  termed the election of the new Zairian prime minister, Kengo Wa  Dondo, as "illegal and unconstitutional." "The only legal and  legitimate transitional government remains the one that is led  and should be led by the prime minister who was democratically  elected at the national conference and confirmed by the  political class to which the head of state does not belong, in  accordance with Article 78 of the transition constitutional  act," the radical opposition pointed out in a communique  published by the opposition media.    Mr. Tshisekedi's supporters feel that he is the only one who  was mandated by the radical opposition grouped under the  umbrella of the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR].  However, the moderate faction of USOR, led by the Union for the  Republic and Democracy [URD], does not share this opinion. The  URD presented three candidates, including Kengo Wa Dondo, for  the post of prime minister. These divergent views caused a  split within the USOR, characterized by the exclusion of  political parties and personalities from the union. The USOR is  currently divided into two factions -- a moderate one  represented by the URD and a "hardline" one led mainly by  Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress.

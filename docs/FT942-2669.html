			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Swissair ponders Sabena stake to gain EU hub Swissair is discussing a strategic alliance with Sabena that might see the Swiss airline acquire a large minority stake in the Belgian national carrier. Swissair confirmed yesterday that it was holding talks with Sabena as well as with other European airlines, but declined to comment on a report that it was considering buying a 49.5 per cent stake in the Belgian carrier. Sabena also confirmed talks with Swissair but added that it was also holding discussions with American Airlines over a possible link-up. Last week American confirmed to Sabena an undisclosed co-operation offer. A Sabena official drew a distinction between talks and negotiations and said Sabena was talking 'to a lot of people'. But Belgian government officials described as 'completely plausible' the report of the possible acquisition by Swissair of a minority stake in Sabena. They added that the Belgian government would not object to a Swissair minority stake as long as the Belgian state maintained majority control of its airline. Sabena is currently 61.8 per cent state-controlled. A large minority stake in Sabena would finally give Swissair a base in the European Union to take advantage of the EU single aviation market. Swissair's biggest handicap is its lack of free access to the liberalised EU aviation market, especially since the airline appears to have lost any hope of overcoming it through an air transport agreement between the Swiss government and the EU. The Swiss airline also indicated that it intended to expand its airline partnerships after the collapse last year of the so-called 'Alcazar' plan to merge Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System and Austrian Airlines. 'Several European carriers are involved in the discussions, including Sabena,' Swissair said yesterday. A report published today in Cash, the Zurich financial magazine, refers to a detailed document setting out the strategic importance for Swissair to acquire a stake in Sabena. The report said Swissair intended to acquire a 49.5 per cent stake in Sabena by buying Air France's 37.5 per cent holding and a further 12 per cent stake in Sabena held by four financial companies controlled by the Belgian government. Swissair said the article was based on one of a number of papers prepared by McKinsey, the business consultants. 'It is not Swissair policy to comment publicly on any proposals or recommendations which such documents may contain,' it added. Air France said it had no comment on the talks between Sabena and Swissair. It added that its original agreement with Sabena left open the possibility for another airline to acquire a minority stake in the Belgian carrier. Although Sabena has become increasingly unhappy with Air France as a minority shareholder, the financially troubled French carrier may be reluctant at this stage to shed its stake, airline industry officials said yesterday. The sale of its Sabena stake risked complicating its efforts to win European Commission approval for its proposed FFr20bn (Dollars 3.5bn) French government capital injection, they added.</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Stock index futures ended the trading account on a dull note as worries about the outlook for the UK economy outweighed better than expected figures on UK inflation, writes Joel Kibazo. After opening at 2,528 the September contract on the FT-SE drifted lower in quiet trading to reach 2513 by 10 am. The release of better than forecast UK inflation figures caused a turnaround in September and sent the contract forward reaching 2,537 around midday. This proved to be the high for the session with dealers thereafter focussing on the negative aspects of the economy. A firm Wall Street had no impact and September eventually closed at 2,509, down 12 on Thursday's close and around 5 points below its fair value premium to cash of about 25. Turnover reached 7,194 contracts. Turnover in traded options improved to reach 33,867, against Thursday's 31,998 lots. Volume in the FT-SE option was also better reaching 12,066 lot. Asda was the busiest stock option with 2,015 total trades while the HSBC stock option which began trading yesterday recorded 640 trades by the close.</p>

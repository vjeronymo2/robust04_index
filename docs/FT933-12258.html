			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Arts: How many orchestras do we need? - Sir Alan Peacock adds his voice to the Arts Council cash debate THE Arts Council has had a difficult time over the recent decision to fund only two orchestras in London. Following a long tradition of assuming infallibility in cultural judgments, musical pundits have ritually castigated the Council for having the courage of its convictions. But it has taken nearly 25 years for the Arts Council to endorse the findings of the closely-reasoned Report of the Orchestral Resources Enquiry published in 1970. Let me declare an interest. I was the chairman of that enquiry, which included among its musician members such luminaries as Malcolm Arnold, Myers Foggin and Thomas Russell. Lord Goodman, the then chairman of the Arts Council, disregarded the advice of his music committee and offered the committee the choice of revising its conclusions or having them denounced on publication. The committee refused to budge. A charter for sensible funding, not only of London but of all government-assisted orchestras, was torn to shreds. In the interim, our ideas have regained currency. The more thoughtful internationally-known conductors and players have recognised that squaring the interests of those who perform music with those who have to pay the piper is a much more complex matter than would appear from the emotional outbursts of musical interest groups. I am proud of that report but my views on funding the arts have changed considerably since those days. Such views cannot be divorced from one's value judgments about the 'good society'. I would like as many people as possible to have the opportunity to enjoy good music and to be so taken with it that they are willing to pay for it. Only the integration of arts education with our general education will achieve such an objective. There is a dilemma in the case of music because many serious composers of today are not primarily interested in winning over the public but in maximising their reputation with each other. There is nothing inherently wrong in their doing so - at their own expense. I calculate that no orchestra in the UK can afford to offer living composers more than 10 per cent of its programme time. Still, I support the funding of new and unfamiliar musical experiments. However, the general aim to be achieved - I suspect never completely - will be to adopt funding methods which win the public round to voluntary support so that state funding becomes unnecessary. The emphasis in funding should shift towards supporting music societies and educational institutions, and even individuals through voucher systems targeted to particular groups. It is a far cry from this description of the ideal to the realities of direct funding of major symphony orchestras (along with all large arts companies) which have acquired all the advantages of incumbency. If we have to live with this method In the meantime, then some of its worst features should be eradicated. The most important one is that it encourages the belief among the big players that they have a right to direct funding in perpetuity. This is surely wrong. The interest of the tax-paying public is in specific art forms, music being a major one, and the 'demand mix' will change as public tastes develop. That being so, the system of direct subsidy must be flexible between different art forms and between those wishing to provide the services required within each art form. There should be more open competition for funding. Arts companies should hold 'franchises' for a number of years, after which the franchise holders would have their performance measured against that of possible new entrants. The Arts Council proposals for funding London's orchestras is therefore a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will pave the way for the more flexible funding arrangements that I have proposed. First, the concentration of funding to achieve artistic excellence makes sense. Second, it would be wrong to 'Balkanise' artistic funding and give the London so-called 'national' orchestras, opera and ballet companies direct access to the Department of Heritage. This is merely a device for special treatment which conflicts with the present policy of increasing access to arts events nationally. There is no reason why the top slice of arts funding should be allocated to metropolitan institutions, and every reason why the Arts Council should decide on the 'opportunity cost' of funding them, alongside the alternative uses of funds. Third, those who have mocked the setting up of a committee under Sir Leonard Hoffman which will recommend who will join the LSO as the second funded orchestra lay themselves open to the charge that they believe that any recommendation should be supplied only by those who represent the producer interest. I agree that a necessary condition for being chosen must be clear evidence of artistic excellence, but this in itself is not a sufficient condition. Evidence of good management and a firm commitment to winning audiences for adventurous programmes must also be provided. The Arts Council is an easy target. Those who are denied funding protest about those who get it, and those who get it protest that what they get is not enough. Being a member is the easiest way of losing friends and alienating people. The Bard says somewhere that 'rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind'. Whatever decision the Arts Council eventually takes about the second orchestra, reasonable people may disagree with it. The trouble is that the voice of reason may be difficult to detect among those who trade in cultural polemics. When it comes to spreading light rather than heat about the funding of the arts, the musical public is at present particularly poorly served by influential metropolitan critics. Sir Alan Peacock was Chairman of the Scottish Arts Council (1986-92). The themes in this article are expanded in his forthcoming book, Paying the Piper, to be published in September by Edinburgh University Press.</p>

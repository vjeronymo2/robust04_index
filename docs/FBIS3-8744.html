In current prices, it reached a value of  336.7 billion korunas [Sk], which was 11.6 percent more than the  year before. Completed investments reached a value of almost  Sk102 billion, which represents a 10-percent increase in nominal  terms but a 6 percent drop when price growth is taken into  consideration.    Slovakia exported Sk167.2 billion worth of goods last year,  with the largest volume of exports going to the Czech Republic  [CR]. Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Russia follow at some  distance. At the same time, exports to the CR dropped more than  11 percent [compared with 1992]. The greatest volumes of goods  to Slovakia were imported from the CR, Russia, Germany, and  Austria. The surplus of imports over exports is reflected in a  balance-of-trade deficit of Sk26.7 billion. A surplus of Sk1.3  billion was achieved in the trade balance with the CR.    An average of 1,924,900 people were working in the national  economy last year, 3.2 percent less than the year before. The  level of employment declined throughout the year, with the  exception of the second quarter. The level of employment in  enterprises in private ownership, including cooperatives,  increased 0.9 percent. The steepest decline in employment was  recorded in the sphere of material production. It was offset by  higher employment in banking and services.    The average nominal monthly wages per employee in the  national economy reached Sk5,372 last year, which represents an  increase of 18.5 percent. Real wages declined 3.5 percent,  however, compared with 1992. The most rapid increase in average  monthly wages, by 30.4 percent, was in small enterprises with up  to 24 employees, where they reached Sk6,675. Average earnings  in enterprises with 25 or more employees increased more than 20  percent, to Sk5,364. The highest level of average monthly  salaries, Sk10,386, was reached in banking and the insurance  business. This represents an increase of 36.6 percent. Monthly  earnings in the production and distribution of electricity, gas,  and water averaged Sk7,767 (an increase of 30.9 percent), and in  the extraction of raw materials Sk6,482 (an increase of 21.8  percent). Average monthly salaries in budget-funded and  subsidized organizations of a nonentrepreneurial nature  increased 10.3 percent, to Sk5,035. The wages of employees in  privately owned businesses are estimated to have increased by  18.2 percent, to Sk5,850.    The greatest profit was made last year in the production and  distribution of electricity, gas, and water. The greatest  losses were suffered in agriculture, gamekeeping, forestry,  retailing, and in repairs of motor vehicles and consumer goods.  Of 4,148 enterprises, 1,763 ended the year with a profit. The  aggregate profit of these firms amounted to Sk68.4 billion,  while loss-making enterprises generated an aggregate loss of  Sk42.6 billion. The liabilities of Slovak enterprises increased  by Sk36.5 billion last year, to Sk373.2 billion.    Small enterprises [with under 25 employees] accounted for  only 8 percent of total industrial output and for 9.8 percent of  building industry output. Small enterprises, including private  businessmen, asserted themselves most markedly in retailing,  where they accounted for 68.8 percent of total turnover. Small  enterprises developed dynamically, in particular, in freight  road transport. Compared with 1992, their performance went up  168.3 percent, while in industry it went up 74.2 percent, in the  building industry 55.4 percent, and in retailing 50.7 percent.    The Slovak Republic had a population of 5,330,000 at the end  of last year, 51.2 percent of which were women. The annual  population growth reached 0.4 percent. Some 8,900 persons  migrated to Slovakia, while 7,200 persons emigrated. A total of  379,170 job seekers were registered with labor offices at the  end of January 1994.</p>

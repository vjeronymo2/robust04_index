			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondents Boris Vlasov and </F> Dmitriy Gorokhov]    [Text] Pskov 7 April, TASS -- At a final stage of his stay  in Pskov, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev visited on  Thursday the "Kunichna Gora" check point on the Russian-Estonian  border.    Public representatives from the frontier town of Pechory  handed over to him an address in which they expressed an alarm  in connection with Estonia's territorial claims on this ancient  Russian locality and called the leadership to strengthen and  improve conditions on the border.    Andrey Kozyrev called the territorial claims of Tallinn  unfounded and stressed that Estonia, just as Russia, were  recognized within the existing borders. Moscow, the foreign  minister noted, is in the know about these problems and is  closely watching them. It is necessary to strengthen the  border, but at the same time there is no need to make it  "impenetrable." Here, on the spot, Andrey Kozyrev said, an  optimal regime should be determined and a formula found which  will suit both sides.    The problems of the strengthening of the border and the  troops withdrawal are exclusively issues of bilateral relations,  but we are interested that these problems are known and  understood by our neighbors in the region, the Russian foreign  minister pointed out.    At the same time, Andrey Kozyrev noted, there are also  problems of the rights of the Russian speaking population in  Estonia. These issues are not exclusively the subject of the  Russo-Estonian dispute. After all, there is international law  and all-European norms which must be observed. We are raising  this issue very insistently, the Russian foreign minister  emphasised.</p>

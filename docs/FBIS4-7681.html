			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mihai Mihailescu: "Troubled Waters"] </F>   [Text] Slowly but surely, the erosion of the current  power's popularity is reaching to the very top at Cotroceni,  despite the fact that President Ion Iliescu has made fewer  public appearances of late -- as if the presidential institution  in our country is like the one in the democratic countries,  namely totally impartial vis-a-vis the political scene. The  decrease in Ion Iliescu's popularity is an exceptional sign for  our nation, which has been considered as dulled by 50 years of  communism.    If Ion Iliescu wavers, then the power situation is truly  serious, because the current president has more than close links  with the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI] and the justice  structure and is trying to achieve the same thing with the Army,  and also because the executive branch is nothing but Cotroceni's  direct extension. Ion Iliescu is also supported by another  extremely important force: the great magnates of the market  economy, who come from the ranks of the former nomenklatura and  Securitate.    There are troubled waters in the Iliescu bloc. It is not so  much the people's attitude that weakens Iliescu as the trend  toward a split within the Social Democracy Party of Romania  [PDSR]. It is obvious that quite a few people in the ruling  party have realized by now in which direction the wind is  blowing and that we are on the threshold of a process of the  society's normalization.    These people, who are labeled the "reforming wing," are not  interested in going into the opposition but rather in distancing  themselves from a conservative power which, sooner or later,  will give in. The crisis within the PDSR has been accentuated  by the pitiable Vacaroiu government -- a straw cabinet run from  Cotroceni. As a matter of fact, we are facing here a double  crisis of disgrace and conceit.    The antidote to this crisis, namely the emergence (creation)  of a new leader, [PDSR Executive President] Adrian Nastase, is  very interesting.    Nastase began his mission by trying to attenuate the dissent  within the party. However, his chances of success are very  small, because it is difficult, if not impossible, to harmonize  conservatism with reformism. Hence the dissonance occasionally  struck by Nastase. In the morning he makes reformist statements  on the radio, while in the evening he makes conservative  statements on the television. However, all this has little  impact on the population, which is politically untrained.    The second step by Nastase was to trigger off the electoral  campaign for early elections. The intelligent PDSR executive  president realized that these elections can no longer be  avoided. Adrian Nastase is well aware of the significance of  power at the local level, as far as elections are concerned.  The ruling party needs the local administration. The  opposition's mayors are beginning to receive their dismissal.  The idea of early local elections is being spread around and  gaining ground. Even if the power does not manage to lay hold  of the mayoral positions, it will manage to intimidate the  electorate by implying that the power is very strong and that if  the opposition wants early legislative elections, then the power  can also impose early local elections.    All this movement to create a new leader is fascinating. Of  course, Ion Iliescu will often make public appearances alongside  Adrian Nastase, thus drawing the attention of the electorate to  the fact that he is endorsing Adrian Nastase. At the same time,  Mr. Nastase displays an appealing seriousness, compared to Ion  Iliescu's shallow smile. The moment will come when he will also  distance himself from certain insignificant concepts of the  president.    "The old" Iliescu will then pass onto Adrian Nastase the  "secret keys" of the relations with the SRI and with the force  of the former nomenklatura, turned great capitalists overnight.  Anyhow, the current government must be preserved until the  elections.    Why did such a move as the creation of a new leader become  necessary? It is true that Ion Iliescu's image is sinking, but  the elections are legislative, not presidential. Here lies the  PDSR's subtlety -- the party won the previous elections thanks  to its leader. It is trying the same thing again, only this  time the leader will not be the outworn Ion Iliescu but Adrian  Nastase. Therefore, the PDSR is trying to win over a new  electorate; if the party splits, then those who leave will not  be able to take with them part of the electorate.    We wonder whether Nastase will also distance himself from  Ion  Iliescu, if he is successful. After all, Mr. Adrian Nastase is  an intelligent politician. Will he observe the guarantees he  gave? Or do they have something on him to keep him on a leash?    As for us, we must vote. The waters are troubled and they  hide all kinds of fish. Some of them are sharks, with wide open  mouths....</p>

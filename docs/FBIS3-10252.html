			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Morning Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] Alpha 66, the Miami-based counterrevolutionary  group, has threatened to carry out terrorist actions against the  group Pastors for Peace, which has organized the Cuba-U.S.  Friendship Caravan, if the group continues to travel through  U.S. cities.    In a letter sent to that ecumenical organization, the  terrorists say any person who visits Cuba, holds talks, or  supports its authorities directly or indirectly will be declared  a military target, regardless of his nationality or nature [as  heard] and will suffer the consequences inside or outside of  Cuba.    Referring to the warnings by the U.S. Government to those  individuals or groups preparing terrorist actions against third  countries from within U.S. territories, Alpha 66's letter adds  it will stop at nothing and will confront the consequences.    Meanwhile, the coordinators of the Friendship Caravan have  reported the caravan of 70 vehicles traveling through 140 U.S.  cities continues to advance satisfactorily. During the travels  group leaders give lectures, visit churches, and collect  donations. According to plans, the volunteers will reach Laredo,  Texas, on 6 March, and three days later they will cross the  border into Mexico; they will then take the goods to a ship that  will sail to Cuba from the Port of Tampico.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: A change of heart on the way to the party - Gartmore's controversial decision was crucial to the bid OVER 30 years, Mr David Crossland, chairman of Airtours, has probably forgotten more about the holiday business than many travel executives would ever hope to know. But the City was new ground and in three bruising months pursuing rival Owners Abroad in a fiercely contested takeover battle, he had a crash course on how it works. It has been an altogether less rewarding experience and one he will not forget. Not only was the Pounds 290m bid notable for the close finish; when Airtours lapsed its offer on Tuesday, it had the support of investors representing 43 per cent of Owners' shareholders and was only one institutional investor away from victory. Airtours also found itself in a rare three-cornered contest with Thomas Cook, the German-controlled travel agency which was proposing a commercial tie-up with Owners Abroad. When Thomas Cook last week offered to tender for 12.5 per cent of the Owners shares if the bid failed, Airtours faced a competing proposal that was not a competing bid. In the end, Airtours returned empty handed to its Lancashire base because of one controversial institutional decision and because Thomas Cook became a substantial buyer in the market. The crucial decision was that of Gartmore, a 7.8 per cent shareholder in Owners Abroad which eventually sold a third of its stake to Thomas Cook and then refused to assent the rest. By the end of last week, with the largest shareholder, Mercury Asset Management, supporting Airtours and the second largest, Philips &amp; Drew Fund Management, supporting Owners Abroad, this decision proved crucial and a significant blow to Airtours. What was surprising to all sides was that when Thomas Cook first announced its decision to tie-up with Owners Abroad, Gartmore was vehemently opposed. The institution did not like the fact that Owners would issue new shares to Thomas Cook or that it would, in turn, be investing in low yielding fixed rate Thomas Cook paper. The institution was thought to be lukewarm about the benefits of the transaction and wary about the probable savings. Nor was Gartmore believed to be a great fan of the entire Owners Abroad board, following the share price performance and various share sales - totally legitimate though they were - by Mr Howard Klein, the Owners chairman. Such was the disenchantment that a Gartmore fund manager left Airtours with a strong impression that if it should bid for Owners Abroad, Gartmore would lend its support. Something clearly changed on the way to the party. Late in the day, Gartmore is believed to have been impressed by Owners' presentations of the benefits that the Thomas Cook deal would bring. And in common with a number of other institutions, there were doubts whether Airtours could handle nearly doubling its share of holiday market through acquisition after a period of such rapid organic growth. The outcome is a salutary reminder to potential bidders who think they have institutional support but have not received irrevocable support. Ultimately the institutions dance to their own tune, acting in the interests of their clients. Support at one price and in one set of circumstances is no guarantee of support throughout. The other issue was Thomas Cook's purchase of Owners shares early this week, the final blow that toppled Airtours' bid. When Thomas Cook bought its 8.9 per cent stake in Owners Abroad, it attempted to buy from shareholders who were expected to accept the Airtours offer. Such directed purchases are totally within Takeover Panel guidelines which say anyone can buy shares from anyone at any time. So where does the outcome leave the protagonists? Owners Abroad has set itself a tough task to live up to the expectations it created throughout the bid. And having made a serious investment, Thomas Cook now has an even greater incentive to make the commercial tie-up work. Also it would be surprising if Owners Abroad does not appoint new non-executive directors - in addition to Mr Christopher Rodrigues, chief executive of Thomas Cook - to look after the interests of minority shareholders. And Airtours? It is likely it will sell its stake in Owners - the stake is a relatively low yielding asset in an industry that has high returns on capital. This could mean more losses to add to the Pounds 8m, or so, cost of the bid. Mr Crossland could well see his next challenge as trying to prove to the City that they had backed the wrong horse. Owners Abroad might expect a rather focused attack on its market share.</p>

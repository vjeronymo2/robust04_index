			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAX JACOBSON: POLLY'S AND PAPA'S -- AMERICAN AS PEACH PIE AND MOOSE HEADS  </P> <P> Polly's Pies and Papa's Pantry (quick, say it fast as you can 10 times) dish up  solid American comfort foods at bargain prices. No wonder lines spill out the  door at both places during peak hours.  </P> <P> Polly's has had a substantial following for years, but the new Los Alamitos  location, No. 7 in Orange County, is attracting the biggest crowds yet. It's a  bright, sunny spot with the clean, scrubbed look of an upscale candy store. The  interior is a bright, summery peach color, and if you visit a Polly's in the  next few weeks, you'll catch their nine-inch fresh peach pies, too. Go early --  they're often sold out by late afternoon.  </P> <P> Before dessert, there are plenty of ways to convince Mom that you're eating a  balanced meal. Rotisserie chicken is one -- a superbly juicy roast chicken  cooked on the restaurant's Hardt rotisserie, a high-heat system that causes  excess fat to drip off judiciously. The BBQ bacon burger is another: lean beef  on a cracked wheat bun, topped with crackling bacon and a sticky-sweet barbecue  sauce. It's a sloppy, indulgent burger, and I can't imagine how it could be  improved.  </P> <P> Lots of things are sweet here in the pie palace, even too sweet. The Oriental  chicken salad is alleged to have sesame oil dressing, but all I could taste was  sugar. Polly's chili, with ground turkey standing in for the usual ground beef,  may be what the menu calls "heart smart" but it's tongue foolish. It's  discordantly sweet, and you'd need scientific instruments to detect any spices.  </P> <P> But, oh, those pies. First there is the flaky house chicken pie, a sumptuous  offering filled with shredded chicken meat, celery, potato, carrot and fresh  peas. The crust is rich and buttery, and the pie comes smothered in an  old-fashioned gravy. And then there are the dessert pies: creams,  double-crusted specialties and fresh fruit pies. These are unquestionably the  best pies produced in quantity that I've tasted in these parts.  </P> <P> Now that it's summer, there are lots of fresh fruits -- strawberries,  raspberries, ollallieberries and peaches -- heaped onto Polly's rich, flaky  crusts, then bound with a sugar and pectin glaze. The peach is gorgeous with  its majestic yellow hues, and the heavily glazed strawberry pie comes in two  varieties, plain or artificially sweetened. (The sweetener used here is Equal,  making this the lowest in calorie content of any pie they make.) And then there  is my personal favorite, the raspberry pie, slightly tart, wonderfully light  and totally refreshing. It's practically perfection.  </P> <P> Polly's is inexpensive. Burgers, sandwiches and hot dishes are $3.15 to $6.25.  Pies are $2.65 a slice.  </P> <P> Papa's Pantry is a dinner house with a Western twist. Though located in a  Huntington Beach shopping mall, it manages to look exactly like a steakhouse in  western Montana. The walls are covered with real moose heads and cowboy hats,  nooses hang from the dark ceiling like stage lights, tables are draped in  checked cloths -- brown and white ones, as you'd see in a frontier saloon. It  all has an oddly mystical effect, as if the present had suddenly vanished and  become a Rod Serling teleplay.  </P> <P> But the food here, while tasty, is far too ordinary to be served in the  Twilight Zone. It's mostly Western-style grub with all the fixin's -- nothing  unusual to be sure, but competently prepared. All dinners come with a choice of  soup or salad, a choice of potato (ask for the crispy potato pancake) and hot  garlic bread. These are trencherman potions, so bring a hefty appetite. Or a  friend who looks like Hoss Cartwright.  </P> <P> Start with a giant bowl of the house soup, either thick vegetable beef or the  even thicker clam chowder. Salads come with a choice of homemade dressings; the  Caesar is particularly good, with an egg-rich dressing that completely coats  the greens. Appetizers such as onion rings and battered zucchini are good here,  too. The onion rings, big enough to collar a horse, come in a crunchy cornmeal  breading. Fried zucchini is served in big battered sticks that Teddy Roosevelt  would approve of.  </P> <P> The inexpensive main dishes -- prime rib, fried chicken and fresh liver, to  name a few -- are surprisingly good. The prime rib is a tasty bargain at $7.95.  Liver is grilled to order, with sweet sauteed onions and crisp bacon. Chicken  (four pieces) comes in a crunchy crust and is virtually greaseless, and, if you  like, they will charbroil it at no extra cost. Steaks come in all shapes and  sizes, prepared just the way you want 'em at bronc-busting low prices. I tried  the chicken fried steak, a big piece of sirloin steak dipped in egg and deep  fried, and enjoyed every tender bite.  </P> <P> Not everything is perfect here, though. The filet mignon, at $8.95 the most  expensive item on the menu, was so tough that Lee Van Cleef would have sent the  thing back. And this is no place for dessert thrills. There are various  refrigerator cakes that look better than they taste, and a couple of sundaes,  chocolate and butterscotch.  </P> <P> Papa's Pantry is inexpensive. Sandwiches are $3.50 to $5.95. Complete dinners  are $5.95 to $8.95.  </P> <P> PAPA'S PANTRY  </P> <P> 21094 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach  </P> <P> (714) 960-5402  </P> <P> Open for lunch and dinner Monday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.,  Friday and Saturday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Sunday from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.  </P> <P> MasterCard and Visa accepted.  </P> <P> POLLY'S  </P> <P> 3464 Katella Road, Los Alamitos  </P> <P> (213) 430-4541  </P> <P> Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner from 6:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through  Friday, from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.  </P> <P> MasterCard and Visa accepted for purchases of $10 and up.  </P> <P> Also at six other Orange County locations including Fullerton, Huntington  Beach, Irvine, Laguna Hills, Orange and Santa Ana.  </P></p>

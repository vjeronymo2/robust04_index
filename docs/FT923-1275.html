			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Bonn in move to bolster east THE German cabinet yesterday launched an emergency programme to prop up the east's fragile industrial base and protect 400,000 jobs. The scheme includes subsidised financing for foreign construction contracts and the extension of export credit guarantees to barter deals with east European customers who are chronically short of foreign exchange. Bonn has also promised to double federal purchases from east German companies and pay premium prices for goods and services. The main aims are to maintain the former GDR's export links with eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union and to open up new markets in western countries. However, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, who proposed the scheme, was told it must be financed out of existing resources. Chancellor Helmut Kohl said on Tuesday that current annual transfers from the west of DM150bn (Pounds 59bn) marked the limit. Mr Mollemann had claimed earlier that his proposals would need more than DM10bn a year. However, under the stern eye of the Bundesbank, the government is committed to a public spending freeze. Approval of the scheme coincided with an appeal for action from the federation of German industry (BDI). The existence of the east's entire capital goods industry - which accounted for 38 per cent of total industrial sales - was in danger, it said. Western companies, meanwhile, were concerned that falling production and order intake in their factories signalled further economic weakening, the BDI said. The effects of the sluggish recovery in export markets had been exacerbated by a 10 per cent increase in unit labour costs since 1990 and the recent appreciation of the D-Mark. It was becoming increasingly difficult for them to contemplate investing in the east.</p>

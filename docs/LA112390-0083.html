			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TALKS GO THROUGH HOLIDAY IN JAPANESE EFFORT TO BUY MCA  </P> <P> Representatives of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and MCA Inc. reversed an  earlier plan to take a holiday break, and bargained through Thanksgiving in New  York without reaching an agreement under which the Japanese company would buy  MCA.  </P> <P> Individuals close to the bargaining have said that Matsushita has offered in  the area of $70 a share, but that MCA is holding out for at least $75 a share.  </P> <P> Creative Artists Agency Chairman Michael Ovitz, a top Matsushita  representative, did not attend Thursday's negotiations. A spokesman said he was  in Los Angeles with his family and would return to New York when needed.  </P> <P> MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman apparently remained in New York through the  holiday. Further meetings are expected today, and may go through the weekend.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for both sides declined to comment on the talks, but people familiar  with the discussions said the two sides almost reached an impasse Wednesday  night before some changes in position allowed the discussions to continue.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service in  Ukrainian at 1710 GMT on 14 January carries another program of a  series which gives air time to representatives of various  political parties in Ukraine to present their election  platforms. An unidentified presenter announces that today's  program will present the election platforms of the Christian  Democratic Party and the Labor Congress of Ukraine. The Labor  Congress of Ukraine is represented by Yuriy Yekhanurov, deputy  minister of economy, and (Anatoliy Tovstoukhov), the secretary  of the political executive committee of the Labor Congress of  Ukraine. The Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine is  represented by Vitaliy Zhuravskyy, party chairman.    The first representative of the Labor Congress speaks in  Russian. He says the current leadership is to blame for  Ukraine's crisis and the current year's budget, adopted by the  government, is an example of yet another deception of the  people. Therefore, he says, it is clear why political parties  and movements are striving to take power.    As background information, the representative says the Labor  Congress was formed in April 1993 on the basis of the Union of  Small Enterprises, the Union of Leaseholders, several  independent trade unions, youth organizations, and the  all-Ukrainian Association of Entrepreneurs. Today it has a  membership of over 2,000 and affiliations in 18 oblasts and in  Kiev. The party is an independent party of centrist orientation  and its objective is active participation in the election  through the 2nd congress, which is to take place on 29th, the  setting up of the socio-political bloc "Solidarity for the Sake  of Well-Being and Progress," and the party intends to form a  faction in parliament. Among the party's nominees is former  Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma, who was nominated by the  Dnepropetrovsk organization of the Labor Congress of Ukraine.    The representative then states the party's election program  envisages three priorities: man, market economy, and state. In  his opinion, neither the West, as a whole, nor Clinton will help  Ukraine unless it helps itself.    In conclusion, the first speaker says the party favors  expansion of cooperation with Russia and other CIS countries in  the economic sphere. The party believes that Ukraine should be  a presidential-parliamentary republic with the growing  decentralization of the administrative economic system which  should lead to federalism. Enterprises and regions should be  granted more rights; the social policy should be geared to  ensuring people's right to work; salaries and wages should  correspond to the cost of living, and support should be rendered  to young families, pensioners and invalids.    The second representative of the Labor Congress of Ukraine  speaks in Ukrainian. He says the economy should be re-oriented  toward satisfying social needs. One of the goals is to increase  the number of private owners. Private property will be a basis  for improving the economic situation. The state should retain  its functions as a regulator during the transitional period of  market transformations. More jobs should be created as soon as  possible. Credits should be given to working private owners and  to those who wish to build their own homes.    Next, the program's presenter invites the audience to watch  and listen to a video recording of the election speech made by  chairman of the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine Vitaliy  Zhuravskyy.    Vitaliy Zhuravskyy says that it is time to do away with  miserable existences, scanty wages, sky-rocketing prices, the  mafia, and corruption. The Christian Democrats call on the  people of Ukraine to elect honest and decent people to the new  parliament. Ukrainians have always had worse living conditions  than the peoples of democratic countries and those who initiated  perestroyka were the first to flee Ukraine to find refuge  abroad. For example, the former minister of power engineering  of Ukraine, Sklyarov.    Zhuravskyy says the Christian Democrats build their ideology  on the philosophy of faith, hope, and charity. His party will  insist that Ukraine's share of the former USSR property be  returned and that the gold and diamond funds, as well as the  property abroad, be divided fairly. Reforms, he says, should be  launched in practical terms with agriculture being a priority.  The Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine supports different  forms of ownership in the countryside.    Continuing with the economy, Zhuravskyy says the energy  sources must be diversified and energy-saving production methods  must be developed. A rigid credit and financial policy is  imperative to curb inflation. However, most important are  demonopolization and privatization on a nation-wide scale, as a  result of which every citizen should receive his share of the  state property. All forms of ownership: state, joint-stock,  and private must be on an equal footing. The taxation system  should be revised so as to give a boost to the production  sphere.    Zhuravskyy adds that today, during the period of a  transition  to civilized economic relations the teams led by Parliament  Speaker Ivan Plyushch and President Leonid Kravchuk show total  inability and feebleness in forming an efficient government of  reformers.    The Christian Democrats favor a strong and efficient army  which will ensure Ukraine's territorial integrity. Ukraine  should become a state with a powerful space industry, Zhuravskyy  says.    On religion, Zhuravskyy says the Christian Democrats support  the equality of all church denominations and the separation of  church and state. As a human rights organization, the Christian  Democratic Party of Ukraine believes that human rights and the  rights of the nation must not exclude each other.    Finally, Vitaliy Zhuravskyy says his party will use its vast  international relations to cope with the Chernobyl aftermath and  help its victims. Help will also be provided to labor and war  veterans.</p>

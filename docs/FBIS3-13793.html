			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>   [Text] Three weeks after the massacre of the Palestinian  worshipers in Hebron, the UN Security Council, adopting a  resolution which is devoid of any enforcement guarantees, has  merely denounced the Zionists' crime.    The elimination of the name of Jerusalem from the occupied  territories in the implementation articles of the resolution and  voting for each section of each paragraph of the resolution are  some of what Washington has imposed on the Security Council.    Two preliminary sections of the Security Council resolution  say that the Council was shocked by the horrendous massacre of  the Palestinian worshipers at Abraham's Mosque and is concerned  over the Palestinian casualties in the occupied territories as a  consequence of that massacre.    America was the only state which did not agree with the  total  text of the resolution and abstained from voting for its first  two sections.</p>

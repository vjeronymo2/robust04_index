We determined that a ``boundary problem'' existed for a target hospital (that is, the hospital whose wage index value is being calculated) if_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Among nearby hospitals, one or more other hospitals' wage index value is at least .04 greater than that of the target hospital, corresponding to approximately a $100 difference in payments per case, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The hospital with the lower wage index value pays higher wages than the hospital with the higher wage index value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Nearby hospitals'' were defined as the 20 nearest hospitals or if a hospital does not have 20 other hospitals within a 35 mile radius, all hospitals within a 35 mile radius. Table C shows the number of hospitals with one or more boundary problems and the average size of the wage index difference for those boundary problems. An average wage index difference of .12 corresponds to a payment difference of about $300 per case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table D shows the effects that different labor market alternatives would have when compared to the current FY 1994 pre-reclassified wage index. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

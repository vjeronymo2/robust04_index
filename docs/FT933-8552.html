			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Minding Your Own Business: A whole new ball game in Manhattan - A golf range in downtown New York ON A bright afternoon in New York, with the sunshine bouncing off the glassy surface of the Hudson River, the waterfront is alive with the sound of iron hitting ball - a steady thwack, thwack, thwack, interrupted by the occasional curse of frustration or low whistle of appreciation. This is pier 25, or to give it its full title, the Manhattan Golf Club. The club is the first, and so far only, driving range on the famously crowded island that is home to 1.5m residents and 3.2m day workers. No one knows exactly how many of those are golfers, but few doubt that Manhattan Golf Club has exclusive access to the largest number of potential customers of any driving range, anywhere in the world - all of them packed within a few square miles. It was this enormous potential that inspired Greg Cohen and Seth Braunstein, two 24-year old New Jersey entrepreneurs and avid amateur golfers, to set up the range at the end of a disused pier just a drive and a long iron away from the banks, broking houses, insurance companies and trading rooms of downtown Manhattan. Today, nine months after the range opened, Cohen and Braunstein are content with the way their young venture is progressing. When the weather is fine - which in the summer is most days - there is a steady flow of business, a flow that can turn into a flood on warm weekday evenings and sunny weekends. It is all a long way from 1990, when the two recently-graduated friends decided to pursue a long-held ambition to open Manhattan's first driving range. At the start, they were so inexperienced that they set out on foot walking around Manhattan's riverfront looking for possible locations. They did not know that it only needed one call to the New York State department of transport, which owns the island's pierfront, to find out which piers might be available for rent. Their search for a suitable pier, however, took almost two years. Delays were caused by mountains of paperwork and by opposition from local communities and politicians, who feared a driving range would disrupt their neighbourhoods. The slow grind of bureaucracy and drawn-out battles with 'not-in-my-back-yard' neighbours are hurdles many small American businesses have to overcome. Even so, Cohen and Braunstein grew frustrated when local community boards blocked every move. Says Cohen: 'Every time we thought we were getting somewhere, we hit a dead end.' Then, in the summer of 1992, their luck turned when they found an outdoor nightclub on one of the west side piers which had some spare space at the back, space that under the terms of its lease could only be sub-let for 'sport and recreational purposes'. This meant that Cohen and Braunstein could build their range free of interference from the community boards. They quickly struck a deal with the club's owners to pay a rent of slightly more than Dollars 10,000 a month, and the work of converting the pier into a golf driving range began. The costs were considerable. It took three months to build the range. About Dollars 225,000 was spent on materials, and at least three times that figure on labour, says Cohen. The equipment costs were also fairly high. They bought about 70 top-quality clubs, Dollars 12,000 went on an initial batch of golf balls and Dollars 2,000 on the little buggy that collects the balls. From the start, staff expenses were low. Cohen and Braunstein are at the range almost every day, and they hire a couple of part-time employees. Family members are asked to help out when needed, and Hank the rottweiler provides the security. The biggest single component of their operating costs is insurance, which, says Cohen, always had the potential to be a 'deal-breaker' for the entire project. Initially, they feared the annual premiums would run to several hundred thousand dollars, because driving ranges are classified as amusement parks by insurance companies, and therefore as relatively high-risk ventures. Cohen and Braunstein found a small company in Indianapolis which specialises in insuring golf driving ranges. So instead of paying six-figure sums every year for liability cover and property insurance, 'we're barely in five figures,' says Cohen. The Manhattan Golf Club opened in October last year and, given the season, business got off to a slow start. Then, on December 10, bad luck struck, in the form of a powerful winter storm that battered New York with 90-mile-an-hour winds. Pier 25 was hit hard. The storm ripped up the 70ft nets that surround the range, destroyed much of the electrical wiring, and pulled up some of the 90,000 sq ft of Astroturf. Cohen and Braunstein risked their lives to save some of the equipment. 'I'm pretty much irrepressible,' says Cohen, 'but for a while there I was feeling pretty glum. It was one of the worst days in my life.' The storm did about Dollars 250,000 worth of damage. The insurance covered everything, but the repairs took so long that the range did not reopen until April. Since then, business has been good, says Cohen, thanks to publicity from local newspapers, magazines and television stations. Word-of-mouth also spread quickly, particularly among the financial community on Wall Street. A 20ft-by-10ft billboard erected where Pier 25 meets the West Side Highway (the main artery that runs along the river on Manhattan's west side) attracts the attention of passing motorists. Weekends are busiest, followed by weekdays between 4pm and 10pm. There is also a steady lunchtime crowd, and the range is already attracting regulars. 'We have guys who come here twice a day, every day,' says Cohen. The economics of the driving range are fairly simple. It has 24 stalls - a dozen on each of two levels. Balls are sold for Dollars 6, Dollars 9 or Dollars 12 a bucket. (This is considerably more than ranges outside the city charge. But overheads are higher in Manhattan and the fact that the range is the only one on the island, allows for more expensive rates.) On average, customers have been paying Dollars 10 for a bucket, and Cohen estimates that each stall can bring in about Dollars 30 per hour when the range is busy. That means that on a good day, with 16 of the 24 stalls in use for six hours, the range can generate upwards of Dollars 3,000 in cash. That, however, is at the weekend. The place is much less busy on a dreary Tuesday afternoon. Cohen and Braunstein are heavily dependent upon the weather. New York is pleasantly warm or unpleasantly hot for about 5 1/2 months of the year - from mid-April through to the end of September. Although (unlike many other driving ranges) the Manhattan Golf Club does not shut down for the winter - the stalls can be heated and players are sheltered from the rain - driving ranges are inescapably a seasonal attraction. 'People just do not think of going to a range if it's cold and wet outside,' says Cohen. This summer, they have also had to contend with the extreme heat and humidity, and a prolonged heatwave in July kept the number of visitors down. Although the two owners are shy about revealing all their financial details, it is clear that more than Dollars 1m was spent on the driving range. The money came from Cohen's father, a doctor, and a friend of his, a Californian businessman. They will have to be patient investors, because Cohen and Braunstein believe it will take up to two years before the range begins to break even. They are not entirely sure, though. 'No one has ever done something like this before,' says Cohen. Ultimately, both are confident the driving range will be a success. As Cohen explains: 'Manhattan has millions of people, and there are only 24 stalls in our range. The numbers have to make sense. 'Once they know about this place, they have to come.'</p>

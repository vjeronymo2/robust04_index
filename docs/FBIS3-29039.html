			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Deputy Commerce Minister Chaloemphon Sanitwongchai  disclosed that the Commerce Ministry and Insurance Department  have not yet come up with a resolution on the proposal to  increase the number of insurance companies nationwide. In  principle, the more companies, the more the people benefit  because they will have more choices.    Chaloemphon said: "The business' present image is not very  good because certain companies still exploit clients.  Liberalization will trigger competition and prevent  maltreatment of clients."    The deputy minister, however, reaffirmed that if it is  decided that more insurance companies will be allowed to  operate, application screening will be carried out in accordance  with regulations. He said: "I can assure you that issuing  permits must be done in a fair manner to all. If not, I will be  the first to defend the interests of the people."    He noted that although liberalization of the insurance  business to open the door for foreign firms is necessary,  existing Thai insurance companies need time to improve so they  will be able to compete with foreign companies.    He said: "I believe that Thai companies are not yet ready  for competition and the government is taking necessary actions  to defend their business as long as possible. They must make  efforts to improve and should not only think of relying on  government assistance."</p>

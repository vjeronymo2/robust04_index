			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia: U.S., France Pushing for </F> NATO Ultimatum"]    [Text] Brussels, 9 Feb (ANSA) -- United States and French  ambassadors to NATO were leading efforts today to overcome their  Canadian and Greek colleagues' concern over an ultimatum to  Bosnian Serbs to lift their siege of Bosnian capital Sarajevo,  French sources reported. "Either there will be a decision  today, or there will be none. There will be no half-measures,"  the French sources said during a break in the Atlantic Council  to allow the 16 ambassadors to consult their governments.    According to the sources, the U.S.-French ultimatum proposal  made this morning would give the forces which have been  bombarding Sarajevo for 22 months 7-10 days to withdraw their  heavy artillery to 20-30 kilometres from the perimeter of the  city, or else face air strikes. Most NATO countries have  expressed support for an ultimatum in response to the worst  single civilian atrocity of the Bosnian war: the mortar shell  that killed 68 and wounded over 200 in a Sarajevo market on  Saturday [5 February].    But Canada is particularly concerned about the possible  repercussions on its large peacekeeping contingent, encircled at  Srebrenica, in the wake of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan  Karadzic's threat that "no foreigner will be safe" if air  strikes are ordered. Greece fears that an escalation of the  Bosnian war would dangerously raise tensions in Kosovo and the  rest of the Balkan area.    The Council is meeting to respond to United Nations  Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's call for a NATO green light on  threatened air strikes to halt the massacre of Sarajevo  civilians. If the Council approves the ultimatum, the last word  as regards launching the strikes lies with Butrus-Ghali.    (In Moscow, the Interfax news agency reported that Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev had written to Butrus-Ghali  warning of the "extremely serious" consequences of "any air  strike, even limited to providing air cover" for UN forces.  Kozyrev was quoted as saying that air strikes "would jeopardise  the entire UN aid operation." Stressing the priority of a  political solution to the Bosnian crisis, he reiterated Russia's  view that before ordering strikes Butrus-Ghali must consult with  the UN Security Council, where Russia has indicated it will veto  such a move.)</p>

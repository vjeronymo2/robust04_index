			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / How to Spend It: A more selective way to enjoy Hong Kong - Lucia van der Post takes it easy and is not taken in by bargains THE FIRST time in Hong Kong is always special but now that I am an old hand I find it interests me in different ways. Fifteen years ago Hong Kong seemed like the bargain basement of the world. Hand-embroidered linens, fake watches, cheapo copies of famous handbags, slightly imperfect cotton shirts, cute children's clothing - you name it, I bought it. I learnt the hard way that only the very best of Hong Kong tailors ever produce exactly what you have in mind and that not every piece of jade is precisely what it seems. These days, I buy much less and better. If I need a special lens for my camera or a string of pearls for a 21st birthday celebration or have a special antique in mind, then I plan it and go where the prices are possibly higher but the quality more certain. First-timers, though, should never miss the markets - prices may have risen but they still are filled with life and interest. Stanley Market and the Kowloon City Market are the places for clothes - you need to be patient and prepared to sort through rails but bargains are there to be found. In particular, look for washable silks (wonderful Equipment-style shirts) and tracksuits. Shoppers in both markets are mostly tourists. If you want to shop where the locals shop then go to the women's market in Mongkok in Kowloon - the prices are even lower. Treat the Jade market (in Yaumatei on Kowloon, open every day from 10 am to 4 pm) as an experience, not as a place for serious investment and do not expect, unless you are really knowledgeable, to find a bargain. Dedicated shoppers wanting to track down keenly-priced designer labels should get the excellent free guides issued by the Hong Kong Tourist Association - Shopping and Factory outlets and Hong Kong Factory Bargains. Those who, like me, are after proper antiques should buy Drummond's Hong Kong Guide to Art &amp; Antique Dealers. I always head straight for the oldest, fuddy-duddiest of the Communist China Stores (the one in Queen's Road Central which is always filled with local Chinese doing proper shopping) just to catch the flavour of China proper. I like to look in on Li Yuen Street East and West, heart of the rip-off merchants (this is where you buy a belt with Woschino written on it and once the money changes hands you turn the W the other way round) just to see what's up. If I feel in need of anything smart to wear the best buildings (HK, you seen learn, is full of buildings) are The Landmark, Princes and Pedder. This time, though, I decided to wander more and buy less - I liked it better. Start with the Hollywood Road, which is where all the best of the antiques are and where there are still workshops and ateliers where almost no English is spoken. Tomb figures, it seems, are currently all the rage - you can buy Ming dynasty figures for around HKDollars 1,000 or a giant Han dynasty horse for about HKDollars 7,000. From there walk around the ladder streets and head in a Westerly direction. As you walk along The Nun's Street listen for the click-click of the Mah-jong pieces coming from almost every room. In Tai Ping Shan Street in the Western district you will find the fortune-telling temple where the locals line-up for serious consultations. In Queens' Road West there is much more fun to be had browsing round the traditional shops than in any number of smart department stores. Where else could you find 20 candles for just HKDollars 10, if not at the Temple Equipment Shop? Where could you drink Nine Dragon Tea, a tea to wake the dead, if not with the fourth generation owner of the oldest tea merchants in town, Yuen Mau Hing Kee Tea Co, 45 Queen's Road West? Who else would show one how to serve the tea? (Use a pottery pot, keep it wet to make sure it does not absorb too much and replenish endlessly). Where else could one eat an authentic Chiu Chow meal in the simplest but most appealing of local restaurants? (At 49, Queen's Road West, Sheung Wan, it looks like a take-away but you will find seats upstairs). When the jet-lag threatens to overcome you, head back to the sanctuary of the Mandarin Hotel but before you sink back in your room to admire the view stop in at the health spa which has had a 'major refurbishment'. Ask for one of the soothing Eastern-style massages and you may, like me, get Christine. She specialises in a combination of vigorous massages which she follows with some reflexology, all accompanied by stream-of-consciousness chatter. 'Fat thighs.' (As if I didn't know.) 'You drink two pints jasmine tea a day, you eat fish four or five times a week . . . crystal on kidley, crystal on thyroid . . . cook plenty for your husband . . . way to husband's heart.' Sound advice I am sure. Just what you need to hear as you set out on the serious business of shopping. Save some time to take a few days off in Macau. Jet-foils leave Hong Kong about every 15 minutes all through the day, the journey takes about an hour and it costs about Pounds 10 each way. Macau is an ancient trading city, where the great tai pans of the old China Coast had their summer homes and where Sun Yat Sen planned the overthrow of the Manchu Dynasty. Do not be put off by your first glimpse of the sky-scrapers on the skyline ('Oh, God,' you think, 'not another Hong Kong'). You will find a heady blend of strange cultures - Southern Chinese, Portuguese and Macanese - which makes it quite, quite different. In the old days people went there to gamble and to eat dog - today they still go to gamble but I would go to wander round the old cobbled lanes, rummage in the street markets and poke around the antique shops. I would go to see the temples and the gentle colonial architecture and I would go to stay in the Bela Vista. The Bela Vista is where Hong Kong's governor Chris Patten comes to stay when he takes time off to rootle round the backstreets of Macau for antiques and local colour. Once a grand private mansion standing on Penha Hill overlooking the Praia Grande Bay it is a splendid contrast to Hong Kong's Mandarin - small, with just eight suites, each one different, it is personal, intimate, a hotel with real character. From there you can saunter out to enjoy Macau. These days almost anything you care to name is cheaper than in Hong Kong. If you are short of sports clothes San Domingos Market is the place to head for - I bought a man's cotton shirt for Pounds 2.50, a cream tracksuit for myself for Pounds 3.50 and jeans, polo shirts, children's clothes (in particular the Red Market) are all available for a song. Many are seconds from the factories that churn out these things for the West so look carefully before you buy. More fun, in my view, is looking into all the antique shops - rumour has it that many of the Hong Kong dealers buy here and double the price when they get back home. The flea market - its best to go in the mornings - is in the lanes round Rua das Estalagens (close to St Paul's ruins, a big Macau landmark). We found marvellous old furniture shops in these little streets and fell on the pieces in Lai Weng Lok in the Rua Nossa Senhora de Amparo No 37 R/7. A mixture of genuine old pieces from the mainland and new, impeccably made copies about which they seem totally honest, prices were incredibly good. Lai Weng Lok does not take credit cards but will pack and ship. Ian Kam Kei, Rua de Madeira No 19 A, I found more expensive but it takes credit cards and is generally better geared up to Westerners. Other good buys are hand-embroidered cottons and linens, porcelain old and new - lots of gentle blue and white tea caddies, plant pots, tableware. Gold jewellery and pearls come duty free and with no sales tax and are popular but the designs seem to me dull and unoriginal, though you could not go far wrong with a classic string of pearls. And if you want to buy even cheaper and go closer to the original source of the embroidery, the basket-ware, the jade, the porcelain, take a trip into mainland China - you can make it to the border in a couple of hours and just beyond the border you can start haggling in a small open-air market-place. Otherwise three-day tours are organised to several Chinese towns. Food is marvellously interesting. For posh dining you could go to the Bela Vista - a lovely room and an eclectic mix of international food and local specialities. Fernando's baked crab casserole they say is not to be missed (though, sadly, we had to) - find him at Hac Sa Beach No. 9, Coloane. The Inner Harbour area is wonderfully scruffy but filled with life and interest  -eat at the informal tables set up in the streets and you will get fresh, zesty seafood. We eat wonderfully at Henri's Galley, 4 Avenida de Republica  -plate after plate, starting with spicy prawns and including African Chicken (a local speciality) and a whole roast fish. Flights to Hong Kong are expensive (British Airways offers a World Traveller, with a minimum seven night stay, but otherwise the economy fare is Pounds 1,200 return) so I would recommend the special British Airways Holidays (Tel: 0293-611611) package of Pounds 925 for return scheduled flights and 7 nights at the Mandarin Hotel (room only). The Bela Vista in Macau charges HKDollars 1,600 per day per suite.</p>

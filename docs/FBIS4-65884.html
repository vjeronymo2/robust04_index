			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Paris France-Inter Radio Network in  French at 0620 GMT on 25 May carries a 10-minute, recorded  interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by Arnette  Ardisson. The interview is described as taking place following  the debate on the military program in the National Assembly; the  date and place are not given.    Discussing the point of holding the debate, Leotard notes  that they are making plans for the future, and though it is  unspectacular, the long-term is the most important thing.  Leotard says he and Prime Minister Balladur respect the  constitution, and the debate goes beyond party political issues.  There is a broad consensus.    Ardisson asks whether Leotard would prefer unanimity in the  assembly on the defense program, even if the Socialists insist  the Baumel amendment on the resumption of nuclear tests is  defeated as a price for their support. Leotard responds: "I  think that when unanimity is artificial, it is deceptive. I am  not looking for unanimity. We are proposing this bill, and we  shall have this amendment." Leotard is then asked whether he  hopes the amendment will be withdrawn. He replies: "In itself,  it isn't an obstacle or provocative. Not at all. It says more  or less the same thing as the president is saying, as the prime  minister and I are saying -- namely, that at the right time we  shall have to hold tests again. But that isn't the main thing  in the bill. Let me remind you that we devote twice as much  money to conventional weaponry as we do to nuclear arms. Twice  as much. And that really is something new; we should stress  that." Leotard goes on to say that he does hope the amendment  is withdrawn "because it doesn't add anything, and it doesn't  come into the area of the law. You know, the assembly more and  more passes laws on issues that are outside its competence. This  should be an administrative procedure. Tests really fall under  administrative procedures -- in other words, an executive  decision. But it is proper and good that we should talk about  them. As far as I am concerned, as I told the assembly, I have  provided for the necessary allocations to enable the head of  state, today's or tomorrow's, if he deems it necessary -- and he  is the one who has to deem it necessary -- to decide to resume  or not to resume. My duty is to prepare the tool, to see that  it is possible. But it is up to the president to decide --  today's or tomorrow's. Today's has already responded."    Leotard then defends French defense spending by invoking  France's history of being invaded and its commitments abroad --  with 200,000 French nationals in sub-Saharan Africa and 11  million sq. km of ocean to defend. There are 70,000 soldiers  currently outside metropolitan France. He recalls the lesson  learned in 1940, when the French Army found itself up against a  modern army.    Ardisson asks if Leotard meant what he said about reducing  French troops in Bosnia. Leotard answers: "I can tell you that  what I said is exactly the case. You'll see -- I'll be only too  glad to come and talk to you at the at the end of the year --  the numbers and intentions I have announced will be implemented.  It is a French decision, corresponding to the way the crisis is  developing: We are going to reduce our forces in Bosnia, and we  shall regroup them in Sarajevo. This is a fact, it's a decision  we have made, and that's it."</p>

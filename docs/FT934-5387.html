			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: BAe upbeat on regional jet business British Aerospace yesterday confirmed its intention to continue its regional jet operations and seek another international alliance for that business even if it were forced to abandon its proposed joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace. Although BAe has continued negotiations with Taiwan, the future of the joint venture remains in serious doubt. The company yesterday sought to reassure its regional jet workforce, based at Woodford, near Manchester, that it would maintain the business should the Taiwan negotiations break down. Mr Dick Evans, chief executive, confirmed the company's 'ongoing support' for the business in a message to employees. He added that the strategy of establishing an international partnership 'will continue to be pursued'. BAe is believed to have had contacts with other possible partners. However, it believes it can now keep its restructured regional jet business going on its own while it seeks an international alliance.</p>

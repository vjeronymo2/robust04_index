			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CS LONG BEACH FACES OREGON AT EUGENE  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach's football team, which lost to Oregon here last season,  49-0, will have a nonconference rematch with the Ducks at 1 p.m. today.  </P> <P> "We remembered what happened last year and hopefully that will be motivation  enough," said Long Beach Coach Larry Reisbig.  </P> <P> The 49ers, who lost to San Jose State last week, 21-10, are 3-5 overall and 1-3  in the Big West Conference. They have defeated only one Division I-A team,  winless New Mexico State.  </P> <P> Oregon (4-3) is led by quarterback Bill Musgrave and tailback Derek Loville,  neither of whom the 49ers could stop a year ago. In that game, Loville ran for  154 yards and Musgrave threw three touchdown passes.  </P> <P> Loville had a 203-yard game last week as the Ducks defeated Arizona State,  27-7. DICK WAGNER  </P></p>

The clashes have not stopped, especially near  San Cristobal de las Casas. The first signs of an eventual  dialogue with the armed groups have emerged.    The clashes continued between the Army and the rebels in Los  Altos de Chiapas for the eighth consecutive day. The Army has  repelled a rebel attack against the Rancho Nuevo Military  Barracks near San Cristobal de las Casas. The roads to the  areas of conflict remain closed.    During the pursuit operations, authorities found a Pemex  [Mexican Petroleum] vehicle from which the rebels stole 1.5 tons  of dynamite 31 December. The truck was found in Guadalupe  Tepeyac, a town thought to be the rebels' stronghold, where it  has been confirmed they are still holding captive the former  Chiapas State governor, Absalon Castellanos, and approximately  100 social security employees of the town. Thousands of Indians  and peasants are fleeing from the areas of conflict to seek  refuge in San Cristobal de las Casas, a city being reinforced by  the Army. [passage omitted]</p>

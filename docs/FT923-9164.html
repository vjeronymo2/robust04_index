			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Prudential Securities to keep HQ in Manhattan PRUDENTIAL Securities, the third-largest brokerage house in the US, announced yesterday that it will be keeping its headquarters and back office operations in Manhattan. The company had considered relocating outside New York, but a Dollars 106m incentive package of tax and energy rebates provided by the city and state government, and the reduction in rental costs linked to the local commercial property slump, persuaded Prudential to stay in the Wall Street area. Prudential's decision is a victory for the administration of Mr David Dinkins, New York's mayor, which has fought hard to persuade big companies to stay in the city despite the cost, the high crime rate and the crumbling infrastructure. If major corporations and their employees leave New York, the city's tax base declines and local government finances, already damaged by federal cuts and the impact of the recession, would come under further pressure. Delighted city officials said yesterday that Prudential's decision would generate Dollars 830m in revenue for New York. In recent years, several big Wall Street firms, including Merill Lynch, Salomon Brothers, and PaineWebber, have moved their back office operations out of New York to cheaper locations in the suburbs or in other states. Kidder Peabody, Smith Barney, and Morgan Stanley have also recently considered relocating part or all their operations elsewhere although none have yet made a final decision.</p>

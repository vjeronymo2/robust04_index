			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: A local difficulty Since its first reaction was to rise, the UK equity market was evidently unperturbed by the local election results. Its greater concern is the trend in US markets where yesterday's jobless figures and worries about the dollar suggest another round of monetary tightening is due. With long dated US Treasury bonds trading at a yield as high as 7.5 per cent yesterday and Wall Street equities heading lower, the short-term risk to the UK market looks considerable. Perhaps because the political situation is so difficult to fathom, investors may feel tempted to ignore the local election results. A prolonged period of political uncertainty would be unhelpful just the same. A successful challenge to Mr John Major need not change the basic thrust of economic policy. The divisions within the party are more to do with Europe, and the chances are that any new leader would have little choice but to continue driving the borrowing requirement lower. The greater uncertainty concerns monetary policy. If a leadership challenge in the autumn is possible, there is very little chance of interest rates being raised before then, even if M0 money supply growth continues to race ahead. For the same reason, sterling is left unprotected. The currency has already shown signs of weakness in the backwash of the dollar's troubles. Further falls would inevitably upset the gilts market too. Gilts shed 1.5 points yesterday, and the yield on index-linked paper is again uncomfortably close to that on equities. Shares cannot ignore that indefinitely.</p>

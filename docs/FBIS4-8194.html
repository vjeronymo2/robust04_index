			<p>BFN     [Text] Cajnice, 12 Apr (TANJUG) -- The details of events on  the Gorazde battlefield following the U.S. bombing raids on  civilian targets and positions of the Bosnian Serb Herzegovina  Corps have finally been revealed, the TANJUG correspondent from  Cajnice, south of Gorazde, reports.    According to the command of the Herzegovina Corps, the  second  NATO attack at about 1445 yesterday [11 April] took place in the  area of the Serb village of Bare, 2 km from Gorazde.    However, ambulance cars belonging to the Serb forces were  hit  instead of Srpska republic army tanks, as NATO representatives  claimed.    Two paramedics from Gacko [Serb-held town south of Gorazde]  were killed on this occasion and two ambulance cars were  completely destroyed. Two Serb houses were also completely  destroyed. Their inhabitants had fled the Muslim attacks almost  two years ago.    The Americans fired missiles and dropped bombs of great  destructive power on Serb positions. This is illustrated by the  fact that one of the missiles broke through three 20  centimeter-thick concrete floors.    According to Serb sources, everything was most probably  carried out in agreement with the Muslim side -- immediately  before the bombing raid yesterday thick black smoke rose from  chimneys of houses in Gorazde. In this way the Muslims were  marking the no-target zone for the Americans.    Simultaneously with the attack of the American planes, the  Muslim forces launched an infantry attack on Serb positions from  Gorazde, with strong support from recoilless guns, mortars,  antiaircraft guns, and multiple rocket launchers.    Where did the Muslims from Gorazde, a UN safe area, get all  the weapons and ammunition? That is what only they and the NATO  representatives know. However, they were not able to move the  Serb positions.    Details of the U.S. attack in the Mount Preljuca area two  days ago have also been revealed. This area is 15 kilometers  from Gorazde and it is a part of the [Serb-held] Foca  municipality.    It is logical to ask: How did the Americans want to protect  UN military observers in Gorazde by bombing positions so far  away?    As long as one can remember, Preljuca has always been a Serb  territory, and a year ago the Muslims committed a horrific crime  in the village of Crnetici just beneath Preljuca, killing more  than 20 civilians, including two infants. The U.S. planes have  carried on the job.</p>

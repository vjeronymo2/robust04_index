			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / International Company News: UAP forecasts sharp increase in profits MR JEAN Peyrelevade, chairman of Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), France's biggest insurance group, yesterday said the company was on course for a 'significant increase' in profits this year in preparation for privatisation. He said 1993 should mark a 'significant step' in UAP's recovery, although he cautioned it did not expect to reach 1990's net profits of FFr4bn (Dollars 695m). UAP, which suffered a steep fall in net profits to FFr1.08bn in 1992 from FFr3.77bn in 1991, is one of 21 state-controlled companies scheduled for sale to the private sector by France's new centre-right government. Mr Peyrelevade has been making strenuous efforts to ensure that UAP will be one of the first privatisation candidates. The improvement in UAP's performance could play an important part in Mr Peyrelevade's plans. Assurances Generales de France (AGF) and GAN Group, the other state-controlled insurers, are also scheduled for sale. AGF is regarded as UAP's chief competitor in the privatisation stakes. GAN this week warned it had to resolve the problems of its loss-making damage division before being sold.</p>

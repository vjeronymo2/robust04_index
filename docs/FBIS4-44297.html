			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Michel Leclercq] </F>   [Excerpt] Paris, June 28 (AFP) -- Senior officials from the  European Union, Russia, the United States and the United Nations  met here Tuesday [28 June] to finalise plans for the future  borders within Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Details of the map drawn up by the "contact group" are to be  submitted to Bosnia-Herzegovina's Croat-Moslem federation and  separatist Serbs in the next few days.    The group will also provide for possible sanctions if  parties  to the two-year conflict fail to accept the carve-up which gives  the Croat-Moslem federation 51 percent of the former Yugoslav  republic's territory and the Bosnian Serbs 49 percent.    The Serbs currently control 70 percent.    At their last meeting in London on June 16 the senior  officials had practically agreed on where to draw the borders  between the warring parties, diplomats said.    The map will be detailed and not leave out any disputed  areas.    But both Bosnian Serbs and Moslems have so far rejected the  proposed carve-up, saying it favored their foes.    The mainly Moslem Bosnian government has called for 58  percent of the territory to form the Croat-Moslem federation.    Agreements reached by the diplomats and experts from  Britain,  France and Germany (representing the European Union), Russia,  the United Nations and the United States will be submitted to a  ministerial meeting in Geneva early next month for approval.    A German proposal for the ministers to meet on July 5 has  not  been confirmed.    A G-7 summit of leading industrialized nations in Naples on  July 8-10 will then appeal to the warring sides to accept the  proposals, billed as the "last chance" for peace by Russian  Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin.    It is feared that a refusal would lead to a flare-up in the  former Yugoslav republic where a shaky one-month truce ends on  July 10. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: American Barrick plans another Nevada gold mine AMERICAN BARRICK is to build a new underground gold mine, with output of 400,000 ounces a year, adjacent to its Goldstrike property in Nevada. The fast-growing, Toronto-based company said yesterday it expected the new Meikle mine to be in full production by 1996. Thanks to the infrastructure already in place at Goldstrike the capital cost of building the mine will be a relatively modest USDollars 180m. American Barrick also yesterday announced another year of record profits in 1991, thanks to rising production from Goldstrike and its active hedging programme. Last year's net earnings were USDollars 92.4m, or 68 cents a share, up from Dollars 58.2m, or 45 cents a share, in 1990. Revenues surged to Dollars 344.7m from Dollars 251.6m. Hedging enabled Barrick to obtain an average price of Dollars 438 a troy ounce last year, compared with the Comex price of Dollars 362 an ounce. Barrick's share of output from its five existing mines in the US and Canada jumped by a third last year to 789,800 ounces. The contribution from Goldstrike, which is set to become North America's biggest gold producer, rose to 546,146 ounces, from 352,880 ounces. Total output is expected to climb to 1.2m ounces this year. Mr Bob Smith, the company's president, predicted yesterday that production could double by the end of the decade. The new Meikle mine, which will be located one mile north of Goldstrike on the Purple Vein deposit, is expected to have a life of 11 years. Its operating costs are estimated at Dollars 125 an ounce. The Meikle development and an agreement with Newmont Gold to develop the nearby Lower and Deep Post orebody have led Barrick to raise its gold reserves estimate by 25 per cent to 25.3m ounces.</p>

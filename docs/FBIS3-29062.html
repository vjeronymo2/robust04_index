Ministry officials said that additional construction of  nuclear power plants in South Korea is inevitable, but that  recognition of the situation and knowledge of nuclear reactors  among the general public are inadequate. In a plan to enhance  such recognition and knowledge, the Ministry will send 210  people in 17 observation parties to overseas power plants this  year, compared to 65 in eight parties last year.    The Ministry plans to construct 76 power plants including 14  nuclear plants by 2006 to meet the demand for power, which is  expected to increase by more than 10 percent yearly into the  early 21st century. The plan will raise the proportion of  nuclear power in electricity generation to 47.7 percent in 2006  from the current 40.3 percent, Ministry officials explained.</p>

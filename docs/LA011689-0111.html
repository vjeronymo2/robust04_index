Gorbachev told Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in  a personal message Sunday that he wants to make an official visit to Britain as  soon as possible, Thatcher's office said.  </P> <P> The message was delivered by Soviet Ambassador Leonid M. Zamyatin, who saw the  prime minister on his return from a trip to Moscow for a Central Committee  meeting.  </P> <P> "Mr. Gorbachev confirmed his desire to pay an official visit to Britain and  said dates should be agreed as soon as possible," a spokeswoman at Thatcher's  office said.  </P> <P> "Mrs. Thatcher said that Mr. Gorbachev was welcome whenever he chose to come to  Britain," the spokeswoman added.  </P> <P> Gorbachev had been scheduled to visit Britain a month ago but had to cancel the  trip at the last minute when an earthquake devastated Soviet Armenia on Dec. 7.  </P> <P> He cut short his visit to the United States and returned to Moscow, postponing  visits to Britain and Cuba.  </P></p>

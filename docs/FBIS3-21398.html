			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Danger of Bloody Revolution"] </F>   [Text] The situation in Sarhad [NWFP] is deteriorating  rapidly. The danger of armed fighting and bloodshed between  government supporters and the opposition is increasing.  Patriotic circles are very concerned about this situation. This  kind of tug-of-war for power in a democratic parliamentary  system is deplorable. What will be the result of all this?  Professor Ghafur Ahmed, the vice chairperson of Jamaat-i Islami  Pakistan, has expressed serious concern about the deteriorating  political situation and the fighting in Sarhad, saying that this  time, there will be no martial law, but a bloody revolution.  While addressing a crowded press conference in Azad Kashmir's  capital of Muzaffarabad, he said, "It is the opposition's  constitutional right to introduce a no-confidence motion;  however, horse-trading is not a constitutional right." Professor  Ahmed warned that if, by ending the government in Sarhad, bricks  from the wall of democracy are removed, then the wall would  crumble and fall right on Benazir Bhutto, and democracy would be  endangered. Professor Ghafur Ahmed also criticized opposition  leader Nawaz Sharif, saying that the action of the opposition  leader was not laudable, and that he opposes for the sake of  opposing. Professor Ghafur Ahmed is considered one of the most  serious and far-sighted political leaders in the nation. He  warned the government and the opposition at the right time and  appropriately. We cannot praise all the actions that Sahibzada  Sabir Shah's government in Sarhad has done. He made some  mistakes that the opposition should have identified. In a  democratic parliamentary system, the purpose of the opposition  is to identify the government's mistakes and suggest ways to  improve the situation. Instead of following this positive  democratic process, though, efforts are being made to remove  Sabir Shah's government and, in order to make the no-confidence  campaign against him successful, they have started  horse-trading. Since the PPP has governments in the two largest  states of the country and at the Center and the president also  belongs to this party, it is commonly believed that Madam  Benazir Bhutto is doing all this to establish her own party's  government in the remaining two states.</p>

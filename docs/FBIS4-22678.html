			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Savin: "Elections Nemtsov-Style"] </F>   [Text] Arkhangelskoye Village, Nizhegorod Oblast--Elections  to the local authorities in Nizhegorod Oblast are scheduled for  27 March. The support of no less than 3 percent of the  district's electorate is required for registration as a  candidate for deputy of the oblast legislative assembly. Such  are the requirements of the statute on elections in the oblast.  It was in accordance with this published law that I began to  collect signatures. Our District No. 31 has an electorate of  52,700, consequently, I needed the support of 1,581 persons. I  managed this task, but all of a sudden there comes news (via the  newspaper once again) just a few days before the end of the  signature-collection and candidate-registration campaign that no  fewer than 2,000 voters of the district have to support the  candidate for deputy. In other words, the rules of the game have  been changed during the game. Only with us, perhaps, is such a  thing possible.    Also interesting is the fact that Governor Nemtsov has  lowered the minimum turnout for the elections to be deemed valid  to 25 percent of the electoral roll eligible "to vote and to run  for office."    Let us now try to understand all that is going on at our  elections. First, they will produce no changes in the organs of  power. The administration heads will remain in place, possessing  the real power. The village elders will be wholly dependent on  the rayon mayors, having no command authority and receiving  purely symbolic wages.    Second, the elections to the oblast organs of power have  been  planned such that at the first stage even, that is, at the time  of registration of the candidates, a realistic chance of being  elected was cut off for the ordinary mortal. Whoever adopted  this law was either entirely ignorant of the territorial  disconnectedness of the inhabitants in a rural locality or was  in fact counting precisely on this. I can say from my own  experience that it is no easy thing to collect the electorate's  ID data in such a quantity in the countryside. It is  considerably easier for whoever either has the money or occupies  a directive position. In this case they operate not simply but  very simply--they dispatch their subordinates to the meetings or  they go to the personnel departments and the councils, where  they write down all the data of interest to them.    Third, in a democratic (that is, power-of-the-people) state,  it seems to me, the nomination of candidates for deputy by  representatives of the ordinary working people should be made as  easy as possible. But the governor of Nizhegorod Oblast has his  own view of the organization of "democratic" elections. To  consolidate his power he is prepared to sacrifice the interests  of 75 percent of the electorate, which, evidently, is contrary  to the rules of public law in a truly democratic country. I know  once again from personal experience that even if the requisite  number of people do not show up at the polls on 27 March, the  missing votes will be added at the polling stations so that they  may report and please the authorities. The question arises in  this connection: Who needs these elections?</p>

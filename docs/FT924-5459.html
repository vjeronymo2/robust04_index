			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report Zinc and Nickel were the strongest markets at the London Metal Exchange yesterday, and their firmness helped to steady other metals. Traders said that ZINC had been underpinned recently by trade buying, which emerged again today, taking the three months delivery position above Dollars 1,080 a tonne and touching off short-covering and stop-loss buying orders. At the close the three months price was quoted at Dollars 1,089.50 a tonne, up Dollars 24.75 on the day. Chinese buying was cited as the main factor lifting NICKEL prices, which rose for the sixth successive trading day. The three months position closed at Dollars 5,515 a tonne, up 39 on the day and Dollars 200 from last week's 5-year low. At the London Futures and Options Exchange COFFEE prices continued this week's retracement, with the January position ending Dollars 5 lower at Dollars 944 a tonne. Dealers said talks on a new pact to support prices at the International Coffee Organisation continued to be monitored, although progress, as expected, was slow. Compiled from Reuters</p>

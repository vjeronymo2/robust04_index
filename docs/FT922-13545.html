			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: US retail chains show slower rate of growth MANY of the largest US retail chains yesterday reported same-store sales increases in the low single digits for the month of March - a slowdown from the rates of improvement seen in January and February. However, the comparisons are influenced by the timing of Easter, which fell on March 31 in 1991, causing the pre-Easter spending period to fall in March. In the current year, Easter is on April 19. Sales gains in the first two months also reflect the very slow period in early 1991, when the Gulf war held consumers' attention. In some cases, February 1992 comparisons were also distorted by the extra leap year day. Shares of many retail groups moved higher on the figures. Sears, Roebuck, for example, gained Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 45 1/2 ; Woolworth was down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 28 5/8 ; Wal-Mart advanced Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 52 7/8 ; JC Penney gained Dollars 2 5/8 at Dollars 65; Dayton Hudson was up Dollars 2 5/8 at Dollars 62 5/8 . The two notable exceptions were The Gap and The Limited, both specialty fashion retailers which have been much admired for their resilience to recession and for their retailing techniques. The Gap saw a 3 per cent decrease in same-store sales in March, compared with a 15 per cent increase a year ago, although total sales were up by 12 per cent. The Limited reported an 8 per cent fall in same-store sales. Shares in these two companies fell by Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 40 3/8 , and Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 24 1/4 , respectively. Among the discount chains, Wal-Mart Stores saw a 6 per cent increase for March on a same-store basis, with the overall sales figure rising by 18 per cent to Dollars 3.93bn. K mart, however, saw a 0.7 per cent fall on a same-store basis, with gains from its specialty chains offset by declines on the general merchandise side. In the department store sector, Sears, Roebuck showed a 3.6 per cent increase in domestic same-store sales, while Dallas-based JC Penney managed 9.5 per cent. Dayton Hudson reported a 1.9 per cent improvement, but Woolworth registered a 9.9 per cent decline for comparable stores. At May Department Stores, there was a 4.7 per cent decline overall, but this masked a 2.3 per cent decline in the department stores themselves and a 15.2 per cent fall in the Payless shoe stores.</p>

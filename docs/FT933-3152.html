			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Trinity Intl turns in Pounds 9.44m and enfranchises shareholders TRINITY INTERNATIONAL, the fast-expanding UK regional newspaper publisher, is to enfranchise its ordinary shareholders. This will end the voting structure which has made it immune from takeover since it floated as the Liverpool Daily Post &amp; Echo in 1904. Trinity coupled its announcement yesterday with news of a 27 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 9.44m from Pounds 7.44m and an increase in interim dividend to 3p (2.7p). The group is joining a band including Great Universal Stores and several other companies which have recently declared a change in their restrictive voting structures. Mr Philip Graf, chief executive, said yesterday enfranchisement was meant to improve the attractiveness, marketability and value of Trinity's shares. He did not accept Trinity was now vulnerable to predators. 'The best long-term defence against a takeover is sustained performance. We have a good record and excellent relations with our shareholders,' he said. Trinity's shares closed up 3p at 388p. Trinity lost its main disgruntled shareholder earlier this year when Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian publisher of the Daily Telegraph, sold a 10 per cent stake he had bought in 1989 in the hope of building a long term relationship. Trinity's directors, who control the 12 management shares that are the only ones with voting rights at present, saw him as a potential predator and are understood to have rebuffed Mr Black's overtures for a seat on the board and enfranchisement of Trinity's shares. Mr Black failed to take up his rights in an oversubscribed rights issue last year and Goldman Sachs had no difficulty placing his shares with institutions. Trinity's biggest shareholder now is Mercury Asset Management, which has 25 per cent. Other financial institutions own at least another 55 per cent. The group, which has its headquarters in Chester, owns the daily newspapers in Liverpool and groups of weeklies and free sheets in Merseyside, north Wales, western Canada and the US. Last year it divested from papermaking and packaging to concentrate on media. It bought Scottish and Universal Newspapers (SUN) from Lonrho, having withdrawn from a contested bid for Southern Newspapers on the English south coast. This year, Trinity has made an agreed offer for the Huddersfield Examiner group of newspapers in West Yorkshire and is in exclusive negotiations to buy Argus Press, in south-east England. Both deals are awaiting government clearance. Under the enfranchising proposal, each non-voting stock unit will be converted into one share with full voting rights. Each management share will be converted into 10 ordinary shares with no compensation for loss of voting power. Trinity's turnover rose 32 per cent to Pounds 64.67m (Pounds 48.96m), reflecting the Scottish and Universal acquisition. Earnings per ordinary stock unit were 9.2p (8.0p). Gearing was 18.3 per cent, although this is likely to double if the Argus and Huddersfield deals are finalised.</p>

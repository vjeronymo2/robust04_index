			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Flag still flies over Austrian bank - CS did not expect such a strong nationalistic reaction The leading trend in banking may be globalisation, but nationalistic sentiment still counts for a lot, even in advanced industrialised countries. That is probably the main message from the aborted attempt by CS Holding, the international financial services group built around Credit Suisse, to take over Creditanstalt, Austria's second largest bank. The Swiss knew they were sticking their noses into a political quagmire when they ventured into Austria, but did not expect such a strong nationalistic reaction. The tone was set in mid-May shortly after Mr Rainer Gut, CS chairman, had made known that the Swiss group was interested in a large part of the Austrian government's 70 per cent voting stake in the bank. 'We would be the only leading commercial bank in the developed world that would be controlled from abroad,' moaned Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, chief executive of Creditanstalt. In response, Mr Gut could only point to the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's control of Midland Bank of the UK. In the subsequent three months, no one in Austria or anywhere else has made any serious criticism of the commercial logic of CS taking over Creditanstalt. Mr Gut said CS would have maintained the bank's Austrian identity and it would have brought better access to global financial markets. However, even at the highest levels of Austria's business community, the idea of Creditanstalt, the bank that financed the industrial development of the Austro-Hungarian empire, being taken over by a foreigner, stuck in the throat. When Mr Gut said CS wanted ultimately to control 100 per cent of Creditanstalt, Mrs Maria Schaumayer, president of the Austrian National Bank, declared solemnly: 'Creditanstalt must fly under the Austrian and not the Swiss flag.' A week later, an unlikely combination of Austrian, German and Italian banks and companies put together a counter-bid. The Austrians do resent the Swiss, finding it difficult to accept that their Alpine neighbours, so similar in many ways, are so much more successful in international business. But Austrian bankers admit that a bid from a big UK or German bank would have had the same reception. Initially, this nationalistic response was camouflaged by the workings of partisan politics in Austrian banking. Because the country has long been run by a coalition of Conservatives and Social Democrats, the leading financial institutions of each tendency share in government and government-influenced business. Creditanstalt is the flag bearer for Austria's Conservative party banks. But if it were sold to CS, it would be out of the loop, and most of the government's largesse could be directed to arch-rival Bank Austria, the Socialists' bank. Therefore, the initial opposition to the CS bid came from Conservatives. Although it was aware of this possibility, CS argued privately that the government could not consistently resist putting business Creditanstalt's way if, under CS direction, it made increasingly competitive and attractive offers. It was also widely thought that Mr Lacina, who was initially enthusiastic in his support for the CS bid, shared this view. Indeed, he probably saw it as a way to begin depoliticising the banking sector. Nationalistic currents soon infected the Socialist party as well. In late June, Mr Helmut Zilk, the mayor of Vienna, said: 'Any other solution would be better than CS'. Mr Lacina, who originally said he would make a decision before summer, announced in July that he would appoint a consultant to review the bids. It was widely understood that this meant nothing would be decided until after national elections due in October. But supporters of the CS cause took comfort from the thought that the Conservatives would likely lose a lot of ground in the election, making it easier for the Social Democrats to sell Creditanstalt to CS. Then last month, Mr Kurt Heindl, the powerful trade spokesman for the Social Democrats, said the government must maintain a golden share or some other means of domestic control over Creditanstalt. More recently, Mr Viktor Klima, the Socialist transport minister, said it was important to have privatised banks controlled within Austria. Mr Lacina, suddenly alone, began to backtrack, saying two weeks ago that an Austrian influence in the bank had to be guaranteed. Then, a month later than planned, he appointed a consultant to assess the bids. CS said yesterday the appointment of JP Morgan did not have much to do with its decision. 'We always knew someone would be appointed, and it pretty well had to be a competitor,' CS said. CS said the group had no regrets about making clear its desire ultimately to buy 100 per cent of Creditanstalt. 'It was honest,' it said.</p>

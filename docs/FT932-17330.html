			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK acts against Islamic bank: Concern at Bank of England - Pounds 83m will go back to depositors THE ONLY bank in Europe run on Islamic principles announced yesterday that it is to stop taking deposits and return Pounds 83m to 10,000 depositors after failing to resolve a dispute with the Bank of England over how it should be supervised. The London-based Albaraka International Bank, wholly owned by a Saudi sheikh, said the Bank of England was concerned it could not be supervised in line with international standards because of its structure. The Bank is thought to have been worried in the wake of the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International that the controlling management of Albaraka appeared to be in Saudi Arabia although it did not operate as a bank there. The move, which follows the administration of Equatorial Bank and the winding up of the Mount Banking Corporation last October, further reduces the number of banks which specialise in lending to Asian businesses in Britain. Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, said he was 'very concerned' that banks serving Asians in Britain were ceasing to trade. Mr Vaz called for a select committee inquiry into the supervision of such banks. Albaraka is one of 22 banks owned by Dallah Albaraka Group, the Jeddah-based family holding company of Sheikh Saleh Abdullah Kamel. It operates in accordance with Moslem law by not charging interest on loans, but instead adopting the Islamic murabaha practice of making set transaction profits. The bank, which has assets of Pounds 191m, made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.8m in 1991 after making Pounds 6.7m provisions against bad debts. Sheikh Kamel, sole owner of a number of businesses with a combined asset value of Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4.2bn), injected Pounds 15m of new capital. Sheikh Kamel said yesterday that he hoped the Bank would accept a new ownership structure he intended to propose in June, under which other British shareholders would dilute his shareholding to below 10 per cent. 'For me, it is not important how much of the bank I own. The most important think is to enable Moslems to practise their religion in their business and to show that there are good things in Islam,' said Sheikh Kamel. He said the bank had been negotiating with the Bank of England's supervision department since the adoption of the Basle concordat in July, which called for consolidated supervision of banks operating in several countries. Sheikh Kamel said Albaraka had offered to bring in other Islamic banks as shareholders, or to accept the Bank of England as its consolidated supervisor, but all its suggestions had been rejected. The Bank said it could not comment on its supervision of individual banks.</p>

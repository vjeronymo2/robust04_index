			<p>BFN     [Text] The Bureau of Immigration and Deportation [BID]  today cancelled the visas of 10 foreign nationals currently  attending the Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor [APCET].  Immigration Associate Commissioner Manuel Roxas reiterated that  their action is in compliance with the government's position to  bar foreigners attending the conference. Those foreigners who  are now attending the APCET are believed to have gained entry  into the country before their ban took effect.    In this connection, immigration agents headed by Tom  Natividad this morning served summons on 10 foreigners attending  the conference at the Malcolm Hall of the University of the  Philippines. Natividad said the foreigners should personally go  to the immigration office before 0800. He clarified that they  went to Malcolm Hall just to serve the subpoenas to the  foreigners and not to arrest them.    [Begin recording, in English] [Natividad] As I have said, we  are just instructed to serve these to the secretariat, and  that's all.    [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, if they do not appear,  what  will happen?    [Natividad] I don't know.    [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, what's your name again?    [Natividad] Tom Natividad. Intelligence Officer Tom  Natividad.    [Indistinct question from unidentified correspondent]    [Natividad] No, it's not. (?It's) a subpoena that they have  to appear at 0800 today.

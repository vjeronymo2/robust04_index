			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Gravy cools as appetites fade: British MPs' opportunities for boosting their earnings may soon be curbed Are the brakes being applied to a gravy train long enjoyed by British politicians? The question, at first sight, seems premature. Few MPs can resist the temptation to profit from their privileged access to government information and to decision-makers by selling their services to companies, trade associations and pressure groups. Of 651 MPs, less than 10 per cent had nothing to declare in the 1994 register of members' interests, in which MPs are required to list details of directorships, consultancies and other interests such as land, property and large shareholdings. Many whose entries are blank are ministers, who are subject to strict rules intended to prevent a conflict of interest with their official duties. Many Labour MPs would protest that the links they declare with trade unions or lobby groups bring little or no personal gain. But other MPs, mostly Conservatives, have corporate directorships and consultancies, often worth thousands of pounds a year. Now, however, their ability to supplement their backbench MPs' salaries of Pounds 31,687 a year is under threat. The House of Commons privileges committee is investigating the issues raised by MPs' lengthy lists of outside interests. This follows the controversy over The Sunday Times newspaper's recent revelations that two MPs were willing to put parliamentary questions to ministers in return for payments of Pounds 1,000. Few expect the committee, composed of senior MPs from the main political parties, to recommend banning directorships and consultancies. This would have expensive consequences: MPs estimate their salaries would have to be doubled or tripled to make up for the loss of this de facto subsidy from the private sector. But Tory backbenchers' doleful expressions and comments during recent Commons debates on members' interests indicate they fear the inquiry may lead to new rules limiting the scope for outside earnings. Rule changes agreed by MPs themselves are only one threat. There are increasing signs that other pressures are reducing the opportunities for politicians to benefit from the lucrative market for information and insight into Whitehall decision-making. Two broad, overlapping trends are apparent. First, the rapid growth of professional lobbying organisations - with an estimated annual turnover in the UK of about Pounds 20m - has created a rival source for the information and ministerial access that MPs can provide. Professional lobbyists can be more effective. 'We have seen some MPs become jealous of us,' says one leading lobbyist. 'We are doing a lot of things they should be doing. How many MPs are prepared to get up early and scour House of Commons documents for parliamentary questions and motions which are relevant to the company that pays them?' Second, the buyers of the information are becoming more careful about how they spend their money. Rather than hiring an MP as a consultant, for example, some organisations run their own in-house parliamentary services departments or employ a Westminster-based liaison officer. 'The trend is towards much more in-house management,' says Mr Ian Greer, chairman of Ian Greer Associates, the political lobbying group. 'Large companies do not spend money recklessly; they evaluate very carefully what their political needs are.' Mr Chris Austin, British Rail's director of policy and parliamentary affairs, offers two explanations for this trend. First, there are 'so many consultancies in the business now' with a broad range of expertise. Second, 'the whole business of financial involvement with MPs has come under scrutiny and been to some extent discredited'. Mr Austin adds: 'I wouldn't advise any of the emerging train operating companies to have an MP as an adviser or a director.' Another reason for not using an MP to lobby the government, says Mr Bob Lloyd-Jones, director-general of the Brick Development Association, is that 'ministers react more favourably to direct contact with the industry than to an approach through an MP. That certainly wasn't the case 30 years ago.' A sign that companies themselves see less value in having an MP on their books is the increasing scepticism about the value of a politician on the board. 'I think the days are gone when a company purely wanted an MP or peer on the board to have the name on the letterhead,' says Mr Gordon Leak, public relations director at the Institute of Directors. For example, Tarmac, the construction group which in the 1980s had the then Mr Cecil Parkinson, former Tory party chairman, as a director, now says it is 'not into MPs at the moment on the board'. Only 10 per cent of City opinion formers regard a governmental career as suitable background for a non-executive director, according to a recent survey commissioned by chartered accountants BDO Binder Hamlyn. British Steel, whose board includes Sir Giles Shaw, Tory MP for Pudsey and member of the privileges committee, says there is 'no particular significance' in Sir Giles being an MP. 'We choose non-executive directors for their wide experience in industry and the City,' the company says. The trend by companies away from using MPs may accelerate. If MPs agree to impose stricter rules on outside interests, they will give a boost to the professional lobbyists - and expose the practice of employing MPs to further unfavourable publicity. Until now, MPs have managed to exploit the growth of professional lobbyists by joining them as directors or consultants. But the inquiry is widely expected to make it harder for them to do this. Mr Richard Faulkner, joint managing director of political consultancy Westminster Communications, thinks the privileges committee will 'inevitably' scrutinise such links. His firm has applied to join the Association of Professional Political Consultants, which does not allow companies with MPs on the board to be members. Explaining these rules, Mr Andrew Gifford, chairman of the association, says: 'We wanted to be ahead of the game. We felt it was difficult to see how you could very easily have MPs on the board or retained and not have some perceived conflict of interest.' If Westminster Communications succeeds in its application to join, it will have to lose the services of Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the 1922 committee of Tory MPs and another privileges committee member. One comfort for MPs is that it will be many years, if ever, before demand for their services disappears completely. Mr Michael Sara, managing director of Hill &amp; Smith Holdings, which manufacturers motorway barriers, says Mr Patrick Nicholls, Tory MP for Teignbridge and consultant to the company, performs a useful role. He breaks down 'civil servants' lethargy and inertia,' says Mr Sara. 'He has only to ask a question or write a letter and they jump to attention and run all over the place. If we ask the department something, nobody does anything.' Similarly, Mr John Maples, former Treasury minister and now chairman of Saatchi and Saatchi Government Communications, the political consultancy, still sees value in retaining an MP on the books. If you are a large company and they 'tell you something once every five years, they have probably paid you back a hundred times over', he says. Those who think that demand from companies for good information will remain strong are almost certainly right. But as competition intensifies to supply political intelligence, and the Commons moves closer to tightening its rules, MPs will find it harder to keep their share of the market.</p>

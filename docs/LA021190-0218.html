			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS.  </P> <P> Landfall -- Few seemed to notice as the first small globules of oil hit the  sands near Newport Pier on Thursday night, but by later in the evening,  onlookers had clustered on the beach in small groups, staring glumly out at the  waves. The strand was dark, lit only periodically by the glare of television  lights.  </P> <P> Kristy Peters and Greg Reece had driven down from Lake Arrowhead to see the  spill and to volunteer their help, but so far there was no organized cleanup.  Curious, both had scooped up some of the oil-fouled sand with their hands and  were now trying, rather unsuccessfully, to get it off. "It's like the oil off  the bottom of your car," Reece observed.  </P> <P> Scott Anderson, an environmental engineer from Belmont Shores, had arrived at  the beach at 6:30 p.m. with a bag of rags to clean up any oil-soaked birds that  might come ashore. At first, he had watched as small balls of tar, pushed along  by the surf, left thin lines of black along the beach. But a couple of hours  later, the water had turned a foaming, uniform brown.  </P> <P> Nearby, contracted cleanup crews in blue jumpsuits had arrived to soak up the  incoming muck with large absorbent pads.  </P> <P> "I want to be here because I want to see what's done, and I want to see the  effects myself," Anderson said. "I wish I was an expert, but then I guess I'd  be more depressed."  </P></p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (7): US truck orders run in high gear - The factors contributing to a surge in sales If the number of heavy-duty trucks rolling off US assembly lines were a sure indication of gathering economic strength, the Clinton administration would have good cause to be cheerful. Manufacturers of class 8 lorries - mostly large, over-the-road tractor-trailers - are enjoying a boom year, with retail sales in the first nine months of 1993 running more than 35 per cent ahead of last year's level. More importantly, current production or 'builds', which analysts use to gauge quarterly earnings, and orders, which point to future performance, have risen to their highest levels since 1979, just before deregulation brought greater efficiency to the freight haulage industry and reduced demand for new vehicles. Industry analysts agree that new truck orders lead the economy by a year or more. Output of heavy lorries generally shows a close correlation with manufacturing activity, as well as trends in freight movements. Big US trucking fleets, the theory goes, buy vehicles in the expectation of increased demand by factories, mines and utilities for hauling raw materials and semi- finished goods. In the event, industrial production has resembled a big rig driving through city traffic. It has moved in fits and starts, showing signs of smooth acceleration only during the past two months. By contrast, heavy duty truck orders are running in high gear. Analysts have raised their estimates of 1993's retail sales to nearly 155,000 vehicles, a 30 per cent increase on last year's figure. The modest recovery in US manufacturing and strong capital investment spending are helping to lift the heavy duty market, while a mix of unrelated factors is also fuelling the sales surge, analysts say. Some of these broad developments have boosted demand for trucking services, while others - such as a heightened emphasis on fuel efficiency, heavy turnover of trained drivers and more stringent emission standards - have encouraged fleet operators to upgrade their equipment more frequently or ahead of schedule. The pattern among foreign manufacturers to build more of their products in the US, rather than import them, has had some impact. Mercedes, for one, announced plans last month to build a car plant in Alabama - its first outside Germany. Ms Maril Macdonald, vice- president of corporate communications at Navistar International, which leads the industry in combined sales of heavy and medium-duty trucks, says that the relocation of foreign-owned factories to the US in recent years has boosted trucking tonnage and, in turn, lorry orders. The extra push has come at a propitious time. During the recession of 1989-91, many large trucking operators and truck-leasing companies, which normally replace their equipment every five to six years, withheld their orders. With the onset of renewed economic optimism in mid-1992, the pent-up demand began to feed into the market. As a result, net orders by the end of last year rose 74 per cent above depressed 1991 levels. Since then, says Mr Gary McManus, an analyst with Kemper Securities in New York, lorry makers have allowed their backlogs to build to a 13-year high. The six leading heavy duty truck manufacturers - Freightliner, Navistar, Paccar, Ford, Mack and Volvo-GM - are now operating at nearly full capacity, which allows for much more efficient production. Paccar, considered by many to be the best run truck-maker in the US, this year opened a truck assembly facility in Renton, Washington. By early 1995, Freightliner, part of Daimler-Benz, plans to increase annual production capacity by 25 per cent. Full production schedules have brought slightly firmer prices in recent months, according to Mr Matt Stover, who follows the market for Bears Stearns in New York. In general, however, the pricing environment has been fiercely competitive, with most of the demand coming from well-financed fleet operators which can command bigger discounts than owner-operators. Navistar says that comparable prices have risen by only 1 per cent in the past eight years. Freightliner, thanks in part to Daimler-Benz's deep pockets, has shown most willingness to undercut its rivals to gain market share. After taking the lead in 1992, it has stayed on top in 1993, with about 23 per cent of the heavy duty market, which represents a 10-point gain over the past decade. Nevertheless, after pulling out of the red in 1992, Freightliner says it has turned a substantial profit this year, a claim only one of its competitors - Paccar - can make. Daimler-Benz does not report separate results for Freightliner. By contrast, Mack, which is wholly owned by Renault of France, says it has cut its losses and expects to become profitable in the second quarter of 1994. Volvo-GM, controlled by the Swedish automotive group, also expects to turn a modest profit this year. For Navistar, this year has brought a return to profitability. In the second quarter, the group - the surviving operations of once mighty International Harvester - edged back into the black after 10 consecutive quarterly losses on the back of strong sales volume. In its fourth quarter, the group's net income was 28 cents a share compared with a loss of Dollars 1.46 in the same quarter last year. The red ink had resurfaced in the third quarter, but the Dollars 312m loss reflected a one-time charge of Dollars 513m relating to a landmark deal agreed with the United Auto Workers to cut post-retirement benefits. The plan, approved in July, is expected to save the company Dollars 200m a year. 'Navistar is making money, but it's not printing it,' says Mr Robert McCarthy, an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago. He raises doubts over whether the group will be able to sustain its momentum when the market returns to more normal, single-digit growth. In the short term, Navistar, along with other manufacturers, has benefited from the desire of truckers to maximise the fuel efficiency of their vehicles and lower operating costs. New trucks are 5 to 7 per cent more fuel-efficient than models built in the late 1980s, says Mr John McGinty, an analyst with First Boston. Navistar's 9200 series, which features lighter weight and more aerodynamic styling, has helped lift the group's class 8 market share in the first nine months of 1993 by nearly a point. Mack, with its CL and CH series of fuel-efficient heavy lorries, has gained about half a point to nearly 11 per cent. By contrast, Ford, which has made no changes in its product line since 1988, has dropped below Mack in sales. Navistar, leader in the class 6 and class 7 medium-duty segment, is poised to take advantage of an expected acceleration in the intermediate segment. An upswing in orders for retail delivery trucks, school buses and lighter construction vehicles is forecast if the consumer side of the economy begins to pick up steam in 1994. In the first nine months of this year, the medium-duty market - from class 4 (where Ford continues to dominate) to class 7 - grew at a more moderate 11.5 per cent.</p>

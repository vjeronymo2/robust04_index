			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said that all  deposits in Turkish lira or foreign currencies in all banks have  been placed under state guarantee as of today. No limitations  are being imposed on the amount of the deposits.    Ciller and Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin, State  Minister Aykon Dogan, Industry and Commerce Minister Tahir Kose,  and Central Bank Governor Yaman Toruner, as well as other  officials, held a joint news conference in Ankara today.    [Begin recording] [Ciller] We have come here today to  announce a decision we consider extremely important for our  country. All savings accounts and deposits in all the banks in  our country have been placed under state guarantee from now on.  From now on, all the savings accounts and all the money  deposited by the people in all the banks in the country,  regardless of their size, are under state guarantee. Half of  the total deposits, which amount to some 536 trillion lira -- of  this amount, 255 trillion is in Turkish lira and the remainder  in foreign currency -- had been insured and guaranteed. In  other words, close to 270 trillion lira was under guarantee.  From now on, all deposits, whether they are in Turkish lira or  foreign currencies, are under state guarantee.    An important stability package is being implemented in our  country. Step-by-step, it will become clear in the coming days  that this package will gradually yield positive results. I  would like to again remind our people that there were some  suspicions and hesitations in the first months of the struggle  we launched against terror. We have surmounted them all. This  package, which we will implement with the same determination and  resolution, will also prove to be auspicious for our country.    Our television and press have been issuing different reports  on the issue. Our newspapers have been carrying at least two  cover stories daily concerning the difficulties being faced by  various banks. This atmosphere of uncertainty has put our  banking community in an almost suspicious position. Given this  atmosphere, the state has increased the insurance premium from  0.6 percent to 1 percent, thus placing all deposits under state  guarantee. I would like to clearly state that our people can,  without any hesitation, deposit any currency any time in any  bank. All deposits are under state guarantee.    Our country is based on a free market economy. All the rules  of a market economy are fully functioning. When we look at the  geographic region, we can observe economic difficulties. This  is actually the case throughout the world. These economic  difficulties can be observed in the United States, Europe, and  Japan. In our region, however, Turkey is the only free country  where a market economy is functioning. We have an economy that  is freer and more secure and in which the market mechanism  functions much better than all the Eastern European countries,  all the former Soviet republics, and some of the Western  countries. Let this be known to all.    Let everyone deposit his money in any bank of his choice  without fear. No one will question the citizen about the  origins of his deposit. Let the citizens deposit their money  without concern and be aware that their money is guaranteed by  the state.    The economic stability package we have been implementing is  following the planned course. There is no deviation from our  estimates. The projections made by the State Planning  Organization are on target, and we believe this trend will  continue. Therefore, I would like to reiterate that everything  is under control. Our struggle will benefit the entire country.  We will begin feeling its positive effects in the coming year  and in the coming months. We are facing difficulties which we  will surmount in a spirit of unity and solidarity, and we will  continue on our path by distributing the burden of these  difficulties in a just manner. This is the right thing. We  will continue to distribute this burden fairly.    I would like to stress once again: Our banks and  particularly all the deposits in the banks have been placed  under state guarantee with the aim of benefiting our people. I  thank you all. The Central Bank would like to issue a statement  now.    [Toruner] Under the new arrangement, all Turkish lira and  foreign currency savings accounts, of which only 150 million  lira [as heard] were insured to date, are now entirely covered  under the savings fund without any limitations. Although we  have sufficient resources, in cases where the fund fails to meet  all the requirements, the necessary funds will be provided by  the Central Bank of Turkey in accordance with Article 66 of the  Law on Banks. Therefore, there is no problem of resources. All  Turkish lira and foreign currency accounts have now been placed  under state guarantee. Consequently, our citizens, whose  Turkish lira and foreign currency savings in the banks are  guaranteed by the state, can securely deposit their savings in  any bank operating in Turkey.    [Unidentified correspondent] Does this include the banks  that have been closed down?    [Ciller] This decree covers all future transactions.  Naturally, we are approaching past transactions with compassion,  and investigations are continuing. This is a decision adopted  today and encompasses developments and changes to occur as of  today. We are guaranteeing the following: All foreign currency  accounts and all other deposits are guaranteed by the state as  of today. There are creditors from previous transactions with  other banks. The investigation and the breakdown of all assets  with regard to the reimbursement of these creditors is  continuing in a very serious manner. Beginning today, we are  guaranteeing all Turkish lira and foreign currency accounts in  all banks, small or large. Everything is under government  guarantee. Let our people relax and deposit their money in any  bank they choose. Let them know that they are guaranteed by the  state. [end recording]</p>

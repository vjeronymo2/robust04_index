			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG ON STYLE;  </P> <P> JACKETS FOR SPRING, 1990, WILL HAVE A SLENDER SILHOUETTE FOR BOTH DAY AND NIGHT  </P> <P> The short skirts, wide pants and sleek little dresses of last summer will look  quite all right next spring. But jackets are another story. They've undergone  the most striking changes in all of Spring, 1990, fashion. And recent runway  shows in Paris, Milan and New York prove that the new shapes, proportions and  fabrics are unlike those of the past.  </P> <P> Last year's slightly boxy, man-tailored jackets do lend themselves to an easy  update. Wear them over bare bra tops and miniskirts to be young and daring. Or  put them with long, sweeping skirts for a fanciful, romantic effect.  </P> <P> But among the latest jackets, the leading choice is the fingertip-length  version, often fitted through the waist and flared at the hem. In New York,  Calvin Klein called it the riding jacket and combined it with narrow pants. In  Paris, Karl Lagerfeld featured a similar rendition, curvier than most and worn  over skirts only an inch or so longer. In Milan, Romeo Gigli paired elongated  jackets in spice-colored silks with ankle-length pants to wear for evening.  </P> <P> More-conservative dressers might prefer the new long-over-long proportion.  Emmanuel Ungaro in Paris offered a particularly pretty arrangement -- long,  awning-stripe jackets over garden-print, ankle-length skirts. For a younger  look, long jackets top very, very short skirts such as those by New Yorker  Charlotte Neuville, who gave pizazz to a white wool suit when she teamed the  streamlined jacket with a knife-pleated mini. In Paris, Claude Montana focused  on a practical solution, substituting shorts for miniskirts.  </P> <P> The elongated jacket is a fresh look for spring, but it's not the only choice.  Alternatives are boleros, Eisenhower jackets and cocoon shapes, often  embellished with gold embroidery, beadwork or even jewel-like baubles. Gigli  likes the richly embroidered cocoon worn with pants in day or evening fabrics.  Oscar de la Renta prefers shimmering, tapestry evening jackets above taffeta  ball-gown skirts.  </P> <P> Among more casual wear, ethnic themes enhance some styles. For added interest,  most designers are presenting jackets with skirts or pants in unmatched but  complementary fabrics. In Milan, Giorgio Armani mixed tapestry-like fabrics.  New Yorkers Adrienne Vittadini and Isaac Mizrahi mixed plaids.  </P> <P> Elongated jackets are fitted at the waist and flared at the hem.  </P> <P> Ethnic-looking jackets are colorful covers for new midriff-baring bra tops.  </P> <P> Unlikely fabric combinations: tapestry over pleated plaid, polka dots atop  stripes. florals with diagonals.  </P> <P> Fingertip-length jackets cover dramatically abbreviated skirts, shorts or  skimmer dresses.  </P></p>

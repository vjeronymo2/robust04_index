			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURVEY CITES FOUR CALIFORNIA BANKS WITH POSSIBLY RISKY REALTY LOANS  </P> <P> Four California banks -- Union Bank, First Interstate, Bank of California and  Wells Fargo -- are among the top banks nationwide with the largest exposure to  potentially risky real estate construction and development loans, a survey  released Friday shows.  </P> <P> Several out-of-state units of California banks also have high exposures,  according to the survey published by U.S. Banker magazine. Security Pacific  Corp.'s Arizona operation had the highest level in the nation, although that  unit is a small part of the Los Angeles banking company's overall operations.  </P> <P> Although some banks here could be vulnerable to a real estate downturn,  statistics from regulators show that real estate-related problems among  California banks are nowhere near the troubles facing institutions in the  Northeast. And officials of some of the California banks in question contended  on Friday that their real estate loan portfolios are of top quality or are in  strong markets.  </P> <P> The survey comes amid increased nervousness among investors, banking experts  and regulators as both residential and commercial real estate markets have  softened in once-booming areas, mainly in the Northeast and Arizona. The  spreading problem has led to concerns that real estate free-falls experienced  in New England this year and earlier in Texas could hit California -- a  position generally disputed by economists and banking experts.  </P> <P> The U.S. Banking survey, conducted by Alex Sheshunoff &amp; Associates of  Austin, Tex., measured exposure as the ratio of a bank's construction and land  development loans to its equity capital. Figures were compiled using data from  the second quarter ended June 30.  </P> <P> The survey found that at least 40 of the nation's 100 largest banks have lent  more than 100% of their equity -- a measure similar to net worth -- to finance  risky construction loans.  </P> <P> The percentage for Union Bank in San Francisco, a unit of Bank of Tokyo, was  239%. The level for San Francisco-based Bank of California, a unit of Japan's  Mitsubishi Bank, was 207%. First Interstate's California unit, based in Los  Angeles, had a 181% level. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo's was 179%, and  Security Pacific's Arizona unit led all at 347%.  </P> <P> But many lenders and economists believe that the situation for California  lenders is markedly different than for lenders elsewhere, even though there has  been sluggishness in office and hotel markets here, and the high cost of  housing is squeezing potential buyers.  </P> <P> They note that the state's economy is still strong and diverse, demand for  housing continues strong and widespread overbuilding has not occurred. Last  week, economists with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco said they saw  no signs of a real estate recession in California. Indeed, most real estate  problems for California banks are at Arizona and Texas units.  </P> <P> U.S. Banker Editor Robert A. Bennett said the survey is not meant to imply that  banks involved in extensive construction lending will have problems, nor is it  meant to predict which ones will suffer losses. But, Bennett said, banks with  the highest exposure could face big losses if the nation's real estate downturn  continues to spread and worsen.  </P> <P> Real estate loans include residential loans, such as home loans and home equity  loans, and commercial real estate loans, typically those used to develop, build  and purchase apartment buildings, housing tracts, shopping centers, office  buildings and hotels. Commercial real estate loans are especially risky because  of the volatile market.  </P> <P> Banks in California have increasingly turned to real estate loans, which is a  higher-profit, higher-risk business. In the quarter ended Sept. 30, the  portfolio of California real estate loans made by banks totaled $98.9 billion,  up 25% from a year earlier, according to figures from the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corp.  </P> <P> FDIC statistics show that the percentage of bank real estate loans made in  California that are either 90 days or more past due, or do not earn interest,  has actually dropped within the past year. As of Sept. 30, the percentage was  1.86% of $98.9 billion in real estate loans, 27th among states in the nation.  That compares to 2% at June 30 and 2.26% at Sept. 30, 1988.  </P> <P> California's percentage also was below the national averages of 2.84% on Sept.  30. In addition, FDIC figures show that although real estate loans make up  about 42% of the total loan portfolio of banks in California, that is not  unusually high by national standards.  </P> <P> Many bank officials were unavailable to respond to the U.S. Banker survey on  Friday because of the holidays. Michael Cummings, senior vice president in Bank  of California's real estate industry group, said the bulk of its real estate  loans finance construction of single-family tract homes in Southern California,  which it considers to be a good business.  </P> <P> Leslie Altick, a senior vice president with Wells Fargo, said the bank  considers its real estate loan portfolio to be top quality, adding that it has  been unfairly linked by investors to spreading real estate problems at other  banks.  </P> <P> "I think it's fair to say we are suffering from guilt by association," she  said.  </P> <P> Union Bank said in a statement last week that it believes that California will  not suffer the kind of real estate downturn experienced in other areas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PROBLEM LOANS: Problem real estate loans are up in the U.S. but down in  California.

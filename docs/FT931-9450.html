			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Markets: For once, don't blame the insurers - Serious Money THE INSURANCE industry is worried about its image. The Association of British Insurers, its trade body, is launching a campaign to counter the bad publicity it believes it has incurred in the past year. Some of the measures it is considering are welcome: for one thing, the ABI says the advertising campaign will tell people not to take out life assurance if they cannot afford it. This is an attempt to limit high lapse rates in the industry. These early surrender levels have caused concern, particularly since the Securities and Investments Board (Sib), the main regulating body for the industry, disclosed the extent of early lapses at the end of 1991. Sib said that, in 1990, 37.1 per cent of unit-linked life policies and 23.1 per cent of with-profits policies were terminated within two years of being started. Most of these were sold on the back of a mortgage. As regular readers will know, early surrender values are so poor that most who cashed in early will have lost money. There have long been fears that endowment mortgages are oversold because of the high commissions paid to intermediaries such as banks and building societies. Sir David Walker, then chief of Sib, said he thought too much pressure was being put on consumers to take out endowment mortgages because of the industry's remuneration structure. At one stage in the 1980s, four of every five mortgages sold were endowments. Banks and building societies would deny they failed to give best advice to customers on their type of mortgage. Yet, there are times when the limited choice presented to consumers is all too obvious. Take the case of fixed-rate mortgages. John Charcol, the insurance broker, said this week it had received an unprecedented demand for fixed-rate mortgages. This is not surprising, since the standard prevailing mortgage rate is at its lowest since 1971. Some of this week's offers certainly are attractive. Alliance &amp; Leicester building society has a fixed rate of 5.95 per cent for one year, 6.35 per cent for two years and 7.99 per cent for five. Midland bank will fix your mortgage at 6.75 per cent for two years and 8.49 per cent until the end of January 1998. Woolwich yesterday launched a two-year fix at 7.25 per cent. But there is a snag. These fixed rates are available only if you take out an endowment or pension-linked mortgage. Those wanting a repayment or interest-only mortgage are being offered nothing at all. One reader, who has a repayment mortgage with National Westminster, complained that he would have to go through with the full costs of a remortgage because NatWest will not offer him a fixed rate on his existing mortgage. One line of defence put out by lenders is that they are under competitive pressure and can offer lower interest rates only by tying the mortgage to life products - a tenuous argument. Another line of defence is based on the funding of fixed-rate loans. The lender borrows funds on the money markets at a fixed rate. It then offers them to customers at a higher, fixed rate. 'In order for this to be profitable for us, we lend it for the same period at a fixed rate of interest,' said a spokesman for the Midland. 'We would, potentially, get back less interest on a repayment mortgage.' With these, each month's payments includes interest and an element of capital repayment. The interest decreases as the capital reduces and the rate of its repayment increases. Endowment or pension-linked mortgages are interest-only loans which rely on the maturing fund to pay off the capital. Nevertheless, this does not appear to prevent other lenders from being able to offer fixed rates on repayment mortgages. Chelsea building society has a fixed rate of 6.99 per cent until the end of June 1995, and 7.99 until the end of June 1997. Leeds &amp; Holbeck has a one-year fix at 5.99 per cent and a four-year rate of 7.99. The catch in these offers is that you have to take out buildings and contents insurance from the society as a condition of the loan. As the Weekend FT has pointed out more than once, this is often more expensive than similar insurance available elsewhere. Abbey National, Halifax, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester and TSB are, however, among those offering competitive fixed-rate loans without requiring insurance-related products to be taken out, although packages for first-time buyers still demand them. Last year, the department of trade and industry said it was 'determined to ensure that home-owners are not coerced into buying services from mortgage lenders that they either do not want or would prefer to buy elsewhere.' But measures have not yet been implemented and the Consumers' Association calls the proposals wholly inadequate.' So, the insurance industry should not take all the blame for the robust selling tactics of the banks and building societies, which rely on insurance products for an increasing proportion of income - Halifax earned 27 per cent of its profits from insurance commission in 1990, according to the Office of Fair Trading. But it could support measures such as commission disclosure, and issue clear warnings that endowments do not guarantee to pay off a mortgage, so consumers can make a more informed choice. If the insurance industry really wants to improve its image, that would be a good start.</p>

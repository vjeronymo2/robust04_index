			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The MSZP Is Leading and the Fidesz </F> Is on the Slide"]    [Text] The Hungarian Gallup Institute examines the changes  in the sympathy of the adult population toward the political  parties regularly once a month. The data are gathered from a  representative sample of people aged 18 and over, according to  sex, age, and type of community. The latest survey took place  between 28 and 31 January 1994, based on a sample of 2,000  people. The results can be affected by sampling mistakes, and  this reflects the difference between these results and the  results that would be obtained if we were to ask the entire  population. In the current survey, the margin of error is in  the range of plus or minus 2-3 percent. The number of people  surveyed in previous opinion polls was as follows: 5,669 in  September 1993, 1,499 in October 1993, 994 in November 1993, and  1,443 in December 1993.    The opinion poll carried out by the Hungarian Gallup  Institute at the end of January 1994 concludes that the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] is heading the popularity list.  The proportion of potential MSZP supporters gradually increased  in the last quarter of 1993, albeit to a small extent every  month, and it showed a 4 percent increase in January compared  with December. The opposite trend can be seen in the case of  the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], the party that is  currently in second place. Compared with September 1993, the  number of Fidesz supporters fell by almost half. The Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF], a party that almost doubled its  percentage of supporters in the days of the funeral of its  leader and prime minister, is currently in third place on the  popularity list. Although the number of its supporters dropped  by 3 percent from December to January, the MDF has not enjoyed  such a high level of support since April 1993. The popularity  of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] is also increasing.  The number of potential SZDSZ voters is roughly equal to the  number of MDF supporters, and is close to the level achieved by  Fidesz.    The survey also asked the people the following question:  "Which party would you vote for if elections were held this  coming Sunday?"    About a fifth of the people (22 percent) answered "I do not  know", and 11 percent said that they would not go to vote.  Thus, people who support a party make up two-thirds of the  entire population, and we will call them "people who answered."  The size of this group was considerably smaller in one case  only, namely during the survey carried out at the time of  Antall's funeral. At the time, mainly as a result of an  increase in the number of uncertain people, people with a  specific party preference made up 60 percent of the adult  population in Hungary.    The Gallup Institute also measured the people's readiness to  vote with the help of a two-tier scale. The question was as  follows: "The number 7 on this card means that someone is very  sure he would vote if elections were held next Sunday. Number 6  means that he is sure. On the other side of the card, number 1  means that he is very sure he would not vote, and number 2 means  that he is sure he would not vote. The other numbers represent  the various levels between these two intentions. Where would  you put yourself on this scale?"    Some 68 percent of the people interviewed in January 1994  said that they were "very sure" or "sure" that they would vote.  People who said they were very sure they would vote "next  Sunday" make up the group of "certain voters." Every second  adult Hungarian citizen was in this group in January (15  percent).    The MSZP received most support from these people at the end  of January 1994, namely 28 percent, or 10 percent more than the  second placed Fidesz (18 percent), and roughly twice as many as  the MDF (15 percent) and the SZDSZ (14 percent). A total of 8  percent would have voted for the Smallholders' Party on "that  Sunday" and a decisive number (7 percent) would have voted for  the Independent Smallholders' Party [FKgP]. The number of  potential voters for the Christian Democratic People's Party  [KDNP] is similar to the FKgP supporters (7 percent).    Regarding the changes in party preferences, we must notice  three elements: 1. The proportion of MSZP supporters increased  from 22 percent in October-November to 28 percent in January; 2.  In the same period of time, the number of Fidesz supporters  dropped from 35 percent to 18 percent; 3. The MDF, which had  been receiving an average of 10 percent since spring 1993,  received 18 percent after Antall's funeral in December, and 15  percent in January.    The percentages measured among the "probable" voters  slightly  differ from the above figures. The "sure" voters are divided  into three groups: A third would be MSZP supporters (32  percent); half as many would support the MDF (15 percent), the  SZDSZ (15 percent), and the Fidesz (15 percent), and only half  as many again would support the FKgP (7 percent) and the KDNP (7  percent).    Finally, let us mention the supporters of "other" parties,  namely non-parliamentary parties. The overall proportion of  people supporting these parties is 9 percent and, at the moment,  none of these parties is in a position to get into parliament.</p>

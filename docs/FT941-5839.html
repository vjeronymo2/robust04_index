			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Arts: Zurbaran's Patriarchs - A family gathering at the National Gallery Upholders of traditional family values find little comfort in the home life of the Patriarch Jacob. The Book of Genesis describes how Jacob divided his favours between two wives and two slave-girls. The result was an ill-starred daughter called Dinah and 12 sons, founders of the Twelve Tribes of Israel. Jacob and his Twelve Sons, which opens next Wednesday at the National Gallery, London, brings together 13 monumental images of the Patriarchs by Zurbaran, a master of Spain's Golden Age. Probably painted in the 1640s, the Patriarchs are not Zurbaran at his best. Just look at two marvellous paintings in the Spanish gallery next door, 'St Francis in meditation' and 'St Margaret'. Yet even if much of the Patriarchs was painted by assistants, they are strikingly decorative in their exotic costumes, each with an amusingly different different personality. The Patriarchs also share a fascinating history. Twelve belong to Auckland Castle, residence of the Bishop of Durham and little known, partly because they have never been lent before and partly because Auckland Castle is well off the beaten track. I also hear that the dining room is too poorly lit to see the Zurbarans properly. Missing from the set is the 13th Patriarch, the youngest, 'Benjamin'. In its place hangs a copy made by Arthur Pond, artist and dealer, in 1756 when the set was split up at auction. Bishop Trevor of Durham must have been greatly vexed to have missed securing the Benjamin. In his knickerbocker suit with pink bows, he is one of the most charming figures in the series. Benjamin went to Grimsthorpe Castle in Lincolnshire until six years ago, when he was lent to the marvellous Zurbaran show in New York and Paris. Now he has come to London, thus completing the family circle for the first time since 1756. It is odd that there should have been this cache of Zurbarans in England, so long before his name became generally known. Not until the 1830s was Zurbaran appreciated outside Spain when a huge haul of Spanish paintings, looted from churches by Napoleon's generals, went on show in the Louvre. Critics and poets raved about Zurbaran's tenebrous monks and friars, brooding over skulls and rapt in ecstatic visions. It was suggested that the Patriarchs were being shipped out to a client in the Spanish Americas when they were intercepted by corsairs. It was a good explanation. The theme of the Patriarchs was not common in art, but it did enjoy a vogue in the Spanish colonies because of a remarkable theory that American Indians were descended from the Lost Tribes of Israel. The pirate theory is romantic, but wrong. Zurbaran probably thought he would attract a colonial buyer, but the paintings seem to have been picked up in Seville by William Chapman, a London wine shipper who, as a director of the disastrous South Sea Company, forfeited three-quarters of his assets. The Patriarchs were bought by a Portuguese Jew with a country house in Surrey. On his death, the series - minus 'Benjamin' - was bought by the Bishop of Durham. A strongly Jewish subject may have appealed to Bishop Trevor because at the time bishops were in favour of allowing English Jews to become naturalised. However, Trevor preached a sermon looking forward to the day when 'this hitherto obstinate and impenitent People' would be converted to Christianity. The strange, colourful figures of Jacob and his Twelve Sons hanging in his dining room was a reminder to the bishop of the goal which he might yet achieve. It is a wonderful chance that we can now see these charming images of Jacob and his 12 strapping sons briefly reunited. At the National Gallery until May 22 as part of the Spanish Arts Festival.

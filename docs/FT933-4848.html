			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Arts: A mass resung after 400 years - Concert VENICE, as we are reminded by the sumptuous Gentile Bellini paintings in the Accademia, has long been a city of ceremony. Even today on great occasions such as the Regatta, the feast of the Redeemer, and Carnival, the crowds, the fireworks, the trappings, and the masks are a sometimes degenerate reminder of the grandeur of the Republic in its festive heyday. The Save Venice organisation, which has achieved splendid results in the restorations it has sponsored, has brought imagination even to its fund-raising and it has turned its attention also to investigating Venetian music and its performance in the past. The American-born musicologist Randolph Mickelson, long a Venice resident, has for some years been studying not only the manuscripts of Venetian music of the golden age but also the records of performances in the Basilica of San Marco, collating published sources with ancient ledgers to reconstruct with accuracy the music of a specific Mass celebrated on a given day. For, to confound later scholars, the musical parts of the Mass, often composed by several hands, might be given in varying sequences on different occasions. Over a six-year period, Mickelson has convincingly recreated a Mass heard in San Marco on Tuesday 6 May 1597 on the occasion of the crowning of the Dogaressa Morosina Morosini Grimani, the climax of a three-day celebration involving processions, a grand ball, an elaborate supper for hundreds of guests, a mock sea-battle, and the solemn presentation of a golden rose, a papal gift brought to Venice by the pontiff's Nuncio. This delivery took place at the end of the solemn Mass, which included music by a dead composer, Adrian Willaert, and by the living Venetians Giovanni Gabrieli and Giovanni Croce. Both composed regularly for the Basilica - Gabrieli was San Marco's organist for many years, and Croce later became its choirmaster ' but their fame, and their music, rapidly traveled from Venice to other parts of Europe. Mickelson found a manuscript of Croce's Ordinary, used in the Dogaressa's Mass, in the Great Choirbook of the Imperial Chapel of Vienna. For the invited audience of the generous patrons of Save Venice, in a Basilica all aglow (the Zen chapel newly resplendent thanks to these friends of the city) like a magic series of golden caves, the Dogaressa's Mass was sung last week for the first time in almost four centuries. Like the mosaics through which it echoed, it has maintained all its brilliance. First a brass choir proceeded from the main door of the church down the nave, through the roodscreen, to the altar, its solemn fanfare reechoing in the shadowy air. Then, invisible in the west loft, the Ambrosian singers and members of the National Philharmonic Orchestra performed three psalms of Croce, while the baritone Francis Keeping - standing in for the Nuncio - chanted the words of the Mass, as the Coro Gregoriano of Treviso - Italy's finest keepers of the Gregorian flame - responded. Keeping stood in the great porphyry pulpit, the Gregorians clustered below him, so chant and baroque music alternated from separate parts of the church, as chorus alternated with solo instruments, and the organ, sometimes a powerful accompaniment, sometimes magnificently on its own, poured out floods of glorious sound. The separation of the forces seemed deliberately to counterpose church and state, the stark chanting belonged to heaven while the Doge's assertive trumpets, heard at intervals from behind the altar, were compelling reminders of worldly power. The gifted young conductor Raffaello Sapere ably kept the separate forces together and - with the mellifluent and sober Keeping - helped maintain the shape of the event. Most of the gala international audience sat in the nave, under the flickering reddish lights of the chandeliers. But a fortunate few were allowed in the little area before the altar, where the thrones of Doge and Dogaressa once stood. Here the acoustics were amazingly clear, the dying echoes never overlapped or became muddied; and the secular brass rang out with a clarity and brilliance that would have fallen sweetly then on ducal ears, as it did, now, on ours.</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Co-drivers needed on rocky road: Consolidation in the Japanese car industry A SHARP downturn in the Japanese car market over the past two years is forcing manufacturers there to contemplate far-reaching changes of strategy, which could lead to a consolidation of the industry. Japanese car drivers have been the main beneficiaries of fierce competition within an industry of 11 producers. The competition has forced Japanese manufacturers to levels of efficiency and quality which are the envy of their competitors. That may be about to change. Japanese manufacturers are increasingly looking to alliances to help reduce competition and cut costs. Late last year Honda and Isuzu announced an agreement to sell each other's vehicles, after Isuzu had said it would withdraw from passenger car production. Last week Nissan and Mazda confirmed they were discussing a plan to swap vehicles to cut development costs. Nissan is likely to suspend production of some light commercial vehicles and instead sell trucks supplied by Mazda. Mazda will streamline its range of vans by taking supplies from Nissan. Toyota and Nissan, the industry's two largest producers, are considering jointly developing an electric car, which could have long-term implications for collaboration over product development. These are the first responses to the downturn in domestic demand since 1990, which many industry executives believe could mark the start of a period of much slower growth in a maturing market. The slowdown comes as most manufacturers are starting to pay for the heavy investment of the late 1980s. Japanese car producers have traditionally relied upon expanding sales rather than reducing costs to raise profits. Mr Jonathon Dobson, an analyst at Jardine Fleming securities, estimates the Japanese market needs to grow by about 7 per cent for the producers to avoid their operating profit margins being eroded. Few believe the market will sustain that growth. The industry is dividing into two groups: those under pressure and those under heavy pressure. A select few appear to be weathering the downturn in reasonable shape. Toyota, the leading producer with about 41 per cent of the domestic market, has large cash reserves and a reputation for low-cost volume production. Mitsubishi Motors has increased its sales, partly thanks to its extensive but tailored product range which includes leisure vehicles such as the Pajero. Suzuki sold more cars last year than the year before because it concentrated on the mini-car segment of the market. The others - Daihatsu, Isuzu, Mazda, Honda and Nissan - are struggling. Many in the industry believe that Daihatsu, the mini-carmaker, which has already retreated from the US market, may be incorporated into its parent Toyota. Nissan and Mazda are facing acute difficulties. In the late 1980s Mazda seemed to represent the model new carmaker, with an impressive array of redesigned products such as the popular MX-5 sports car. It boasts 4,000 permutations of car. Now it is paying for its image. Sumitomo Bank, which has parachuted a senior executive on to the company's board, is breathing down Mazda's neck. The carmaker's pre-tax profits in the first half of the year to the end of March fell 73 per cent to Y3bn (Pounds 15.4m). The depreciation charge for investments such as its Hofu production plant will rise 30 per cent this year to Y88bn. Its sluggish sales are spread across five sales channels which share few costs. Its overseas operations are less developed than the other carmakers. Mazda, which is a quarter owned by Ford, the US manufacturer, has one of the smallest production operations in North America which leaves it badly placed to benefit from an upturn in the US market. It recently cancelled plans for a separate luxury car sales network in the US. It is also the only Japanese carmaker to lack a production presence in Europe. Long running talks with Ford are yet to produce a deal but the company is understood to have exploratory talks with Citroen of France. Nissan, which incurred a pre-tax loss of Y14.2bn in the six months to the end of last September, has been losing market share largely because its ageing model range is over-extended. Nissan sells 57 per cent fewer vehicles than Toyota, spread over 29 basic models, compared with Toyota's 26. The Cedric model comes with thousands of variations; the Laurel has 86 different steering wheels and 173 types of steering column. To maintain this range Nissan needs a huge and costly array of parts and suppliers. All producers have slowly begun to cut costs. Investment is being reined in and they have announced plans to standardise and reduce the numbers of parts they use by up to 45 per cent. Agreements to share large components are spreading: Mazda is taking diesel engines from Isuzu. Wage costs are being restrained, partly by the spread of single-shift working at many plants. As yet, however, no company has dared cut into the large white-collar overheads in offices and showrooms. However this cost cutting is unlikely to boost profitability, given the bruising competition in a declining market. The obvious companion step is to cut the pace of competition. Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, Nissan president, says the agreement with Mazda will cut development costs but in the long run it could lead the two companies to reduce the number of competing models on offer. The next logical step would be to overturn the conventional wisdom of the late 1980s, which was that product cycles would inevitably shorten as producers rushed out new models to maintain market share. Stretching the life of a model could save huge sums in research and development costs. However until the market leader Toyota signals that it may take such a step, the other companies will be loath to go it alone for fear that their market share and profits will fall sharply. Profits are under pressure in a slow growth market, opportunities for deep cost cutting are limited by labour practices, and the costs of rapid product development are rising unabated. The laggards of the industry will have to start contemplating a more radical consolidation of the industry to allow them to keep up the pace of the leaders.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of a parliamentary committee said Russia's  agrarian reforms are following "the wrong course" and might lead  to famine.    "The electricity per worker ratio in the agrarian sector of  Russia is less than one-tenth of that in Western Europe, while  the low productivity is at present predetermining the depth of  the abyss where the agrarian sector is quietly rolling," said  Vyacheslav Zvolinskiy, chairman of the Agrarian Policy Committee  of the Federation Council, the upper house of parliament.    The "wrong course" for Russian agriculture has been charted  not by science but by politicians, "who are carrying out their  reforms, both in the countryside and elsewhere, at the expense  of the people, above all the peasantry," Zvolinskiy, who is an  agricultural scientist, said in an interview with Interfax on  Saturday.    "What we are witnessing in Russia today is a struggle among  foreign spheres of influence forced on the country by the world  community," he continued. For this reason, the Agrarian Policy  Committee is determined "to defend the interests of the Russian  peasantry to the end" and do its best to have "the executive  branch carry out unconditionally and as accurately as possible"  Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha's April 27 directive  on the agrarian reform.</p>

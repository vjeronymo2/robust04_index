			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Azanian Students' Movement [Azasm] says it will  continue with its campaign to force white teachers out of  township schools, but that this will now proceed in a structured  manner. At a meeting between Azapo [Azanian People's  Organization], Azasm, and the National Education Coordinating  Committee in Cape Town it was agreed to set up a committee to  collect data on white teachers in black schools. A summit  meeting will also be convened to investigate the findings and to  discuss the way forward. An Azasm spokesman said the committee  should meet within the next month. Azasm denied that the  campaign was racist and described it as an attempt to get jobs  for unemployed black teachers.</p>

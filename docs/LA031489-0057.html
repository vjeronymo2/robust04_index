			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTO THE NIGHT  </P> <P> The Scene: A benefit encore performance of "Laundromatinee" by Collage Dance  Theatre. Originally performed last December, the dancers again took over the  Thrifty Wash in Santa Monica to raise money for a matching grant from the  National/State/County Partnership funding agency. Guests pulled into the strip  shopping center, left their cars with the valet, picked up a program (folded in  an empty mini-detergent box) and entered the antiseptic world of Thrifty Wash  with its harvest gold and tomato red decor. Some mistakenly went to the  Brite-Wash across the street, only to find people simply doing their laundry.  </P> <P> The Buzz: Those who had never seen "Laundromatinee" before were very pleasantly  surprised by the dancers' work. "They made such great use of the space!" one  woman squealed. Another guest gave it higher marks than the American Ballet  Theatre's current production of "Swan Lake." But then, ABT didn't have the  added advantage of spin-dry.  </P> <P> Who was there: Dancers Debi Albeyta Cindy Clarke, September Gaw, Eimi Guirao,  Betsy Howard, Vanessa Vandergriff and artistic director/choreographer Heidi  Duckler; Tina and Steve Silberman; Richard and Sandy Mallory; Abby Sher; Roland  Wiley; Susan and Michael Lushing, Eric Rosenfeld; Gil and Shari Escobedo; Greg  Goyeneche; Hali Paul and Howard Brock and musician Randy Gornel, who six years  ago did a Las Vegas lounge act/performance art piece at the Thrifty Wash and  the Brite-Wash. Life, like the wash, works in cycles.  </P> <P> Dress mode: Eclectic. Many tall male and female yuppies zipped over from work  in their BMWs, dressed in suits and horn-rimmed glasses; one woman opted for  black gloves with her strapless dress and others wore jeans.  </P> <P> The food: Donated by Trader Joe's, it included Brie, fresh fruit, crackers and  wine, set on platters atop the washers. One pesticide-conscious woman was  horrified to find bunches of grapes among the fruit. "They can't serve those  grapes!" she cried. "People will have mutant babies if they eat those grapes!"  </P> <P> Quoted: "We spent six weeks rehearsing here while people did their laundry,"  Duckler said. "Some people were just really incensed. And we felt bad that the  owner was losing money so we all brought our wash here."  </P> <P> Triumphs: Overwhelmingly favorable reviews from the audience, who never  expected to have so much fun and actually be exposed to culture in a  Laundromat.  </P> <P> Glitches: With no real seats, shorter guests found it difficult to see the  performance, especially with all those tall yuppies in the way.  </P> <P> Sentimental Journey: Laundromat owner Stan Fox was presented with a collage of  photos and reviews, signed by the dancers. "When they called and asked if they  could do the performance here originally, I couldn't say no," he said. "I said  OK, as long as it doesn't disrupt the business. And it disrupted the business.  I thought, 'What'd I do this for?' But I got to like 'em so much. And the show  was a big hit. They worked really hard, trying different things, going in the  dryers, in the washing machines. I thought that was the last I'd see of them,  but I was delighted when they called me again. I really missed 'em while they  were gone." JEANNINE STEIN  </P></p>

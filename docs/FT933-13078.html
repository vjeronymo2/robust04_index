			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Limits of world order 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it,' said Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, last January, answering a question about the membership of the UN Security Council. The system was working well. The existing five permanent members had at last found the cohesion necessary to play the role assigned them by the United Nations Charter. So why risk paralysing the council by introducing new members, especially since it would be very difficult to know where to stop? No doubt the case for admitting Germany and Japan was strong, based on their economic importance - though they would have to match that with a bolder and more direct role in world security if their candidature were to be taken seriously. (A pause at this point for the British and French to thump their chests: Our troops are in the Gulf, Bosnia, etc. Where are yours?) But don't imagine that the two-thirds majority in the General Assembly required for amendment of the charter would be available for two extra permanent members from the rich north, unless the poor south's importance were also recognised. We should find ourselves enlarging the council's membership to 20 or more, and giving vetoes to problematic countries like India and Brazil, or even Indonesia and Nigeria. Where would your new world order be then? I paraphrase, of course. Indeed, I caricature. But that has been the gist of the British argument for opposing change. There are two things wrong with it. First, it is too self-serving. Britain's interest - or at least the interest of the UK foreign office - in preserving the trappings of being a great power long after the reality has gone is too obvious for the merits of the case to command attention. The case sounded much more persuasive than it ever has in the mouths of British ministers or diplomats when, last week, it was put by a young German scholar, Marc Weller of the Cambridge Research Centre for International Law, arguing against his own country's campaign for permanent membership. The second problem is that its main premise is dubious. Are we sure that the UN Security Council 'ain't broke'? It is true that the vehicle is now in motion, with one great power firmly in the driving seat, which is better than when it was immobilised by rival drivers yanking on the hand brake. But the steering column looks increasingly ropey, the needle on the petrol gauge is well into the red, and many of the passengers have no confidence in the man at the wheel. Should we wait until it has ground to a halt again, or careered right off the road, before attempting an overhaul? Many things about the UN need to be re-thought. The membership of the Security Council is only one of them, and perhaps not the most directly relevant to immediate problems. More countries with vetoes may well not be the answer, and certainly an increase in the weight of rich countries at the expense of poor ones would make things worse. If the number of permanent members is to be increased, the veto should either be scrapped and replaced with a system of weighted voting, or there should be provision for an override when the majority is large enough. First, though, we should all think harder about what we actually want the Security Council to do. Its primary responsibility under the charter is 'the maintenance of international peace and security'. It has no direct responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security within states and it is not equipped for that task. It has slid into it for three reasons: War and insecurity within states have a tendency to spread across international frontiers, for example in the cases of Cambodia and Iraq. In many conflicts which start within states the existence of the state or its frontiers becomes the central issue, as is the case with Yugoslavia. Public opinion in western countries, which at present dominate the council, no longer feels that its responsibility to try to halt bloodshed stops at the frontiers of a sovereign state, since images of bloodshed and misery now leap across frontiers and oceans into every western living-room. No man is an island. That is perhaps more true today than when John Donne said it. The urge to 'do something' is natural and admirable. But to act on it is frivolous and irresponsible unless we first measure the size of the task and forge instruments capable of performing it. To restore order and rebuild society in countries where it has completely broken down requires sizeable armies and the will to use them. It requires confiscation of sovereignty and the imposition of external rule - temporary, no doubt, but measured in years rather than months. Either a single country has to undertake this task - that was the old way, but is any country now willing to do it? - or a supranational authority has to be set up specially for the purpose, with procedures and chains of command carefully worked out. If anyone asked me to take charge of Somalia, for instance, I should want a very broad mandate, authority to hire and fire all UN personnel within the country, both civilian and military, and to use force against any local group that challenged my rule. I should want a guaranteed budget and at least a three-year term, to be shortened only by a unanimous vote of the council. I rather doubt if I should get it. If I did, how could I guarantee that mayhem would not again break out on my departure, as it did in so many countries when imperial rule came to an end?</p>

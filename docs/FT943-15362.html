			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Let's get down to business, comrade: As Russia's old system collapses, a dynamic market economy is taking its place Ivan is one of the new Russian businessmen who seem to have come from nowhere. Six years ago, he was a special education teacher. Now he is owner or director of 20 companies, which range from insurance to manufacturing of clothes, furniture and china to trading and importing. It was the importing that interested the mafia. Ivan's offices are at the top of a worn-out office building. The water often goes off and hallways are dingy. But Ivan's own suite is a world of stylish, modern furniture. On the day the mafia called, six of the gangsters stayed downstairs, while five took the elevator up to his office. They knew that Ivan had received a shipment of cigarettes worth Dollars 200,000 from the west. It was on consignment, meaning that he had not yet paid for it. They wanted those cigarettes. To make sure Ivan knew they were serious, two of them ostentatiously put guns on the table. 'They're not mine,' said Ivan. 'I can't give them away.' The gangsters did not care. They wanted the goods. Ivan asked for time, excused himself and went into another office. He was shaking. He hurriedly called a friend who was an officer in the FSK, the successor to the KGB. An FSK squad arrived quickly: on the way up, they arrested the six men downstairs. They then met Ivan, who had not yet gone back to his own office, and put a recording device on him. Ivan returned to the room where the gangsters waited for his answer. They said their patience was not endless; they threatened him and his family. They described the different ways they had killed people. Ivan asked for more time. The mafia boss stood up to leave. He made it clear that he expected the matter to be resolved very soon. Some of his men remained, to keep up the pressure. Then, on a pre-arranged signal, Ivan said: 'There's no need for you to be here.' At that moment, the FSK men broke in with their guns drawn. They scooped up the guns on the table and ordered the gangsters up against the wall, frisked them, removing other guns, and then took them away in handcuffs. Recalling the scene a few weeks later, Ivan was still shaken: 'It looked like an American film.' That is one face of emerging Russian capitalism - a combination of the wild west, America's 19th century robber barons, and Chicago in the 1930s. But it is only one face of the new market economy that is developing in Russia much faster than is generally recognised. In our book Russia 2010, we try to offer a preliminary sketch of how Russian-style capitalism might look in the year 2010. It might bear more resemblance to Italian or Latin American capitalism (before privatisation) than the US or Japanese versions. But whatever its final shape, elements of Russian capitalism are already in place. Early in the next century, people may even be talking about 'a Russian economic miracle'. Russians are as surprised as anyone. 'The market is developing much more rapidly than I would have thought possible even a year ago,' said Evgenii Yasin, one of the chief economic advisers to President Boris Yeltsin. 'Unlike socialism,' Yasin added wryly, 'you don't have to 'build' capitalism. It builds itself.' Russia is certainly going through wrenching changes: industrial output continues to plummet; many workers are not receiving their salaries; and many enterprises are not being paid. Savings have been wiped out by inflation and well-trained professionals are today earning only the equivalent of Pounds 60 or Pounds 70 a month. A distinguished musicologist, for instance, now sells mineral water on the streets of Moscow. Meanwhile, people who would have been regarded as 'social parasites' in Soviet days drive around in Mercedes, with personal bodyguards. Crime is pervasive: by one estimate, a third of all bank employees are security guards. Yet what one sees does not match the dismal numbers. Colour is appearing on buildings and in shop windows, enlivening the drabness of even a year or two ago. The billboards extolling the achievements of Soviet communism have been replaced by signs advertising American candybars, Korean electronic goods, and Russian banks. The residential construction boom on the outskirts of Moscow and other cities is so strong that it has caused a shortage of bricks. And Moscow even has its own version of Wall Street - a long row of interconnected office buildings two miles from the Kremlin. 'The country is supposed to be in a deep economic crisis, but the traffic jams in Moscow get bigger and bigger,' a foreign diplomat commented sardonically. Which is the 'real' Russia - that of the great depression or the emerging market? The answer is both. Even while the old system continues to collapse, with perhaps the worst yet to come, a dynamic market economy is beginning to take its place. Will it ever be fully functioning? Boris Fedorov, the former Russian finance minister, answered that question only half facetiously: 'Why not? We already have a malfunctioning market economy.' No one has any idea of how big this market economy is. The statistics of the Great Russian Depression capture only the official, measurable economy. Industrial production should be declining, as the lop-sided military-industrial economy runs down. But there are no accessible numbers on the private economy. In the Soviet era, managers had every incentive to exaggerate their economic performance, to meet their targets. Today, the incentive is just the opposite - to minimise figures to avoid the taxman (whether from the government or the mafia) and to evade regulations. Visit Astrakhan, the caviar capital of the world, and ask how much caviar is being produced these days: 'Officially, 550 tons a year,' said a local caviar expert. And unofficially? 'Maybe twice that, maybe five times - who knows?' Beyond the visible and the anecdotal, there is some circumstantial evidence of the rapid growth of the private economy. Real incomes are growing by 10 per cent a year, and reported consumption levels have almost recovered to 1990 levels. At this point, Russian-style capitalism is capitalism at its rawest. It is, as some Russians say, the era of 'primitive accumulation of capital'. After all, you cannot have capitalism without capitalists. The country is caught in a great battle to gain control of the resources, property, and political power that are being set free by the collapse of the old order. 'Crime cannot be controlled,' said one deputy in the Duma, the new parliament, 'until the struggle for property is finished.' The distance Russia has to go to develop a modern market economy is highlighted when one considers the common features that underlie the many different 'brands' of capitalism around the world. One is a competitive price system; a second is a system of agreed-upon 'rules of the game'. The latter extend from general values, such as that the market should not be a corrupter, to specific laws and regulation. They also include norms - for instance, a dispute over a contract should not be settled by murder but by a court. And a market system is embedded in a legal, cultural, and institutional context that supports its workings. By these criteria, Russia has a long way to go on the road to a mature market system. This is what Russians mean when they say that what they have is 'a bazaar, not an economy'. A body of rules and laws is yet to be written. Even lawyers are in short supply and good independent judges are even more scarce. The concept of property, fundamental to a market system, is far from worked out. Moreover, things could go badly wrong over the next few years. Conflict between Russia and its newly-independent neighbours is an obvious risk; a severe unemployment crisis - promoted by the eventual collapse of the old military industrial enterprises - could provide fertile ground for demagogues and civil unrest. And if unchecked, crime could prevent development of the market, destroy the morale and ambition of entrepreneurs, and undermine the legitimacy of the state. Russians themselves, we have found, are fascinated, if also amused, by the very idea of writing a book called Russia 2010. They hardly have any framework for thinking about the future. Uncertainty and insecurity characterise their lives. Everything they took for granted has disappeared - economic security, the dictatorship of the Communist Party and the control of the KGB, the predictability of life and the delivery of food by the enterprise that employs them, the stupefying cant of Marxism, safety in the streets, a yearly holiday in the Crimea and the Soviet Union as a superpower. Thus, it is hard to find anyone who will describe themselves as optimistic. A distinguished academician, who is also deeply engaged in the private sector, is asked what he expects for the future. He replied: 'I think of the last line in a letter my grandfather wrote from Stalin's gulag: 'Hope for the best, and expect the worst'.' Yet it is remarkable how much has been accomplished in the brief time since communism collapsed. A driving force of change has been the voucher privatisation programme, celebrated last year in the hit song 'Wow Wow Voucher'. Anatoly Chubais, privatisation minister, said the objective of this hectic programme was to make the destruction of socialism 'irreversible'. However imperfect, it may well have worked. Most small shops and enterprises are now in private hands and an estimated 40 per cent of the workforce now works in the private economy. Over the next two years, the newly-elected Duma has the challenging job of privatising land, and writing the laws and creating the financial structures for a market system. A new phase of the market system begins this month as 'voucher privatisation' gives way to a system under which state property will be sold for cash. In short, despite all the dangers ahead, Russian capitalism is already a reality. But to understand the direction of Russian capitalism, one must look beyond the 'Red Barons' - the Soviet industrial managers turned businessmen - and seek out younger people, such as Ivan, who are part of a post-communist generation that will build the market society. Ivan never knew his father; his mother was a cleaner. He did poorly at school. When Gorbachev started to encourage private business, he decided to make weight-lifting equipment. His workshop was so low he could not stand fully upright; at night, he worked as a taxi driver to support himself. He borrowed metalworking equipment and small tools from factory workers. He began with seven employees - by the end of the first year, he had 50. He stayed in the weight-lifting equipment business for three years. 'It's difficult to be a boss,' he said. 'I believed in communism. I was educated in it. The feeling of comradeship was very important. But, as a boss, you've lost your chains. You have a feeling of responsibility for those who come to work for you.' Now the groups Ivan either heads or is involved with employ 3,000 people. 'The fashion is over for weight-lifting,' he said. 'The fashion today is to work with finance and money. I now work day and night. I start at seven in the morning and go to 11 at night.' He owns his own apartment and five cars, but he keeps them locked in garages to prevent theft. To explain how business works in Russia today, Ivan told this story: 'Two people meet. The First one says: 'You want to buy a cartload of sugar?' The second one replies: 'Yes, fine.' They agree on price. 'Then the first one goes to see if he can buy a cartload of sugar, and the second goes to see if he can find some money. 'Business here is a gamble. You can make money one day, and it can all go wrong the next. You've got to risk. The biggest lesson of business for me is that you have to defend and attack.' He had a specific meaning in mind. He opened his coat, to reveal a glimpse of something that looked like a gun. Daniel Yergin and Thane Gustafson, respectively president and director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, are co-authors of Russia 2010, which will be published by Nicholas Brealey Publishing on July 14, and on which this article is partly based.</p>

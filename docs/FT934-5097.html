			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Arts cuts less severe than expected - Heritage The government plans to spend Pounds 4.5m on fire-prevention measures at royal palaces in the wake of the recent fires at Windsor Castle and Hampton Court. Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, seems to have fought his corner well against the Treasury's attempts to reduce public expenditure in 1994-95. The national heritage department's budget for the year will be Pounds 976m, compared with Pounds 955m in 1993-94. The biggest projected victim was the Arts Council, which a year ago was told it faced a 2 per cent reduction in its 1994-95 grant. It will now receive 1.69 per cent less. The Arts Council of England will have about Pounds 3.2m less to distribute in 1994-95. Lord Palumbo, chairman of the Arts Council, said: 'This is a black day for the arts and a national disgrace. This is a needless budget cut which will inflict disproportionate harm on the arts.' The full council will meet in mid-December to decide whether to share the reduction in grant equally among its clients, or whether to concentrate its reduced resources on certain art forms and companies. About Pounds 1m will be spent on London's Albert Memorial, which has been under protective wraps for several years. The government is also providing Pounds 3m towards the Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds.</p>

			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Faults in EC package The so-called EC growth package lies mainly in the realm of gesture politics. The Ecu60bn a year injection of demand, first mooted in Brussels, was obviously meant to be 1 per cent of Community GDP - something like its budget - rather than a specific programme. The likely EC action, involving the European Investment Bank, is about a tenth of that amount. Meanwhile the British government mainly wants to give the label 'growth package' to what it has already announced in the Autumn Statement in which it supposedly 'rebalanced' expenditure and which it holds out as an example to other governments. As for the genuine growth package proposals, there is a danger that they will come too late. They are being brought up just as the first signs of recovery are appearing in at least some parts of the international economy. There is thus a risk of aggravating rather than dampening the boom and bust cycle. The risks of mistiming are greater at the international level, where the lags between diagnosis and policy implementation are even longer than they are domestically. Admittedly, mere signs that output may no longer be dropping (outside Germany) or could be rising slightly do not themselves make a growth package mistimed. An anaemic recovery which increased the gap between actual and potential output, and was accompanied by high and rising unemployment, would still be a case for treatment. But would a conventional package be the right treatment for such below-par performance? The one precedent we have to go on is at the level not of the EC, but of the Group of Seven countries at the Bonn summit of 1978. This was undertaken fairly late in the recovery phase of the business cycle, when it was felt that the upturn was not strong enough to make a sufficient dent in world unemployment. The centrepiece was a promise by the German government to stimulate demand by 1 per cent of GDP. Many participants subsequently concluded that it had all been a mistake and merely aggravated the inflationary boom of 1979, which coincided with the deposition of the Shah of Iran and the consequent shock to oil prices. Some, such as the former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, changed their minds more than once on the issue. A proper analysis, either of the 1978 package or the one suggested now, would have to take account of the elementary fact that a fiscal stimulus - whether government spending or a monetary relaxation - can only add to spending in money terms. Whether the result is real growth, just more inflation or some mixture of the two depends on the state of the economy and on the reactions of businessmen, unions, financial market participants and many other economic agents. Although it took place all those years ago, there has never been a proper analysis of the Bonn summit package. It was simply assumed that all the stimulus represented real goods and generated more jobs. The same naive assumption is being made by the more enthusiastic proponents of concerted EC action today. This confusion between nominal and real is especially likely when all the talk is of infrastructure projects. It is taken for granted that bridges, roads and buildings must add to GNP. This is to reckon without the more far-reaching effects on wages, prices and interest rates, and second and third-round effects in general. There is a more far-reaching criticism. It is taken for granted that, if the economy needs a kick-start, it must always take the form of public investment and never of tax cuts. There is no warrant for such belief, which is simply a return to the conventional wisdom of the pre-Thatcher and pre-Reagan eras, without anything having been learnt in between. If it really is true that the European economy needs a demand stimulus, and that stimulus has to take in part a fiscal form, then it is just as appropriate to have temporary tax cuts. A tax cut is quicker to implement, and quicker to reverse. It is not, of course, plain sailing. An income tax cut known to be temporary might have reduced effects on spending. On the other hand, a temporary VAT cut might bring people into the shops more quickly, but would not have the same incentive or supply-side effects. Nevertheless any kind of temporary tax cut would avoid the danger of a continuing upward drift in national debt ratios. Above all it would avoid the danger so apparent in the British plans, which show public expenditure rising to more than 45 per cent of GNP next year. The alternative of a concerted tax cut among several countries is moreover much less open to the objection that the extra spending will leak abroad, as one country's leakage will be another's stimulus. We are mainly talking about the need to find some fiscal kick-start until German interest rates begin to tumble, as they surely will before we are many moons older; and for that purpose, a temporary tax cut meets the bill admirably.</p>

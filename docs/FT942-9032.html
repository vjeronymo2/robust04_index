			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Disgraced former mayor joins the race for Washington Mr Marion Barry will this weekend declare himself a candidate to be mayor of Washington, DC, the job he left in disgrace four years ago after being arrested for use of narcotics. Mr Barry, who subsequently served a prison term, was re-elected to the city council in 1992 representing Washington's poorest district. He is given at least an outside chance of winning September's Democratic party primary, which is tantamount to victory in November since local Republicans are insignificant in number. The likely field of local black leaders also includes Ms Sharon Pratt Kelly, the incumbent mayor, and Mr John Ray, an at-large city council member. There is no provision for a run-off election after the primary which means, as was Mr Barry's fortune in 1978, that the mayoralty can be won in an evenly divided three-person field with little more than one third of the vote. Mayor Kelly is widely considered to have been a disappointment, especially by the city's whites, a majority of whom supported her in 1990. One recent city-wide poll found two-thirds believing she did not deserve a second term. She is blamed for failing to attack both the crime wave and the city's budgetary deficit, which leaves it on the verge of seeking federal assistance. Several senior aides have recently been fired or resigned. Mr Ray is probably now rated the favourite, since he seems to have been the principal beneficiary of Ms Kelly's declining support. He is expected to run a less passive campaign than he did in 1990, when he sought to balance his appeal between blacks and whites and was upstaged by Ms Kelly's campaign to clean up the Barry mess. Mr Barry's three terms, from 1978 to 1990, could hardly have been more controversial, even before his demise. A well known community and civil rights activist, he cut a flamboyant figure, preaching black pride and awarding city contracts to minority companies, but simultaneously alienating both the federal government and Congress, on whom Washington depends for about 20 per cent of its financial needs. But his grassroots support in the overcrowded and run-down housing precincts remained strong, as witnessed by his easy council victory two years ago over an apparently formidable black female opponent. He claims now to be a reformed person, with a new marriage, and his drug addiction behind him.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Accountancy income dented: Competition and recession dent earnings, league table shows Intense competition and the effects of the recession severly dented the income of the UK's acountancy firms during the last year, according to the Fincial Times laegue table of the profession published today. Fee income excluding expenses for the largest 30 firms was almost unchanged between 1991-92 and 1992-93, while the number of partners professional staff and offices fell sunstantially. Two-thirds of the firms reported an absolute decline in income and most of the increases were in single digits. The greatest growth was 17.5 per cent at Andersen - comprising Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting - and the largest decline was 11.1 per cent at Casson Beckman. Overall fee income rose just 0.2 per cent to $3.4bn, indicating stagnation in the sector but also demonstrating the tremendous revenues now generated by the profession. The figures also show the growing dominance of the 'Big 6' firms, which alone generated revenues of $2.6bn during the past year - or three quarters of the total. A year ago Coopers &amp; Lybrand was the only Big 6 firm to report a decline in fee income. This year only one of the Big 6 - Andersen - has managed to report any growth. Across the firms (excluding Reeves &amp; Neylan, for which there were no comparative figures) the number of partners fell by 4 per cent to 5,010. Other professional staff fell nearly 6 per cent to 43,449. The results show the growing diversity of services provided by accountants. Among those which break out activities, audit and related accounting services compromises on average just 41 per cent of total fee income. It is below half for all but 11 of the 30 firms. Total audit fees fell 2.4 per cent to $1.4bn during the period. Insolvency income - now making up 11 per cnet of the total - rose by 10.8 per cent to $389m. It accounts for as much as 43 per cent of income for Levy Gee and 27 per cent at Robson Rhodes. Tax recenues - 23 per cent of the total - dropped 0.3 per cent to $787m, while those from consulting - 20 per cent of the total - rose 1 per cent to $674m. Beyond the four prinicipal divisions there are many other activities, such as $1.9m generated by the corporate finance group at KPMG Peat Marwick. Acountancy firms ar under no legal obligation to publish financial information because they are private partnerships. They persistently refuse to provide details of profits. Andersen has the highest ratio of professional staff to partners and the highest fees generated by each partner, at nearly $1.6m. The figures are adjusted as far as posible to allow for comparisons, but many of the stated year-ends are different, and other factors such as mergers and widely differing structures confuse the position. Several - such as Moore Rowlands - are associations of different firms rather than a unified organsiation, while a number of others - like BDO Binder Hamlyn and KPMG Peat Marwick - compromise separate partnerships.</p>

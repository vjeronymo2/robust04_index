			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleg Falichev: "Russia Is Staying at Baykonur"] </F>   [Text] So the prediction by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA about the  outcome of the Russian-Kazakh negotiations was virtually  completely right. And apparently it was because the logic of  life itself -- especially the life of the recent difficult years  -- prompted the two republics to search for a solution in a more  intimate integration and strengthening of friendly ties.    Perhaps one of the most important document signed by  Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev was the Treaty  on Broadening Further the Cooperation and Integration Between  Russia and Kazakhstan. Specifically, it lays the foundation for  cooperation in areas such as economics, culture, and law. Also  extremely important are the Agreement of Strategic Nuclear  Storage Facilities Temporarily Located in Kazakhstan, the Treaty  on Military Cooperation, the Memorandum on the Basic Principles  for the Resolution of Issues Associated With the Civil and Legal  Status of Citizens of Kazakhstan Living in the Russian  Federation and of Citizens of Russia Living in Kazakhstan. In  all, more than 30 documents were signed.    As we also expected, some problems arose in connection with  the resolution of the issue of the fate of the Baykonur  Cosmodrome. But there, much was done by those working on the  joint agreement during the preparatory period of the delegation.  And although the last word was still with the presidents, the  changes they inserted into the agreements on the status and  conditions of use of Baykonur and the city of Leninsk turned out  to be insignificant. The cosmodrome, under development for many  years during the time of the Soviet Union and from which the  first launch was made, on 4 October 1957 -- as well as from  which the first cosmonaut, Yuriy Gagarin, lifted off, on 12  April 1961 -- remained under lease to Russia.    The term of the lease is 20 years, with an extension of 10  years. The Russian side maintained its position on Russian  citizens -- military servicemen of the Military Space Forces of  the Russian Federation -- staying at the cosmodrome and  servicing it. The lease price: $115 million a year. The director  of the Russian Space Agency, Yuriy Koptev, had this to say about  that: the Russian-Kazakh agreements reached in Moscow  acknowledge Russian jurisdiction over the cosmodrome. That means  that the Russian citizens and military servicemen will live  under Russian law.    With the Baykonur lease, we emphasize once again, both sides  win, the citizens of both republics win. As for the people in  shoulder boards, who, by the nature of their activity, are used  to following strict regulations and clear laws, these agreements  -- including the Treaty on Military Cooperation -- are  particularly important to them. And what they say is that the  period of uncertainty in Russian-Kazakh relations is behind us.  That, like it or not, all of us have to swim together to the new  shore under the rubric of "cooperation." That the popular wisdom  that say that one old friend is better than two new ones is  right.</p>

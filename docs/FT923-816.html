			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Books: Putting the Great in Britain BRITONS: FORGING THE NATION 1707- 1837 by Linda Colley Yale Pounds 19.95, 421 pages THIS IS a very ambitious book, long awaited by Professor Colley's colleagues, admirers and friends. It is based on a remarkable range of scholarship - not archival, for there are few new manuscript sources used in its making, but her knowledge of printed sources is majestic, especially of articles, seminar papers and Ph. D. theses. However, almost all post-date 1970; yet the subject of her book - the transformation of England from being a European power of moderate substance to Great Britain, the greatest imperial power in the world - has not been neglected since the days of Macaulay, let alone Lecky and others. But even though Professor Colley's theme is commonplace, her approach is in many ways very original and novel, and more often than not carries conviction. The book consists of eight major essays - Protestants; Profits; Peripheries; Dominance; Majesty; Womenpower; Manpower and Victories. They are held together by a kind of chronological structure and by the internal logic of their subjects. Each chapter could easily be expanded into a book; for, constrained by space, there are at times there is a sense of elision, of interesting facets remaining unexplored. The overruling impression of the book, however, is one of weight and importance. The subjects of these essays are central to an understanding of the greatest transition in our history. Professor Colley is right, too, to stress Britain's role as the bastion of a protestantism that was also xenophobic to a degree. The Pope and all his works belonged to a world of ignorance, deceit, cruelty and despotism. She makes great play with Hogarth's print of The Calais Gate. Hogarth's violent hatred was a common attitude. Indeed, Roman Catholics were anathema to most English; not surprisingly, the most destructive riots of the 18th century were those against Catholics: the Gordon of 1780. This loathing, however, had one benign side effect not mentioned by Professor Colley - the Jews escaped the fate they usually suffered elsewhere in Europe, pogroms;. they began to be integrated into English society very fast in the last decade of the 18th century. A more serious criticism is the absence of any discussion of the great changes in English protestantism in the 18th century, both intellectual and structural. 'Protestants' is followed by an admirable chapter on 'Peripheries' - Scotland mainly, but much wisdom and insight is shown into the career of John Wilkes (although a surprise to find him in this chapter) and she is excellent, too, on the struggle for American Independence (I was delighted to discover that Professor Colley agreed with my view , adumbrated some 20 years ago, that many Americans and Britons viewed the conflict as a civil war at least until the French intervened). Her treatment of the 1760s and 1770s is quite splendid in this and subsequent chapters, although the very slight treatment of Ireland creates an uneasiness. It is not enough to say they never took to 'Britishness.' Fully into her stride, Professor Colley covers an increasing range of subjects: sharp vignettes of people and stimulating insights into the complex nature of patriotic belief and its rationale (or lack of it) gather pace, yet the whole is varied in quality - 'Womenpower' weak, 'Manpower' truly excellent, and so on. It is an amazing panorama, a little chaotic at times, disputable at others, as all bold historical work must be. The general reader cannot fail to enjoy it and the professional historian will be stimulated by it. It is a book of great merit, yet, good as it is, it seems to me to have two major weaknesses. Economic history, the growth and spread of British wealth, is largely ignored; referred to certainly but never investigated, yet the growing patriotic optimism about, and confidence in, Britain's greatness derives from industrial supremacy as well as military victory. Britain was in the forefront of industrial technology and that counted. And, secondly, although there is a short paragraph on the subject, the age structure of the British population between 1800 - 1820 merits a more extended treatment. The young men, blazoned with Union Jacks, tattooed on almost every available inch of skin, who create mayhem every weekend in Europe or Britain (or the neo-Nazis viciously attacking refugees in Rostock) are all contained within the age group 17 - 24. At any period patriotism seems to seize that age group like a fever - and that was the overwhelmingly dominant age group in late Georgian England when blatant patriotism was more prevalent than it was to be again for nearly a hundred years. Indeed, the adolescent population may have been a great factor in forging not only the British but also the French nation. Professor Colley's book will stimulate debate as well as research and it certainly confirms her position as an historian of distinction.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / SNP hopes strengthened by polls The Scottish National party enters today's Euro-elections with its hopes of winning a second Euro-seat and of strengthening its position in others, boosted by favourable opinion poll findings. An ICM opinion poll for The Scotsman newspaper and Scottish Television put support for the SNP at 31 per cent, one of its highest levels. It also showed that 48 per cent believed Scotland would get a better deal from the European Union if it were independent. The SNP is increasingly confident of winning the North-east Scotland seat - which includes Aberden and Dundee - from Labour, which beat it in 1989 by only 2,613 votes. The SNP already holds Highlands and Islands, where Mrs Winnie Ewing took 51.5 per cent of the vote in 1989. The party hopes at least to strengthen its position in the six other Scottish seats, which are held by Labour. Last time it came second in four of them. The ICM poll showed Labour on 46 per cent, the Liberal Democrats on 11 per cent and the Conservatives in fourth place on 10 per cent, their lowest level ever. Labour is concerned that the leeching of support from the Tories to the nationalists in rural areas, where Labour is not the Tories' main opponent, could work to its disadvantage. But while the SNP claims to have won the argument in the campaign, it agrees that the outcome depends on the level of turnout. 'The turnout is very difficult to predict,' Mr John Swinney, the SNP's campaign director said yesterday. The ICM poll showed a three point drop to 35 per cent in those backing independence for Scotland, with 46 per cent wanting a separate Scottish parliament under Westminster. It also showed most Scots believe that the European Commission and European parliament should have less importance than national parliaments, and that European integration should be slowed down.</p>

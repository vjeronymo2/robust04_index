			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Radical agenda urged on Major A call for the government to abandon consolidation in favour of a radical agenda of reform was issued yesterday by a prominent rightwinger on the Tory back benches. Mr Edward Leigh, the former technology minister identified as a key figure behind efforts to promote a leadership challenge to Mr John Major, warned that a 'steady as she goes' policy risked becoming 'steady as she sinks'. Mr Leigh, a strong critic of the decision to drop privatisation of the Post Office, said the government had to weave the traditional threads of Tory philosophy into a populist and radical programme for the next century. He said in a pamphlet published by the Conservative Political Centre that the platform should be based on the notion of 'responsible individualism'. That meant empowering individuals through the market economy while equally supporting the creation of an 'ethical' society through leadership and legislation. Alongside traditional Tory commitments to strong defence, law and order, and firm support of British sovereignty in Europe, the pamphlet suggests a range of new policies. He also calls for the present leadership rules to be replaced by a framework which would ensure one contest during the lifetime of each parliament. Meanwhile, Mr William Powell, Tory MP for Corby, last night called on Mr Major to resign and stand for re-election, to end speculation about his leadership. He told BBC Radio Five Live that he did not want to see a leadership challenge, but believed Mr Major could end the speculation and reimpose party discipline by winning a leadership contest.

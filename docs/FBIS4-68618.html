			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by AKTSENT Deputy Editor in Chief L. Kozin: </F> "Results of the `President-94' Survey: In Choosing the President  of Ukraine, Oblast Workers Give Preference to Simonenko and  Kuchma"]       [Text] Of survey participants, 24.1 percent, that is, one  out of four, are ready to vote in the presidential elections for  Leonid Kuchma, the former prime minister and currently a  people's deputy of Ukraine.    Another 20.7 percent have firmly decided to vote for making  Petr Simonenko, head of the Communist party of Ukraine and  Ukraine's people's deputy, the head of state.    People's Deputy of Ukraine Vyacheslav Chornovil ranked third  in popularity among voters who participated in the survey. He  got 13.8 percent of the vote.    Yefim Zvyahilskyy, acting prime minister and a people's  deputy of Ukraine, also received a rather high rating (11  percent).    Vladimir Grinev, former deputy chairman of the Supreme  Council and currently a people's deputy of Ukraine, is supported  by 10.4 percent of the voters.    Seven percent of the voters see the socialists' leader and  People's Deputy Aleksandr Moroz as the future president of  Ukraine. According to survey results, 3.4 percent of respondents  give their preference to the current President of Ukraine Leonid  Kravchuk.    The same percentage of respondents wrote in People's Deputy  Viktor Pynzenyk, who was not included in the main list...    What was the main factor in the readers' choices? To answer  this question, let us look at the opinions expressed in letters.  Naturally, newspaper space does not permit us to quote all the  mail we received in connection with the "President-94" survey.  But the letters we quote below will probably be indicative  enough for the voters and politicians to draw conclusions.    (In quoting from the letters, we have retained the authors'  style and spelling.)    "We are pensioners; our life is not that sweet; we follow  the  situation in independent Ukraine, read the press, although it is  very expensive, and follow the work of politicians and the  parliament. In our choice of candidate for president we will  give our vote without hesitation to Leonid Danilovich Kuchma. He  is a worthy candidate of his people. He is honest, fair, and is  not stained with stealing. He attempted to unmask thieves, such  as enterprise directors..., for which he was punished by  President Kravchuk. We believe that L.D. Kuchma will be able to  lead Ukraine out of the crisis, impose order and discipline.  Respectfully, pensioners Tvardovskiy, Dzerzhinsk."    "I talked to the residents of our apartment building, dear  comrades, and the majority of them said that if there are going  to be several names on the ballot in the Ukrainian presidential  elections, then people said that I should write to you that we  would vote for Leonid Kuchma. When I asked them why Kuchma, they  could not answer. So it is for Kuchma. His idea was, and he  tried, to change everything for the benefit of the people, using  his powers. Respectfully, N. Babenko, Kirovskoye."    "I do not have time, I am in a hurry, but I will reply. I  vote for Leonid Kuchma or Vladimir Grinev. Why? They represent  the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, are the only  sensible people of all the ones listed. Had the Supreme Council  consisted of sensible people, perhaps we would not need the  institution of the presidency. And if we had a competent,  farsighted president, he would have governed the Supreme Council  well, directed them along the right course. T., Donetsk."    "We, pensioners from Shakhtersk, are answering your survey.  We will vote for Leonid Kuchma. Why? Because he advocated unity  with Russia and we have nothing to quarrel with them about; our  brothers, children, and parents are there; we do not need  bloodshed like Karabakh. Not like one fool who spoke on the tube  for the Ukrainian language, cut one's finger--he should have his  tongue cut out, this is better. We do not know his name. Our  state needs to have a president, to protect our interests, but  not like L. Kravchuk protects... interests. We do not need to  divide the fleet, it is all people's property. This is our  opinion."    "Dear AKTSENT! I did not want to write, but I am sick and  tired of watching and listening to all sorts of nonsense. You  are asking about presidential candidates. And this Chornovil  from Rukh yells right away: Do not let the communists into  power. Why? How long can we listen to them? They do not pay any  attention to our hardworking Donbass [Donetsk Basin]. All one  hears is: Canada, Poland, Romania; as to Russia, it is as if it  does not exist. We are fingers on the same hand. Our children  are in Russia. So how can we not vote for the communists? Let it  be Simonenko. But no way "bandery" [Ukrainian nationalists]. For  Simonenko! Because we want to live in peace and for our children  to have a future. L. Kravchuk. L. Kuchma, V. Chornovil, I.  Plyushch, S. Khmara, and Ye. Zvyahilskyy should not be placed on  the list of presidential candidates under any circumstances!  They should be kicked out... If there is to be a presidential  system in our state, I personally can only trust P. Simonenko  and A. Moroz. Only communists are capable of leading the country  from the dead end--the deep economic crisis. I have always  trusted and will trust communists. Our state does not need a  president. It is quite enough for us to have a Supreme Council  and a Cabinet of Ministers. We do not need an additional staff  of presidential loafers. Respectfully, L.N. Granitnoye,  Telmanovskiy Rayon."    "If the names you listed are put on the ballot in Ukrainian  presidential elections, our sympathies are on the side of Petr  Simonenko and Leonid Kuchma. We do not need a president like  Kravchuk. We need to bring back the Soviet Union. We are waiting  for this. I., Donetsk Oblast."    "Dear editors. Forgive me for my illiteracy, I only attended  school for a year and a half. Dear editors, I and all my  relatives and my whole family we only recognize as future  president-94 and will vote for Simonenko or Kuchma. Kuchma  always was and is for people, while Kravchuk is for America and  we do not need people like him. We need those who are for Soviet  people. Simonenko we respect because he is a real communist not  like other candidates, who said I am not a party member. Had he  not been a party member, he would not have reached such a  throne. We will vote for these people, and all others are not  worthy to be president, they took a wonderful life away from us  and instead gave us a concentration camp, the only difference is  that we are not behind barbed wire but like this. Real leaders,  all the dirt they did they dump on Kuchma. Without Kuchma we do  not have such prices as bread for 28 kopeks and milk for 20  kopeks. Why did they not give us back without Kuchma everything  that had cost kopeks. They are shameless bazaar women. Soviet  power gave them free education and such jobs. And they have  fouled it up. Stalin was right that he sent to Kolyma all  "bandery." They are afraid of communists. Ts., Kuchayevsk."    "If there is a God in this world, the president's job, if he  is to be elected, should go to a truly honest man,  patriot-communist Petr Simonenko. Respectfully, not a party  member but in my heart with the communists, Vasiliy Vasilyevich  Frostal, Donetsk."    "I want to take part in the survey because I am not  indifferent to the fate of my motherland--Ukraine. I am writing  in Russian so that our brothers--the Russians--can read this.  Dear people, what have we come to--we have walked into a dead  end, into a labyrinth, and do not know how to get out, although  there seem to be smart people in Ukraine. Why was it necessary  to destroy the Soviet Union, one big friendly family? Who is now  our "father"?--President Leonid Makarovich Kravchuk. He is a  good man. But he is cunning, and when he begins to dodge in his  speeches--beware. I have a been a Komsomol [All-Union Leninist  Communist Youth League] member since I was 18; I have been a  member of the Communist Party since 1976. I have not surrendered  my party card, and all good communists have remained in its  ranks, those who are communists at heart; it is not our fault  that former leaders of our party turned out to be traitors, and  now they have become turncoats and live in clover. At the  election meeting I asked candidates for deputy to resolve in the  parliament the question of reunification with Russia and  Belorussia. They are Slavic peoples. The language is  understandable for everyone, we are of the same faith, or at  least let us make one ruble zone, because one cannot even buy  mineral water in Ilovaysk from speculators for our coupons, they  demand Russian rubles. This is how it is. If the people you  listed are to be put on the ballot, I would vote for Petr  Simonenko, because under the communists bread cost 24 kopeks,  and an envelope--6 kopeks, not 430 karbovantsy. Anyway, dear  comrades, maybe we do not particularly need a president, this  will create dual power, I think. We have elected a parliament,  the people elected it, so let the parliament decide everything,  carry out the will of the people. I am 57. A pensioner. A  communist--posthumously [as published]. Your newspaper is very  good, I mean it. I am a regular reader, S.G.G., Aleksandrovskiy  Rayon."    "I would very much like to see Vyacheslav Chornovil as  president. Here is why. A president must love Ukraine and then  he would do everything so that Ukraine would be rich and its  people would live well. What is happening now is that the people  we have elected expend their energy (like Charodeyev) on  symbols, on two state languages. For us, ordinary people, it  does not matter what kind of flag we have, just let us live  decent life--by the way, the yellow and blue flag is pretty.  Since there is a state, let there be our own flag. And also, do  not offend other nationalities: Why do some deputies insist on  Russian as a state language, there are many Greeks, Jews, and  others living in Donbass. How are they worse than Russians?  There should be one language--state language, Ukrainian. And all  the deputies should be able to speak it, they are smart, instead  of creating clashes and inciting interethnic strife. We all want  to live in peace and live well. As to the president, we need  one. Goodbye. S.A. Tregub, Donetsk."    "Although I am not knowledgeable about politics, I decided  to  take part in the survey. Of the names you listed, I consider V.  Chornovil the most appropriate candidate. I voted for him in  previous elections, since he was the only candidate who insisted  on disbanding the parliament, and the appropriateness of this  demand has been confirmed many times with the passage of time. I  cannot judge whether the office of president is needed, since I  have not read the draft of the constitution and do not know what  powers are vested in him. Everything depends on what powers he  will have. We do not need a "ceremonial" president as Kravchuk  was. By the way, tell us about the powers of the proposed  president--this would be very useful. And also: If there is no  president, who will have more power--the prime minister or the  parliament? A., Donetsk."    "In the previous survey you joyfully, on the front page,  printed the results of the survey, in which Donbass said "No to  Nationalism" and "Yes to Socialism." This is exactly what  transpired in the elections on 27 March and 10 April. And what  good is there in this? Our Donbass has disgraced itself in front  of the whole world. That we said "no" to nationalism is good.  But let us look at who our people gave their votes to. To  communists-fascists. Why do I say this? Everybody remembers the  events of 3-4 October in Moscow; they walked there shoulder to  shoulder in closed ranks--Nazis, communists, and fascists. So I  ask you: "Who was it our people voted for in the final  analysis?" For those who fooled us for 76 years and are still  fooling us; those who have destroyed millions of innocent  people. This criminal communist regime deserves a second  Nuremberg trial. I will vote for Vyacheslav Chornovil, because  in my opinion he is the person who can launch a market reform.  Until our people learn to separate the truth from dirty lies,  there will be a dark night over Donbass for a long time. V.I.  Shostak. Miner, 37 years old. Ukrainsk."    "I would elect V.V. Chornovil to the job of the head of  state, Why? First: Everyone else, with the exception of S.  Khmara, is of a communist orientation, communists, whom I do not  trust. Second, Chornovil is a brave and decisive person when it  comes to implementing market reforms, and please do not label  him "nationalist" in the bad sense of this word. Does our state  need a president? Yes, it does! As to the soviets, they need to  be liquidated. V.P., Russian, Konstantinovka."    "I am answering your survey. Of this list, I would vote for  Yefim Zvyahilskyy and Kuchma. Behind them is a classic schooling  in Donbass--the hardest region in Ukraine. They raise the issue  of stopping the downward slide. They occupy priority directions  and will be filled [as published] with positive solutions. They  raise the issue of implementing reforms for the sake of the  people, not at the expense of impoverishing citizens, and  especially implementing reforms in the coal industry.  Peace-loving foreign policy, primacy of human rights, solid  protection of citizens from criminals, and many other things we  associate with the notion of normal life. P.D. Melbrod, Torez."    "I would vote for Yefim Zvyahilskyy. He got the economy  moving for the better. My thanks to him! As to our state, it  needs a president. I like presidents of capitalist countries and  their senate (parliament), and I want so much for them to live  for the country instead of their own shirt, as our president and  the former parliament did. Galina Mitich, Yenakhiyevo."    "Dear editors! I would like Ye. Zvyahilskyy to become  president, because this man does not just talk--he acts; because  of all the people who have been in power in independent Ukraine  after Shcherbitskiy, he is the only one who has been able to  sharply bring down the rate of inflation. I understand that the  next necessary step is to stimulate truly needed and important  and vital enterprises of all forms of ownership. I think  Zvyahilskyy understands this too. To the best of my knowledge,  he is not at all a fool. Of course, he is, as they say, not a  charismatic leader at all (that is, to put it simply, he lacks  charm). Well, so what, Thatcher also was like this and this did  not keep her from pulling England out of the crisis. I do not  know whether this is appropriate in answering this survey, but I  want to say that in Kravchuk, too, I see not only negative  traits. He is intelligent and flexible; he is not a chauvinist  and not dogmatic, which one could easily expect of the second  secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine. He does not react  fast enough to the fast-changing reality. And this has  contributed--wittingly or unwittingly--to the impoverishment of  Ukraine and all of us. Respectfully, G.I. Chizhina, 61 years  old, Donetsk."    "I personally will vote for Leonid Makarovich Kravchuk.  During the first elections I voted for Kravchuk without  hesitation. I believe that we need only a strong presidential  authority. Let it even be a dictatorial form in the beginning.  Our people need to be taught to work and be responsible for  their actions. So far our people are a pack, and they need a  strong leader. At this point I do not see a better president for  us than Kravchuk. I personally am against early presidential  elections. Why throw away money? Better invest this money in  health care and science. With all my respect, Valentina  Vasilyevna Zhdanova."    "I believe that V. Chornovil should become the president of  Ukraine. This man and politician has integrity, is honest, and  is a man of action. The intelligentsia supports his position.  Although for some reason I am convinced that Ukraine, especially  the communist Donetsk Oblast, Lugansk Oblast, and Crimea, will  elect such a candidate that the whole world will laugh at  Ukraine. I believe that we need a president. We cannot place all  the authority in the hands of our unprofessional Supreme  Council. N.K., Gorlovka."    Well, another readers' survey is behind us. The results of  political contests in the oblast completely confirmed the trends  revealed by our two previous surveys. How will it be this time?    One may say that AKTSENT already has held its presidential  elections. The political leaders and their teams are just  launching their election campaign. We can already see the gap  between what readers-voters confidentially tell us in their  letters and what is happening these days at enterprises and  organizations. Despite-- judging by the results of the  survey--the extremely low current rating of Ivan Plyushch, he  was nominated as a presidential candidate in the proletarian  bastion of Donetsk--Kirovskiy Rayon, at the Imeni Abakumova  mine. Time will tell whether the results of our survey will burn  up in the flames of miners' hot love for the speaker. President  Kravchuk said last week that he does not wish to participate in  the elections--he believes that working people do not want to  elect a head of state if they are given such a compressed time  frame. On Tuesday this week, however, he was nominated as a  presidential candidate in Slavyansk. Local collectives took the  initiative, in particular, the Farko production-cooperative  association. It is not known whether or not the elections will  be held on 26 June, but just in case, as they say, it does not  hurt to be nominated in a timely fashion. Political reserves do  not burden the pocket. And this is considering that the  popularity of the current president--again, according to the  survey--in our oblast is extremely low...    The nomination of candidates, the actions of politicians and  their teams are proceeding along the old blueprints, which is  quite normal for our land of workers and peasants... Everything  repeats itself: Apricots are in bloom in Donbass, and socialist  democracy is blossoming again in all its splendor. Before you  know it, harvest time will be here...</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: Swedish jobless rate climbs Sweden's unemployment rate climbed to 8.5 per cent of the workforce in June from 7.1 per cent in May, according to the central bureau of statistics. The latest figure was swollen by school-leavers and was in line with market expectations. It was lower than a year ago when 9 per cent of the workforce lacked a job. Economists say that, adjusted for seasonal factors, the unemployment rate is steady. This may disappoint the centre-right government, which is anxious for clear signs of economic revival just two months before a general election. An encouraging sign is that the number of people in jobs rose in June to 4.05m from 3.88m in May. The number of people participating in special training schemes was also down, falling to 177,000 from 240,000. Christopher Brown-Humes, Stockholm Finnish unemployment rose to 19.9 per cent in June from 19.0 per cent in May, the Labour Ministry said yesterday.</p>

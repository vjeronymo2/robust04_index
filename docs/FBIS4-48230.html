			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulundi May 14 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]  president and minister of home affairs Chief Mangosuthu  Buthelezi launched a stinging attack on the media for  "demonising" him and his party in the run-up to the election.  Addressing an IFP victory rally in the KwaZulu/Natal region on  Saturday, Chief Buthelezi said: "We had no money, we had the  media against us, we had gurus at universities against us." "I  thank the editors and journalists who had a field day vilifying  me both here and abroad."    He decried the fact that the IFP, which entered the election  race late had only six days to campaign, adding that the  confidence ordinary people had in his leadership assured him  victory. "Never in the history of democracy has any political  party entered an election with just six days left to campaign  and then go on to win as the IFP has done in KwaZulu/Natal."    Chief Buthelezi implored his supporters to work for  reconciliation to overcome the hostilities in the townships and  rural areas, caused by a drawn out internecine conflict which  has claimed more than 10,000 lives in KwaZulu/Natal. "Go out  and break down the barriers that divide you from your political  opponents. Go out and spread the word of peace and  reconciliation."    Chief Buthelezi said: "There can be no economic development  in the region until we achieve peace. No businessman will want  to invest in this region if his life is in danger. No investor  will want to build factories if their factories are going to be  burned down. We will have to work at political reconciliation  if we are to end up with a national will to make democracy work  for the benefit of the people."    He said South Africa's new coalition government faced a  difficult task, adding that the politics of the dominant ANC  partner differed in many respects from Inkatha's. "And yet,  through this so-called government of national unity, we have to  operate together jointly as a cabinet. It is not going to be  easy," he warned. But he assured President Nelson Mandela of  his cooperation.    Chief Buthelezi made it clear the IFP's election win in  KwaZulu- Natal meant the government of KwaZulu-Natal was an IFP  government. "The future of this region in relation to everything  that has still to be settled can only be settled with the full  agreement of the IFP and its leadership."    Chief Buthelezi said the IFP shared the objectives of the  ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme, but cast doubt  on the ability of the programme to achieve its stated goals.  "We fear it that it may not work simply because it says that  the government will provide everything to the people. Nowhere  in the world has the state been able to provide for all the  needs of a country's people."</p>

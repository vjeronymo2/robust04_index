			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / The Council Tax: Proposals for the poll tax replacement set out in detail - Local funding consultation document The outcome of the next general election will be influenced by the electorate's acceptance or rejection of the new council tax announced yesterday. Plans have also been published for streamlining local government by introducing a single tier of authorities in place of many county and district councils. FT writers report on the proposals and their implications THE consultation document A New Tax For Local Government sets out in some detail the government's proposals for the new council tax, to come into effect by April 1993. Basic proposals: 'The government has decided that from the earliest possible moment the community charge will be replaced by a new system of local taxation. The new 'council tax' will comprise a property and a personal element. But it will take the form of a single bill for each household, based on the value of the property and the number of adults who live in it.' Discounts: As 54 per cent of households have two adults living in them, 'the government favours a discount approach on the assumption that there are two adults in each household. Households with two or more adults would pay the basic council tax for their property. Single-adult households would pay less through a personal discount indicated on the bill. 'Under these proposals, some 38m adults in Great Britain would be taken into account directly in calculating bills. Only 4m adults would be excluded, many of whom - for example students and people on income support - would be eligible for personal discounts even if they were to be counted for the tax. 'A significant advantage of the discount approach is that there is no need for a register of council tax payers. Households simply receive a bill which assumes two adults, but pay a reduced bill through a discount where there is only one liable adult or two discounts where there are none or where the property is not a principal place of residence. 'The government favours setting the personal discount as a percentage of the basic bill of the household. It proposes that the discount should be 25 per cent of the basic bill.' Banding: Assessing the taxable value of domestic properties based on rental values, capital values or rebuilding costs . . . would pose various problems. The government therefore proposes to adopt a new approach: a banding system. 'Each property would be allocated to one of a small number of bands. Households in properties in the same band in a council's area would receive the same basic council tax bill. There would be no need for a detailed valuation of all dwellings. 'The banding system could be designed to ensure that excessive burdens did not fall on a minority of properties. Undue variations in bills arising from regional variations in property values could be avoided. Banding would reduce the administrative task involved in the introduction of the new council tax and allow it to be achieved more quickly. 'The government proposes a system by which all properties in an area would be placed in one of a small number of bands constructed around the average property value in the relevant country - England, Scotland or Wales. 'The government proposes that a couple living in the highest band would pay two thirds more than a couple living in a property in the middle band. A couple living in a property in the lowest band would pay two thirds of the bill for a middle-band property. Overall, bills for couples in the highest band would be two and a half times as much as those for couples in the lowest band.' Valuation: The Valuation Office of the Inland Revenue will supervise the assignment of properties to bands. There would be no need for regular or frequent revaluations of properties under a system of banding. Multiple occupancy: The government proposes to bring some houses within the scope of non-domestic rating when there is multiple occupancy, or where adults are joint owners or tenants, recognising that many properties of this kind are run as businesses. Second homes: Where a property is not anyone's main residence, the government proposes that the bill should then be reduced by the maximum of two personal discounts. Rebates: 'The government proposes that, for individuals or couples on income support or equivalent levels of income, rebates should meet 100 per cent of their liability to the council tax. There would be no minimum contribution. 'People on incomes above the income support level will contribute on a sliding scale.' Where non-dependants on low incomes live as the second adult in households where the occupier is not eligible for a rebate, there should be a full personal discount where the person is at or below the income support level. Students: Where the first or second adult in a property is a student, a student nurse, an apprentice or a Youth Training trainee, each will receive a full personal discount. If there are no other adults in a household of students, the household will receive two discounts. Government grants and assessments: The system of standard spending assessments by central government will remain, and under the new council tax 'grants will be paid to local authorities so that each area can finance spending at a standard level by levying the standard taxable amounts fixed by the secretary of state for the council tax. 'Local authorities would retain discretion to set their budgets above or below the standard level . . . The government's intention is that an authority's spending above or below the standard level will be reflected in its council tax bills. 'The variation in spending should fall proportionately on the bills of all council tax payers in the area, so that each household would see an equal percentage increase or reduction in their bill compared with the level for standard spending.' Two-tier authorities: 'In areas with more than one tier of authorities, the tiers should each set their own separate element of the council tax, and the separate elements should be clearly identifiable on the single bill.' Capping: The government will continue to use its powers to cap excessive local authority spending. Powers for capping Scottish authorities will be adjusted to equate with those in England and Wales. Business rates: No changes are proposed in the business rate system introduced in 1990. Room N7/20 Department of the Environment, 2 Marsham Street, London, SW1P 3EB. Free.</p>

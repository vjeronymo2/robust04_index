			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Oktay Eksi: "How Can the Following Be </F> Explained?"]    [Text] Understanding the motives of those who wish to  undermine the secular system in Turkey is not difficult.  However, those who are convinced that "nothing can happen"  should also be considered.... Understanding their approach is  impossible. Are they truly convinced that nothing can happen?  That the profundamentalist forces, which are led by the  Prosperity Party, cannot come to power in the future and that  those forces will not remove the democratic system if they do?  If that is the way they look at things, then are they unable to  see the situation in the countries that have adopted the  "Islamic way of life?" Unfortunately, the situation cannot be  explained to them. No matter what you say, they will respond:  "Do not worry, nothing can happen." That will make you feel  frantic. At least, that is how I feel because I do not believe  that a threat can be described as "small" or "unimportant."    If a problem poses a "threat," then a solution must be found  to it. However, the view Speaker of the Grand National Assembly  Husamettin Cindoruk has expressed on the matter is as follows:  "The anxiety on the secular system's future is baseless. Our  people will defend secularism. The people will support us to  defend secularism if we effectively explain what it means to  them. The secular system is guaranteed not only by the  Constitution but also by the people." That is a baseless view  that conflicts with reality. It has made me feel that I am  among officials who are deaf and dumb.    Yes, that view conflicts with reality. Was Husamettin  Cindoruk not in Turkey when the elections were held on 27 March?  If not, was he not informed of the outcome of those elections?  Is he among those who defend the view that "Turkey and Algeria  are two different countries?"    It is true that Algeria is not similar to Turkey.... A  comparison between the two countries will show many things in  favor of Turkey, which will raise the people's morale. However,  I wish to recall the following: All the other Islamic countries  said "we are different from Iran" when Ayatollah Khomeyni ousted  the Iranian shah's regime and established a fundamentalist  order. Several correspondents arrived in Turkey and asked who  our "khomeyni" was at the time. We laughed at them because we  were convinced that the "khomeyni" in Turkey commanded only 7 or  9 percent of the votes and that the Turkish people had adopted  the secular system as a way of life. However, we were unaware  that the United States was trying to establish a green belt of  fundamentalist countries against the former Soviet Union to  check Communism at the time. Consequently, it supported the  religious trends and organizations, regardless of its dispute  with the Khomeyni regime in Iran.    Let us consider the changes that have taken place since that  time: An Islamic order has been established in Sudan, which  said in the past that "Iran is a different country." Very  little time is left before the fundamentalists take over  Algeria. The terrorists in Egypt, who wish to establish a  fundamentalist order, have frustrated the people to such an  extent that they are almost ready to embrace the "Islamic  Brotherhood Organization," which has been a problem in that  country since 1928. The secular system in Tunisia is  maintaining its existence with great difficulty. Meanwhile,  King Hassan has had the largest mosque in the world constructed  in Morocco to secure the support of the fundamentalists in his  country. The reports from Bangladesh and Pakistan are  demoralizing. The Islamic way of life, which Prosperity Party  Leader Necmettin Erbakan has described as "just order," is  supposed to bring peace to the people. However, it has created  a fratricide in Afghanistan.    All that is an indication of the present situation in many  of  the countries that said "Iran is a different country" 15 years  ago.    Meanwhile, the United States has moved to consider "how to  improve Washington's relations with the countries that have  adopted the Islamic order." That indicates that no one will  support the prosecular forces in a country when their secular  system is removed. In view of this, we must abandon the view  that "the secular system will not collapse" and adopt the  approach that "the secular system will collapse if we do not  support it." We must be skeptical and not heed the views of  apathetic and imprudent people like Husamettin Cindoruk and  former Social Democratic People's Party Leader Erdal Inonu. We  must be aware that we shall never again be able to see the light  of contemporary civilization if our secular system collapses.</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Rural poverty 'hidden by cloak of prosperity' An influx of wealthy people has cast a 'cloak of prosperity' over the English countryside which hides the poverty, inequality and isolation faced by at least a fifth of rural households, says a study to be published next week. The report by the Rural Development Commission, a government agency, also finds evidence of a significant 'black economy' in rural areas. At least 20 per cent of households were living on or below the poverty line in nine of the 12 counties surveyed, the report says. Even in well-heeled West Sussex, Warwickshire and Northamptonshire between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of wage-earners in households had gross salaries below Pounds 8,000. 'The juxtaposition of wealth and poverty merely heightens the relative impact of low-income lifestyles in these areas,' says the report by Bristol University researchers. During the 1980s, many well-off, mobile people moved into villages to retire or commute to jobs in towns and cities, creating an image of affluence, it says. 'The increasingly common assumption of countryside people as two-car-owning merito-cracies can only serve to hide the plight of the non-mobile minority in gaining access to basic and necessary lifestyle opportunities.' The report was funded jointly by the Rural Development Commission, the Department of the Environment and the Economic and Social Research Council, a government agency. It was based on questionnaires from more than 3,000 households in 12 areas in England in 1990. It argues for more government action to create jobs, fill the 'vacuum of affordable property for rent' and improve public transport and other services. Migration to the countryside is not confined to the better-off, the study says. 'The incidence of low-income households appeared to be being reproduced in most areas through the 'in-migration' of a significant number of lower-income households.' This runs counter to suggestions that rural deprivation will disappear as disadvantaged groups 'move out or die off', it says. More than 60 per cent of respondents in most counties surveyed - 90 per cent in North Yorkshire - believed local people, especially young married couples, faced difficulty gaining access to accommodation. Between 54 per cent and 74 per cent considered that there were 'significant employment disadvantages'. But there was also evidence of a vigorous black economy in many areas. 'Second jobs (done by) 'foreigners' or 'moonlighting'  -or casual work done by those who would otherwise be unemployed - appeared to be significant if hidden aspects of economic life.' More than 90 per cent of people in six counties and more than 80 per cent in two others believed public transport had declined while 16 per cent of households had no car and 23 per cent of women had no access to a car. For many country-dwellers, there is the compensation of a close-knit community, proximity to nature, and being happy and healthy, says the report. 'However, our surveys also emphasised that the experiences of these characteristics can be highly differentiated. One person's splendid isolation was another's loneliness; the close-knit community for many can be prying, gossiping intrusion for others.' Lifestyles in Rural England.

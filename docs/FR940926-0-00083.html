			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA has evaluated the level of safety for the 1,500-foot minimum altitude requirement in the final rule and that provided by a 500-foot minimum altitude requirement. Although the 1,500-foot minimum altitude requirement has a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, it provides operational safety superior to that provided by a 500-foot minimum altitude and is necessary in the public interest. With the 1,500-foot minimum altitude, fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters have a longer power off gliding time, and the pilots are better able to select a suitable landing area in the event of a power failure. Hawaii's unique topography often complicates access to suitable emergency landing areas. The air tour accidents in Hawaii have been characterized by insufficient time for pilots to locate suitable landing areas after engine power loss or other problems leading to accidents. Therefore, the additional safety margins at the 1,500-foot minimum altitude should be provided when conducting passenger flights. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> International Trade Impact Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SFAR will not have any impact on international trade because the affected operators do not compete with foreign operators. The SFAR will not constitute a barrier to international trade, including the export of U.S. goods and services to foreign countries and the import of foreign goods and services to the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Good Cause for Immediate Adoption <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA is implementing this emergency final rule due to the recent escalation of fatal air tour accidents. Despite voluntary measures, the cooperation of the Hawaii air tour operators, and the FAA's inspections, the accident data show that voluntary measures and existing regulations are insufficient to ensure safe air tour operations in Hawaii. The recent accidents discussed above indicate an urgent safety problem that cannot be adequately addressed solely by enforcement of existing regulations. For this reason, I find that notice and public procedure are impracticable and contrary to the public interest. However, interested persons are invited to submit such comments as they desire regarding this SFAR. Communications should identify the docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the Rules Docket address noted above. All communications received on or before the close of the comment period will be considered by the Administrator, and this SFAR may be changed in light of the comments received. All comments will be available, both before and after the closing dates for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested parties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> International Civil Aviation Organization and Joint Aviation Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In keeping with U.S. obligations under the Convention on International Civil Aviation, it is FAA policy to comply with the Standards and Recommended Practices of the International Civil Aviation Organization to the maximum extent practicable. The FAA is not aware of any differences that this amendment will present. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Federalism Implications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this regulation will not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination and the International Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this regulation is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that this regulation will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This regulation is considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures. A final regulatory evaluation of the regulation, including a Regulatory Flexibility Determination and Trade Impact Analysis, has been placed in the docket.

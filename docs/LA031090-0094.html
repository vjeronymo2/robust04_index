			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABBOTT UNHAPPY ABOUT RAISE;  </P> <P> ANGELS: CLUB RENEWS HIS CONTRACT. HE WILL RECEIVE $185,000 THIS SEASON.  </P> <P> Jim Abbott, the first Angel rookie pitcher to reach double figures in victories  in four years, said Friday that the team's decision to unilaterally renew his  contract and pay him $185,000 this season "kind of hurts."  </P> <P> Abbott earned the minimum of $68,000 last season and as a second-year player is  not Abbott, who made a rare jump by going directly from college ball to the  major leagues, was 12-12 with a 3.92 earned-run average in 181 1/3 innings. He  was the first Angel rookie left-hander to reach double figures since Frank  Tanana in 1974.  </P> <P> "We didn't ask for the moon," Abbott said. "I'm not real happy with it. We went  in and we talked about how I contributed a lot to the Angels on and off the  field and they didn't agree. We really went in with an offer we felt was fair  based on my performance. You look at guys around the league who have won less  games, and they're going to be paid $80,000 to $100,000 more.  </P> <P> "We just feel there was a pretty good commitment on our part toward the Angel  organization and they said there wasn't. I'm a little disappointed. In these  things, you should compare yourself with people in your class and they ranked  me at the bottom of the class."  </P> <P> The Angels also renewed the contract of pitcher Mike Fetters, who was 12-8 last  season with triple-A Edmonton. Seven players also agreed to new contracts,  catchers John Orton and Ron Tingley, infielders Mark McLemore, Kent Anderson  and Bobby Rose, outfielder Dante Bichette and pitcher Rich Monteleone.  </P> <P> No terms were disclosed in any case. The Angels have all 38 of their players  under contract.  </P> <P> Abbott's agent, Scott Boros, said that in arguing for a higher salary he  compared Abbott with to the Atlanta Braves' John Smoltz, the Seattle Mariners'  Brian Holman and the Baltimore Orioles' Bob Milacki, among others.  </P> <P> Smoltz, who was 12-11 with a 2.94 ERA in 208 innings, recently signed for  $210,000 plus $55,000 in incentives. Milacki was 14-12 with a 3.74 ERA in 243  innings, and he recently signed for $235,000 plus $40,000 in incentives.  Abbott's contract has no incentive clauses. Holman was 8-10 with a 3.44 ERA and  signed for $195,000.  </P> <P> Boros also contended that Abbott should be compensated for attracting fans to  Anaheim Stadium. He presented the Angels with data showing that the team's  average attendance in Abbott's home starts was 5,000 higher than in games  started by other pitchers.  </P> <P> "I thought Mr. (Gene) Autry would particularly understand Jim Abbott's  entertainment value," Boros said. "(The attendance increase) was pretty  reflective that his value was above average for a major league baseball player  but the Angels said they do not recognize that value."  </P> <P> General Manager Mike Port said the raise given Abbott was substantial and  deserved.  </P> <P> "We evaluated his performance to the best of the club's capacity and tired to  look at it in an economic framework," Port said. "We've had the capability of  renewing since March 1, but we wanted to give our fellows every conceivable  opportunity to present their case."  </P></p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Atlantic storm does its worst - London / And shares remain vulnerable The saloon bar weather forecasters were definite. 'Roses still blooming in November? It's not natural. It can't last,' they declared at the start of the week. 'The Footsie still over 3,100, with 10-year gilts yielding 8.6 per cent? It can't last,' echoed the gloomier City forecasters. The meteorological cold snap has yet to arrive, but the financial storm duly hit on Tuesday. The map looked all too familiar, with low pressure over the Atlantic leading to precipitating share prices in London. The FT-SE 100 index lost 42.3 points on Tuesday as New York started to slide, and tumbled another 51.2 points on Wednesday after Wall Street ended the session down almost 2 1/2 per cent. With Wall Street closed for Thanksgiving on Thursday, there was then a nervous calm as the City peered at its barometer. Members of the Michael Fish school of forecasting ('hurricane, what hurricane?') saw the events as a healthy correction. Those of a more apocalyptic frame of mind announced the beginning of the end. Nick Knight, equity strategist at Nomura, advised investors to 'sell while you still can'. His equally gloomy rival at Panmure Gordon, Robin Aspinall, declared himself 'quite certain' the Footsie would hit 2,750 before Christmas on the way to 2,200. That might still happen. But when New York traders returned to their desks yesterday, full of turkey and pumpkin pie, the wind had dropped. New York started brightly and there was little change in London shares, leaving the Footsie at 3,033.5, down almost 100 points on the week. There was plenty to worry about at home, too. Despite the cabinet's so-called suicide threat, it seemed at least possible that Tory back-benchers would call its bluff over the European Union finance bill on Monday. And there was mounting unease about what Tuesday's Budget might bring. In particular, the fear has re-surfaced that chancellor Kenneth Clarke will return to the subject of advance corporation tax. The cut from 25 per cent to 20 per cent, announced by Norman Lamont in March last year, released Pounds 1bn annually for the exchequer by reducing the tax credit that pension funds, and other tax-exempt investors, can claim on dividends. The money was generated at relatively little political cost, and there must be a chance that Clarke will come back for more. But reducing the rate cuts institutions' income from equities - so such a move would hit share prices, particularly high-yielding utilities, by making them less attractive compared with gilts. UK institutions have been moving into gilts over the past couple of months, narrowing the yield premium they offer over US government bonds and over UK equities. The process accelerated sharply this week, with the yield on 10-year gilts falling from 8.6 per cent to below 8.5 per cent while the yield on the FT All-Share index pushed back through the 4 per cent level. That cut the ratio of yields on gilts and equities from 2.23 to just over 2.13. The doomsters point out that, at present gilt yields, the FT-SE 100 index would have to fall to 2,600 to bring the yield ratio down to its opening year levels. But the ratio is now close to its long-run average. As for the comparison with US Treasuries, gilts have further ground to make up, given the UK's better inflation outlook. There were some warning signs this week. The Confederation of British Industry's monthly survey showed an increased proportion of manufacturers planning to raise prices to offset higher raw materials costs. Earlier in the week, Courtaulds joined the chorus of companies complaining about squeezed margins and said it would put up its fibre prices by between 5 and 15 per cent in January. Yet, even if these increases stick, it is debatable if they will be passed on to consumers. Still suffering from the over-expansion of the 1980s, retailers are finding it extremely difficult to push through price rises - as BHS and Mothercare admitted this week. All this is encouraging City economists to stick to their inflation predictions. Indeed, Bill Martin of UBS, one of the leading pessimists, has just cut his inflation forecast for next year by 1.25 points to 3.5 per cent. As a result, he now forecasts base rates of 8 per cent at the end of 1995, rather less than the markets are expecting. Lower inflation means investors will require a lower yield on equities, so UBS has increased its target for the FT-SE 100 to 3,200 for the middle of next year and 3,400 by the end. Meanwhile, the interim reporting season continued to produce very healthy dividend increases. Granada, Tate &amp; Lyle and Vodafone all announced rises of more than 10 per cent and water company shareholders felt the benefits of the industry's comfortable new price corsets. Even the back marker, South West Water, offered an 8.3 per cent rise, while Yorkshire pledged to provide growth of 5 per cent per annum after inflation for the next five years. The market was not impressed, though, with both water and electricity shares having a poor week. In part, this reflected nothing more sinister than a bit of profit-taking. But there were also also renewed worries about Labour's proposed windfall tax on the profits of utilities. That apart, the climate looks quite favourable for equities. Yet, UK share prices will remain vulnerable to turbulence in New York, where the behaviour of retail investors could be critical. With interest rates rising and share prices returning to the level where many investors bought, it would be no surprise to see a rush for the door. Until that threat passes, UK equities are unlikely to enjoy an Indian summer.</p>

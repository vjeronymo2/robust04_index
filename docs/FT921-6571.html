			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Commercial Union in the red RECESSION-related losses in the UK have pushed Commercial Union, the insurance group, into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 68.6m for 1991 from a profit of Pounds 1.4m in 1990. This is the first loss incurred by the composite insurer since the mid-1980s. However, the result is likely to be better than those to come from other UK insurers during the next few weeks. CU has largely avoided the damage inflicted on some competitors by domestic mortgage indemnity claims. The company's management was sufficiently confident about the group's underlying financial strength and the positive impact of recent rises in insurance rates to announce a 3 per cent increase in the dividend to 23.65p. Mr Steven Bird, analyst with Smith New Court, the securities house, said the decision had reassured the market which marked the shares up 10p to 466p. 'The loss is due to cyclical factors but everything appears to be under control,' he said. Underwriting losses rose to Pounds 462.6m from Pounds 344.8m, but were offset by investment earnings of Pounds 271.6m, up from Pounds 243.5m. Life profits rose to Pounds 114.3m from Pounds 102m, and earnings from associated undertakings to Pounds 8.1m from Pounds 700,000. After realised investment gains which rose to Pounds 49.8m from Pounds 20.8m, losses attributable to shareholders fell to Pounds 15.5m, against a profit of Pounds 22.2m. The cost of the dividend amounted to Pounds 104.8m taking shareholders' funds to Pounds 1.21bn, from Pounds 1.23bn. Mr Tony Wyand, finance director said the average solvency ratio (the yardstick which measures net assets as a percentage of non-life premium) for non-life business amounted to 63 per cent, although analysts suggested it might be nearer 40 per cent. Underwriting losses in the UK rose to Pounds 226.5m from Pounds 145.4m. Mr Peter Ward, general manager UK, singled out the effect of the recession. Industrial fire claims rose 21 per cent to Pounds 109.3m, with arson claims leaping from Pounds 9m to Pounds 20m. Mr Ward also said property and motor theft claims increased by 38 per cent. Domestic theft claims rose from Pounds 33m to Pounds 51m. Outside the Netherlands, where Delta Lloyd reduced its underwriting loss to Pounds 17.4m from Pounds 26.7m, underwriting losses rose from Pounds 52m to Pounds 76m. Lex, Page 24</p>

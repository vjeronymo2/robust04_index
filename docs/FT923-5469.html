			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Socialists upset by Craxi press campaign TENSIONS in Italy's Socialist party have continued to mount as more senior party members have objected to the campaign by the party newspaper Avanti] against the magistrates leading the political corruption investigation in Milan. The Avanti] attacks, inspired by Socialist party leader Mr Bettino Craxi, have focused on Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the best known of the judges examining the scandal, in which numerous Socialist politicians have been implicated. The attacks have caused difficulties for Mr Giuliano Amato and Mr Claudio Martelli, respectively Italy's premier and justice minister, senior members of the Socialist party. The two have been widely criticised for taking part in a party meeting in Rome last week, at which Mr Craxi discussed his objections to the Milan investigations. Both men said they were not present for that part of the meeting. Separately, the inquiry is due to take a new turn this week, with the appearance today before magistrates of Mr Giuseppe Garofano, the deputy chairman of Ferruzzi Finanziaria, one of Italy's biggest private-sector holding companies. Mr Garofano, summoned to explain unspecified political donations, is expected to be one of a number of industrialists to be asked to testify before magistrates.</p>

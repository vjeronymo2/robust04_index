			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Gasprom threatens to cut exports: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia may lose gas supplies Gasprom, the monopoly Russian gas producer on which most of the former Soviet states depend for their gas supplies, yesterday threatened to cut off exports to the three Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The company said it was owed Rbs10.5bn from Estonia, Rbs32bn from Latvia and Rbs51bn from Lithuania - 'enough grounds to stop supply of energy for non-payment even at a time when the coldest weather is upon us.' Temperatures have plunged sharply in the last two weeks, to an expected  - 30 degrees in Moscow this weekend and to even lower levels in the Baltics. At the same time, Mr Yuri Shafranik, the energy minister, appealed to Mr Oleg Soskovets, the first deputy prime minister, to 'use his authority' to force payment of energy debts, now totalling Rbs12,000bn. These debts have risen by more than six times in the past year. He said the energy sector was faced with twin crises of underinvestment and soaring debts. Oil output fell to 354m tonnes last year - down 11 per cent on 1992; gas output decreased by 23bn cu metres, or 3.6 per cent on the previous year; and coal production was down 31m tonnes to 306m tonnes. Much of the reason for the falling output was the sharp fall in investment, he said, down by 27 per cent last year and by 200 per cent in the past five years. Mr Shafranik emphasised that energy accounted for 38 per cent of budget income and 60 per cent of the state's hard currency revenues. The energy crisis was further dramatised yesterday with the publication of details of an incident last December when an aircraft carrying President Boris Yeltsin was put into danger when it lost radio contact with the ground because electricity supplies to the radar facility near Rostov-on-Don were cut off for non-payment of the bill. Mr Gennady Bocharov, an Izvestiya correspondent, said the power was cut off at a time when there were a large numbers of Russian and foreign planes in southern regional airspace. Mr Bocharov said that, while details of the incident were suppressed, the power was again cut two days later. In the second period of power failure, an aircraft carrying Mr Sergei Shakhrai, then a deputy prime minister, was also put in danger. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, holding a meeting separately with leaders of the mineworkers, promised them yet again that the government would pay back wages, unpaid in some cases since the beginning of winter. He ordered the Ministry of Finance to pay Rbs1,000bn in back pay - but said an agreement on pay and prices was required in the industry to help address the soaring budget deficit.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Yeltsin misses Irish talks The steps leading to the Russian presidential aircraft were in place. Dignitaries including the Irish prime minister Albert Reynolds were gathered at Shannon airport to greet their guest - but president Boris Yeltsin failed to appear for official talks. After a 15-minute delay Mr Reynolds and his entourage returned to the airport terminal accompanied by Oleg Soskovetz, first Russian deputy prime minister, who stood in for Mr Yeltsin during the talks. He said later Mr Yeltsin was 'extremely tired' after a 17-hour flight to Ireland. On his return to Moscow, Mr Yeltsin told reporters he was feeling 'excellent' and had 'just overslept'.</p>

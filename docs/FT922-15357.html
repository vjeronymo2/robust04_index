			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: Accor posts 5.6% decline ACCOR, the French hotels group which recently took over its competitor, Wagons-Lits, saw net profits fall by 5.6 per cent from FFr1bn in 1990 to FFr948.6m (Dollars 169.3m) in 1991 because of the disruption caused by the Gulf war in the opening months of the year, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. Last autumn, Accor fought a fierce battle to take over Wagons-Lits, a Franco-Belgian concern, in order to expand its presence in the European hotel market. Accor had forecast net profits of FFr900m for 1991. Its performance was slightly better than expected thanks to a good performance in Germany, Italy and Belgium during the second half. Group turnover fell modestly from FFr22.8bn in 1990 to FFr22.4bn in 1991. However, earnings per share declined by 13.3 per cent from FFr50.96 in 1990 to FFr44.15 in 1991 after a reduction in exceptional items from FFr209.9m to FFr182.8m.</p>

A national project must have at least two sites in different States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The primary purpose of prevention programs is to find effective means of reaching adolescents, both male and female, before they become sexually active in order to encourage them to abstain from sexual activity. There is general agreement that early initiation of sexual activity brings not only the risk of unintended pregnancy but also substantial health risks to adolescents, primarily infection with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV. Accordingly, applicants must provide services that help pre-adolescents and young adolescents acquire knowledge and skills that will instill healthy attitudes and encourage and support the postponement of early sexual activity. Such services must also include the provision of medically accurate information relating to reducing the risk of unintended pregnancy and disease for adolescents who may be or become sexually active. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Under this announcement, OAPP will not fund proposals to develop new prevention curricula. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Applicants must propose to use existing and available educational materials/curricula which are consistent with this program announcement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OAPP encourages the submission of prevention applications which propose to do the following: (1) Add prevention services to supplement existing adolescent health education programs or health service programs in school or other community settings, (2) provide prevention services to minority or other disadvantaged populations, (3) use curricula which have been demonstrated and evaluated to be effective, (4) include medically accurate information on sexuality, contraception, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV/AIDS, (5) offer educational services to parents to assist them in communicating with their children about sexuality, contraception, STDs and HIV/AIDS, and (6) involve males and promote male responsibility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants for prevention programs are not required to provide any specific array of services; a proposal may include any one or more of the following services as appropriate: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Educational services relating to family life and problems associated with adolescent premarital sexual relations including: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Information about adoption, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Education on the responsibilities of sexuality and parenting, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The development of material to support the role of parents as the providers of sex education, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Assistance to parents, schools, youth agencies and health providers to educate adolescents and preadolescents concerning self-discipline and responsibility in human sexuality; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Appropriate educational and vocational services; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Counseling for the immediate and extended family members of the eligible person; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Transportation; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Outreach services to families of adolescents to discourage sexual relations among unemancipated minors; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Pregnancy testing and maternity counseling; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Nutrition information and counseling; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Referral for screening and treatment of venereal disease. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

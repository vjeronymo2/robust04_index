			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VINTAGE DINER GETS A NEW LEASE ON LIFE  </P> <P> The Gem Cafe, a decades-old Hermosa Beach diner that was to have been shut down  by its landlord this week, has been given a reprieve, thanks to an outpouring  of community support and a last-minute compromise.  </P> <P> "It's a miracle!" cheered Richard McCurdy, a local businessman and Gem patron  who last month launched a "Save the Gem Cafe Committee" when he heard the  landlord was planning to lease the space to a new tenant.  </P> <P> The restaurant's owners, Henry and Grace Poirier, had been facing the demise of  the diner they bought 28 years ago from two sisters who had founded it in 1949.  </P> <P> Now they have a six-month lease that will give them until Dec. 31 to find a new  location.  </P></p>

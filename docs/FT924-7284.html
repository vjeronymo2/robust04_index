			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Money Markets: Firmer UK rates CASH RATES in the sterling money market yesterday firmed sharply from Friday night's levels, as dealers continued to take the view that there will be no more cuts in UK base rates before the New Year. The mood in European markets was somewhat more bullish in the morning, however. Short-dated Euromark futures rose sharply after a group of leading German economists forecast zero per cent growth in Germany in 1993. This implies that there may be greater pressure on the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy, writes James Blitz. Despite the UK government's continued commitment to easing monetary policy, the sterling cash market believes that policy is changing cautiously. At the weekend, Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, said that the recent cuts in rates and the September devaluation of sterling amounted to 'a very considerable relaxation' of policy. Dealers believe that 6 per cent base rate is inevitable, but the government will tread carefully before signalling it. Three-month money therefore rose sharply from an offered rate of 7 1/8 per cent on Friday night to a close of 7 5/16 per cent. One month money, a rate at which commercial banks do much trading, rose from around 7 1/4 per cent on Friday to 7 5/16 per cent last night. The sharpness of yesterday's rise in market rates partly reflects the decision of commercial banks to fund their books further down the yield curve. Rates there are cheaper, and it is safer now to lock into the longer-dated maturities. One dealer also suggested that the approach of the new year, when bank balances must reflect the share of assets and cash required by central banks, meant that rates were being pushed higher. He said that Japanese banks had aggressively paid higher rates to meet such requirements. Euromark futures rose sharply yesterday morning after a group of economic forecasters who give independent advice to the German government forecast zero real growth next year. The report from the 'five wise men' triggered renewed speculation that the Bundesbank will further ease monetary policy before the end of the year. The March contract rose 12 basis points to a high of 92.25, and closed at 92.08.</p>

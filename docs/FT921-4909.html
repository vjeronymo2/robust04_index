			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Lloyd's may face more litigation FRESH LEGAL action could be taken within the Lloyd's of London insurance market following a meeting today liquidating one of its most troubled agencies. A group of Names - individuals whose assets back underwriting in the market  -will fight for representation on the creditors' committee of Lime Street Underwriting Agencies in the hope of recovering some of their losses, which total millions of pounds. The Lime Street agency, which handled the Names' affairs, put their assets into some of the worst-performing syndicates in the recent history of Lloyd's. Initially 35 Names out of the 450 Lime Street members will seek representation on the committee on the grounds that they would be creditors in the event of future legal action against the agency. Mr Guy Sutton, solicitor with Norton Rose, the firm which is advising the Lime Street Names Association, said Lime Street Names were 'among the most wounded by events at Lloyd's'. The insurance market reported its first losses for 20 years last year when it reported on the 1988 underwriting year. Lloyd's will face a deficit of more than Pounds 1.3bn when it reports its 1989 results in June. Many Lime Street Names are members of stricken catastrophe reinsurance syndicates managed by agencies such as Feltrim, Gooda Walker, Rose Thomson Young and Devonshire. The Names wrote to Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, last December to request an investigation into Lime Street and its associated companies. However, Lloyd's has refused to inform the Names whether it is conducting an investigation, saying any such matters are confidential. Meanwhile Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, tabled a motion in the Commons yesterday urging an inquiry into the relationship between the Lime Street agency and associated companies; Mr Robin Kingsley, a director of Lime Street; and syndicate 387. Mr Hain said that in 1988 and 1989 Lime Street Underwriting 'contributed 70 per cent of Names' premium capacity' of Gooda Walker syndicate 387, which specialised in stop-loss insurance - reinsurance for Names. The Names stand to lose more than seven times the amount they had committed to the syndicate. He alleged that Mr Kingsley, a Name working in the market, reduced his commitment to several troubled syndicates between 1988 and 1990 at a time when other outside Names found it impossible to 'escape' from those syndicates.</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Markets: All work and no plays for the brokers - Wall Street The Americans are working more than has been the case for years - and they are working much harder. But they are not getting paid a lot more, and they certainly seem nervous about spending what extra they have. With interest rates likely to be cranked up again later in November, is this any background against which to buy shares? More jobs should be good for business. They put money into consumers' pockets. According to the latest monthly employment figures released yesterday, the rate of unemployment in the US slipped to 5.8 per cent in October, from 5.9 per cent the month before and 7.7 per cent in mid-1992. Manufacturing has led the way. Who would have thought just two years ago that Michigan - home of the US car industry - would see its unemployment rate tumble well below the national average, to 5.1 per cent? At the same time, overtime hours have been rising rapidly, with the average workweek now longer than at any time since February 1987. Yet pay is not rising much: in the year to September, the total compensation package for the average worker went up only 3.2 per cent, one of the lowest increases on record. That is in part because of an overall shift in employment towards lower-paid service jobs, in part because of moderate pay agreements in the manufacturing sector. For retailers and the companies whose products they sell, this creates an uncertain background. Christmas began officially on Tuesday as seasonal goods started to flood into shops - yet October store sales figures, released Thursday, showed a mixed picture at best, and retailers are already talking about holding down their prices to last year's levels, if not lower. For US car makers, too - and the steel, glass and tyre companies whose products they buy - the outlook is not as rosy as it seemed only a matter of weeks ago. General Motors' stumble during the third quarter revealed that the country's biggest manufacturing company continues to struggle, even in the best economic conditions for some time. While car sales in October were up strongly on a year before, it is noteable that Japanese car makers managed to increase their combined market share by more than one percentage point, to 13.3 per cent - even though the yen hit a new high against the dollar last week. While shares in Ford and Chrysler remain firm, General Motors has slipped 15 per cent in the past three weeks, to just under Dollars 40 yesterday morning. If the Federal Reserve increases interest rates at its next policy-making meeting the week after next weaker consumer demand and the higher financing costs faced by US companies could dampen things even more. That was the worry that hit share prices for most of last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 94 points by midweek, to 3,837.13, before stabilising on Thursday and Friday. The word from the takeover market, meanwhile, has not been encouraging for US share prices either. Throughout much of this year, frothy takeover bids (and even frothier rumours) have buoyed stock prices in a range of industries. Two announcements last Wednesday suggest that expectations have got ahead of themselves. First came news that soft drink maker Snapple had agreed to be bought by Quaker Oats for Dollars 1.7bn. No fancy premiums here: the shares, which had traded as high as Dollars 32 1/4 in February, had slumped to Dollars 14 1/4 . As if to rub it in, Quaker Oats offered even less - Dollars 14 a share. Then there is the saga of Kemper, the financial services company that agreed to a Dollars 2.7bn bid from insurance group Conseco. In part because higher interest rates have hit the outlook for financial service companies, Conseco's bid has been looking increasingly fragile in recent weeks. Last week the company said it wanted to cut its original offer. If that was not enough, there have been signs that the anti-trust authorities are taking a tougher line. Just over a week ago they announced an intention to block a takeover of American Tobacco by Britain's BAT Industries. Then, on Thursday, the regulators hammered out a deal with drug maker Eli Lilly over its proposed Dollars 4bn acquisition of PCS, a big seller of drugs. Lilly was adamant that its compromise with the regulators did not undermine the logic of its bid - but it may be no coincidence that on the same day, Value Health, another healthcare group, said it had abandoned plans to auction its own drugs sales company. Its shares fell 5 per cent on the news, to Dollars 37 5/8 . If the takeover market slows, those companies with big acquisition premiums built into their share prices could come down with a bump.  ------------------------------------------ Monday          3908.12   -   22.54 Tuesday         3863.37   -   44.75 Wednesday       3837.13   -   26.24 Thursday        3845.88   +   08.75 Friday          3807.52   -   38.36  ------------------------------------------</p>

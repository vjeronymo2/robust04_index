			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Ladbroke The warm glow of approval for Ladbroke's new open management style has already dissipated. The shares have lost all the ground gained early in the year following Mr Cyril Stein's decision to cut his links with the group he created. It is not that Mr Peter George, the chief executive, has drifted back into the bad old ways. Yesterday's half-year figures were a model of clarity. The trouble is that a clear view of trading prospects is hardly uplifting. The performance of Hilton hotels is especially disappointing. Even allowing for economic recovery in continental Europe, it will be a long time before Ladbroke sees a decent return on the Pounds 1.8bn capital tied up in that business. That is not to deny the long-term attractions of hotels, or the logic of its marriage to gaming within the Ladbroke empire. The group's modest move back into casinos could create additional synergies. But neither hotels nor gaming is likely to deliver the kind of earnings growth the stock market was anticipating earlier in the year. This might explain Ladbroke's decision to invest in the Texas DIY chain rather than look for a quick sale. Even modest margin improvements on Texas's Pounds 700m annual sales would add pep to group profits. Optimism on that score - and the prospects for early realisation of the remaining Pounds 600m property portfolio - should limit the downside for the shares. But it is difficult to see that Ladbroke brings much to retailing in the longer term. The sooner Ladbroke places its bets firmly on hotels and leisure the better.</p>

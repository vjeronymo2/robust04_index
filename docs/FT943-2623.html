			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / World News in Brief: Footsie suffers largest fall since June The London equity market fell sharply following the release of unexpectedly strong data on the US economy. The FT-SE 100 Index ended the day 47.6 points down at 3,065.1, its largest daily fall since mid-June. The Footsie fell nearly 2.4 per cent on the week as the first rise in base rates for nearly five years left the UK bond markets still vulnerable to shocks from overseas.

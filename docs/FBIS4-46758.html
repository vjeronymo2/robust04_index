			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Meetings in the Turkmen Land"] </F>   [Text] On 27 May 1994 the President of Turkmenistan  S. Niyazov received G. Fadeyev, chairman of the Council on Rail  Transportation of the CIS Countries and RF Minister of  Railways.    B. Sardzhayev, deputy chairman of the Turkmen Cabinet  of Ministers, and Kh. Khalykov, chief of the Turkmen State  Railway, took part in the conversation.    The minister informed the President of Turkmenistan of the  work done by the Council on Rail Transportation to coordinate  the activities of railroads on the interstate level.  Preservation of the technological uniformity of the rail network  of the former USSR was noted as an important result of the  Council's work.    The President of Turkmenistan had high praise for the role  of  the Council on Rail Transportation in supporting the transport  of freight and passengers in the interests of the economic and  social development of all the member states of the CIS and the  Baltic countries. He noted the need for further consolidation of  cooperation among railroads, in particular the railroads of the  Russian Federation and Turkmenistan.    Turkmenistan is devoting a great deal of attention to the  creation of rail transport corridors, which are important not  only for the particular region but also for Russia and the other  countries of the CIS. They have in mind construction of new rail  lines from Tedzhen through Seraks to Meshkhed and from  Gazandzhik to Gyzyletrek; these lines will provide the shortest  route to Iran and on to the Persian Gulf for freight from  Russia's eastern regions, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan as well as  for international transit freight.    Salarmurat Niyazov stressed that the doors are open for  mutually advantageous cooperation by all interested states in  carrying out these projects. As for Russia, a joint working  group has been formed on the basis of the protocol of the talks  between the RF minister of railways and the chief of the Turkmen  State Railway to study the set of questions related to Russian  participation in building the above-named rail lines. As the  result of its work, which should be completed before 1 September  of this year, proposals will be prepared for the governments of  Russia and Turkmenistan.    The support of the RF Ministry of Railways for the formative  process and efficient operation of Turkmenistan's independent  railway was noted as part of the development of bilateral  Russian-Turkmen cooperation. At this meeting questions of  improving the quality of transportation ties between Russian and  Turkmenistan were also discussed.    In conclusion the President of Turkmenistan wished the  participants of the 11th meeting of the Council on Rail  Transportation good results and successful implementation of the  decisions adopted in the interests of further development of  mutually advantageous cooperation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [English abstract of article by Suo Yu-cheng of China </F> Research Institute of Radiowave Propagation, Xinxiang 453003; MS  received 24 Mar 92]    [Text] In accordance with the requirement of ground  communications systems of remote distance for short-wave band,  on the basis of the model calculation of the mean background of  ionospheric parameters, a method is presented for calculating  the trace of short-wave rays in the ionosphere. The work is  mainly concentrated on two aspects. First of all, because the  frequency of short waves is relatively higher, the magnetic and  collision effects in refractive index are neglected, so that  general ray equations are simplified. In the second place, a  method of calculating the first-order partial derivative of  ionospheric plasma parameters is presented. The calculation of  the partial derivative is on the basis of model result of  parameters of each ionospheric layer, that is, on the basis of  mean background of ionospheric parameters.    This method can be used in HF communications system, and  other short-wave systems such as target-position system of HF  radar, etc.</p>

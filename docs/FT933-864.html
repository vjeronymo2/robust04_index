			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Arts: Two houses clash their swords - Opera in Paris While musical life in London is taken up with the battle of the orchestras, Parisians are in the fortunate position of being able to watch the rivalry between two international opera-houses. An extra frisson is added when one knows that political rivalry lurks in the background. The Bastille (or, to give it its full name, the Opera de Paris Bastille) is the vast new opera-house of the people, a state organisation, the treasured project of Mitterrand and the left. Even at the opening night of the season, jeans are de rigeur. The Theatre du Chatelet has a smarter audience than the old Palais Garnier and is, if not snobbish, at least elegant. It belongs to the city, the homeground of Chirac and the right. Surely it cannot be a coincidence that they chose to open their 1993-94 seasons on consecutive nights, both mounting new productions, both turning to the most ambitious large-scale German operas? The clash of swords can almost be heard from behind the drop-curtain. The Bastille came first. Its new production of Wagner's Der fliegende Hollander was entrusted to the film producer Werner Herzog, who has already essayed Wagner (without great success) at Bayreuth. He updated the opera to the early years of the industrial revolution. Senta and her workmates have dispensed with their spinning-wheels and operate a large textile machine. Daland's men are first seen trying to haul their capsized steamship out of the water - memories of Herzog's film, Fitzcarraldo. The programme reminded us that Wagner was inspired to take up the myth of the flying Dutchman after a perilous journey by sea to England, during which storms forced the boat to take refuge off the coast of Norway. Herzog has seized upon this image and set the opera in a frozen wasteland. An iceberg looms over the scene; when the time comes for the arrival of the Dutchman's ship, it rises out of the sea to a vast height and disgorges the wandering mariner. That is the limit to the production's entertainment value. Nothing that follows suggests that Herzog has any point to make out of his choice of time or place. Maurizio Balo's settings are impressive (so they should be on the most lavishly equipped opera-stage in the world) but the characters could be anybody, at any time, anywhere. Somewhere along the line the Bastille had lost its scheduled baritone. Simon Estes, a much-travelled Dutchman, took over, singing strongly, but not making much either of the words or the personality. During the long duet with Senta he hit an awkward patch where he seemed fated to arrive in tune only one line in every seven. Sabine Hass's Senta was a cuddly figure, not much given to obsessions or neuroses, who revealed most about herself when she was punching out big, blazing top notes. Nothing that passed between them was of any moment, although I hesitate to blame the singers for that, as the same vacuum enveloped Aage Haugland's booming Daland and Peter Straka's Erik. Myung-Whun Chung and the Bastille orchestra received a roar of applause, which would be hard to justify. It seemed to me that the performance needed a stiff dose of discipline to stop it losing impetus and getting becalmed for long stretches at a time. The next night at the Theatre du Chatelet - another coincidence. The Chatelet's new production of Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier was also set in the period of the opera's composition. Adolf Dresen, the producer, had done away with Rococo finery and set the piece in the years just before the First World War. If penny-pinching was the objective, he could hardly have done the company a better favour. No need for all that gilt decor, brocaded upholstery and sumptuous costumes. The Marschallin's bedroom consisted of merely a bed and a grandfather clock (she must have a clock of some kind, if she is to stop the time in the middle of the night). The Baron's seduction supper was held outdoors in the backyard of the local Heuriege, not a plausible locale. Visually it was a big disappointment, but Dresen scored by making his characters really seem to live in that period. It is unlikely that Felicity Lott will ever look more at home as the Marschallin than she did here. With her willowy stance, sinuous arms, elegantly casual walk, she is the picture of a society lady in the 20th-century understanding of the term. Morals had changed somewhat by 1910 and one imagines that she would easily forget this affair with a shrug of her shoulders (oh, those shoulders] Are there any in opera today which work harder?) The voice is only just weighty enough, even in this theatre, but she floated the opening of the trio to graceful perfection. Every comment, every look that passed between her and Randi Stene's tousle-haired Octavian, as their relationship broke down, was heartrending. No Octavian that I have seen has looked younger, more vulnerable than Stene, an impressively confident young mezzo, and the sense of pain was akin to needles piercing innocent young flesh. Cyndia Sieden was a delightfully open, uninhibited Sophie. Kurt Rydl convincingly turned Baron Ochs into a sharp-witted dealer in dapper suit and panama hat, quick to pocket the croissant left on the Marschallin's breakfast table. After his lacklustre showing at the Aix-en-Provence festival in the summer Armin Jordan was a conductor transformed, keeping Strauss's music thrusting forwards without slackening or sentimentality. He was fortunate to have the Philharmonia Orchestra from London (sponsored by Rover France) on good form in the pit. Why ever should this orchestra be facing the threat of closure when it is proving such a high-profile ambassador for British music abroad? The French must think us mad. Ironic to find the battles of British musical politics being fought in Paris as well.</p>

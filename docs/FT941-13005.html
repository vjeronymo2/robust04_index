			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Prestwick passes preference dividend A lack of distributable reserves has prevented Prestwick Holdings paying the preference share dividend due on January 31, Mr Archie Coulson, executive chairman, stated at the annual meeting. He pointed out that the group was 'not making what I consider to be acceptable money and it will take some time to change that.' The shares fell 4p to 40p.</p>

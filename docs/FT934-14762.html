			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Arrest in Pepsi's numbers nightmare PHILIPPINES police have arrested a leader of a group pursuing claims on sizeable cash prizes in a Pepsi-Cola numbers game promotion that the soft-drinks company has refused to pay. Mr Ferdinand Eslabon, president of the so-called 'United 349', was arrested by National Bureau of Investigation agents on suspicion of involvement in a series of bombing attacks on local Pepsi plants and retail outlets five months ago. In February last year, Pepsi-Cola Products Philippines, the local bottler of Pepsi soft drinks, launched 'Number Fever', a sales promotion that promised cash prizes of up to Pesos 1m to holders of Pepsi bottle caps bearing three-digit numbers that are declared winners on certain days. The campaign was to have run until May 8 1992, but was extended by another four weeks, because, Pepsi officials said, of its tremendous success in boosting sales. Company officials said Pepsi's market share rose by five percentage points to 25 per cent during the period. During the extension, however, the winning number 349 was announced on May 22 1992. That turned the huge marketing success into a nightmare as hundreds of individuals turned up at Pepsi plants claiming prizes for their '349' bottle crowns. Pepsi refused to redeem most of these caps, saying that only those with the winning number 349 and 'authenticated security codes' printed in the cap would be paid. About 600,000 caps with the number 349, according to the company, were distributed as a result of 'a computer glitch'. Outraged holders of '349' crowns soon massed at Pepsi plants nationwide, in some cases disrupting deliveries, and leading to the birth of a number of organisations among the '349' holders, including 'United 349', some of which pursued claims in court. Of more than 10,000 court cases filed against Pepsi, 7,400 have been dismissed. Pepsi officials also note that 18 crowns with the '349' and the authenticated security code have actually been awarded prizes of varying sums indicated in the crown. Also, the company offered Pesos 500 as a 'goodwill gesture' to holders of non-winning '349' caps. Some 500,000 individuals are reported to have been paid about Dollars 9m (Pounds 5.9m) under that offer. No negotiations are being conducted by Pepsi's parent company in New York.</p>

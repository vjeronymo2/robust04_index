			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURCHARGE LETS CONSUMER KNOW THAT CULPRIT BEHIND HIGHER COSTS IS INSURANCE  COMPANY  </P> <P> This is in regard to S. J. Diamond's "It Pays to Question Those Bill  Surcharges," March 16.  </P> <P> Four years ago, after having had excellent safety and loss records, our  insurance premiums doubled and tripled in two years.  </P> <P> As any business, to survive, this cost was inevitably passed on to the  customer. After careful consideration we decided on a surcharge for two main  reasons.  </P> <P> First, we wanted the customer to clearly see on the invoice that skyrocketing  insurance rates had affected their cost for home services. It should also be  pointed out that the surcharge covers only a portion of the increase and does  not begin to pay our entire insurance premium.  </P> <P> The surcharge also was the least expensive way of passing this expense on to  the client. Any increase in the hourly labor rate always brings on additional  taxes and additional insurance fees resulting in a final increase of charges in  excess of what is really needed to defray costs.  </P> <P> R.

In a written statement issued today, Karayalcin noted that  he  finds the massacre at Tuzla train station in which five officer  cadets were martyred, the bombing of the Democracy Party  headquarters, and the killing of the Motherland Party mayor of  Adalar, as very worrying from the viewpoint of their timing as  well as their nature.    Stressing that it does not matter much if these incidents  were planned or coincidental, Karayalcin said: I described my  concern on the subject as the preparations of centers wanting to  interrupt or eliminate democracy and I called on all political  party leaders to display unity against such moves. Asked by  reporters who these centers are, I retorted: I wish I knew and  I could make it public. These attacks are directed against  democracy. I do not believe that anyone could interpret these  intensifying incidents of terror and bombing in any other way.  I continue to hold these views. In voicing my concern,  however, I never used the word coup. I never linked the  incidents to the army. Moreover, if I had any information on  the subject, I would not have hesitated to make it public in  line with my understanding of democracy.    Karayalcin remarked that democracy is the only foundation  for  the solution of all problems and called on all parties to  embrace one another and democracy.</p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> WANG SUFFERS $424-MILLION LOSS  </P> <P> Wang Laboratories Inc., formerly one of the computer industry's top performers,  posted a $424.3-million loss for its latest fiscal year today and said it is  suspending its dividend while it restructures operations to cut costs.  </P> <P> Wang stock was off 37.5 cents at $6 on the American Stock Exchange in heavy  early afternoon trading, as Wall Street reacted to what one trader called a  "dreadful" earnings report.  </P> <P> The company's second straight money-losing quarter gave it a net loss for the  year ended June 30 of $424.3 million, or $2.59 a share, compared with a profit  of $92.7 million, or 56 cents a share, in the previous year.  </P> <P> Wang's long profit slide has been blamed on its slowness to switch to operating  systems that are compatible with computers made by other companies.  </P></p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of New Broadcast and Communication Media (3): A man of heretical views - Interview with Philippe Galteau, General Cable's managing director Mr Philippe Galteau, managing director of General Cable, is an unusual executive in the British cable industry. He is, of course, a Frenchman working for a subsidiary of Compagnie General des Eaux, the large French services group, in an industry still dominated by North American money. But more important than the fact that he is not an American are what he describes as his heretical views on the future of the industry. In contrast to cable television or even residential telephony, he places enormous emphasis on developing business telephone services because of the high revenues involved. Mr Galteau regards video-on-demand, a concept that is exciting many cable and satellite operators, as little more than 'a gadget, a dazzling thing' that is not really essential for the financial development of the industry. He is also sceptical about another of the latest industry buzzwords - interactive television - because of the high costs involved and describes himself as 'scandalised' by those putting a heavy emphasis on games or bothering to show a single football game from a number of different camera angles. 'Cable television is only one part of our activity and in the long term I would be very surprised if it amounted to more than 40 per cent of our revenues - and I think it is more likely to be one third rather than 40 per cent,' he says. 'I would hope that the message that we are building broadband networks rather than TV networks is going to grow,' he adds. General Cable, founded in 1989, has three main stakes in the UK cable industry. It owns 83 per cent of The Cable Corporation, which runs suburban London franchises that also cover Heathrow, the Slough trading estate and Windsor, and 45 per cent of the Birmingham Cable Corporation, which is managed by another shareholder, Comcast. General Cable also has a 50-50 joint venture with Singapore Telecom in the Yorkshire Cable Group - one of the largest cable franchises covering 875,000 homes and 50,000 businesses. But it is TCC that demonstrates Mr Galteau's philosophy of cable most clearly. Last year TCC had total revenues of Pounds 15.7m with 53 per cent coming from business telephone services, 29 per cent from television and 18 per cent from residential telephones. Since 1991 the number of business lines operated by TCC has grown from 2,639 to more than 7,500 now. But Mr Galteau is fascinated by the ratios between what he regards as a business with three quite distinct streams of revenue. If the monthly gross margin on cable television services is 1, he argues, then the margin on a residential telephone line is 1.4 but on each business line it is anything between 5 and 7. The figures tip even further in favour of business telephony because TCC's average business customer installs seven lines. The result is that, in terms of revenue potential an average business telephony customer could be worth anything from 40 to 50 times that of a home taking just a cable television subscription where revenue levels are also more finite than with telecommunications. To get away from the generally disappointing figures for penetration of cable television - the ratio of homes subscribing to those who could subscribe - Mr Galteau has produced a new measure, 'combined penetration,' which applies the different weightings for residential and business telephony revenues to the figures. This means that while General Cable's ordinary television penetration is 23 per cent, a bit ahead of the current industry average of around 21 per cent, the weighted combined penetration produces a figure of 68 per cent which Mr Galteau believes gives a more accurate picture of the state of the business. 'Bankers are starting to understand,' says Mr Galteau who has been making presentations to warm up the City of London for a possible flotation. That could come some time next year, but would very much depend on market conditions. The main aim would be to make General Cable a more British company. General Cable can already get access to debt finance and it has behind it the fourth largest French company by market capitalisation, with a total turnover of Pounds 17.4bn. Both TCC and Birmingham Cable Corporation reached positive operating cash flow this year with Yorkshire, a much newer franchise only 9 per cent built, forecasting positive cash flow in 1997. Just as General Cable believes it has been a pioneer in the emphasis given to business cable, so Birmingham Cable has been seen as a pioneer in the marketing of residential services. For several years Birmingham was the undisputed champion of the UK cable industry and not only had the largest number of homes subscribing but also the highest penetration rate in the industry. According to the latest official statistics, Birmingham is, with 59,231 subscriptions, still the franchise with the largest number of homes connected - 30,000 ahead of its nearest rival, Portsmouth. However, Birmingham's penetration rate has dropped to 31.4 per cent and it is now second to Swindon's 32.4 per cent. Mr Ted Campbell, until earlier this year managing director of Birmingham before moving to the Tyne Tees franchise, says the Birmingham success has been based on attention to detail. 'Unlike some systems, from the start, marketing has played a large part in determining where we should build,' Mr Campbell explains. The marketing campaign included making sure that every potential customer in an area received a video of Birmingham cable's services. Sales staff were also properly trained, paid and motivated so that staff turnover was virtually nil. The Birmingham franchise which covers 471,000 homes and 30,000 businesses is now 40 per cent built and is due to be complete in 1997. By then it could be the most powerful franchise in the country. As for Mr Galteau, in General Cable's group headquarters not far from the House of Commons the concept of cable remains a simple one - to achieve the maximum revenues possible from every possible source from the millions spent digging holes in the ground.</p>

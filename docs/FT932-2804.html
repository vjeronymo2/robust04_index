			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Pollution deal threat to Thorp THE government's decision about whether to give the go-ahead to the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield could be complicated by a new international agreement reached last night. The Paris Commission Convention on sea pollution, whose 13 signatories border the north-east Atlantic, voted last night in Berlin to tighten the rules on discharges of radioactivity to the sea. The UK was the only member to vote against the proposal.</p>

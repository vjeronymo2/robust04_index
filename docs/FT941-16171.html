			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Clinton in Europe: Hungary welcomes joint exercises The first joint military manoeuvres between Nato countries and their 'partners for peace' in eastern Europe could take place as early as this year, according to Mr Geza Jeszenszky, Hungary's foreign minister, write Patrick Blum in Prague and Nicholas Denton in Budapest. Mr Jeszenszky, speaking yesterday on the eve of east European leaders' meeting with President Bill Clinton, said Budapest would welcome exercises on Hungarian territory. After initial doubts, Hungary has taken a more positive view of the Partnership for Peace and interpreted the initiative as a route to full Nato membership. Partnership for Peace has brought to the surface sharp differences between the four countries of the Visegrad group - Poland, Hungary and the Czech and Slovak republics. All four want to join Nato as a guarantee for their security which they feel could be threatened by a resurgence of Russian expansionism, and as a means of strengthening their own democracies. But while Poland, Hungary and Slovakia wish to act as a group, the Czech Republic believes it can achieve its aims more quickly on its own. Poland's President Lech Walesa warned on Monday that Prague's approach could harm all Visegrad countries.</p>

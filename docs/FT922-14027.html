			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: First-quarter profit forecast by Cummins CUMMINS Engine, the US diesel engine manufacturer, said it expected to report a profit for the first quarter, AP-DJ reports. The company posted net income of Dollars 17.2m, or Dollars 1.02 a share, in the same period a year earlier, after a big gain from an accounting change. Without the gain, Cummins would have posted a loss of Dollars 34.3m, or Dollars 2.44, for the period. Cummins added that it expected second-quarter profits to exceed those of the first quarter, assuming there was 'no deterioration in business conditions'. In last year's second quarter, Cummins posted a loss of Dollars 17.2m, or Dollars 1.29. Mr James Henderson, president and chief operating officer, said 1991 had been a year of 'significant progress' for the company, in spite of recession in most of its world markets. Mid-range engine volume increased 6,000 units over 1990 levels, while heavy-duty engine volume dropped by about 18,000 units.</p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Rank Organisation With a bit more life in the economy, Rank might by now have digested the balance-sheet consequences of its Mecca purchase in 1990. As it is, the first half ended with gearing still at an uncomfortable 70 per cent. Rank has still not sold any of the 22 hotels it put on the market in April. Progress in stemming the video distribution losses in the US is embarrassingly slow. To crown it all, a slowdown in the Japanese office supplies market depressed the contribution from Rank Xerox by more than 10 per cent. That said, it is easy to overdo the gloom reflected in the shares' near-20 per cent fall since late May. Bingo is going from strength to strength and London hotels are making money, though at the cost of savage discounting. The company still managed enough capital spending to keep an edge on the competition during the first half, while lopping Pounds 47m off net debt outstanding a year earlier. Lower profits at Rank Xerox should have little impact on Rank's cash flow, since the associate is unlikely to cut its regular dividend much, if at all. Tax credits from previous US losses will help keep the tax charge down, so that profits, which have now started flowing from Universal Studios, will pass straight to the bottom line. Rank's dividend thus looks reasonably secure in terms both of earnings and cash cover. But it is not worth getting too carried away by the yield of more than 6.5 per cent. The upside is limited by the delayed UK recovery which Rank itself does not expect before 1994.</p>

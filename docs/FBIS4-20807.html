			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by D. Ferhat: "Faced With a Resurgence of </F> Assassinations and Acts of Sabotage, the State Reacts: The  National People's Assembly (ANP) on the Spot"--first paragraph  is LIBERTE introduction]    [Text] It is reported that major antiterrorist measures  will soon be considered.    The country's authorities are, it seems, firmly determined  to  put every chance on their side to conduct the national dialogue  under the best security conditions. According to well-informed  sources, major decisions are reported to have been considered in  this regard at a recent three-day meeting of top military  leaders. A beefing up of security forces is reported to have  been decided upon. So the main units and barracks are reported  to have been put on a state of alert and received major  reinforcements of men and materiel. Information reporting the  deployment of military units and troop movements in the interior  of the country and around the capital would tend to corroborate  this on-site return by the state. According to our sources, the  meeting of the heads of military staffs is also reported to have  studied the eventual need for a partial mobilization of reserve  forces so as to enhance the presence of the National People's  Assembly [ANP] in urban centers and villages. This last measure  would have more of a psychological than a military import.  Terrorist propaganda does not cease pummeling people's minds  with rumors suggesting that they hold the country in their grip.  This reassertion by the state will also be seen through a more  decentralized logistic system in the antiterrorist fight. It  will be implemented at the national and regional levels,  especially in each major city and at local coordinating military  headquarters combining the ANP, the national gendarmerie, and  the police. This system will allow for a better flow of security  information but also for greater efficiency and speed in  operations. The justice system also has its role to play in this  new strategy. So sentences and general capital punishment orders  in the special jurisdictions will henceforth be carried out  speedily. It was probably with this in mind that the special  court, following several weeks' worth of postponements of major  trials, restarted its sessions, handing down six convictions  carrying the death penalty. It would appear that in the future  terrorists, in particularly those picked up who are armed, will  be punished in exemplary fashion. Among other measures that have  been mentioned, the heads of the national defense force are  reported to have discussed ways of eliminating the armed groups'  support and arms supply networks. The issue of closing the  borders with Morocco was reported to have been brought up. The  country's vast border areas, owing to the contraband trade, are  indeed being used to bring in subversive elements and documents  but in particular weapons, despite the vigilance of the  gendarmerie and the customs service.    The deterioration of the security situation is such that  even  a state of emergency has been considered. It was, according to  our sources, supposed to have been instituted before 24 March,  but developments on the political scene and in particular the  restart of the national dialogue have, it would seem, helped  postpone this measure. It remains to be seen whether these  decisions will be enforced in one overall step or gradually.    However, it develops from this redeployment by the state  that  the overall security formula has not been completely abandoned.    That formula will be used in parallel with "the political  solution," in other words discussions with political and social  forces. The government, which has increased its appeasement  gestures (closing the camps in the south, freeing Boukhamkham  and Djeddi, and suspending executions), has been poorly  understood, if we may put it that way, by the terrorists. The  latter have interpreted the government's attitude as a sign of  weakness and stepped up the violence. The policy of concessions  has given them the illusion that the reins of power were within  their grasp.</p>

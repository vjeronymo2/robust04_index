			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Unions in with large companies The number of large companies which use unions to communicate with their employees appears to be rising after a sharp fall in the late 1980s, a survey by employee communications consultancy Vista has found, David Goodhart writes. About 60 per cent of 375 of Britain's biggest companies questioned last month said they used unions to brief staff. This compares with 53 per cent in a 1989 survey, which was sharply down from 62 per cent in 1985.</p>

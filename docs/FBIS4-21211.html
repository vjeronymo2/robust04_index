			<p>Traffickers   <F P=102>   PY1204214694 Madrid EFE in Spanish 2325 GMT 11 Apr 94 </F> <F P=103> PY1204214694 </F> <F P=104>  Madrid EFE </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] Lima, 11 Apr (EFE) -- It was disclosed today that a  high-ranking Peruvian Army chief has been accused of heading a  military organization that protected drug traffickers in  exchange for money.    General Eduardo Bellido, current Peruvian military attache  in  Israel, was charged by retired Major Evaristo Castillo with  letting drug traffickers operate in Huallaga, where he was  political-military commander during 1991 and 1992.    Castillo, who said he has been harassed and received death  threats, asserted that in 1992 Bellido ordered his troops not to  intervene in the struggle against drug trafficking and that they  only fought terrorism.    The retired Army major stated that the alleged links  Peruvian  military officers maintained with the drug mafias ``are a  complete system'' and that it is not only isolated cases of  corruption involving certain officers.    He thus disagreed with a recent U.S. State Department report  stating that one of the obstacles facing the fight against drug  trafficking in Peru is the corruption of police and military  officers, but that the problem does not have an institutional  character.    Castillo stated that in 1992 he witnessed how chiefs of  battalions under Bellido's command collected protection fees  from drug traffickers to let them operate and then handed that  money over to Bellido.    As an example he mentioned that the general never ordered  the  arrest of the most important Peruvian drug trafficker, Demetrio  Chavez Penaherrera, aka Vaticano, arrested last February in  Colombia, ``although he knew where he was through Intelligence  Service and DEA reports.''    He also asserted that the Peruvian military also knows where  Colombian trafficker Waldo Vargas, aka Ministro, operates and is  not doing anything to arrest him.</p>

			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia may press for better diamond deal RUSSIA will press for an improvement in the terms of a five-year deal giving South Africa's De Beers a virtual monopoly on the country's sales of rough diamonds, if an influential Russian parliamentarian gets his way. Mr Leonid Gurevich, who co-chairs a state commission examining the Russian diamond industry, has complained that the agreement signed in 1990 by Soviet authorities is 'not a partnership'. He said that other diamond-producing countries such as Australia had obtained much better terms from De Beers, which controls 80 per cent of the rough (uncut) diamond market through its London-based Central Selling Organisation. Mr Gurevich also rejected what he called 'blackmail' by De Beers, which suggested that Russian complaints would only damage Russian interests by further weakening an already depressed diamond market. He said that at a meeting requested by De Beers on Thursday evening he had challenged Mr Gary Ralfe, the head of the CSO, who is also in charge of relations with Russia, to prove that the relationship was fair. 'I said 'help me' (prove this). He answered with an attack. He said they are thinking about whether to renew the present agreement. . . I told him he was strongly exaggerating the losses we would face if the relationship broke down. I explained to him that it would be a catastrophe for De Beers but not for Russia.' Mr Gurevich also said he had received from Mr Ralfe media reports on the Russian diamond business with a note from him claiming that such articles were harming the market. Welcoming the creation of a new Russian-Yakutian joint stock company as ending internal divisions over control of Russian diamonds, Mr Ralfe said before meeting Mr Gurevich that he did not expect Russia to renegotiate their present agreement. But Mr Gurevich told a different story. Despite Mr Ralfe's assertion that Mr Gurevich was 'not running the diamond business', the parliamentarian said he would press for changes before the present deal expires in 1995. He complained that while Australia could sell 15 per cent of its diamond exports independently of the CSO, Russia could sell only 5 per cent. Even then, the independent Russian sales, intended to test the prices fetched by the CSO, could only be conducted in Moscow. Mr Gurevich said: 'Can we talk seriously about this if there is no diamond market in Moscow? We want to sell these diamonds abroad on the free market.' Almazyuvelirexport, the state organisation that handles diamond sales and signed the agreement with De Beers for the now defunct Soviet Union, agreed yesterday that there was room for improvement. But Mr Pavel Kovilin, the deputy director of Almazyuvelirexport, said his organisation would press for changes only after the agreement expired. He also claimed that the Moscow sales. which were attended by buyers from all continents, fetched prices representative of the world market. Although he has no formal role in running the Russian diamond business, Mr Gurevich is capable of mobilising opinion against the present arrangements if informal pressure for a better deal from De Beers does not work.</p>

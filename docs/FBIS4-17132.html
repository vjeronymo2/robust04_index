			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vasiliy Kononenko report: "Russian Security Council Has </F> Examined Situation in Hotspots"]    [Text] Russian policy toward the conflict situations in  nearby and more distant countries -- that was the main theme of  the Russian Federation Security Council session chaired by B.  Yeltsin in the Kremlin 20 April.    The session examined two main questions: on Russia's policy  in the Caucasus region and on the fulfillment of decisions on  state support for the Cossacks. However, as Security Council  Secretary O. Lobov said in conversation with your IZVESTIYA  correspondent, Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev also briefed the  Council on the situation in Bosnia. In view of the fact that B.  Yeltsin's initiative to hold a summit meeting of leaders of the  interested states on the Bosnian problem is meeting with growing  support, it was decided to speed up its preparation. Working  contacts have already begun in this regard.    A. Kozyrev gave the Security Council members a detailed  report on the military-political situation in the region of the  conflict between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh and also in  connection with the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. The general  opinion, O. Lobov said, is this: Russia's interests in this  region -- first and foremost the existence of a considerable  Russian diaspora there and the presence of a large military  contingent -- dictate the necessity of strengthening its  peacemaking role in those conflicts. Since organizations like  the United Nations and the CSCE cannot send their forces there,  Russia advocates the presence of Defense Ministry disengagement  forces in the conflict zones, as well as the presence of  observers from international organizations.    As for the problem of the Cossacks, the Security Council  session took note of the slow solution of the questions of  ensuring self-government in the Cossack communities and granting  them land. In some regions there have been confrontations  between local administrations and Cossack elected organs. On  the other hand, the government and the president's structures  have a common position regarding the rehabilitation of the  Cossacks as a community [sosloviye]. A general federal program  will be drafted in that regard. The president is going to send  the State Duma a draft law on the return of land to Cossack  settlements. This process will have different features in  different regions, of course. As for the performance of  military service by Cossacks, the Cossack formations will be  introduced into the structures of the Defense Ministry and the  border troops.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Technology: Japan's flight of fantasy - Building an airport on a man-made island presented special engineering challenges When Kansai International Airport opened on a man-made island in the middle of Osaka Bay in central Japan, it was greeted by the typical chorus of disapproval that attends most large civil engineering projects: it was too expensive, it was sinking, it was not large enough, it was a white elephant. It cost more than Y1,500bn (Pounds 9.5bn) to build, 50 per cent more than projected when work began 10 years ago. Since the first aircraft touched down on September 4, just 110 arrivals and departures take place a week, compared with the planned-for 454. But if there is a success story, it is to be found in the architectural and technological achievements of the ambitious project. Nearly 2km long and occupying more than 300,000sq m, it is the world's biggest airport terminal. It sits, wings outstretched like a great gull, on a 520ha artificial island, 5km offshore, joined to the mainland by a double-deck road and rail causeway. A project of that size brought unique challenges to its engineers, a British-Japanese collaboration of Ove Arup and Nikken Sekkei. The principal difficulty arose from that scale. The number of flights the airport would be required to handle meant it would be Japan's first 24-hour facility. But the Kansai region is a flat, densely populated plain, flanked by mountains to the north and sea to the south. A 24-hour airport on such crowded land would require the kind of tolerance of late-night flights for which the Japanese are not renowned. It was decided instead to build an island in Osaka Bay and put the airport there. In normal circumstances that would have presented few unfamiliar problems. Landfill reclamation is a local speciality in Osaka Bay - there were already half a dozen sites in the bay reclaimed for port facilities when the project started. The initial plans involved building the airport 1km out to sea, like most of the other artificial islands in the area. But the Osaka Bay's fishing community, which was courted assiduously for permission to build the airport, objected to the idea of a site so close to land within their waters. After a prolonged wrangle, it was agreed to build the island 5km from the shore. That decision created the principal difficulties for the construction of the island and the terminal building. As John Batchelor, in charge of Ove Arup's Japanese operations, puts it: 'The difference between placing something 1km and 5km from land was enormous. Five kilometres into the bay the water is much deeper and the soil much softer. The volume of landfill on such soil meant the island would settle considerably over a period of a few years.' To minimise the effect of settlement, the subsoils immediately below the seabed bottom, composed of soft alluvial clay, had to be strengthened. This involved draining the clay layer by injecting sand, increasing the density of the soil and hardening it. In total 1m sand drains were installed in the clay, four times as many as have been used in the past 25 years in Japanese offshore construction. The site was then completed with landfill reclamation. The water depth at the chosen site required soil reclamation of about 33m in depth - a total of 180m cu ft of fill - some 50 per cent more than had ever been used in the construction of similar islands in Japan. Yet the whole process - improvement of the foundations and full reclamation - was completed in less than five years. But although the strengthening of the foundations had gone a considerable way towards limiting the settlement, it had not been eliminated completely. This posed a new problem for the construction of the terminal building itself. The engineers' calculation was that, following the improvement, the total settlement would be more than 2m, but would be at an exponential rate, with rapid sinking at the outset, gradually diminishing towards zero in the future. If the settlement occurred to the same degree all over the building, there would be little structural problem, but the danger was that different parts of the building would sink at different speeds, threatening to break the back of the structure. Ove Arup and Nikken Sekkei opted for a technique that had been tried in smaller buildings on reclaimed land, but not on the scale of a vast airport terminal. They built a system of computer-controlled hydraulic jacks that actually raise and lower the building's 900 columns. Pipes between the pillars contain advanced spirit levels that measure precise movements of the building. Every two months the building's maintenance engineers wheel a vast computer around the basement of the building and plug it into each pillar. The computer provides a series of readings of the differential movement of each of the pillars. They can then calculate precisely which pillars need to be raised and which lowered. Deep in the foundations, the pillars are then moved up or down by removing or inserting shims - metal wedges that sit beneath them. The more mundane consequences were also tackled. Over the next 10 years the building is expected to settle by as much as 1m. The jacking system ensures that only the ground level will actually move, while the rest of the building remains intact, but the fact that the settlement is differential means that one side of the building could fall, creating difficulties for walls, doors and staircases. As Batchelor explains: 'The roof and outer walls are fixed but the hydraulics allow the floor to move around like water in a choppy sea. This could create difficulties such as walls with gaps at the bottom as the ground moves.' So, at the ground level all the walls and staircases are longer than they initially need to be. As the floor descends or rises with each jack movement the walls slide out of panels and 'stretch'. The staircases contain an extra two hidden steps to allow for this movement, and the plumbing systems are all built with flexible pipes. The overall effect is that the passenger does not notice that one side of the building could be 1m lower than the other. While in the foundations modern applications of the primitive jack keep the building secure, in the roof a new concept keeps it comfortable. A problem that confronted Ove Arup in constructing the interior of the terminal was that Renzo Piano, the Italian architect who designed the building, was concerned that the structure should, from both inside and out, maintain the pure simplicity of its curves, unimpeded by any obtrusions. Unfortunately the demands of human comfort require most buildings to have large air conditioning units in their ceiling, involving complex and usually unprepossessing pipes and boxes which Piano was anxious to avoid. Ove Arup's solution was the creation of what they call 'open air ducts'. Seventeen vast blue nozzles pump air at high speed from the ground level of the international departures floor to the ceiling. The air is then conducted along Teflon-coated strips of fabric following the curve of the roof, the shape of which had been determined by the profile that would carry air most effectively across the space. The conducted air then falls, losing speed and circulates back along the floor, producing a cool breeze at passenger level. The design of the roof also helped facilitate the engineers' safety plans. Japanese regulations require fire-resistant compartments of no more than 500cu m. The Kansai terminal forms a continuous volume of more than 1m cu m. Ove Arup convinced the regulators the high curved roof would allow smoke to rise and stay trapped in the ceiling area for long enough to allow passengers to escape the building. According to Batchelor, the conjunction of form and content is what makes the building unique in Japan. 'Buildings form an essentially practical purpose in Japan,' he says. 'They are simple, they work and they are boring. This is a building that departs from that tradition. It is a work of grace and style that uses technology to perform its basic function.'</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed news item: "Nuclear Warheads Are Returning to </F> Ukraine as Fuel for Nuclear Electric Power Stations"]    [Text] The first batch of cassettes [kaset] has arrived  from Russia at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Electric Power Station,  Europe's largest AES, as payment for the dismantled nuclear  warheads. This means that the practical implementation of the  measures provided for in the trilateral declaration of the  Presidents of Ukraine, Russia, and the United States on this  issue has begun.    Experts estimate that the amount of fuel delivered to the  Zaporizhzhya AES is sufficient to operate one of the five  reactors for a year. This will provide our country with 5.5-6  billion kilowatt-hours of cheap electric power.</p>

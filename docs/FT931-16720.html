			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Sun Alliance cuts bonuses SUN ALLIANCE, the composite insurer, yesterday announced cuts in the bonuses it pays on with-profits life insurance contracts. Pay-outs on 10-year endowments, which Sun Alliance expects to account for a large proportion of its business following heavy sales of the product in 1983 and 1984, will drop by 14.94 per cent, compared to this time last year. Assuming the policy was taken out by a 29-year-old man paying Pounds 30 per month, a pay-out of Pounds 7,060 on January 1 last year would have dropped to Pounds 6,005 by the beginning of this month. Cuts in 25-year pay-outs have been less marked, and on the same assumptions a Pounds 52,021 pay-out will drop to Pounds 50,048. The company chose to make cuts in annual or reversionary bonus rates, which are announced annually and then cannot be taken away from the value of the contract. It said this reflected its expectations of lower investment returns and inflation for the next decade. Capital bonuses, added only at the end of the contract, remain unchanged but are reviewed monthly.</p>

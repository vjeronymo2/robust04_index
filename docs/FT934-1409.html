			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / The Nature of Things: Forecasters find cash in chaos theory Meteorologists suffer more than other scientists from people's selective memories. We remember their past sins - above all, in the UK, the failure to predict the October 1987 hurricane - while failing to notice how much more accurate their routine forecasts are becoming. A forecast five days ahead today is likely to be as accurate as a two-day forecast 20 years ago. But chaos theory, the new science of order and disorder, places a fundamental limit on meteorologists' ability to issue accurate forecasts for a particular time and place indefinitely into the future. The dynamics of the atmosphere are so sensitive to small changes in the starting conditions that even a forecaster with an infinitely powerful computer could not predict the details of the weather a month ahead. The famous - if far-fetched - example is that the fluttering of a butterfly's wings over the Amazon could determine whether a storm develops over New York several weeks later. As meteorologists began to understand the implications of chaos during the 1980s, their initial dismay was replaced by determination to take advantage of the theory's mathematical insights. Quietly they are developing a powerful technique called ensemble forecasting, which is based on chaos theory. The UK Met Office is leading the way. Its researchers routinely use the ensemble method for 30-day forecasts. These are much more accurate than they used to be when long-range forecasters relied on statistics and climatology, finding similarities between the current weather pattern and past years - and hoping it would develop in broadly the same way over the next month as it did then. The Met Office ensemble forecaster runs the supercomputer model of the global atmosphere nine times, deliberately varying the starting conditions on each occasion. From the distribution of different outcomes, he or she can estimate the likelihood of various weather patterns over the coming month. If all nine runs give the same pattern - say, dry settled weather - the forecaster is more confident than if six predict a long settled spell and three end up with wind and rain. In practice, the Met Office then combines the ensemble result with more traditional statistical analysis to produce its final forecast. This does not predict detailed weather on any particular day but gives likely trends of temperature, rain / snowfall and sunshine over the month. Using a technical measure of forecasting 'skill' on which zero means no better than chance, temperature predictions have improved from 10 per cent to 25 per cent since the 1970s. That means today's 30-day forecasts are about half as accurate as those for the next five days. Sadly, only big businesses are benefiting from this work. The Met Office stopped publishing its monthly weather prospects in the 1970s because they were then only a slightly better guide than tossing a coin. And it has no plans to resume publication now that they have improved. Instead it sells the forecasts on a confidential basis to large corporate clients in industries such as energy, water and retailing, for whom the commercial benefits far exceed the Pounds 5,000 a year subscription fee. The official Met Office line, expressed by Julian Hunt, the chief executive, is: 'The results are not yet reliable enough to issue to the public, who are not really interested in a forecast that is reasonably correct only about seven times out of 10.' Even if the Met Office is right to take such a condescending view of the public's meteorological sophistication, what about small businesses and farmers for whom Pounds 5,000 is a prohibitive fee? Why, for instance, should independent shops not be able to adjust their ice-cream stocks in response to a forecast of hot or cold weather when the big supermarket chains can? At least part of the answer lies in the commercial pressure on the Met Office to reduce its demands on the public purse, by making as much money as possible selling services. Indeed Prof Hunt notes the irony that 'the fact the 30-day forecast is not brilliantly accurate means that we make more money out of it.' Surely, however, it could still make money by selling a more elaborate or specialised 30-day forecast to commercial customers - as it does with daily and weekly forecasts - while making the basic prospects more widely available. The Met Office is one British scientific institution that is still a world leader in its field. How sad that it no longer believes in fair weather for all.</p>

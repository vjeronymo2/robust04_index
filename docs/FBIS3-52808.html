			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hasan 'Asfur, member of the PLO delegation </F> to the Taba talks, by 'Umar Zaydani in Taba on 10 January,  carried within the "With the Midday Events" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Zaydani] Mr. Hasan 'Asfur, member of the PLO  delegation to the Taba talks. Let us begin with a statement  made by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in which he says that the  Taba talks are being conducted on the basis of an understanding  reached in Cairo and on the basis of Dr. Nabil Sha'th's remarks  on this, and not on the basis of the remarks sent by Yasir  'Arafat.    ['Asfur] As a matter of fact, the joint statement issued by  the Palestinian and Israeli sides to resume the negotiations in  Taba states that the basis of negotiations is the Declaration of  Principles signed on 13 September 1993 and the understandings  reached in Cairo. Besides, the remarks sent by Dr. Nabil Sha'th  to Amnon Shahaq were made by Yasir 'Arafat. Therefore, there  are no personal remarks by Dr. Nabil Sha'th. These remarks  represent the reservations of President Yasir 'Arafat.    [Zaydani] There is an impression that the negotiations have  been going on for months, and each time we go back to the same  issues: the crossings, protection of roads, the size of the  Jericho area, and the transfer of civil powers. Has there been  no progress?    ['Asfur] The truth is that the negotiations which have been  going on for around three months did not only address these  issues. They also addressed all issues pertaining to the Gaza  agreement, the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and the  size of the Jericho area, in all their aspects. Discussions  dealt with all details. There are understandings on several  issues, but the recent differences over these three points --  which emerged as three major issues in the negotiations --  created this impression that there has been no progress on any  aspects. The truth is that this is not an accurate picture of  what is going on at the negotiations. There are major and minor  differences, and we are trying to overcome all difficulties. We  hope to make progress that will end this long process of  negotiations, which started three months ago, and to implement  the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area.  This is what we are seeking in the days ahead.    [Zaydani] How do you explain the variation in optimism  between you and the Israeli delegation? You are talking about  two or three weeks while the Israelis are talking about two or  three months?    ['Asfur] It is not that we have determined how long things  will go on. It is an expression of the nature of our  understanding of the implementation of this agreement and the  translation of the protocol of Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza  Strip and the Jericho area. We believe that with hard work and  without wasting time and avoiding direct responsibility on both  sides, we can reach agreement within two or three weeks maximum.  This is what we will try to do, if we really want to end this  long process of negotiations.    [Zaydani] Do you think that the Taba talks will be clearer,  given the recent crisis that happened with the Liaison Committee  in Cairo?    ['Asfur] What happened in Cairo was not a crisis. It was  only a misunderstanding of some of the issues during the  discussions and how each side dealt with these issues. Finally,  an understanding was reached to overcome what happened in Cairo.  We think that the Taba talks will produce clearer answers about  what happened, especially since there are understandings about  some issues. We have covered a considerable distance in areas  of understanding, even regarding complicated issues. We can say  that during the recent negotiations, the Palestinian side has  offered perceptions that give practical solutions. We hope that  the Israeli side will understand the Palestinian understandings  without pushing in directions which express a unilateral vision  of the negotiations -- something which we do not want as a  negotiating party.    [Zaydani] Do you agree with Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. Yosi  Beilin that the most important thing in the negotiations is the  ability of the Israeli and Palestinian sides to overcome  differences and reach an understanding?    ['Asfur] No doubt the desire, ability, positive intentions,  and abandoning the mentality of pressures to achieve  instantaneous or personal gains by any party -- especially if  this party believes itself to be the strongest party -- will  make the negotiations take a positive course and achieve  progress. However, if the other view prevails, using pressure  through the logic of strength and weakness, then this will not  enable the negotiations to achieve any results. This we do not  want to happen.    [Zaydani] Will the Taba talks continue uninterrupted until  agreement is reached?    ['Asfur] This is what we, as a Palestinian party, want. I  believe there is initial understanding with the Israeli side.  We will know for sure today. We want continuous negotiations  until we reach an agreement. Perhaps, there might be technical  halts, on Fridays and Saturdays for religious and practical  reasons, but we will try to give as much of our time to the  negotiations as we can.    [Zaydani] Mr. Hasan 'Asfur, member of the Palestinian  delegation to the Taba talks, thank you very much.    ['Asfur] You are welcome.</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: BMW car orders outstrip production Orders for BMW cars outstripped production capacity in the first half of this year, when net profits jumped 14 per cent to DM290m (Dollars 181m), the automotive group said yesterday. Output of BMW models, hampered by retooling for new models, rose 3 per cent to 285,000 units, while deliveries to customers increased 5 per cent to 291,500. Turnover climbed 7.4 per cent to DM15.8bn. The newly-acquired Rover group also worked at the limits of its capacity to deliver 234,600 vehicles - a 16 per cent improvement on the first half of 1993, BMW said. No financial details for Rover were included in the report. Although the company provided no clear forecasts for the full year, apart from predicting higher deliveries and production, it suggested the early pace would slow. In the US, where first-half sales of BMWs rose 13 per cent to 41,700, it expected overall demand for passenger cars to continue increasing but at a lower rate than the 8 per cent recorded in the period to the end of June. The company was concerned at the strength of the D-Mark, which 'could bring into question the expected economic recovery', it said. Lower growth rates were likely in western Europe, where price cuts, cheap special models and government-funded measures to encourage people to buy new cars, had lifted overall registrations 7 per cent to 6.5m units in the first half. BMW sales in the region rose 2 per cent to 201,200 cars. Registrations in Germany increased only slightly to 116,000. In Japan, the marque's sales rose 15 per cent to 14,700 units, in spite of a clear fall in overall demand for quality cars. Although the Japanese market had stopped declining, an increase in overall registrations was not to be expected before 1995, BMW said. In an enthusiastic review of the Rover purchase, the report said sales in mainland European countries had 'almost without exception', grown by more than 10 per cent. The introduction of the Land Rover Discovery to the US in April had helped double sales of Land Rover vehicles there to 4,500. The company's motor cycle business reported a 35 per cent rise in deliveries during the review period to 29,300. Production of two-wheelers, including assembly in Italy of the new F650 single-cylinder model, increased 11.5 per cent to 24,240. The BMW marque's share of the world market rose to 5 per cent, compared with 3.5 per cent in the first half of 1993.</p>

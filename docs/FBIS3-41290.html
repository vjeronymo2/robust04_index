"We planned the operation quite thoroughly to capture all  members of the gang in one week," said Vladimir Kolosov, chief  of the Internal Affairs Department of the Maritime Territory.    "Ten chieftains of the Azeri diaspora were detained,  including one criminal authority who controlled the fund which  provided assistance to criminals and their families."    One of the chieftains had on him raw opium and syringes, was  armed and carried 2,640,000 roubles and 900 U.S. dollars in his  wallet.    Forty Caucasians residing in Vladivostok without proper  registration were also detained. There was no shooting or  violence in the course of the operation.</p>

			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Rivals emphasise doubts at IBM IBM's competitors moved swiftly over the weekend to capitalise on uncertainty created inside and outside the world's largest computer maker by the appointment as chief executive of Mr Louis Gerstner, a man with no computer industry experience. Choosing Mr Gerstner, who joins IBM on Thursday from RJR Nabisco, the food and tobacco group, was a bold but risky way for IBM's board to try to revitalise the company, many computer executives and analysts said. Questions about IBM's technology and product strategies will pile up while Mr Gerstner gets to grips with the company, they added. 'The customer is saying, holy mackerel, why should I buy any more from IBM until this guy figures out what he is doing?' said Mr Scott McNealy, chief executive of Sun Microsystems, the leading computer workstation manufacturer. Computer buyers realise that Mr Gerstner is likely to eliminate some products as he streamlines IBM, but they don't know which ones, he explains. The fear of buying IBM products that will soon be obsolete 'gives Sun's sales people a really nice run at the IBM customer base'. If IBM's customers are worried, its employees are living in fear and dread of the 'axe man', a reputation Mr Gerstner brings with him from RJR Nabisco, where he lopped the workforce and sold off assets. Wall Street analysts expect Mr Gerstner to accelerate the 'downsizing' of IBM by cutting up to 100,000 people from the company's 300,000 payroll. Among computer experts, another source of concern is Mr Gerstner's lack of prior experience in the computer industry. Others see Mr Gerstner's lack of computer industry experience as a positive advantage because he will be forced to rely upon the advice of others, pushing responsibility down the ranks. But that raises questions about who Mr Gerstner will choose as his top advisers. 'The management team he builds is much more important than what he knows about mips and flops,' said Mr Regis McKenna, an industry consultant. 'Making IBM faster on its feet is going to be the key challenge.' IBM's wish-list, Page 14</p>

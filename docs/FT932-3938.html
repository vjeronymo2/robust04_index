			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Control Tech up sharply to Pounds 3.7m CONTROL TECHNIQUES, the Powys-based electronic drives group, yesterday reported sharply higher interim profits. Pre-tax profits in the six months to March 31 increased to Pounds 3.72m against Pounds 1.57m in the comparable period when they were depressed by reorganisation costs and other disruptions. Both periods included about Pounds 200,000 of rationalisation costs. Turnover increased by 25 per cent from Pounds 43.2m to Pounds 54.2m. After a higher tax charge of Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 600,000) earnings per share increased to 5.9p (2.3p) and the interim dividend is raised by 9 per cent to 2.35p (2.15p). Mr Trevor Wheatley, chairman, said the improvements were mainly due to organic growth and continuing tight cost controls. Order books were up about 20 per cent on the same time last year, he added. The chairman said almost all the group's companies were trading ahead of the same period last year. Sales via distributors increased by 31 per cent, as did sales through the group's expanding number of CT Drive Centres which now total 17, including one in Turkey opened this week. Negotiations are continuing on establishing Drive Centres in Spain, the Czech Republic, Austria, India and China. Meanwhile the group is continuing the rationalisation and integration of ICD, its US subsidiary, acquired in 1991. Profitability is expected to be further improved as product substitution is completed.</p>

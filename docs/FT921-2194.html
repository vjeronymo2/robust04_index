			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: C and W moves could save Pounds 175m next year CABLE AND Wireless is restructuring its business services units and merging its personal communications network business with Unitel, a US-owned operator, in moves that will lead to savings for the group of Pounds 175m in the next year. The UK-based international telecommunications group is, however, making an exceptional charge of Pounds 50m in the current year to March 31 to cover the costs of the restructuring. Shares in C and W dropped sharply on the news before closing down 28p at 555p as investors were disappointed by the prospect of another year of flat earnings. In the year to March 31 1991, C and W reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 609m against Pounds 527m but earnings per share were flat at 31.3p. The restructuring would provide the foundation for a more focused strategy for C and W's business services activities, an area where it expects to see the greatest competition. C and W was not interested in building a mega-network around the world but would concentrate on areas where it already has strength. The move was aimed at 'clearing the decks for the nineties,' said Lord Young, chairman. The merger of Mercury Personal Communications, a wholly owned C and W subsidiary, with Unitel, a consortium led by US West, a diversified communications company based in Colorado, brings together two of three competing operators of personal communications networks (PCNs). It highlights the difficult market faced by groups licensed to operate PCN, a mobile communications system based on digital cellular radio technology. PCNs were initially hailed as a low-cost mobile system which could compete against BT's fixed-link telecommunications network. However, the market for mobile communications has failed to grow according to the industry's initial optimistic forecasts. Mercury acknowledged that with two analogue networks - Vodafone and Cellnet - already well established, 'it may well be that the market can only support one digital cellular network.' In addition, the costs of installing PCN infrastructure are prohibitively high. Mercury PCN and Unitel had already agreed last July to share the costs of building a new infrastructure for PCNs to reduce costs by about Pounds 400m. A merger would cut costs by approximately a further Pounds 200m over the next three years, C and W said. C and W indicated that it could tie up with Microtel, the only other PCN operator, to share a single network. Since the UK government awarded licenses in 1989 to three consortia of several companies each to develop and operate PCNs, most have withdrawn from participation leaving only C and W, US West and Hutchinson Telecommunications.

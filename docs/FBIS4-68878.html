			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ilgonis Upmalis, Head of the Russian Troop </F> Withdrawal Control Bureau, by Viktors Berzins: "Are They  Leaving? -- Nothing Good There -- An Excuse for Contention Has  Been Created."]    [Text] I LGONIS UPMALIS, Head of the Russian Troop  Withdrawal Control Bureau answers questions from NEATKARIGA CINA.    [Berzins] Following the official initialing of the  agreement,  there has been a great deal of discussion about the demobilized  Russian army personnel remaining in Latvia. Who are the people  in this group, who will have the opportunity to remain here  after the army leaves?    [Upmalis] One military unit was withdrawn from Latvia with  the accompaniment of music. The very first one. For the rest,  there has been no music, and no other military unit has been  withdrawn. Property has been taken out, and the military units  have disappeared.    There are three options for an officer, after the military  unit is disbanded.    First -- there are those who sign a contract with Russia to  continue service in the military. The drawback is that the  signers cannot select where to serve. They must serve where they  are sent. The majority desires to go to Moscow, but most will  not be sent there. For this reason, a great many do not sign  such contracts.    Second -- there are those who have sufficient service time  to  receive a pension when they demobilize. Those who have  apartments in Russia will leave, and also those for whom  apartments are being built. They have registered with Mayorov  (Commander of the North Western Military Group), and will have  apartments provided for them in Russia, in time. A few days ago,  he showed me a list on which those were crossed off who had  received apartments and had left. Those who have already entered  into the Latvian community will not leave.    Third -- there are those, who, with the help of some arm  twisting, have found the opportunity to serve in a comfortable  little spot in Russia. All of these leave.    A fourth category consists of military persons who are  non-commissioned officers. They are mid-ranking and warrant  officers who had signed short-term re-enlistment contracts. They  make up an entire category of the military, and these gentlemen  have other problems, as well. Basically, they have been left on  their own; they have completed their contact service stay,  cannot yet receive a pension, and must provide for their own  future subsistence. They are disappearing somewhere.    There is yet another category -- connected with the army  were  the so-called civilian workers, former Soviet military providers  and workers. They did not walk around with epaulets. They may  have even been Latvian citizens, although, for the most part,  they were soldiers who had been released from active duty and  who stayed to work. Every military unit was surrounded by these  civilian workers. And, there is one more category that may  increase the number of personnel remaining in Latvia. Mr.  Mayorov has just submitted to me an official document on the  number of retirees. There are 21,976 persons receiving pensions  from the Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation. Information  is not forthcoming on the KGB retirees.    We had officially requested the listing a week ago.    [Berzins] Must we rely on the data supplied by the chief of  the withdrawing military forces? Isn't there some way we can  find this out ourselves?    [Upmalis] The municipalities are not doing well with respect  to this matter. We had requested that, as of April 15, the  municipalities, whose territories contained demobilized Russian  military units, submit data regarding the retired military  persons in their territory. The response is very poor. The only  official data we have received up until now are from Rezekne,  Jekabpils and the Vidzeme suburb. The rest are calling and  complaining that they don't have any such data. As for example,  Jurmala. But they have house management boards where such  information could be obtained. -- That's a lot of work -- is the  reply. While it is true that this a lot of work, these  municipalities have the ability to gather the information. They  have form No. 16, which shows who each person is.    The work is there, and it must be done. But, even more  surprising than this laziness to perform the work is that we are  concluding agreements with Russia without requesting such  official information from them. That we are concluding  agreements in the dark. We had no available information on the  number of retirees, but we concluded an agreement on giving them  public guarantees.    [Berzins] But those 22 thousand that are being mentioned  constantly?    [Upmalis] I have not seen any official documents as of the  present. To the best of my knowledge, the first official  document is the one Mr. Mayorov presented to us on Tuesday.    And also. How many military persons there are in Latvia --  even this, no one has officially requested from Russia.    And if we are talking about demobilization as of February  28,  1992 and afterwards, we should know these figures. The office  does not have these figures, and as far as I known, no one else  does either.    [Berzins] Is it possible that the delegation is going around  you, and that it already knows?    [Upmalis] For over one and a half years, I participated in  the delegation as an expert. With the exception of the last two  times, which were -- Jurmala and the signing in Moscow. Maybe  then... But even in such a case, this figure should have been  published.    [Berzins] So what is really happening -- is the Russian army  leaving right now, or not? What about the orders to halt the  withdrawal of the army, and all other threats of this type?    [Upmalis] There is only one way to answer this -- the army  cannot not withdraw. This is because the army has reduced itself  to a situation where, if it could remain here, it would have to  bring the military forces back, bring in soldiers, bring in  material reserves, technical equipment. Without these, no army  can live or survive.    We are very strict in the control of all persons and  military  services being brought in. We are allowing military persons who  are truly connected with the military withdrawal. Yes, we have  admitted over 300 soldiers into the Cekule and Garkalns  munitions storehouses, where they are packing munitions for  removal. We look upon this as a necessity -- this is a  workforce. This is also why it was possible to empty out the  storehouses so quickly in Cekule -- some of the largest in  Latvia. Right now, the area is being demined, and the work is  being performed by the North Western Military Group. These  storehouses will be taken over by the Latvian defense forces.    As for the other military persons -- and, naturally, we are  talking about a large number -- the road here has been closed.  One or two can get in -- our borders have quite a few gaps. You  don't have to look far. They are entering right here through  Riga airport, and, unfortunately, we have been unsuccessful in  our attempts to have customs control aircraft coming from Russia.    [Berzins] Is this because the Russian side is prohibiting  this by force, or are we just too afraid to do it?    [Upmalis] I believe the main reason is our disorganized  structure. Three systems -- customs, border guards, and flight  services -- must coordinate their activities. If they would get  together and work properly, the problem would not exist.    The Russian military withdrawal process is occurring. At the  end of this month, one more Latvian rayon will be free of  Russian military forces. This is the Rezekne rayon, from which  the last military unit is preparing for withdrawal. It is  possible that, as early as this week, part of this territory can  be taken over by our armed forces for border guarding needs.    Finally, the Biryuzov War School has been officially turned  over. The same applies to the Alksnis War School. An airport in  Daugavpils has been turned over. In Jekabpils, as well. A part  of Bukultos is being turned over. In Oskalns station, a train is  being filled from Zakamuiza -- a unit with about 60 various  technical installations.    In the near future, a division will depart from Dobele to  prepare a site in the Leningrad district for the relocation of  this military unit. After a conversation with Mayorov, it could  be gathered that the leadership is hoping to perform the  withdrawal during the summer months. This is because barracks  have not been built for all of the military forces, and  therefore a portion will have to spend the winter in tents. This  refers to both the Tallin 144th division and the Dobele 25th  sharpshooters brigade.    [Berzins] People are upset that Latvia is preparing to pay  for the properties built by the Russian army.    [Upmalis] While participating in the talks as an expert, I  paid particular attention to a statement in the agreement that  was worded as follows: the Latvian side guarantees reimbursing  the Russian Federation for properties built by the army of the  Russian Federation. Now, the Latvian side understands this  statement as follows: Yeltsin proclaimed that this army became  the Russian army after February 28, 1992. Thus, if anything was  built after this date, then the Latvian side is prepared to pay  for it. Unfortunately, I am unaware of any property that the  Russian side may have built after this date. But Mr. Mayorov  understands this matter in the same way as you did, that all  property left behind will be paid for by the Latvian side. It  has already been said that "property cannot continue to be  turned over, because the property relationships have not been  settled."    Thus, you can see what happens when the points of the accord  between nations are not clearly defined. I already brought up  the fact that such difficulties would arise, but the Latvian  side interpreted this in a manner I already mentioned.    There is nothing good there -- an excuse for contention has  been created.</p>

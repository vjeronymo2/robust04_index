			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Trade position signals strengthening recovery The underlying trends in Britain's trade position with non-European Union countries continued to improve last month, providing further indications of the increasingly solid nature of the economic recovery, official figures yesterday indicated. The trade deficit with non-EU countries was a seasonally adjusted Pounds 418m in July, barely changed from the Pounds 392m deficit seen in June, but sharply down from deficits of about Pounds 600m seen earlier this year, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. The figure was considerably better than City forecasts. Exports to non-EU countries rose 3 per cent to Pounds 5.46bn last month, up from Pounds 5.32bn in June, the CSO said. Imports also rose 3 per cent on the month to Pounds 5.89bn in July. However, measured on a three-monthly basis, the figures pointed to an even healthier underlying trend. Exports rose 2.5 per cent in the three months to July compared with the three months to April, while imports rose 0.5 per cent in the same period. Measured without oil and erratics - the figure regarded as the best guide to the underlying trend - exports rose 3 per cent in the three months to April compared with the previous three months, while imports fell 0.5 per cent. The trend in the volume trade, however, was slightly divergent, with price rises accounting for much of the growth in trade. Export volumes, excluding oil and erratics, rose 0.5 per cent in the three months to April compared with the previous three months. As this is lower than the rise in export values, it indicates that exporters have raised their prices in the past three months. Import volumes excluding oil and erratics, however, fell 5 per cent in the three months to April compared with the previous three months. Since this was a larger drop than the fall in import values, this indicates that import prices have remained relatively high. The CSO estimated that export volumes will rise slightly in the coming months, while export volumes will rise 0.5 per cent each month. Import volumes are expected to fall 1 per cent each month, while import values are expected to remain flat.</p>

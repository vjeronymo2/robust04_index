			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / The Long View: Independent illusions ONCE AGAIN the trade press of the retail investment industry is buzzing with alarm about the renewed threat to that beleaguered group, the providers of independent financial advice. They are the ones who like to put blue IFA logos on their office doors. The plan to transfer these advisers - of which there are some 6,300 authorised firms - from their tottering regulatory body Fimbra (which is being kept alive only by financial transfusions from insurance companies) to a new body called the Personal Investment Authority is in deep trouble. Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, says he will not recognise the PIA unless its preliminary prospectus is changed so that a number of conditions are met. One of these is that the PIA must vet all the IFAs thoroughly before accepting them, and must not simply take the view that they can be grandfathered over from Fimbra. The PIA will certainly not now start operations on July 1, as scheduled, and may well be stillborn. There is a lot of tedious financial industry politics in all this, but the question of independent advice is an important one. The UK is unusual in having a large group of independent intermediaries, who as recently as 20 years ago accounted for the bulk of life insurance and pensions business, and still sell maybe a third. On the Continent most savings products of this kind are sold through banks or by salesmen. When the UK's new investment regulation framework was being developed in the mid-1980s it was rightly thought vital to protect the tradition of independent advice. Unfortunately a serious mistake was made. The IFAs did not accurately recognise their own function, which was essentially to act as freelance marketing agents who could sell products for a large number of independent life offices, not to mention other providers such as unit trust companies. Because of the existence of this independent distribution channel the UK has been able to sustain a large number of innovative and competitive life companies which have generally offered good value to investors. But the IFAs had bigger ideas. They considered they were investment experts whose job it was to offer best advice to clients. This was seriously over-optimistic in most cases, because truly professional IFAs would require proper experience and qualifications and would be remunerated by their clients through fees; in fact IFAs are almost always remunerated through commissions from the product providers. With ideas a long way above their real station in life, the IFAs and their trade associations saw the new Financial Services Act (intended to improve investor protection) as a way of securing a marketing advantage. They insisted that they alone should have the right to multiple representation; other intermediaries could act only for one company. The gloss put on this 'polarisation' was that it protected the public against conflicts of interest. But for the IFAs the point was that it restricted the banks and building societies in their plans to develop the retailing of investment products. As recently as the beginning of this month we saw one of the belated effects of this National Westminster Bank finally abandoned its attempt to persevere as the last major High Street multi-branch IFA. The entirely superfluous NatWest Life is now in operation, and leading independent offices such as Clerical Medical and Standard Life have lost an important source of business. But in winning the battle against the banks in the 1980s the IFAs overplayed their hand. The new rules required them to give 'best advice' and to subscribe to a compensation scheme through which good IFAs must pay for the losses inflicted on the public by the rogues and the incompetents. For a truly professional industry this should not have been a problem. Alas, in too many cases the IFAs have failed to match their own image of themselves. Many firms have been closed or gone into liquidation, and there is concern that the courts may make big awards against certain IFAs in favour of victims of home income plans, the packages of mortgages and insurance bonds that have left many pensioners facing repossession of their homes. The financial viability of the IFAs' regulator Fimbra has been undermined. If it collapses the law says that the IFAs must find authorisation elsewhere or cease trading. Moreover the banks are out for revenge. If the IFAs had not been so keen to drive the banks and building societies out of multi-provider retailing the IFAs might have lost some of their marketing distinctiveness but they would have shared some regulatory interests with the banks. As it is, the banks see the IFAs purely as competitors that would be better eliminated. They are well-placed to kill the PIA - but are negotiating as they would prefer not to be seen with a smoking gun. If the worst comes to the worst most IFAs will have to sign up as the tied agents of single life companies. A few may be able to gain authorisation from other regulators. There remain accountants, solicitors and other professionals who are authorised to give independent advice by their professional institutes. In due course a professional body of specialist IFAs could be formed to authorise firms in the same way. But these would cater for a limited group of high net worth clients rather than the mass market. Would the drastic shrinkage of the IFA sector matter? The problem would be not so much that people would get worse advice (this aspect has been exaggerated) as that they would suffer a reduction in choice and in value for money. The retail investment market in the UK would become much like that on the Continent, and many venerable institutions would disappear, while the likes of NatWest Life would thrive. It would scarcely be the end of the world, but it would be the end of a distinctive British tradition.</p>

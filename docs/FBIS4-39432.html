			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Platkovskiy report: "Pyongyang Meets Threat With </F> Threat"]    [Text] Consultations are being held in the UN Security  Council about how best to punish the DPRK for disrupting  international monitoring of [kontrol nad] its nuclear programs.  Meanwhile, Pyongyang is threatening to withdraw once and for all  from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.    The majority of Security Council members no longer has any  doubt that the introduction of sanctions against the DPRK is the  best means of forcing the North Korean leadership to come to its  senses. However, Moscow views such a development as extremely  undesirable.    Trading interests aside, there is also the Russian Embassy  in  the DPRK, which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs fears would  become the target of the "uncontrollable wrath of the Korean  people" -- to use Pyongyang's terminology. Our diplomats and  their families would feel this wrath directly were Russia to  support any sanctions, whose introduction Pyongyang assesses as  "a declaration of war."    Meanwile, our military experts are already analyzing the  possible reaction of the North Korean leadership to the  introduction of sanctions. A military specialist who worked in  the DPRK for several years told IZVESTIYA that field commanders  are in a state of constant stress. Especially those whose  subunits are stationed in the region of the demilitarized zone.  No one can predict what may prompt a salvo of fire on Seoul  from the almost 10,000 North Korean guns stationed in this  extremely dangerous region.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Working Life: Travelling light - Style The surprising thing about packing a holiday suitcase is that the formula hardly changes from year to year. The more practised you become the less likely you are to take dozens of things that never get worn. There are certain rules which always apply to a two-week sunshine holiday. The first is you never need anything that dressy (and that includes jewellery). The second, that it helps to keep your clothes in a choice of two or three colours. (Black and white being the most obvious). A formal evening dress with stockings and stilettos looks somewhat out-of-place, even banal, in a mediterranean setting. You can tell a practised traveller by the way she saunters out to dinner in a white t-shirt and white trousers, accessories consisting merely of a pair of strappy silver sandals and a few brush strokes of bronzer on her cheeks. The summer sales in Britain are full of floral viscose dresses (short and long) which can be dressed up (those silver sandals) or down with a t-shirt underneath and espadrilles. Look for the Ghost label (Whistles, Harrods, Liberty) and you will find the perfect weight fluid viscose crepe in simple solid colour dresses, elasticated waist trousers and long line, loose-fitting tunic tops. Flyte Ostell (A la Mode and Liberty) and Betty Jackson (311 Brompton Road) are designers with a similar philosophy. Do you really need shorts? Yes, if you plan to play tennis and other athletic pursuits. No, unless you buy shorts that are tailored to flatter (Calvin Klein at Selfridges, Levis or Emporio Armani). A sarong skirt, or piece of patterned fabric (for glamour you can use a large Hermes silk scarf) tied round a swimsuit and knotted at the waist is far more stylish as an alternative. Cooler too. Always plan to take items which double as something else, like the silk scarf that can be worn as a hairband, over the head if visiting a church or as a mini sarong - even as a bedspread if you hate the rented villa furnishings. Classic shirts always present an ironing problem which is why simple tank-style swimsuits, which work as bodies for the day, are far less like hard work. Glamourous plunge-neck styles (black is always best) can double as an evening top. The brave can take this years' three-triangle bikini because at least it takes up no packing space. Shoes are the most bulky item, but the way they transform the image of an outfit is paramount. That crease-resistant viscose dress says one thing worn with trainers, another when with espadrilles and changes further with delicate strappy sandals. Good sunglasses with Polaroid lenses, a sunhat that will survive the journey, and a bag which works for the beach and the market and doesn't look like the formal leather one you take to the office are all intelligent investments.

It is a mockery of and insult to the North," says the  Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of  the Fatherland [CPRF] in its Information No. 644 published  Thursday.    It notes:    "As for the `National Security Law' in which the South  Korean puppets define the North as `an anti-state organisation',  it is an anti-national and anti-reunification fascist law which  should have been thrown into the dust bin of history long ago.    "We cannot but take a serious view of the fact that the  South  Korean puppets made the rude remarks blatantly getting on our  nerves when they were talking about the resumption of the  North-South dialogue.    "Entirely attributable to the South Korean authorities'  dishonest stance of dialogue is the grave situation in which the  North-South agreement and the joint declaration on  denuclearization have not been implemented and all dialogues  between the North and South have been totally broken up.    "If the South Korean authorities truly want the improvement  of the North-South relations and dialogue, they must change the  confrontation policy into a reconciliation policy and abolish  the fascist `National Security Law' against the nation and  reunification."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 4 May (MTI) -- Although the government  has committed errors over the past four years, Hungary has  advanced so far that there is no way back to the former  conditions, Prime Minister Peter Boross, prime minister  candidate of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), the senior  governing party, told a rally at Pecs tonight.    The prime minister pointed out that Hungary, which inherited  a ruined economy, a disintegrated society and a fallen political  regime, now has a viable system of democratic institutions, and  an economy based on private property. Since no party  cooperating with the trade unions has ever implemented a liberal  economic programme, there is a suspicion that the Socialists do  not want to implement it at all.    What is at stake in the elections is whether the country  returns to the failed political regime or prevents the  interruption of what has started -- even if with errors,  difficulties and the problems of incompletion. "I trust in the  instinctive wisdom of the Hungarian nation, which has never  voted for the left of its own accord -- there had to be an army  present," the prime minister said.</p>

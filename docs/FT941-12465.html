			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Sport: A hug can give you a lift - Skiing Silver Star, hidden away in a remote part of Canada's Okanagan Valley, is about to ignite a small but bright glow in the minds of those British skiers already committed to crossing the Atlantic for their annual romp in the snow. The main cause of its sudden emergence as a potential world player is the opening up of some impressive intermediate and advanced terrain, thus making it the biggest ski area in British Columbia after Whistler / Blackcomb, and removing almost at a stroke its reputation as a mere family hill for beginners and intermediates. A diminutive ski-lift attendant, Mary-Jane Rutherford, also deserves part of the credit. It takes all sorts to be a 'Liftie': in the Alps you are lucky if they acknowledge your existence; in the States they ask 'How's it goin'?' and wish you a nice day, but at Silver Star they go one better - they hug you. Not every time you use their lift, of course, but pretty much as often as you feel the urge . . . More phlegmatic types, determined to preserve stiff upper lips, will not want to be hugged or have their space invaded by a complete stranger. Even some of the Canadians themselves are not overly fond of the idea. But to me it felt just about as spontaneous as a good gimmick can be. During our visit to this delightful ski area, I was hugged by a number of female 'Lifties', including Mary-Jane, the young lady who started the trend; it can be quite a tonic on a winter's day. It all started when Miss Rutherford, the slightest but most exuberant of lift operators, noticed that a skier had written 'Have you hugged your kids today?' on a message board at the bottom of her lift. She changed it to 'Have you hugged your Liftie?' - and was immediately swamped with so many hugs that it became a habit. Now most of Mary-Jane's colleagues are up for hugs too. The habit has even spread to neighbouring ski resorts. A ski resort, of course, cannot live by hugs alone, and Silver Star has many other qualities. With skiing on both sides of Aberdeen mountain there are more than 60 attractive trails cut through the trees and encompassing every degree of difficulty. Vance Creek, the traditional side of the mountain which opened in 1958, has 38 trails almost exclusively aimed at family and intermediate skiers. On the other side of the mountain, Putnam Creek was opened a year or so ago and has some scorchingly steep trails among its 23 runs. Another large mountain face across the valley is earmarked for further expansion. Many of the trail names reflect either the area's mining history or astronomical connotations in keeping with the resort's name. Lone Star, Milky Way, Constellation and Big Dipper are all enjoyable blue runs on the Vance Creek side. White Elephant, Gypsy Queen and Eldorado, all on the Putnam Creek side, are named after old mining claims. Silver Star is run by John Gow, the resort's president. He is a hands-on executive who lives on the mountain and provides the personal touch that so many ski resorts lack. The strict planning regulations are simple: 'They have to please me,' says Gow's wife Heather - and she is only half joking. She has decreed that the few new buildings erected have to be neo-Victorian in an attempt to recreate something close to the gaslight era of the late 1890s. With their bright pastel shades and ubiquitous fairy lights, these town houses make for a colourful, cosy and charming, if ersatz, atmosphere. Silver Star has become too good and too big to remain a British Columbian secret for much longer, and already skiers from Europe are beginning to find their way there. It can easily be combined with two major skiing attractions already well-known to British skiers: helicopter skiing in the Bugaboo, Monashee and Cariboo ranges, and the major destination resort of Whistler/Blackcomb. This year, for the first time, Silver Star is featured in British ski tour operators' brochures: Made to measure, Canada's Best and All Canada Travel and Holidays. But will it be a question of 'No hugs please - we're British'? Arnie Wilson stayed at the Vance Creek Hotel, the resort's leading hotel, with roof-top hot tubs, a Victorian-style dining room and live music which includes old time fiddle shows. The rates are CDollars 80-124. (tel 0101 604 549 5191)</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris </F> Krivoshey and Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow 19 April TASS -- The first round of  inter-Tajik negotiations has reached its major goal of the  beginning of a political dialogue between the Tajik Government  and the opposition. The negotiations were held under the U.N.  aegis and with active participation of the Russian Federation,  special envoy of the United Nations Secretary-General Ramiro  Piriz-Ballon told a news conference here today.    In his words, the Tajik Government and the opposition are  determined to find a peaceful solution to the complicated  political problems in order to achieve national reconciliation  in Tajikistan and restore national economy.    The sides have managed to agree on the agenda and sign an  appeal on all sides to abstain from actions that may endanger  the results of political negotiations.    It was an important discussion, but the sides understood it  is impossible to achieve a comprehensive decision at the first  round of negotiations. They will be continued in other places.  Iran and Pakistan have offered their territories for further  inter-Tajik talks, said Ramiro Piriz-Ballon.</p>

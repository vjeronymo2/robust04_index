			<p>BFN     [Text] There cannot be sustainable development for a part  of the world, and underdevelopment for the rest. This was said  by Cuban President Fidel Castro on 5 May at the First  International Small Island Nations Conference. In his address to  the plenum of the summit, comprising approximately 50  delegations in Barbados, Fidel pointed out that the problem of  sustainable development will not be solved unless there is a  more equitable distribution of the world's wealth.    Fidel added: We are islands a few meters above sea level. We  ask ourselves what will happen when the water level rises, and  whether we will be able to withstand the droughts, hurricanes,  and other weather disasters awaiting us. Fidel also pointed out:  We are not responsible for this; others colonized and exploited  us. Consumer societies have destroyed the environment.    Commander in chief Fidel Castro today emphasized that while  annual per capita income of Switzerland is $34,000; Bangladesh,  with over 100 million habitants, and in danger of disappearing  underwater, has a per capita income of barely $210. Castro said  this during the 5 May session of the First International Small  Island Nations Conference being held in Bridgetown, Barbados.    Castro added that the arms race continues, weapons sales are  on the increase, the most powerful nations sell the most  weapons, and do not mind profiting from the deaths of others.  Why should they care about the environment and the fact that  islands are sinking underwater?    All the heads of state and government present in Barbados  are  participating in today's meeting; they are scheduled, on 6 May,  to approve a program for action on sustainable development for  small island nations.</p>

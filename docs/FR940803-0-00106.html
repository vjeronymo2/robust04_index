			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is currently developing a timeline for the development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of emission standards and test procedures for ethanol-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles. In the event that manufacturers introduce ethanol-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fueled vehicles into commerce before federal fuel economy test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures are established, EPA will consider proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California test procedures and a fuel economy equation to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a mechanism is in place for ethanol-fueled vehicle CAFE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit as soon as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's rule also integrates the energy efficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the AMFA into EPA's existing fuel economy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. These requirements must be met for a dual-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle to be eligible for fuel economy credit. In the NPRM, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed that the manufacturer must test each dual-fueled vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used for fuel economy purposes on both the city and highway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> driving cycles using three fuels: gasoline or diesel fuel, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative fuel, and, in the case of alcohol dual-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automobiles, a 50 percent gasoline/50 percent alcohol mixture to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfy the energy efficiency requirements of the AMFA. 15 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2013(h)(1)(C) (ii) and (iii). Although testing on both the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative fuel and gasoline fuel is required to determine fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economy, the 50/50 mixture requirement is only needed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine energy efficiency. After considering comments received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from manufacturers, the EPA realizes that the requirement to test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> every fuel economy vehicle on three fuels could be excessively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burdensome compared to the requirements for testing gasoline-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fueled vehicles, which are tested on one fuel. Therefore, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dual-fueled vehicles, this final rule requires manufacturers to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Perform city and highway fuel economy tests on all vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used for fuel economy purposes using both gasoline and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alcohol fuel and, (2) during initial certification, either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perform city and highway fuel economy tests on one emission data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle per engine family using the 50/50 alcohol/gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mixture or provide a statement attesting that equal or superior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy efficiency is attained while using a 50/50 mixture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compared to using gasoline, where applicable. EPA retains the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> right to audit test any vehicle used for fuel economy purposes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confirm the manufacturer's statement. This will reduce the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden on the manufacturer while preserving the intent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy efficiency requirements of the AMFA by ensuring that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles are designed to be equally or more energy efficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while operating on the alternative fuel and a 50/50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alcohol/gasoline mixture than when operated on gasoline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's rule also integrates the fuel economy labeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the AMFA for alternative-fueled vehicles into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing fuel economy regulations. Some minor modifications were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made to the proposed label formats as a result of comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received on the NPRM. These changes are discussed in detail in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ``Public Participation'' section. In response to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers' comments, the EPA is offering an optional label  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> format for dual-fueled vehicles that contains fuel economy values  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for vehicle operation using the alternative fuel. The AMFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires that the fuel economy values while operating on gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or diesel appear on the label with a statement that further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information is contained in the Gas Mileage Guide available at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the dealer. This optional label format contains a limited amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of additional information pertaining to the fuel economy while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating on the alternative fuel and should reduce consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confusion and frustration in obtaining such fuel economy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information. Also, this optional label will contain a statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that refers to the availability of additional information in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gas Mileage Guide. The label formats established under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking are found in the revised regulations following the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is working with the Department of Energy (DOE), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Transportation (DOT), and the Federal Trade  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission (FTC) to revise the Gas Mileage Guide to include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information on alternative-fueled vehicles. These changes will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be coordinated with the FTC's implementation of section 406 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102&hyph;486) which mandates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the FTC promulgate rules to establish uniform labeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for alternative fuels and alternative-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles, including requirements for appropriate information with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to costs and benefits so as to reasonably enable the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer to make choices and comparisons. The revisions to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gas Mileage Guide (including changing the name of the guide to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Fuel Economy Guide'') will not be completed in time for inclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the 1994 model year guide. Therefore, the fuel economy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labeling requirements for alternative-fueled vehicles, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain label statements that refer the consumer to the Gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mileage Guide for further information on the fuel economy of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative-fueled vehicles, are applicable beginning with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1995 model year. However, those manufacturers who produce 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or 1994 model year alternative-fueled automobiles may optionally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply with the labeling regulations in today's rule using the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate label wording modifications, approved by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator, regarding availability of additional information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Gas Mileage Guide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AMFA does not address the applicability of the gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guzzler tax to dedicated alternative-fueled vehicles or dual-fueled vehicles. The Secretary of the Treasury (after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consultation with the Secretary of Transportation) is authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by Section 201 of the Energy Tax Act of 1978, 26, U.S.C. 4064  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , to include in the gas guzzler tax program automobiles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fueled with any product of petroleum or natural gas, if such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inclusion is consistent with the need of the nation to conserve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy. Consequently, the alternative fuels covered by the AMFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could conceivably be included in the gas guzzler tax program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently the program is limited to passenger automobiles powered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by gasoline or diesel fuel. The Secretary of Treasury has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made a determination to include alcohols or natural gas in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas guzzler program; therefore, dedicated alternative-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles are currently not included in the guzzler program. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NPRM, the EPA solicited comments regarding whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative fueled automobiles or dual-fueled automobiles should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be included in the gas guzzler tax program. The comments were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forwarded to the Treasury Department for consideration in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of applicability of gas guzzler tax to dual-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles. The IRS agreed that EPA's decision to label dual-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fueled automobiles for gas guzzler tax purposes based on the fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economy while operating on gasoline is in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To save time and printing costs, some technical amendments of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR parts 86 and 600 have also been included in this final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

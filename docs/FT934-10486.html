			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Boeing plans new combat aircraft BOEING is making a bid to return as a leading combat aircraft manufacturer by announcing yesterday it was studying the development of a new multi-role military aircraft to challenge proposals by the two main US combat aircraft manufacturers, Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas. Boeing said it had reached an agreement with the US government's Advanced Research Projects Agency on a demonstration programme for the new modular, multi-role aircraft that could perform conventional take-off and landing missions for the US Air Force, short take-off and vertical landing missions for the US Navy and Marine Corps and conventional aircraft carrier operations. The new aircraft is designed to perform missions now undertaken by the Lockheed F-16, the McDonnell Douglas AV-8B built in co-operation and under licence from British Aerospace and based on the BAe Harrier, and the McDonnell Douglas F-18. Both Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas have also been awarded US government contracts to explore the feasibility of a new generation short take-off and vertical landing aircraft. But the Boeing concept takes this further by proposing a multi-role tactical aircraft to perform a variety of missions for all three US forces. 'We're excited because our work is proving the idea is affordable as well as technically feasible,' said Mr Mickey Michellich, Boeing's director of advanced tactical aircraft programmes. Boeing is also discussing with the US general Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney aero-engine groups as well as with Rolls-Royce, which produces the Pegasus powerplant for the Harrier, on a possible propulsion system for its new modular combat aircraft. Rolls-Royce also confirmed that it is discussing possible co-operation with Pratt &amp; Whitney on a new short take -off and vertical landing engine for the 21st century successor to the Harrier.</p>

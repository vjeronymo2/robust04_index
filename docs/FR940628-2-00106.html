The result of this proposed change of position would be a small decrease in the rate of duty on the subject merchandise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By this action, those rulings which are inconsistent with our current position would be revoked. Before adopting this proposed change, consideration will be given to any written comments timely submitted in response to publication of the document. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before August 29, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments (preferably in triplicates) may be addressed to the U.S. Customs Service, Office of Regulations and Rulings, Regulations Branch, Franklin Court, 1301 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20229.

GRI 1 provides that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Magnets are specifically provided for in heading 8505, HTSUS. In several rulings, we have held that articles consisting of a magnet placed within a decorative housing or shell made of plastic, ceramic, or textile (sometimes referred to as refrigerator or household magnets), were composite goods. Classification was considered under the following subheadings and duty rates: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> 6912.00.50: Ceramic tableware, kitchenware, other household articles *&blank;*&blank;*: [o]ther  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The general, column one rate of duty is 7 percent ad valorem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> 7323.99.90: Table, kitchen or other household articles and parts thereof, of iron or steel .*&blank;*&blank;*: [o]ther: [o]ther: [n]ot coated or plated with precious metal: [o]ther: [o]ther. *&blank;*&blank;*.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=1 --> The general, column one rate of duty is 3.4 percent ad  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=3 --> valorem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> 8505.19.00: Electromagnets; permanent magnets and articles intended to become permanent magnets after magnetization. *&blank;*&blank;*: [p]ermanent magnets and articles intended to become permanent magnets after magnetization: [o]ther. *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=3 --> The general, column one rate of duty is 4.9 percent ad valorem. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Because the article was a composite good consisting of metal, ceramic, textile, and/or plastic, it was prima facie classifiable under two or more headings. Customs would then apply GRI 3(b) to determine the essential character of the article.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (EN) constitute the Customs Cooperation Council's official interpretation of the HTSUS. While not legally binding, the ENs provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUS and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of these headings. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> T.D. 89&hyph;80, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989). EN VIII to GRI 3(b) states as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [T]he factor which determines essential character will vary as between different kinds of goods. It may, for example, be determined by the nature of the material or component, its bulk, quantity, weight or value, or by the role of a constituent material in relation to the use of the goods. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the rulings issued, Customs concluded that the magnet imparts the essential character to the article. The plastic, textile or ceramic portion of the article merely embellished the article and acted as a decorative selling feature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, Customs precluded classification of the article under heading 8505, HTSUS, which specifically provides for permanent magnets based upon a portion of EN 85.05. EN 85.05, page 1341, states in pertinent part as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [T]his heading does not cover: [e]lectro-magnets, permanent magnets or magnetic devices of this heading, when presented with machines, apparatus, toys, games, etc., of which they are designed to form part (classified with those machines, apparatus, etc.) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based upon this portion of EN 85.05, we held that the magnets were designed to form part of the article. It was concluded that because the magnets are presented with and incorporated into a textile, ceramic or plastic article (i.e., a hook, fruit caricature or advertising slogan), they are precluded from classification in heading 8505, HTSUS. Because the essential character of the article is the magnet, the article would then be classified based upon the composition of the magnet as an article of metal under heading 7323, HTSUS, or as an article of ceramic (barium ferrite) under heading 6912, HTSUS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several rulings were issued following this rationale.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HQs 082500, 083130, 083133, 083134, 089332, 089333, 089760; NYs 860370, 862523. This list may not be exhaustive. There may be others issued by Customs in New York or in the various Customs districts under the pre-entry classification procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Change of Position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After intensive analysis, we believe that EN 85.05 has been misinterpreted. The exclusion in EN 85.05 is designed to cover only those articles in which the magnet is merely an insignificant part of a larger article ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , kitchen cabinets with a magnet to keep the doors closed). In such cases, the magnet portion is ignored for classification purposes, and the article ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , kitchen cabinet) is classified as if the magnet were not present.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In regards to articles consisting of a metal or barium ferrite magnet and a plastic, textile or ceramic shell or housing (i.e., a hook, fruit caricature or an advertisement slogan), Customs believes that they are a composite good. Customs will continue to apply an essential character analysis pursuant to GRI 3(b) to find the essential character of the merchandise. If the shell or housing portion of the article merely embellishes the product and acts as a decorative selling feature, and the essential character is imparted by the magnet, then the article is properly classifiable in heading 8505, HTSUS, as a permanent magnet. This change in position only relates to how Customs interprets the exclusion stated in EN 85.05.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice is published in accordance with section 177.10, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 177.10).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before adopting this proposed change in position, consideration will be given to any written comments timely submitted to Customs.

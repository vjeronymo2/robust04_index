The theme of this meeting is to convey  the guidelines laid down by the central meeting on rural work  and to study and formulate measures to further emancipate  people's minds, seize the opportunity, and speed up  comprehensive agricultural, rural economic, and social  development in the region. Zhao Fulin, secretary of the  regional party committee, delivered an important speech at the  meeting.    Zhao Fulin's speech focused on five topics: 1) Having a  thorough understanding of the extreme importance of  agricultural, rural, and agrarian issues under socialist market  economy conditions; 2) the current situation in agriculture and  rural work in the region; 3) emancipating people's minds,  seizing the opportunity, and speeding up comprehensive  agricultural, rural economic, and social development; 4)  carrying out rural reform in depth, and speeding up the  establishment of a rural economic operational mechanism which  suits the needs of the socialist market economy; and 5)  intensifying leadership over agriculture and rural work.  [passage omitted]    Talking about the effort to speed up comprehensive  agricultural, rural economic, and social development, Comrade  Zhao Fulin pointed out that it is necessary to concentrate on  the following aspects: With the market condition as a guide, we  are to speed up the readjustment of the production structure in  rural areas and optimize the allocation of resources; we are to  vigorously develop township and town enterprises, accelerate the  process of relocation of the rural labor force, and speed up  construction of small cities and towns; we are to implement the  development strategy of invigorating agriculture through  promotion of education; we are to strengthen infrastructure for  agriculture, improve production conditions, and preserve  high-yield grain-growing farmland; we are to step up our effort  to aid impoverished areas, enabling them to speed up their pace  in extricating themselves from poverty and getting rich; and we  are to step up the development of socialist spiritual  civilization and of democracy and the legal system, and to do a  good a job in comprehensive management of public security.    Referring to the effort to deepen rural reform and speed up  the establishment of a rural economic operational mechanism  which suits the needs of the socialist market economy, Comrade  Zhao Fulin noted: We must heighten our sense of urgency to seize  the opportunity to accomplish the reform. In view of the actual  circumstances in this region, we must focus our attention on the  following tasks: We are to further stabilize and perfect the  responsibility system, mainly the contracted responsibility  system on a household basis with remuneration to output, and the  two-tier operational system characterized by integration of  centralized management and independent operation. First of all  we are to stabilize and perfect relations stemming from farmland  management contracts; secondly, we are to perfect unified  collective management system and strengthen its role of serving  the peasants; meanwhile, we are to vigorously introduce various  types of joint-stock systems and joint-stock cooperative  systems, enhance rational allocation and combination of  resources, vigorously promote the socialized service network in  rural areas, and step up the establishment of an operational  form featuring the integration of trade, industry, and  agriculture, and of production, processing, and marketing. We  are to establish a unified urban-rural market system, and  gradually build up a great commodity circulation structure. We  are to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and  control, and constantly intensify the government's role in  macroscopic guidance and management of the rural economy.    Comrade Zhao Fulin stressed that party committees and  governments at all levels must steadfastly place agriculture  before all other economic tasks, earnestly strengthening  leadership. In the meantime, the regional party committee and  the regional people's government must devote great efforts to  rural work, while prefectural, county, and city party  committees, as well as prefectural administrative commissioners'  offices and county and city governments, must focus on and  devote most energy to rural work. Party committee secretaries  and government leaders at all levels should constantly pay  attention to and personally attend to rural work. When dealing  with major issues concerning rural reform and development, they  must personally conduct investigations and studies, before  making decisions and adopting measures. And they must monitor  the implementation of such measures thereafter.    More than 500 people, including principal persons-in-charge  of various prefectures, cities, and counties, and leading  comrades from departments concerned, attended the meeting.  Present at the meeting were regional leaders Zhao Fulin, Cheng  Kejie [provincial governor], Liu Mingzu, Ding Tingmo, Li  Zhenqian, Lin Chaoqun, Li Enchao, Yuan Zhengzhong, Ma Qingsheng,  Yang Jichang, He Bin, Lei Yu, Xu Bingsong, Lu Bing, Yuan  Fenglan, Liu Hong, and Long Chuan.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Bogus factories hid fraud Tax evasion was so widespread among a group of London garment factories that the use of false invoices and bogus companies was widely regarded as normal, a judge said yesterday. Judge Mota Singh said at Southwark Crown Court that 'vast resources' had been necessary to uncover a fraud centred on garment factories predominantly controlled by members of the Turkish and Cypriot communities in the Hackney and Stoke Newington areas. A series of fraud trials ended yesterday in jail sentences for four company directors and a bookkeeper. Customs and Excise was defrauded of Pounds 6m in value added tax and there was an estimated further Pounds 10m in unpaid income tax and national insurance contributions. In April 1990 a total of 300 Customs officers raided more than 50 London premises. Sixty-one people were arrested and of the 47 who came to court, 20 admitted various offences relating to VAT fraud. Five trials were held with the longest taking seven months. Total prison sentences of 60 years and six months and total fines of Pounds 180,000 were imposed. Customs investigators found that in some cases only Pounds 150 of a worker's Pounds 500 weekly wage was being declared for tax. To conceal what was going on a large number of bogus businesses were set up to provide fictitious invoices to the garment manufacturing companies. Investigators believe it is unlikely any of the money will be recovered.</p>

Inaugurating the 19-member commission  in Abuja, the head of state, General Sani Abacha, said his  administration has unshakable commitment to the unity,  stability, and peace of Nigeria. State House correspondent  Chris Ngu reports:    [Begin recording] [Ngu] The head of state, in his inaugural  address, restated the commitment of his administration to the  cause of unity, peace, and stability of the nation. In deciding  on the need for the constitutional conference, Gen. Abacha said  the administration is informed by a basic democratic norm which  has it that what touches all must be approved by all. He said  that Nigerians owe it as a duty to posterity to stand up with  faith and good conscience in facing the challenges of nation  building. Then he asked: What is nation building, after all,  other than problem solving? The 19-member commission has Dr.  (Saidu Kawu) as chairman. Gen. Abacha then stated the  commission's terms of reference:    [Abacha] To prescribe modalities and organize a  constitutional conference; b) [as heard] to invite memoranda  from all parts of the country and from interest groups on the  agenda of conference; c) to collate documents and compile  memoranda for submission to the conference; d) to propose a  reasonable and comprehensive time table for the conference; e)  to advise on the number of delegates and members that will make  up the conference; f) to recommend suitable modalities for  electing and for selecting the delegations; and, finally, g) to  advise on any other matters which the commission considers  relevant to its assignment.    [Ngu] The head of state said that after a careful study of  the national debate, even on the rather tense atmosphere of the  nation's recent past, he is convinced that Nigerians still wish  to live together in one country but under conditions of justice  and fairness. The commission's chairman, Justice (Kawu),  speaking on behalf of all the members, said that they were aware  of the enormous task before the commission. He assured the head  of state of the members' determination to successfully carry out  their responsibility. [end recording]</p>

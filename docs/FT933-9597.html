			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Letter: Ostriches go way back Sir, Matthew Kaminski's article, 'Feathered herds give heavyweight profits' (July 29), talked about ostriches being 'first introduced . . . in the mid-1980s' to the US. In fact, ostrich farms abounded in south-west US more than 70 years or so ago. I recall seeing several old photographs of ostrich farms in Arizona. This is not a new phenomenon, merely an old one revived. Peter J M Rodger, White Horses, 11 Devondale Drive, Devonshire DV07, Bermuda</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / How to Spend It: Roller-blading hits town - A fast-growing activity that provides fun, exercise and transport Forget the gentle swish of leather on willow or thwack of tennis ball and racket. The new sound in the parks this summer is the whoosh of roller-blades on tarmac. Roller-blading has hit London in a big way - and it is not just the teenage set that has taken it up. Roller-blading started in Minnesota in the early 1980s as a means of honing ice-skating skills during the summer. Then people besides sportsmen realised it was fun and it became a more general activity. In the UK it is just beginning to take off, whereas in New York roller-bladers are everywhere. 'In New York it is a new form of public transportation,' says Eric Reguly, London correspondent of the Canadian Financial Post and once an ice-skating star. 'It is also culturally acceptable - in most stores in New York you can go into a store on your roller-blades; you could go to the most expensive restaurant and nobody would look at you twice. Executives roller-blading to work in their Armani suits are a common sight.' Eric himself roller-blades in the parks in London but is more nervous of roller-blading to work because of the traffic. 'In New York they are not confined to the parks: they can be seen all over the streets and New York drivers, having become used to the many bicycle couriers, seemed to have no trouble adapting to roller-bladers. People do it for fun, for exercise and for transport.' He started in his early thirties having resisted it initially 'because I thought I was too old for it but my doctor recommended that I took it up for my back - it's great for your muscles and is good aerobic exercise without damaging joints. Many runners and joggers who have been told to stop running because of the damage it was doing their joints have taken it up.' It is not difficult to learn and anybody who already knows how to ice-skate should pick it up very quickly. The main problem seems to involve stopping: ice-skating has techniques for stopping; but there is no emergency stop for roller-bladers - only diving on to the nearest grass, or making a couple of 360-degree turns, or doing a T-stop (but that wrecks the wheels). Lessons are available for those who do not know how to ice-skate. In London, Road Runner, Unit 002, Lancaster Road, (c/o 253, Portobello Road, London W11. Tel: 071-792 0584) will organise lessons at Pounds 10 an hour and hire out roller-blades at Pounds 8 a day. According to Road Runner, most people need 1-1 1/2 hours before they are ready to take to the parks. The activity is refreshingly free of any cult clothing. According to Road Runner 'baggy shorts, bright colours (we're a lot less cultish and much jollier than the skate-boarding crowd), and loose tops' are all you need to wear - apart from the equipment. Road Runner says it supplies gear to all ages - from children so tiny they can hardly see over the counter, to the 'gold card' set, well over retirement age. 'Lots of middle-aged people love it because it is low-impact exercise and much more fun than aerobics. This year we're also getting lots of the City crowd - people who work in merchant banks and love skiing in the winter are taking to roller-blading in the summer,' says Road Runner. The most common injury is a broken wrist and wrist-guards should be worn at all times, while knee and elbow guards are advisable as well. Bicycle-style helmets are a further precaution. Weekend FT sent Carmel Allen, old enough to see over the counter but a long way off bus-pass age, to have a go. She loved it: 'I'd just come back from New York where I'd seen people having great fun roller-blading at the open-air disco in Central Park. I was full of enthusiasm but a bit apprehensive and worried about losing a tooth or grazing my face. So I wanted to take lessons. 'Road Runner provided the inestimable Sven whom I had to meet at the kiosk in Kensington Gardens. I knew it had to be him when I saw this pony-tailed blond doing some very fancy foot-work just by the kiosk. He was sweet as pie. 'The first thing I wanted to know was how to stop - once I could do that I was ready for my turns. Two hours whizzed by and by the end I was able to skate off, waving good-bye, into Kensington High Street. I had one dramatic fall when I put my weight back and fell slap on my bottom. Now I feel ready to experiment further on my own. 'The thing I like about it is that it is such a happy sport. People smile when they roller-blade. When I used to go to the gym it was much more competitive. In the park everybody was encouraging me and clapping if I managed a difficult turn. And since friends have heard that I have taken it up I have had at least four roller-blading invitations.' Most good sports shops sell roller-blades - a good pair will cost anything from Pounds 85 to about Pounds 200. Wrist-guards and elbow guards cost between Pounds 15 and Pounds 20 and knee guards are about Pounds 20. As for the boots, the wheels and bearings are what really matter technically - and if you decide you like the sport you can upgrade them later on. Road Runner also has a branch at 127 Queen's Road, Brighton, BN1 3WB (0273-774266). Many other sports shops supplying roller-blades might be able to provide a teacher.</p>

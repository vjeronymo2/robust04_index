			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Airbreak resignations 'a gesture' MR DAVID LEWIS, who tendered his resignation on Monday as chairman of Airbreak Leisure Group, said yesterday that the move was largely a gesture. His resignation and that of Mr Martin Linton, finance director had not yet been accepted and nor did he expect them to be. In a statement to the Stock Exchange on Monday after the markets closed, Mr Lewis reported an interim pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.92m and the sale of Sunsail International, an ill-starred recent acquisition. He also said in the statement: 'I have tendered my resignation as your chairman along with your finance director, Mr Linton.' Mr Lewis had also warned that 'the results for this financial year will be significantly below the expectation of our shareholders'. He was unavailable for comment on Monday evening. Responding to the news, Airbreak's shares dropped 13 1/2 p to close yesterday at 10 1/2 p. Mr Lewis explained yesterday that he made the warning so as not to create a 'false market' for the tour operator's shares. The Pounds 2.92m losses, for the traditionally loss-making first half, were about Pounds 500,000 better than the predicted losses of Pounds 3.4m, he said. But the company would probably not meet, he said, profit forecasts of Pounds 4.2m for the full year. As for Sunsail, Mr Lewis said that he and Mr Linton had 'bought a company we should never have bought'. Sunsail owns some 340 of the more than 450 yachts it charters and has no business through the winter months. The company was bought in January for up to Pounds 8.08m, mostly in shares but including Pounds 1.55m of loan stock. The first tranche of 5.71m shares was paid, but Mr Lewis said that the second tranche of 6.91m, which was dependent on Sunsail making profits of at least Pounds 1.4m pre-tax in the year to October 31 1992, would not now be issued. Mr Lewis said Sunsail had been sold 'to a large well-known City institution' for Pounds 3.4m in cash and loan notes.</p>

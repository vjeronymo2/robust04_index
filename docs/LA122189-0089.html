			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: DUARTE;  </P> <P> COMPUTER LOAN PLAN SET  </P> <P> In an effort to promote computer literacy and pave the way for employees to  work at home, the City Council has approved an interest-free computer loan  program for half- to full-time city employees.  </P> <P> The city will provide loans of up to $3,000 to 43 eligible employees, including  City Council members, for the purchase of home computers and software  compatible with the city's system.  </P> <P> Assistant City Manager Don Pruyn said the program will encourage greater  computer proficiency and will allow employees to work at home, reducing traffic  and enabling the city to meet future South Coast Air Quality Management  District requirements.  </P> <P> The program's $50,000 budget will come from the city's Vehicle Replacement  Fund, normally used to replace city trucks and other vehicles.  </P> <P> Payments, made through monthly payroll deductions, will go back into the  vehicle fund. Loans must be repaid in two years.  </P> <P> The vendor, Computer Vision of San Dimas, in January will show city employees  four computer packages available, with prices ranging from $1,425 to $3,174.  </P></p>

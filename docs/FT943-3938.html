			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Cashless society suffers a setback The number of transactions settled in cash rose for the first time in at least seven years, a survey showed yesterday. The Association for Payment Clearing Services for banks and building services said the number of cash payments of more than Pounds 1 rose 1.6 per cent to 16.9bn. It was the first time in the seven years the survey has been running that the number of cash transactions rose, accounting for 63 per cent of all transactions. Non-cash transactions also grew 2 per cent last year to 8.9bn. The association said the rise in cash transactions last year had been unexpected and was unlikely to be maintained as the economy recovered. The biggest area of growth for non-cash payments was debit cards, rising 26 per cent last year to 2m a day, only slightly less than the volume of credit-card purchases. Debit cards were winning market share from cheques and were expected to achieve 'double-digit growth rates' for the rest of the decade. It said credit-card purchases, after falling in 1991 when annual fees were introduced, had recovered in 1992 and last year, and were expected to grow about 4 per cent a year until the end of the decade.</p>

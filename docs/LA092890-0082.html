			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CYCLE SHOP SPURS NOISE COMPLAINT  </P> <P> I am not a writer, but I am going to attempt this letter to bring out several  points of interest that were never mentioned in various articles on South Bay  Cycles.  </P> <P> Co-owner of the business William Campbell applied for and received a  conditional-use permit to operate a car leasing agency.  </P> <P> Several neighbors were opposed to this, while Jerry Compton highly supported  it. The city and neighbors were led to believe that a car brokerage was to  open. Near the shop's completion, signs were put up saying South Bay  Cycles-Harley-Davidson parts and accessories. Needless to say, the neighbors  were shocked. After several neighborhood complaints to the city, Mr. Campbell  then, and only then, attempted to obtain the necessary permit for a motorcycle  shop.  </P> <P> The shop is presently selling Harley-Davidson apparel, and there is already too  much noise and traffic related to Harley-Davidsons in the area.  </P> <P> The shop owners keep saying "give us a chance" to let them open and show that  they can control the noise and traffic. There has already been an increase in  traffic and noise.  </P> <P> These shop owners have not been fair. They have already had confrontations with  neighbors. It was only when the neighbors really started opposing, with  petitions of over 100 signatures, that the shop owners attempted to try and win  them over. A bit late.  </P> <P> I, as a concerned neighbor, am opposed to the opening of this shop. I see no  way of controlling the increase in noise and traffic it will have throughout  Hermosa.  </P> <P> JACKLYNN A.  </P> <P> TAGLIAFERRO  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach  </P></p>

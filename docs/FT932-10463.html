			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / International Company News: Air Canada deeper in red after write-off AIR CANADA reports a large net loss for the first quarter of 1993 following the write-off of its remaining 9 per cent stake in GPA, the troubled Irish-based aircraft leasing group. The company, Canada's biggest airline, has incurred a net loss of CDollars 293m (USDollars 234m), or CDollars 3.96 a share, compared with a loss of CDollars 164m, or CDollars 2.23, a year earlier. It said operating revenues were steady with a slightly better passenger yield. Revenues from other business offset declines in traffic and cargo income. The first-quarter results include a CDollars 80m write-down to cover the book value of the 9 per cent interest in GPA. Air Canada spent CDollars 53m buying a 20 per cent interest in GPA. As the recession began, it sold part of this for a CDollars 248m gain. It has received CDollars 59m in GPA dividends. 'We will not make any further investment in GPA,' said Mr Hollis Harris, chairman. GPA is restructuring its USDollars 5.5bn debt after shareholders refused to take up a USDollars 200m convertible preferred issue. Air Canada's net loss included CDollars 64m in extra provisions for staff retirements and other special charges. The first-quarter operating loss was CDollars 79m, before provisions, compared with an operating loss of CDollars 101m a year ago. The company said 1,000 more jobs would go this year, over and above the 500 announced. The new reductions applied across the board would reduce the payroll to about 16,000 people by the year end. Mr Harris announced a broad executive reshuffle designed to speed the drive for cost reduction and profitability. The number of top executives would be cut to 15 from 18. All airline operations become the responsibility of Mr Jean-Jacques Bourgeault, who steps up from executive vice-president, marketing, to executive vice-president and chief operating officer. A senior executive would be based in Vancouver to develop more business in western Canada. Mr Rob Peterson, treasurer, steps up to vice-president finance. Air Canada is forging operating links with Continental Airlines of the US which it hoped would lead to extra revenues and lower costs. A plan to merge with rival Canadian Airlines was blocked by legal process plus opposition from the Canadian Airlines management.</p>

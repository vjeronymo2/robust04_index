			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Medeva It will take more than explanations and assurances to restore confidence in Medeva. The overstatement of sales at its IMS subsidiary - and separate disagreement with the US Food and Drug Administration over production standards - point to management weaknesses. Never mind that bigger and better drugs companies have fallen into similar traps. Even on the bold assumption that these episodes can be resolved without further damage, they raise the spectre of nasty surprises lurking elsewhere in the group. Having subscribed to April's rights issue in good faith only to watch the shares almost halve in value yesterday, shareholders might thus expect some positive action. Medeva has already gone some way towards strengthening management. But the onus remains with the company to prove that financial and other management controls have not lagged behind its expansion. The deeper problem, though, may lie with strategy. Buying drugs companies with good organic growth prospects, yet too small to interest the giants of the sector, is coherent enough. But only if the pace of acquisitions does not outstrip Medeva's ability to manage them. Similar strategies in other markets - such as advertising, food distribution and hosiery - have come to a sticky end. There is no reason why pharmaceuticals should be different. At the very least Medeva should take time out from empire-building and let organic growth take the strain.</p>

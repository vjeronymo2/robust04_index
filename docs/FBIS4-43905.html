			<p>BFN     [Text] [no dateline as received] -- According to Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Federal Manager Guenter  Verheugen, "Kohl" belongs "in a museum." The population cannot  be expected to bear another four years of Kohl. The SPD is  missing its historical task if it does not manage to bring about  a change of power in the autumn because of its own problems.  "Attack is the command of the hour. Up and at 'em!" Verheugen  said during the discussion.    Thomas Westphal, chairman of the Young Socialists, openly  came out in favor of committing the party to a red-green  coalition, but he remained clearly in the minority with this  proposal. Brandenburg Social Affairs Minister Regine  Hildebrandt said it is incomprehensible and unacceptable that  many people in the east still vote for Helmut Kohl, despite all  the social cutbacks imposed by the coalition.    [Lower Saxony Minister President] Schroeder stated that,  with  its new program, the SPD has a good basis to win the Bundestag  elections. After the "failure of the Free Democratic Party of  Germany," the SPD must make sure that it does not give up  liberal principles in domestic policy and that it does not fall  into the trap of FRG Interior Minister Manfred Kanther's rigid  ideological concepts.</p>

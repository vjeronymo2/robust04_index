			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Colonel P. Olenin and Lieutenant-Colonel N. </F> Salamakhin]    [Text] The protective clothing set is designed to protect  the combat engineer from injury by the explosion of  antipersonnel mines when conducting reconnaissance and clearing  an area of landmines by hand.    The kit enables the combat engineer to search for and  destroy  (disarm) antipersonnel mines.    The KSZ includes a jacket with a cushioning climate layer,  trousers, a hood, a visor, shoe covers, and a respirator.    The jacket, trousers, hood, and shoe covers are made of a  large number of layers of ballistic fabric. A differentiated  change in the protective properties of the clothing is ensured  by using removable metal armor elements with varied levels of  strength.    The protective clothing is recommended for use, depending on  the conditions of the task being carried out, as a full set or  without individual components, with additional reinforcement or  without reinforcement. Three basic variants are formed: The base  variant for protection against small fragments; a reinforced  variant for protection against small fragments; and a  bulletproof variant for protection against directional mines.    The design features of the clothing make it possible to be  used in a temperature range of -35 to +35 degrees C and to fire  small arms.  <H5>  Basic Specifications of the Protective Clothing Set </H5>   Protective properties of the base variant:    --against explosion of high-explosive antipersonnel mines to  a distance of 1 meter;    --against bullets from a Makarov pistol from a distance of  10 meters.    Protective properties of the base variant with additional  armored protection:    --against explosion of POMZ-2 fragmentation-type  antipersonnel mines at a distance of 2 meters;    --against explosion of MON-50 fragmentation-type  antipersonnel mines at a distance of 15 meters;    --against bullets from Kalashnikov 7.62-mm and 5.45-mm  assault rifles from a distance of 15 meters.</p>

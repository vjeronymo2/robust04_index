			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / People: Schulmeyer returns to the 'fun' world of high-tech electronics Hans-Dieter Wiedig reckons he has crammed 20 years' work into his 10 years at the head of Siemens' computer business. The past three, spent trying to blend the conservative old group's operations with those of the free-wheeling Nixdorf enterprise, have been especially stressful, writes Christopher Parkes. In the past 24 months, Siemens-Nixdorf Informations-systeme (SNI) has booked losses of almost DM1bn. But his trials come to an end on October 1, when he surren-ders his post to 55-year-old Gerhard Schulmeyer. Formerly with Motorola, and now a main board member running the engineering group ABB's operations in the Americas, Schulmeyer says he believes his new job will be 'fun'. That remains to be seen - as does the reaction of the existing management to the appointment of an outsider. Top jobs in typically conservative German corporations are traditionally reserved for home-bred talent. But SNI, preparing to cast off 5,000 more employees and announce another DM300m-plus loss this year, requires special treatment. The first signs of group chairman Heinrich von Pierer's resolve to break with tradition appeared last autumn when he brought in Tandem's Robert Hoogstraten as SNI marketing director. Further signs of his determination to plug SNI's profits drain emerged last week when he announced that he would personally take the chair of the subsidiary's supervisory board next October when Schulmeyer (who arrives in July) formally takes over from Wiedig. The job at hand is to meet von Pierer's self-imposed deadline of 1996 for the business to reach break-even - and thus a position of relative strength from which it can negotiate on equal terms with potential partners. Wiedig, who is to be found a new job within the group, will also take a seat on the SNI supervisory board - from where he will be able to offer Schulmeyer the fruits of his '20 years' experience. Schulmeyer, who has dual German and American nationality, returns to the line of business he knows best: high-tech electronics. In the late 1970s he worked for Wega Radio, a Sony subsidiary, before moving to Motorola, where he worked between 1980 and 1989, latterly as executive vice president and deputy to the chief executive running Motorola Europe. He then moved to ABB, based in Stamford, Connecticut, and at the end of the year went on to the main board. As chief executive officer of ABB in America he presided over the integration of two important acquisitions, Combustion Engineering, and the transmission and distribution businesses of Westinghouse, although his period at the helm was characterised by what the company terms 'flattish' earnings. A restructuring of ABB last October put Schulmeyer in charge of the group's business throughout the Americas.</p>

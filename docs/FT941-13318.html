			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Cost of capital With rate of return on investment a hot topic with the utilities, the statistics in BZW's annual equity-gilt study make interesting reading. Unfortunately, there is a large deviation between the two main ways of calculating the cost of capital. The dividend discount model gives an estimate around 7 per cent while the capital asset-pricing model produces a figure of around 10 per cent. In tending towards the lower figure BZW seeks to resolve the problem by suggesting that the risk-free real interest rates of 2-4 per cent, often used in the CAPM, are too high. It thinks long-run real rates may be as low as 1.2 per cent. If true, that suggests a brighter outlook for gilts, and hence equities, than many now fear. Yet if the overall market is supported, there is a question over the likely level of corporate investment. It is striking that, in the past, two-thirds of total returns on equities have come from dividends. This UK bias towards draining cash has arguably led to under-investment and a smaller capital stock than might otherwise have been possible. Looking forward the study suggests that companies have not adjusted their hurdle rates of return to reflect lower inflation and financing costs. Profitable investment opportunities may thus be missed. That particularly applies to banks, whose high hurdle rates and central role in credit creation may be particularly important. The risk is that investment may be curbed because gun-shy banks are trying to fill in the holes they dug for themselves in the last cycle.</p>

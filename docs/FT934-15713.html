			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Books: Does it pass the blushing test? - Jackie Wullschlager observes the social mores revealed by the reading habits of Victorian England THE WOMAN READER 1837-1914 by Kate Flint Oxford Pounds 25.00, 366 pages READER, I married him, concludes Jane Eyre famously. But who was the reader? Some Victorian households banned Jane Eyre as dangerously sexy and subversive. Others welcomed it as great literature. Some critics advocated the blushing test - 'if you come to a passage which you could not read aloud to your father or brothers without a blush, lay down the book, it is not fit for you'. Some thought women should not read at all, but only listen, 'albeit understanding little', to what their husbands read to them. The Woman Reader is the story of what Victorian women read, what they were told to read, what they were forbidden from reading, and why. Out of this comes a history of the imaginative life of a century. It marches down the corridors of girls' schools, into the tea party in the Victorian parlour, under the seething currents of attraction in the mixed reading rooms of the public library, to discover people's hopes, fears and longings via the books they read and discussed. Books are a wonderful focus for this sort of social history. In an age before television, they were the cultural references that people shared and cared passionately about, The EastEnders of the classroom or the coffee morning. Ms Flint surveys reading habits recollected in memoirs and letters, contemporary book reviews, the literary prescriptions of advice manuals, the portrayal of women readers in novels. The results show compellingly how literary responses both united people of vastly different classes and ages, and highlighted the disparity between them. 'When Hildegarde Muspratt smuggled in Story of an African Farm, just out, the whole sky seemed aflame and many of us became violent feminists', recalled a pupil at Cheltenham Ladies College. A Lancashire working woman, reading Olive Schreiner's story of female oppression on the veldt, said 'I think there is hundreds of women what feels like that but can't speak it'. Sex, authority, freedom of expression were the issues in the battle between censors and readers. Deliciously, Ms Flint evokes earnest middle-class 19th-century England, where literature was seen as a tool of socialisation moulding conformist, or - if they read the wrong books - questioning, members of society. At Cheltenham, Desdemona and Ophelia were studied as victims of their own deceitfulness. David Copperfield and Adam Bede, which featured fallen women, were thought as inflammatory as pornography. Vera Brittan talks of 'that intensive searching' for salacious detail through these books, 'which appears to have been customary almost everywhere among the adolescents of my generation'. Harriet Shaw Weaver, discovered reading George Eliot, was dispatched to her room while the local vicar was summoned to lecture her on the errors of her ways; she rebelled absolutely and as an adult became patron and confidante of James Joyce. A 60 year old woman reading Barrett Browning's Aurora Leigh was sure her reputation would be ruined 'if it were known that she had looked at the poem'. Feminist novelists answered back. The woman reader is a subversive character in novels like The Story of a Modern Woman, where the heroine asks her governess 'what is a lost woman, really, Miss Brown? Dickens says that Little Emily is a lost woman because she goes to Italy with that Mr Steerforth. Was Mr Steerforth a lost man, too?' Controversial books like David Copperfield became talismans in the debate on sexual normality, women's independence, the suffragettes. Social history here meets political history; in Dickens Sylvia Pankhurst discovered 'the cause of the People and the Poor'. This is an immensely ambitious book which could have been a much better one. It is drenched in jargon but the writing is dry as dust. I wish Ms Flint would quote critical theorists a little less, stop worrying about metasexuality and readers' 'aggressive participation', and come out boldly with her own opinion. She avoids many questions about culture's relation to politics and morality, which still matters today, and too often she gets lost in a maze of forgotten bestsellers and unheard of memoirs. But other eclectic details - the effect of reading on 19th century nervous diseases; Edwardian guidebooks like Modern Marriage and How To Bear It - are compelling. Ms Flint's research is superb, and most readers, of either sex, will find her books at once fascinating and infuriating.</p>

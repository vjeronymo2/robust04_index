			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- The United States has  presented a compromise proposal designed to replace  state-by-state insurance licensing criteria with interstate  ones, Finance Ministry officials said Wednesday [22 June].    The U.S. proposal came in the latest round of bilateral  talks  on insurance that began in Tokyo Tuesday for a two-day run as  part of the so-called trade "framework" talks, the officials  said.    In the talks, Tokyo urged Washington to standardize U.S.  criteria on giving insurance licenses, describing the current  state-by-state criteria as a barrier for foreign insurers  looking to do business in the U.S.    U.S. negotiators involved in the insurance talks told their  Japanese counterparts that the federal government will encourage  each state to adopt common standards on whether to issue an  insurance license, the Japanese officials said.    Japan and the U.S. are to hold the next round of bilateral  talks on insurance next week in Washington to try to reach an  agreement before the July summit of the Group of Seven (G-7)  industrialized nations in the Italian city of Naples.    Insurance is one of the areas to which the U.S. gives top  priority under the framework talks, which are intended to  rectify the chronic trade imbalance between the two countries.</p>

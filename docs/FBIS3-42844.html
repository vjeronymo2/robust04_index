At this pivotal stage of Moldovan history a return to the  old  ways and the forms of the organization of society and management  of the economy which have exhausted their possibilities cannot  yet be completely ruled out. Reactionary-conservative forces,  gambling on the masses' fatigue from the inordinate  politicization of life of recent years and nostalgia for the  "replete" Brezhnev years and presenting as democracy the  arbitrary action in economic activity and the lack of respect  for the order established in society not without the  participation of representatives of these circles, are nurturing  the hope of exacting vengeance. In the absence of resistance on  the part of real democratic and progressive forces, which remain  fragmented and frequently in thrall to their corporate interests  and ambitions, the parties and movements of a manifest or  concealed pro-communist persuasion are endeavoring to make all  of us hostages of the times of stagnation, unfinished  undertakings, and their own ignorance.    However paradoxical, the conservatives are being rendered  the  utmost assistance by social and political organizations and  parties which appeared in the political arena following the  split of the People's Front. Having monopolized the right to  call themselves "democratic" and having pinned on themselves all  possible designations, they are essentially far removed from a  constructive approach to the accomplishment of the economic,  social, and political tasks confronting the people of Moldova  and are, as before, committing the sin of populism and  posturing, idealizing individual aspects of our historical past,  and remaining captive to their vision and understanding of the  events of recent years to the detriment of a responsible  approach to a surmounting of the crisis in which the country has  found itself.    The social and political reality of Moldova is manifesting  increasingly distinctly the main trends in the activity of the  following political formations:    1) right-liberal geared to the continued reform of society  and the creation of a full-fledged multiparty political system  and a market economy;    2) left-conservative endeavoring overtly or covertly, while  employing market rhetoric, to take the republic back to the  administrative-directive system and to the old forms of  government customary for the nomenklatura;    3) forces opposed to the independence and statehood of the  Republic of Moldova, both pro-unionist and pro-Soviet, for which  ideological orientation is secondary and is replaced by  posturing and outright populism.    Under these conditions the Liberal Convention of Moldova,  advocating further constructive and specific steps en route to  the implementation of liberal reforms, announces its emphatic  support for the progressive forces and its readiness to  influence the course of the election campaign in accordance with  current legislation with its own program principles also.    The recent decision of the Central Election Commission,  which  limits the Liberal Convention's possibilities of participating  in practice in the consolidation of the democratic forces,  leaves the LKM [Liberal Convention of Moldova] no choice but the  utmost and active support for the independent candidates who  share the program principles and endeavor of the Convention to  contribute by actual deeds to the continuation and  intensification of the progressive transformations and reforms  in Moldova and to an imperative nature being imparted to this  process.    While not questioning the right of the presidium of  parliament and the election commission to limit in this way or  the other the right of political organizations to participate  fully in the formation of the representative authorities, the  Liberal Convention nonetheless attributes these decisions to the  imperfection and immaturity of society's democratic institutions.    All independent candidates registered by the Central  Election  Commission, sharing the program principles of the LKM, and  prepared to contribute with real action to their implementation,  may call 24-07-04 or 22-61-43 to obtain additional information.    [Signed] Liberal Convention of Moldova Republic Council</p>

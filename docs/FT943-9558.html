			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: Foreign finance lines up at Mexico's doors - Nafta has sparked a rush to join the country's banking sector Foreign financial institutions have set their sights on Mexico. Some 61 of them, drawn by the North American Free Trade Agreement, last week submitted applications to open one or more subsidiaries in the country by the end of the year. The approval of licences for new banks, brokerages and other institutions would lead to one of the fastest infusions of foreign capital into a country's financial sector. From next to nothing, foreigners are likely to account for almost 8 per cent of domestic banking capital at the end of this year, 10 per cent of brokerage capital, and dominate the non-bank bank sector. The influx is expected to increase competition significantly in the corporate banking sector, the area attracting most interest. That should help to lower the cost of peso funding for Mexican companies, many of which are struggling under high domestic interest rates or having to fund themselves in dollars and face exchange rate risk. Officials reckon that international institutions will play a key part developing a more mature domestic financial sector. Mexico's derivatives and securitisation markets have been slow to develop because of regulatory obstacles, low liquidity and lack of expertise. By contributing liquidity and risk-management skills, foreigners should help such markets to become established. Most of the 20 banks which applied are active in offshore peso trading, corporate finance and lending dollars to better-known Mexican companies. With their new licences they will be able for the first time to receive peso deposits from Mexicans, lend money in pesos to Mexican corporations, and actively trade in the onshore foreign exchange and money markets. Mexican banks play down the impact of the foreigners' arrival, taking comfort from the significant barriers to entry in retail banking and their access through branch networks to cheap peso funding. With the exception of Citibank, none of the foreign banks that have applied is expected to target retail banking. But domestic banks, especially the larger ones, make a significant proportion of their profits from corporate banking and securities and money market trading. Many would appear to be at least partly vulnerable to an onslaught on these sectors - especially when the limits on foreign banking shares are scrapped at the end of the decade. While Mexican banks will enjoy lower peso funding costs than international counterparts, this advantage may be lost because of their inefficiency and the consequent need to charge high spreads, according to Mr John Donnelly of Chemical Bank. Some foreign banks believe competition in the corporate banking and securities market may become so tough that they will find it difficult to survive. Such fears have increased as more and more domestic banks have been approved by the Mexican government and financial margins have begun to fall. The finance ministry has approved 17 banks in the past 12 months, nearly as many as the 18 that were privatised from 1991-92. Mr Eduardo Cepeda, head of J. P. Morgan in Mexico City, says the winning banks are likely to be those which have been in Mexico for longer and have established clients. Morgan itself plans to employ about 80 people in Mexico as it increases corporate banking business, lends selectively in pesos and trades in the onshore foreign exchange and money market. In the brokerage sector, foreigners applied for more than the initial capital limit, and requests are expected to be scaled back. Foreign brokerages with a licence will for the first time be able to execute local trades, cutting out the often large commissions charged by local brokers. 'We will see more of the available business on the international side as a result (of the liberalisation),' says Mr Peter Norris, head of Barings Securities, one of 17 brokerages to apply. 'Obviously it does open up the potential to become an intermediary for the local market as that develops.' While some of the larger US brokerages and investment banks which have not sought licences - such as CS First Boston and Salomon Brothers - intend to continue doing business in Mexico as before, rivals which expect to open full subsidiaries maintain they will have a distinct advantage. 'Opening up a subsidiary will demonstrate to our clients our commitment to doing business in Mexico,' says Mr Justin Manson of Morgan Stanley.</p>

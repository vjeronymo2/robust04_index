			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COALITION AIMS TO BLOCK EXPANSION OF  LANDFILLS  </P> <P> A diverse coalition -- including environmentalists, representatives of local  real estate boards, a dozen mayors and U.S. Rep. David Dreier -- on Wednesday  announced it will work to block expansion of landfills in the San Gabriel  Valley.  </P> <P> "We can't continue to be the receptacle of waste for the entire Los Angeles  County," Dreier (R-La Verne) told the group in the City of Industry.  </P> <P> The meeting was organized by Dr. Forest Tennant, a landfill activist and former  mayor of West Covina.  </P> <P> Dreier said the group of more than three dozen opposes plans to expand  landfills such as the one in Puente Hills, America's second-largest garbage  dump operation. The San Gabriel Valley has four of the county's 10 working  landfills.  </P> <P> Dreier said the group will lobby in favor of proposals to haul trash on trains  to remote desert areas.  </P></p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (20): Threatened by their own success - Government concessions, spectacular marketing and anxiety about the safety of employers' schemes have helped to boost the sales of personal pensions. But the climate is changing / Personal Pensions AS A product, personal pensions have been spectacularly more successful than even their designers can have hoped. The latest figures from the Department of Social Security showed that 4.6m people held personal pensions, and the indications are that the number is still rising. For the life insurance industry, the main purveyor of the product, they have proved a boon during the lean years of the recession, with single-premium pensions business having risen by 45 per cent in the year to March 31. In explaining this spectacular success, analysts point to two key factors. The first is the introduction of government incentives, designed to encourage young people to opt out of the State Earnings-related Pension Scheme (Serps). 'These products have been sold to young people on the basis that the government is offering you a bribe to opt out,' said Mr Stewart Ritchie, pensions manager at Scottish Equitable. Indeed, the DSS's forecast of the number who would take up the initial offer of a personal pension, 500,000 at the most, was based on an assumption that no incentive would be offered at all. The second factor is the spectacular marketing effort launched by the life insurers themselves. This has been given a late boost by the collapse of occupational pension schemes controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell with over Pounds 400m of members' assets apparently stolen. This combination of give-aways from the National Insurance fund, enthusiastic sales agents and anxiety about the safety of employer-run schemes in general helped to boost personal pension sales to Pounds 5.9bn in the year to March 31. But recently the government has proposed that, from next April, there should be less generous incentives, limited to those over 30 years of age; while the antics of some over-enthusiastic pensions sales agents has turned a harsh spotlight on some of their sales claims, with consumer advocates singling out the product for special criticism. So the question facing the industry is whether the growth seen in the past four years is likely to continue; and, if not, how will the pensions industry adapt? 'It will still be a very strong area of growth, but not as strong as it has been,' predicts Mr Brian Sharp, secretary to the Association of British Insurers Life Insurance Council. Before personal pensions were launched, it was estimated that 10m employed people were not covered by any occupational scheme, and it was at this pool that the initial sales pitch was aimed. 'Now that group is fairly saturated,' said Mr Sharp. New business, he added, had come largely from existing personal pension holders topping up their policies, or from people changing jobs who had opted to place the transfer value from a previous pension scheme into a personal pension. It is these new sources of growth that have caused most anxiety among consumer advocates and regulators, who are concerned about the wanton sale of personal pensions to those people for whom they are clearly inappropriate. A protected-rights personal pension may well be a less attractive option for a job-changer, and should only be considered after the merits of both the former and future employers' schemes have been reviewed in detail. Those leaving with a redundancy payment, and who remain unemployed, cannot take advantage of the tax incentives of personal pensions. Helena Wiesner, a consumer affairs consultant, who recently completed a study of retail financial products for the Office of Fair Trading, expressed concern about sales tactics. She cited figures from the Department of Social Services for the 1988-89 tax year, showing that personal pensions were sold to 63,000 women who had no earnings at all and were therefore ineligible for tax incentives. Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, in recording a 77 per cent increase in complaints last year, singled out the sale of personal pensions for particular concern. It mentioned several cases of commission-based sales agents who had encouraged individuals to switch out of perfectly good occupational pension schemes into less desirable personal pensions. Like life insurance, personal pension schemes are frequently sold by sales agents whose salary is dependent on the number of policies they sell. And, like life insurance, sales procedures are subject to the same rules of opaque disclosure, which make it difficult for consumers to learn exactly what they are paying for. The industry faces the danger that dubious sales tactics from a number of agents will cause their general lack of credibility to rub off on the product as well. Meanwhile, the industry must face up to somewhat less generous incentives in future years. The cut in incentives, announced earlier this year, follows widespread criticism that the incentives cost Pounds 5.9bn more than could be saved from the National Insurance fund. The lower rebate from next April, together with the reduced incentives, will have the effect of encouraging people to opt back into Serps roughly five years earlier than under the existing rebate. While actuaries' calculations about the exact break-even age vary, the consensus is that men in their mid-forties and women in their late thirties have more to gain by opting back into Serps. Meanwhile, the personal pensions industry remains uncertain about whether it can count on the existence of incentive payments at all indefinitely. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats are pledged to end what both have described as a bribe. Furthermore, the Tory government's own intentions remain uncertain. While it is committed in principle to encouraging individuals to opt out of the National Insurance scheme, the method may well change. Indeed, the former social security secretary, Mr Tony Newton, in announcing the new rebates for the five-year period beginning next April, caused a stir when he said the government would look into age-related rebates. Larger contributions are required to a pension scheme as the member becomes older. Thus, the incentives offered to young people opting for personal pensions are larger than the contributions they would need to make if they remained in the state system. By the time people reach their mid-forties, the contributions required to a personal pension are far larger to obtain the same benefits offered by Serps, and they are advised to opt back in. The insurance industry has largely opposed age-related rebates, because they would offer too little incentive to young people to opt out of the state scheme, and older individuals are more likely to remain with their existing arrangements. However, Mr Ron Spill, pensions manager at Legal and General, a leading provider of personal pensions, has urged a sliding scale of rebates based on age, to encourage those who have personal pensions to hold on to them as they get older. That view has been echoed by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an economic think-tank, which argues that the present system costs more in incentives than it saves. While personal pensions remain a booming business for the insurance companies which sell them, they risk being undermined by their own success. The over-eager sales agent and the drain on the public purse from incentive payments could threaten the popularity of the product.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Nigeria hit by new currency regulations Nigeria's official economy is near to standstill following currency rules in last week's budget which fixed the naira exchange rate at 22 to the dollar and banned sale of export proceeds at the parallel rate of about 45 to the dollar, writes Paul Adams in Lagos. Banks and industry are unable to deal in foreign exchange until the central bank of Nigeria issues guidelines governing the rate and allocation of foreign exchange. The Central Bank of Nigeria yesterday postponed a meeting that was to have defined the rules. No explanation was given but some senior officials doubt that the bank is ready to regulate the system whereby it allocates scarce foreign exchange at an overvalued rate to the commercial and merchant banks with strict guidelines for their distribution to priority customers, mainly manufacturing and agricultural companies. The biggest casualty could be investment by multinational oil companies which produce most of Nigeria's 1.8m barrels a day. Oil accounted for nearly 90 per cent of last year's export earnings. The oil majors bring in between Dollars 700m and Dollars 1bn a year for existing operations. Before the budget, they exchanged dollars at the parallel rate, about N45 to the dollar, but the N22 exchange rate has doubled the funding cost of local operations. They are also suffering late payment by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation for its 60 per cent share of operating costs. Letters, Page 18</p>

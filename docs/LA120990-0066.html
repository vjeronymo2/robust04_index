			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INN ADVICE  </P> <P> Several years ago, you wrote an article about The Governor's Inn, 86 Main St.,  Ludlow, Vt. 05149.  </P> <P> I saved the article because of your favorable review. My wife and I have just  returned from a four-day stay at the inn. It was all that you said and more. We  were pampered and spoiled by the staff. And the food was outstanding.  </P> <P> THOMAS R.

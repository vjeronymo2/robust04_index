			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Athletes Decide To Get Into Politics"] </F>   [Text] A new political party is being set up in Armenia,  which will represent people engaged in various types of sports.    Speaking at the party's founding assembly, Karlan Torosyan,  an initiative group representative and chairman of the Ararat-73  society, said: "We have been told for many years that sports is  outside politics; life, however, proves otherwise. Physical  culture and sports are represented not only by the healthy and  the tough, but also by people who possess intellectual  potential, who can and should actively participate in formation  of policy and resolution of problems of socioeconomic  significance, and contribute to raising the athletic authority  of Armenia."    According to a NOYAN TAPAN report, the first congress of the  party will be convened in a month; it will approve the party's  charter and program and elect the governing bodies.</p>

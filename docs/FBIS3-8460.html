			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Serb Democratic Forum, a nonparty organization  for Croatian citizens of Serbian nationality, held a news  conference in Zagreb today. A report by Nenad Kocmur:    [Kocmur] The Serb Democratic Forum holds that the UN  presence  in crisis areas in Croatia so far has produced some results,  primarily in the halting of armed conflicts. According to Forum  Chairman Milorad Pupovac, no important political changes have  taken place in the field -- there have been no agreements on  cease-fire and demilitarization. Therefore, they are proposing  a number of concrete activities to be taken:    [Begin Pupovac recording] First, the presidency of the Serb  Democratic Forum believes that the UN Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR] mandate needs to be extended as long as possible in  order to avoid the renewal of clashes by disputes on its  extension which would create a stable time framework for the  resolution of civilian and political issues.    Second, agreements governing a cease-fire and  demilitarization should be reached as soon as possible. They  should provide adequate control of pink zones, of separation  lines, and the international political observation and control  of possible irresponsible actions.    Third, full opening of all communications must be secured,  both physical and commercial communications, which should be  under the UNPROFOR mandate, on which the sides should be  consulted, but are not expected to give their consent. [end  recording]    [Kocmur] The mobilization of Serb citizens into the Croatian  Army was also mentioned at the conference. Petar Lazovic,  chairman of the political committee of the Serb Democratic  Forum, stated that some mobilization drafts are unacceptable,  because citizens who do not have Croatian citizenship or persons  either under 18 or over 50 years of age have been receiving  draft notices. In that regard a letter has been sent to top  representatives of Croatian Government departments.</p>

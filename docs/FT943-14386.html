			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Taiwan resists demands to lift capital controls Taiwan has balked at US demands that it lift controls on capital movement and foreign investment in the domestic stock market as a condition for the island's entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Liang Kuo-shu, governor of the country's Central Bank of China, was quoted yesterday as saying that to do so would be to allow the US to dictate Taiwan's monetary policy. Because Taiwan is not a member of the International Monetary Fund, it is required to sign a special exchange pact in order to join Gatt. But Taiwan views some of the terms of a financial services agreement which it must sign with the US to gain US support for the Gatt bid as 'unreasonable', the Chinese-language Economic Daily News reported. Taiwan officials were in Washington last week to discuss the agreement, but refused to concede to US demands. Taiwan is widening market access to foreign banks to enhance its Gatt application and further its professed aim of becoming a regional financial centre, according to Mr Liang, who took up his post last month. Soon, non-resident foreigners will be allowed to open local-currency bank accounts. Rules limiting foreign banks from accepting more than 15 times their capital in deposits will be relaxed or abolished. And restrictions on the number and location of branches foreign banks may open are to be eased. 'We're not allowing foreign banks to do everything, but we are making it easier for them to get a licence and open offshore banking units,' Mr Liang said.</p>

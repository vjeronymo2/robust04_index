			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Worldwide shortage of glass to hit production of TV sets Some 10m potential customers for colour television sets or computer monitors are likely to be disappointed this year - because of a shortage of the right kind of glass. Makers of cathode ray tubes, the funnel-shaped electronic components responsible for the picture in a television set or computer display, cannot satisfy demand even though they are working to capacity. They are limited by the availability of the high quality lead glass used in making the tubes. Only a handful of companies in the world manufacture the glass. They include Philips of the Netherlands, Schott of Germany, Videoglass of France and several Japanese producers, including Nippon Electric Glass and Asahi Glass. Mr Wim de Kleuver, chief executive of Philips Components, the division of the Dutch company that makes cathode ray tubes, said world demand for tubes would be 160m units this year but that CRT makers would be able to produce only 150m because of the glass shortage. The reasons for the shortage are twofold: Glass makers cut investment in the special glass-making plant during the recession and are finding it hard to increase production to match demand, currently estimated to be growing by 25 per cent a year. A number of makers decided to take advantage of the recession for routine refurbishment and closed about a quarter of the industry's capacity. Now Philips is planning to spend about Pounds 10m to increase capacity at its UK glass-making plant near Blackburn in Lancashire, while Schott is collaborating with Nippon Electric Glass to build a new plant in Cardiff to supply Sony's Bridgend television factory. Philips is a major supplier of CRTs to television and computer manufacturers throughout the world. In the UK its customers include National Panasonic, Hitachi and Sanyo of Japan and Samsung of South Korea. In the meantime, CRT makers are seeking new sources of supply. Some are transporting glass around the world by ship while others are thinking of recycling old displays. This is regarded with horror by some manu-facturers because of the greater risk that displays could burst in use. Industry analysts reckon the surge in demand is unlikely to continue next year allowing glass makers to catch up.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Subsection 202(u)(2) of the Safety Act provides that IR&hyph;1 and IR&hyph;2 and any amendment to either rule shall be adopted without regard to subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code. This subsection thus allows IR&hyph;1 and IR&hyph;2 to be issued without regard to the Administrative Procedure Act's (APA) general requirement of providing an opportunity for public participation in the rulemaking process or, by implication, the Safety Act's requirement that an opportunity for oral presentation be provided where notice and comment are necessary. See 45 U.S.C. 431(b). Similarly, the normal APA requirement that a rule be effective no sooner than 30 days after issuance does not apply here. See 5 U.S.C. 553(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the enabling legislation suspended the requirements for notice and comment, FRA will consider written comments received on or before July 12, 1994. During this period, FRA will also consider petitions for amendment of this rule, provided that such petitions clarify the descriptions of devices addressed in this rule, or identify devices that perform the same function at least as effectively as those devices addressed in this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion of Comments and Section Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In IR&hyph;1, FRA solicited comments from railroads, lighting manufacturers, railroad employees and other interested persons regarding (i) the specific performance standards for the different auxiliary lighting arrangements detailed in that rule and (ii) the concept of ``locomotive conspicuity'' in general.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA received comments from the Florida East Coast Railway Company, the Union Pacific Railroad Company (UP), The American Short Line Railroad Association (ASLRA), the Association of American Railroads (AAR), the Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Railroad Corporation (METRA), the Long Island Rail Road, Canadian Pacific Limited (CP), the Quest Corporation, 3M, Flash Technology Corporation of America, the Norfolk Southern Corporation (NS), and the Canadian National Railway Company (CN).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After review of public comments, FRA determined that changes to IR&hyph;1 are warranted. The following discussion is provided in response to these comments and in explanation of these changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> A. Length of the ``Grandfathering'' Period (&sect;229.133(a))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Several commenters, including AAR, UP and ASLRA, requested that any auxiliary lighting system meeting the specifications in IR&hyph;1 that is installed on a locomotive be considered in compliance with the final rule for the entire life of the locomotive, rather than for only the four-year period specified in IR&hyph;1 at 49 CFR 229.133(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The enabling legislation specifically allowed a four-year period of acceptability for installed auxiliary lighting systems that conform to the specifications outlined in IR&hyph;1. FRA does not have the authority to ``grandfather'' such lighting systems beyond that four-year period. Furthermore, FRA does not want to constrain the content and applicability of the final rule to decisions made at this time without benefit of information from research and rulemaking that will be available and incorporated into the rulemaking process beginning in 1994. FRA will endeavor to apply a ``rule of reason'' at the final-rule stage to recognize the value of early investments in auxiliary lighting systems that were in service prior to the issuance of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> B. Activation of Auxiliary Lighting Systems (&sect;&sect;229.133 (b)(1)(iii), (b)(2)(iv), (b)(3)(v) and (b)(4)(ii))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ASLRA requested that the interim rule not reference the manner in which the auxiliary lighting systems would be activated on the locomotive. ASLRA is concerned that the language in IR&hyph;1 at &sect;&sect;229.133(b)(1)(iii), (b)(2)(iv), (b)(3)(v) and (b)(4)(ii) referring to activation parameters of auxiliary lights might be considered a precedent for adoption of similar provisions in the final rule without full consideration of the consequences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA agrees in part. Mention of specific activation parameters without requiring their use may be interpreted to imply that similar parameters would be incorporated in the final rule. That is not the intent of the interim rule. Activation methods or systems will be specified in the final rule as needed. Such activation methods could then be applied to almost any system regardless of whether the lights were installed prior to or after the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In reality, any system imaginable is capable of actuation by a wide variety of devices and at almost any time. The final rule may require actuation devices to be provided wherever necessary, without rendering existing lighting systems obsolete. Therefore, the specification for capability of automatic operation has been eliminated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IR&hyph;2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> C. Dimensional Requirements for Lighting Placement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (&sect;&sect;229.133(b)(1)(i), (b)(2)(iii) and (b)(3)(i))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Several responders commented on the vertical and horizontal dimensional requirements for the various auxiliary lighting arrangements in IR&hyph;1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The dimensional requirements for light placement in IR&hyph;1 at &sect;&sect;229.133(b)(1)(i), (b)(2)(iii) and (b)(3)(i) represented the best information available to FRA at the time of issuance of IR&hyph;1. The governing principle was to have the lights far enough apart to be distinguishable, preferably forming a triangle with the headlight, and high enough above the rail that they would be effective in snow as well as over vertical curves in the railroad track.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments and photographs submitted in this regard were valid and informative. Several locomotive types in common use present a problem with installation of ditch or crossing lights with horizontal spacing greater than 49 inches. CN, which has had considerable experience and success with ditch lights, has one type of installation with a horizontal spacing of 37 inches, and focused on the track at a point 800 feet in front of the locomotive. Other locomotives have horizontal spacing less than the minimum requirement of 60 inches contained in IR&hyph;1 at &sect;229.133(b)(1)(i). CN also has some locomotives equipped with ditch lights placed 91 inches above the rail, above the 84-inch maximum established in IR&hyph;1 at &sect;229.133(b)(1)(i). METRA, the commuter railroad in the Chicago area, has ditch lights mounted on cab control cars at a height of only 25 inches above the rail, lower than the 36-inch minimum in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IR&hyph;1 at &sect;229.133(b)(1)(i). Additionally, the flat section of the cab roof on some EMD locomotives might inhibit the installation of strobe lights spaced 60 inches horizontally.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Three-Light Triangle Dimensions: (New &sect;&sect;229.133(b)(1)(ii), (iii), (b)(2)(iii) and (b)(3)(ii), (iii))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FRA believes that the purpose of IR&hyph;2 would be best served by broadening the limits on acceptable placement dimensions to some degree. However, some minimum horizontal spacing of lights remains necessary to permit recognition of a characteristic pattern by a motorist sufficiently in advance of the approach of a train to permit timely defensive action. FRA concludes that the spacing requirement for ditch and crossing lights can be modified if the vertical dimension of the three-light triangle (headlight and two crossing lights; headlight and two ditch lights; or headlight and two strobe lights) is large enough to afford recognition by a motorist not only of the approaching train, but also of its general location relative to the crossing. If the vertical dimension, or the altitude, of the three-light triangle is at least 60 inches, it would compensate for a shorter horizontal spacing of the lower lights, or base of the triangle. The normal human eye can resolve two objects spaced to form an angle of approximately one-half of one degree. The orientation_horizontal, vertical or diagonal_is immaterial. Spacing of 60 inches subtends, or delimits, one-half of one degree at 573 feet from the observer, beyond which distance the lights are seen as one. This distance corresponds to an approach time of 6.5 seconds at 60 miles per hour.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 2. Horizontal Dimensions (New &sect;&sect;229.133(b)(1) (ii), (iii), (b)(2)(iii) and (b)(3)(ii), (iii))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FRA concludes that the minimum horizontal interval between adjacent crossing lights and adjacent ditch lights should be reduced from 60 to 36 inches, provided that, if the horizontal interval is less than 60 inches, the vertical distance between the headlight and the plane of the ditch or crossing lights be not less than 60 inches.

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Australian states join forces against reform: Hopes of agreement with PM Keating at talks today are slim MR Paul Keating, Australia's Labor prime minister, will meet the eight state and territory leaders in Canberra today in an attempt to revive moribund talks on reform of federal/state relations. However, the signals from state capitals suggest that agreement on fiscal and administrative reforms remains as elusive as when the talks broke down last year. Mr Ray Groom, the Tasmanian Liberal premier, probably spoke for most of the state leaders when he accused Mr Keating yesterday of taking a 'financially homicidal' approach to the talks. 'He is really strangling the states to death,' Mr Groom said. The gloomy prognosis contrasts with the rapid progress achieved after Mr Bob Hawke, the former prime minister, announced his vision of a 'new federalism' in the wake of Labor's election victory in March 1990. Among other achievements, Mr Hawke persuaded the states to reduce barriers to interstate trade, co-operate on transport reforms, and move towards mutual recognition of trade and professional qualifications. But the reform process broke down last year after Mr Keating attacked a deal to correct the imbalance between the states' narrow tax-raising powers and their growing responsibility for delivering government services. The solution proposed by Mr Hawke was to give the states a guaranteed share of federal personal and corporate income tax receipts to supplement the property and stamp taxes on which they rely for revenue. But that proved too much for Mr Keating and other Labor centralists, who saw it as a threat to the party's historical use of federal control of the national purse strings to determine social policy. Mr Keating has made some conciliatory overtures to the states since replacing Mr Hawke in December. But although he has won praise for his willingness to reopen negotiations, the two sides appear to have sharply differing agendas for today's talks. The federal government's priority will be to secure state co-operation for a series of economic and administrative initiatives announced by Mr Keating in February. Most of Mr Keating's energy is likely to focus on plans for the creation of national rail and electricity networks, and transfer of the states' ADollars 2bn (Pounds 800m) technical and further education programmes to the federal government. The prime minister also wants guarantees that the states will implement costly recommendations by a royal commission by investigating the deaths of nearly 100 aborigines in police custody. The state leaders will accept much of what Mr Keating has to say. But for perhaps the first time in the history of federal-state negotiations, they are presenting a united front on the need for urgent fiscal reform. The state leaders agreed at a planning meeting in Melbourne last month to continue pressing for a greater share of federal tax revenues, and claimed the states' ADollars 7bn debt could grow to ADollars 12bn by 1997 if nothing was done. Mr Keating will do his best to avoid starting an outright battle with the states in the run-up to the next federal election, due by mid-1993. But several federal ministers have indicated recently that the government is likely to tell the states to balance their books by cutting costs. The federal government may also try to divide the states by proposing changes to the fiscal equalisation formula, which attempts to maintain a consistent level of government services by transferring revenue from the bigger states to the smaller states and territories.</p>

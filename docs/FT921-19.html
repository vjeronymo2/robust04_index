			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / International Company News: Olympia &amp; York bonds attract bargain-hunters LONG-TERM securities issued by Olympia &amp; York, the debt-burdened Canadian property developer, are attracting the attention of bargain-hunters in the North American bond market. Real estate and corporate finance specialists at several Toronto securities firms are suggesting investors should buy any O&amp;Y bonds which come on the market at the deep discounts at which they have recently been traded. One parcel of bonds secured by First Canadian Place, O&amp;Y's flagship building in Toronto, changed hands at a discount of 22 per cent to par last week. The chief bond trader at one leading Toronto securities firms said yesterday that several other small transactions had taken place, but that not all sell orders had been filled. One corporate bond specialist said the O&amp;Y bonds 'are probably a good gamble'. Mr Brian Berner, chief executive of Berner and Company, a Toronto investment firm which specialises in securities issued by companies in financial difficulty, said his firm was preparing bids on behalf of its institutional clients. O&amp;Y has been caught in a liquidity crunch and is in the early stages of restructuring its debt. But the publicly-traded bonds, which were mostly issued in the mid and late 1980s, are secured by specific buildings. Besides First Canadian Place, securitised projects in Canada include the 690,000 sq ft Shell Centre in Calgary, and 240 Sparks Street, an Ottawa building occupied by federal government agencies. Several O&amp;Y buildings in the US are also securitised, including 55 Water Street and 58 Maiden Lane in Manhattan. The analysts who recommend purchases of the bonds are confident their value is more than covered by the buildings which secure them, even allowing for the recession in the North American office property market. According to one analyst, the value of First Canadian Place is almost certainly high enough to cover the CDollars 475m in outstanding bonds, even allowing for CDollars 100m in higher-ranking debt and the fact the building has a vacancy rate of about 20 per cent. He said even in a 'worst-case scenario,' in which O&amp;Y was liquidated, holders of the First Canadian Place bonds could expect to retrieve a minimum of 85 cents per dollar invested. In a report issued in mid-February, Dominion Bond Rating Service of Toronto assumed First Canadian Place's appraised value at CDollars 700m. There is, however, a cautious side to the interest in the O&amp;Y bonds. One Toronto trader said his firm would not quote prices to sellers until it had found a serious buyer. O&amp;Y's secrecy and its penchant for complicated transactions is also giving cause for caution. O&amp;Y has postponed a meeting due to be held in London yesterday with its bankers and participants in the Docklands Canary Wharf project. The meeting was to have been attended by Mr Tom Johnson, O&amp;Y's new president, and by its financial advisers. No new date has been set. Olympia &amp; York has asked an international syndicate of banks for a one-year extension of a CDollars 450m (USDollars 378.1m) loan which falls due tomorrow, writes Bernard Simon. The loan, arranged four years ago to finance construction of Toronto's Scotia Plaza complex, appears to be a key reason for the moratorium on principal repayments requested by O&amp;Y from its senior creditors last Friday. O&amp;Y asked the lenders to freeze its obligations until April 6, when it expects to present an interim plan to restructure its debt, estimated at about CDollars 20bn.</p>

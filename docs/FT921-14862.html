			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Fletcher King declines to Pounds 108,000 Fletcher King, the commercial estate agent and surveyor, saw pre-tax profits decline from Pounds 433,000 to Pounds 108,000 in the six months to October 31. Mr David Fletcher, chairman, said that while the results were 'disappointing by comparison with the corresponding period last year', they were 'slightly higher than in the second half of the year'. He added that the property market in 1992 was likely to remain difficult and that in the first half political uncertainty would exacerbate an already fragile market. The volume of transactions in the period under review fell by 18 per cent and as the value of properties handled also declined, turnover was adversely affected, falling from Pounds 3.77m to Pounds 2.68m. Earnings fell to 0.8p (3.1p) per share. The interim dividend is cut from 1.8p to 0.5p.</p>

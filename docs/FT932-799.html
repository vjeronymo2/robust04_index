			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / International Company News: Volvo carves Japanese sales niche THE Japanese market is an open market to be compared with any other car market in the world. The issue of whether the Japanese market is closed or open is a kind of a yesterday question,' says Mr Hans-Olov Olsson, president of Volvo Japan. So what is it about the Japanese car market which has kept foreign penetration to less than 3 per cent, while Japanese makers enjoy a 12 per cent share of markets in Europe and nearly 30 per cent in the US? In Mr Olsson's experience, the answer lies in the history of domination by Japan's domestic manufacturers rather than any current formal barriers. It is also consumers' high quality standards and the need for long-term thinking that challenge the western manufacturer hoping to penetrate the Japanese market. Local domination for decades has ensured that domestic companies have cornered the best dealership sites, making it difficult for foreign companies to gain access to the most important distribution networks. When Volvo tried to form dealerships it ran up against a system of quotas that officially limits the number of dealerships allowed in any given area of Japan. Such obstacles meant Volvo needed to make a large, long-term financial commitment to the market. In its years in Japan, Volvo has moved from a joint venture operation with a Japanese company to establishing a wholly-owned subsidiary in 1986. Today it has its own retail operations, which account for 30 per cent of sales in Japan. The bulk of sales, however, comes from independent dealers. These provide 50 per cent of the company's Japanese revenues. A joint venture with Fuji Heavy Industries brings in a further 17 per cent. 'We have spent a lot of money in building up a network and in developing products for the Japanese market,' Mr Olsson says. Volvo has also had to improve quality standards to meet the high expectations of Japanese consumers. In Japan, it is a basic condition that cars have to have automatic gear boxes, air conditioning, radio systems, electric windows and right-hand drive. Japanese consumers are hard to please. They do not accept bad painting, spills, dust or poor fittings. 'If you fail on this today there is no chance,' Mr Olsson says. 'This market is so demanding that if you fail you really fail. You really have to feel yourself a samurai and fight.' Volvo's rewards so far have been promising. In the past eight years, the company's registrations have increased from 1,046 cars to 8,628 last year, when sales fell in line with the decline of the Japanese market. In 1990, registrations peaked at 10,915 units. Volvo is aiming for sales of 10,200 this year. Mr Olsson believes the company's reading of the market was correct and that the current surge of interest in estate cars in Japan will help it achieve that target. In 1986 Volvo did not sell any estate cars. Today they represent 60 per cent of sales. 'Once you have built trust, I think you are rewarded. Then the Japanese customer will stay with you and support you,' Mr Olsson says.</p>

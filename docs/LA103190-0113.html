			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> SKINHEADS TO RALLY FOR METZGER AT PARK  </P> <P> City officials on Tuesday confirmed that a group of skinheads supporting race  separatist Tom Metzger are expected to meet Saturday in Central Park.  </P> <P> "As long as the group is not over 25 persons, we can't prohibit them from  meeting in the park," Mayor Thomas J. Mays said. He said that about 20 to 25  people are expected to show up.  </P> <P> The rally, by self-avowed skinheads, is to show support for Metzger in the wake  of hisloss of a civil court case in Portland, Ore. In that case, which was  decided last week by a jury, Metzger and his organization, White Aryan  Resistance, was ordered to pay $12.5 million in damages to the family of a  black man killed by followers of that organization.  </P> <P> The city first heard of the proposed rally from an anonymous caller who sought  information about use of Central Park. The caller said skinheads wanted to have  a rally for Metzger.  </P> <P> Later, a permit request was filed, asking for use of the park with sound  amplification equipment. The city denied the sound amplification request but  could not legally deny park access to the group as long as it does not exceed  25, Mays said. Groups larger than that require extra city services and thus  require permits, he noted.  </P> <P> Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg said officers will be on hand at the park.  </P> <P> "I have some concerns about that type of group coming to our park and what  other type groups they may draw," Lowenberg said. "The potential for conflict  is significant. And so we hope nobody shows up. But from a proactive point of  view, we have to be prepared. We will be keeping our eye on the area."  </P> <P> Mays said he hopes that people, including opponents of Metzger, will not come  to the park Saturday to see the rally. He said that an influx of curiosity  seekers or opponents of Metzger would only "add to their (the skinheads') crowd  and thus add to the attention they want to get."  </P> <P> Mays said that he deplores the race separation sentiments of Metzger's  followers but conceded that they have the constitutional right to meet and  speak.

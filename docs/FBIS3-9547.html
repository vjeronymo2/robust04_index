			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 23/3/1994 -- The Romanian  Government dismissed on 18 March, 15 mayors and 12 councillors.  Nicolae Vrabiescu, mayor of the Bucharest District Six, is top  of the list. He was elected to this position in February 1992  on the ticket of the Democratic Convention (CDR), the main  opposition coalition. Vrabiescu is member of the  Christian-Democratic National Peasant Party (PNTCD), the main  party of the CDR.    Grave infringements of the laws by authorizing construction  on land in public property, no due attention granted to payments  of sums resulting from leasing or hiring, that are part of the  local budget, were among the reasons given by the government for  Vrabiescu's demise.    The dismissal of the mayor of the Bucharest District Six has  been met with a strong reaction by Mr. Vrabiescu's party, which  calls it "illegal and abusive." The spokesman for the PNTCD  told a press conference of this party that the move was part of  a campaign "of denigration of the PNTCD, that has turned tougher  and tougher" and is likely to be a sign that "the ruling Party  of Social Democracy abandons the idea that snap elections would  not be opportune."    As for Mr. Vrabiescu, he said that the accusations against  him were ungrounded. "I shall ask to be handed the dismissal  decision and then I shall take legal action," said he.    ADEVARUL writes in its March 21 issue that many residents of  the Bucharest District Six are supposed to learn only now that  "Vrabiescu was a representative of the Democratic Convention, as  he made a name for himself not as a politician but as an abusive  mayor, who illegally leased plots of land and commercial space  in a district whose absolute master he thought he was."    Bucharest, Romania's capital counts six districts, each of  them with its own town hall. The city also has a general  mayoralty.</p>

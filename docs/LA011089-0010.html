			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNIVERSITIES AND TRUTH  </P> <P> In his discussion of U.S. universities, Pfaff has made the error of confusing  the movement for a more universalist foundation for a canon of knowledge with  his unease at the relativist approach of "postmodern" literary theory. While  the two may be related, they are not the same.  </P> <P> My particular concern is with his assumption that Western civilization is  somehow morally superior to other cultures. The very foundations of our  heritage in the Greek classical period to which he attributes the birth of  morality, were intertwined with slavery at home and subjugation abroad.  </P> <P> Moreover, this perversion of morality has persisted until recent times in the  "white man's burden" and "manifest destiny" of colonialism and imperialist U.S.  and European expansionism. This historical process included the devaluing of  the cultural content and legacies of the civilizations that are now known as  the Third World.  </P> <P> A critical understanding of our own Western history and how its conduct has  deviated from our ideology is essential to moral progress. It is also vital if  we wish to integrate our own citizenry from other backgrounds into traditional  U.S. intellectual life on a basis of self-respect and mutual appreciation.  </P> <P> A more worldwide approach to the study of values and cultural development  permits such awarenesses.  </P> <P> MARJORIE WOODFORD  </P> <P> BRAY  </P> <P> Cal State, L.A.  </P></p>

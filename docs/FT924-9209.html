			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Hanson/RHM Hanson's decision to pull out of the bidding for RHM leaves it in the awkward position of appearing definitively to have lost that magic touch with hostile deals. But its choice was not enviable. The agreed offer from Tomkins is certainly full. Had Hanson topped it, it would have been hard pressed to justify the price on commercial grounds. RHM's brands are lacklustre and Tomkins itself, as the likely acquirer, may find it has bitten off an indigestible morsel in milling and baking. RHM's ability to exact a price higher than that originally offered by Hanson is not a particular commendation of its rather feeble defence. It owes more to the fact that conglomerates still feel the need to scrabble around for the occasional deal, even though real opportunities are remarkably thin on the ground.</p>

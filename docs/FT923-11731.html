			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: McCarthy seeks new markets in retail link McCARTHY, South Africa's largest car sales group, and Prefcor, a mass-market retailer, are joining forces. The newly-merged group, McCarthy Prefcor, will have annual turnover of R4.5bn (Dollars 1.63bn) and a market capitalisation of R900m. McCarthy is acquiring Prefhold through issue of its paper. It will then sell some Prefhold subsidiaries. McCarthy, a mature business, is seeking diversification. It is joining Prefhold, a young group, to benefit from prospects in consumer durables and clothing. McCarthy, in which Anglo-American holds 37 per cent, is a doyen of South Africa's business establishment. It contrasts dramatically with Prefhold, which has a more informal management ethos. The deal also breaks new ground for Anglo because it offers it exposure to mass-market retailing. Anglo and its industrial arm, Amic, hold 37 per cent of McCarthy. After the merger, this stake will be reduced to between 20 and 27 per cent, depending on the degree of acceptance of McCarthy's offer to Prefhold. Mr Brian McCarthy will be chairman of the enlarged group.</p>

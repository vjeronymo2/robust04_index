			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / People: New finance director at Green Property In the space of six months, Green Property, the Dublin-based property investment and development group, has recruited its second corporate finance specialist from the Investment Bank of Ireland (IBI) stable, one of Ireland's leading fund managers. The 42-year old Danny Kitchen is leaving his post as a director of IBI Corporate Finance, to join Green Property as its new finance director. He will be replacing David McDowell, who will continue as a director on the board and as company secretary. Kitchen has worked closely with Richard Hooper, who last September retired as the managing director of IBI corporate finance and was immediately recruited onto Green's board as a non-executive director by Stephen Vernon, Green's managing director. Hooper has been involved in most of the major corporate finance deals in Ireland for the past two decades. Belfast-born, Kitchen was educated at Queen's University and went on to work for Northern Bank, subsequently joining IBI in 1980. He advised Green on its IPounds 42m acquisition last February of the Irish Merchant Navy Officer's Pension Fund property portfolio, which consists mainly of office buildings in Dublin's city centre, and its part financing through a successful IPounds 26.3m three-for-four rights issue. Vernon said yesterday: 'I wanted to take on someone with the appropriate corporate finance skills the company needs and Danny is the best man around.' Vernon has been on Green's board since 1989 and became managing director in September last year, four weeks before Hooper joined the board. His main experience has been in the UK property market. He added yesterday that Kitchen will now bring specialised knowledge of the Irish property and financial markets into Green. The company has 'ambitious plans for further growth and development,' he said.</p>

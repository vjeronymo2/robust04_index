			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 28 (TANJUG) -- Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday praised the opposition New  Democracy Party for supporting the idea of a national unity  government by joining the cabinet of Premier Mirko Marjanovic.    Milosevic said that the party had acted from patriotic  motives, rising above petty party interests. Milosevic was  speaking with the party's representatives whom he received on  the occasion of 100 days in office of the Serbian government. He  had first received Prime Minister Marjanovic and his cabinet.    After the meeting, New Democracy president Dusan Mihajlovic  told reporters the party had no reason to be dissatisfied with  the decision to join the cabinet. Mihajlovic said the party had  accepted the offer to join the Marjanovic cabinet because of the  latter's promise to work actively for peace, the lifting of  international sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro),  its reintegration in the international economic and political  community and the implementation of the country's economic  recovery programme.</p>

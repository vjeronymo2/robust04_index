			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Shigeo Mochizuki, vice minister of </F> construction, by Koji Oguni, EKONOMISUTO editor; place and date  not given: "Designating Bidders Is Not a Power But a Duty to the  People"]    [Text] Shigeo Mochizuki, vice minister of  construction, was born in 1935 in Nagano Prefecture. After  graduating from the Law Department of Tokyo University, he  entered the Ministry of Construction. After temporary transfers  to Ibaragi Prefecture, Hyogo Prefecture, and the National Land  Agency, he became Economic Affairs Bureau director general in  1988 and director of the Secretariat in 1990. He has held his  present post since July 1993.    Problems with bidding on public works have led to the  arrest of regional government leaders and top executives of the  nation's major construction companies. "The cause of the scandal  lies in both defects of the system and the way the system is  operated," said Vice Minister of Construction Shigeo Mochizuki,  whose ministry is in charge of supervising public works bidding.  Vice Minister Mochizuki was interviewed about bidding and other  matters.  <H5>  Problems of the System and Problems of Its Management </H5>   [Oguni] Recently, problems have been occurring so rapidly,  one after another, that you almost get the impression that the  entire Japanese archipelago has been completely contaminated by  the corruption of construction companies. What do you think of  the situation?    [Mochizuki] I don't have the words to express how irritated  I  am by it. I'm thoroughly exasperated. The majority of the  520,000 companies and 6 million workers in the construction  industry do their work honestly and seriously. With this kind of  corruption scandal, though, the entire industry gets criticized,  and that, the administration and I feel, is intolerable.    One other thing. Since last year we've come out with almost  30 trillion yen in economic stimulus measures. Most, though,  involve construction investment and public works that are to be  carried out by the companies that have caused the scandal. As a  result, the stimulus measures are not necessarily progressing  very smoothly, as can be seen at some of the [construction]  sites.    [Oguni] First, about the role of the Ministry of  Construction  as the supervisory agency for bidding. If corruption exists to  this extent, it means that, as you've said, there are problems  in the bidding system, as a result of which you're studying open  public bidding under certain conditions. In this process, what  is your main focus?    [Mochizuki] It's a fact that various things about the  bidding  system are now being questioned. However, I don't think that  [the problems with] the bidding system and the current series of  scandals are directly linked on an equal, one-to-one basis. The  reasons for the scandals are, first, problems with the system,  and second, the way the system is managed--in other words,  problems with the morals of those who commission and those who  are commissioned to do public works. The scandals occurred, I  think, because these various problems having become so pervasive.    Therefore, I don't think that the system is responsible for  everything, although, when you look at it calmly, it does  contain elements that contribute to the occurrence of such  scandals, and those elements have to be corrected. That is the  main focus.    In Japan, ever since the Public Accounting Act of 1899, open  public bidding has been the guiding principle on the books.  However, it has come about that, especially in cases where there  are special circumstances, a system of designated bidding is  used.    On the other hand, the contracts related to commissioning  public works are different than those for buying and selling  goods. When the contract is made, there are no products. The  problem is thus how to guarantee that what the commissioning  party wants will be finished within the work period, will be  inexpensive, and will have the desired quality.    Therefore, in a competitive system, the commissioning party,  to get excellent work at a price as low as possible, will choose  companies whose abilities can be trusted and get them to compete  against each other for the work. That, based on our experience,  is what has been found to be most appropriate. It's what the  central and local governments and the related agencies have been  doing.    Actually, after the war, based on a directive from GHQ  [Allied General Headquarters], Japan National Railways used open  public bidding. The result was terrible problems and a very  bitter experience.    Since the bidding was free and open, all kinds of companies  entered: ones with construction ability and ones without. To be  more precise, there were irresponsible companies and front  companies. Careless work was continually being done, so, to  prevent it, it was necessary to employ an enormous number of  supervisors and so on. In any case, it was a bitter experience.    And due to experiences like that, we have come to use  designated competitive bidding. That said, however, it is coming  to be seen, from these latest scandals, that designated bidding  has been conducted under the illusion that it is the  commissioning party that has the power.    Therefore, we have to rethink both the system and the way it  is managed. So we're studying a system of open bidding conducted  under certain conditions. However, the conditions would have to  be able to guarantee such things as that reliable companies got  the work and did it according to the desired specifications. The  conditions would have to be objective; no arbitrariness could be  allowed in. In this connection, we are currently attempting to  introduce a new contract system.  <H3>  The Bitter Experience of Interference by Gangster  Organizations </H3>   [Oguni] What I keep thinking as I'm listening is, Why did  you  go to a system of designated bidders? Vice minister, you spoke  in rather muted terms about the experience with companies that  didn't fulfill the required conditions, but still participated  in open bidding. To put it more bluntly, weren't those companies  gangster organizations?    [Mochizuki] Yes, there were those, and also paper companies.  To put it briefly, it's a fact there was a bitter experience  with ill-mannered companies, or company-like organizations, that  interfered.    [Oguni] Would there be a danger of that happening today if  you had a completely open system of bidding?    [Mochizuki] If we made the qualifications for participating  in bidding such that companies without technical ability--I'm  not just talking about gangster organizations--could  participate, the overwhelming majority of serious companies  would suffer and enormous confusion would result--which would  not be in the best interests of the country.    [Oguni] Even so, with a system of designated bidding there's  the problem that it's hard for new companies to participate  unless they make a considerable [preliminary] effort. That has  especially been the situation for foreign companies.    [Mochizuki] As you say, this is a big problem. How do you  tell whether a company is reliable? The easiest way is from its  track record. In the case of domestic companies, we can see  their total record--not just their public works construction,  but their private sector construction as well--so in that sense  our approach are not exclusionary.    Regarding the participation of foreign companies, though,  you  can't but doubt the logic of only looking at a company's record  of work done inside Japan when Japanese markets have been  internationalized. I think it is necessary to think about a more  flexible, realistic system for evaluating companies.    [Oguni] If it comes about that, in principle, the system is  open except for some basic standards that have to be met and  those standards are transparent, then the current situation will  change considerably, won't it?    [Mochizuki] Yes, probably. But I would like to emphasize  that  our position is not to try to bring about open public bidding,  under certain conditions, for all public works. For example, in  the case of regional public works, if you consider such things  as the policy for helping small and medium-sized companies or  the speed needed in recovering from a disaster, it's better to  use companies that are closely linked to the region. However,  for work like that which the major construction companies do and  which has become the subject of an international problem, I  think that open public bidding with conditions is better.    Looking at examples from overseas, every country uses a  bidding system geared to its particular circumstances. The U.S.  system is said to be the freest. England used to have open  bidding, but at a certain point they changed to designated  bidding. The other main European countries have a system  somewhere between the American and the British.    However, even in the United States, which is said to have  the  freest system, a company's qualifications are strictly  investigated. In the Japanese system of designated competitive  bidding, an investigation is carried out at the beginning of the  bidding process, whereas in the U.S. system it is at the end--as  a result of having submitted a bid--that a check is rigorously  carried out.    In Japan, we have been conducting, since September, open  public bidding on a trial basis with regard to more than 1  billion yen's worth of construction. To introduce it in earnest  in the future, though, we would first have to put various  systems in order. There's the problem of the registration system  and ranking, and whether the methods of accident investigation  and management investigation that have been used until now are  fine as is or have to be adjusted and made more transparent.    [Oguni] Then there's the problem of the way the system is  managed. In the commissioning of public works, doesn't the party  that gives the commission have an enormous amount of power?  Wouldn't it be possible to make a little more equal the  one-sidedness of the relationship between the commissioning  party and commissioned party?    [Mochizuki] It's just as you say. If there's not a  relationship of equality, then the contract between the two  parties won't be fair. Designating is not a power; it is a duty  to the people. As persons who use the people's taxes, we are in  the position of acting for the people when we designate bidders.  Therefore, there must be no arbitrariness involved [in the  designation process]. Otherwise, the relationship between us,  the commissioning party and the commissioned party, will be  one-sided.    To give an example, there's the problem of companies that  are  designated to bid, but come to not want to bid but still have  difficulty refusing to bid. In projects directly under the  jurisdiction of the Ministry of Construction, companies are free  to refuse to be designated, and the same goes for the  prefectures and the cities, towns, and villages. But if a  company thinks, "If we withdraw, then we'll be treated badly and  have trouble the next time around," it will not refuse.    If we place ourselves in the position that the act of  designating is not a matter of power but a duty, a  responsibility, to the people, then the system will naturally  change. For example, at the Ministry of Construction eight  standards are used when designating a bidder (designation  standards). Recently, those standards were made concrete and  objective. In other words, we should adopt designation standards  and make them open. In short, we have our own standards and we  will be bound by them.  <H5>  Lack of Transparency in Cities, Towns, and Villages </H5>   [Mochizuki] Recently, however, we examined the situation in  the prefectures and in cities, towns, and villages, and found  that some have designation standards and some don't. Only one of  every four cities and one of every six towns and villages has  standards and has made them public. We want this situation to be  changed. The Ministry of Construction makes its designation  process and the names of successful bidders public, but the  cities, towns, and villages don't; it's a bad situation.    [Oguni] Another thing. There is a "work completion guarantor  system" that provides that, if the company that was number one  in the bidding is unable to complete the work, the company that  entered the second-place or the third-place bid will assume  responsibility and undertake the work. But doesn't that create a  "dango" atmosphere [an atmosphere that invites collusion]?"    [Mochizuki] The bidders lower than second or third place  don't win because they can't do the work inexpensively, so you  can't expect them to stand surety for a company that can do it  inexpensively.    There used to be an element of mutual assistance to this  system; [guarantor companies] had a sense like that of a loan  guarantor who won't let a project be abandoned half way. Due to  the way the society has become, however, the system has  developed problems. Therefore, about two years ago, the Ministry  of Construction revised its policy of choosing the work  completion guarantor from among the designated bidders, to one  of choosing from a broad range of companies that are at least  the equal of the winning bidder.    It is said that the work completion guarantor is chosen from  the designated bidders in 17 percent of cities and 42  percent--an extremely high frequency--of towns and villages.  This is an enormous problem. But from the commissioning party's  point of view, if companies are ranked A, B, C, D, and E and you  have B-class work guaranteed by a C- or D-ranked company, you're  worried.    So in that sense, these practices are easy to understand.  But  saying "Choose the guarantor from among the designated bidders"  can promote "dango," and that has to be eliminated.    [Oguni] Then there is the problem of human relationships.  Friends who studied together in college, or perhaps had an upper  classman/lower classman [senpai/kohai] relationship there, go to  work, one as a technical official in the Ministry of  Construction, the other in a general construction company. Also,  when technical officials reach a certain age, they receive a  post-retirement appointment [amakudari] in a general  construction company. Because they've associated with each other  since they were young, they might not realize how cliquish they  are, but it seems to me that their relationships are a breeding  ground for cliquism. What do you think?    [Mochizuki] That view is often expressed these days, but for  me it's painful to hear. A person naturally values throughout  his life the people with whom he went to college. To deny it  would be untrue.    The point is, though, we are public servants, and we are  aware of ourselves as such. To behave according to personal  ideas and feelings--cliquism--is, in a word, impermissible.  <H5>  Using the Scandal as an Opportunity To Straighten Up </H5>   [Oguni] So you can't tell a friend what to do?    [Mochizuki] No, we can't. A system of civil servants cannot  function properly if a person uses his position to pursue even  the slightest personal interest, such as trying to get on good  terms with a company for when he golden parachutes out of the  government.    Until now, when an official from the Ministry of  Construction  has retired and then gone to work at a general construction  company, the company has had to sign an oath saying, "We won't  involve him in business related to government agencies." As to  what actually happens, however... Enforcement of the oath has  been a topic of concern.    [Oguni] Until now I've been asking about the relationship  between civil servants and the private sector, but there is one  other relationship: that between the commissioning party [civil  servants] and politicians. All things considered, [civil  servants] are in a strong position, but isn't the position of  politicians even stronger? Companies use various means to  influence politicians and make demands of them, which can result  in bribery cases. The one-party rule of the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP] has ended and the political situation has changed,  but what will happen with the relationship between bureaucrats  (civil servants) and politicians?    [Mochizuki] With regard to the work under the direct  jurisdiction of the Ministry of Construction, I am certain that  there is no intervention by politicians in the commissioning  process. We have a Designation Investigation Committee whose  chairman is not chosen in an election but is rather a civil  servant--the head of a regional construction bureau or of a  construction work office. As far as I know, the committee  members have never instructed the officials in charge of  designation to do this or do that. In particular, with regard to  the public works worth 1 billion yen or more (work for the major  construction companies), a committee chaired by the the vice  minister double-checks the work of the Designation Investigation  Committee. So the original plan is almost never changed.    Perhaps civil servants related to the commissioning of  public  works and politicians related to it have different standpoints,  although that's just a personal opinion of mine---because  governors, as well as the mayors of cities, towns and villages,  are both civil servants and politicians. So I wouldn't want to  speak carelessly about different standpoints. But, in any case,  what is important is having designation standards and having a  Designation Investigation Committee and establishing total  transparency.    This latest scandal has been taken very hard, and seen as  shocking, by everybody involved in commissioning public works.  These problems existed before the changeover to the new  government. However, the idea that it is time to straighten  one's collar--to fix what's wrong with the system--now needs to  become stronger than ever. At the Ministry of Construction, we  will get the views of people in all fields and tackle the  problems with determination.</p>

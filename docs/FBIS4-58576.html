			<p>BFN     [Text] Taysir Khalid, member of the Democratic Front for  the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] Political Bureau, has said  that, by all standards, the agreement between Israel and the PLO  is a capitulation agreement. In a statement today, Khalid said  that the formula of the agreement and its supplements consecrate  the isolation of Jerusalem from the occupied territories,  suspend the Palestinian people's right to sovereignty over their  territories, and give Israel the right to control crossing  points, borders, and foreign security.    He said that the agreement was not presented to the PLO  organizations, especially the Palestine National Council, which  did not authorize the PLO Executive Committee to sign the  agreement. He called on the Palestinian people to unite their  ranks and continue resisting the occupation.</p>

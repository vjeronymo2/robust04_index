He has appeared overly enthusiastic about his  mission, rash and reckless in his behavior and statements, and  unusually unbalanced. These actions have irritated the UN  secretary general, prompting him to strongly criticize Van Der  Stoel's actions and tell the ambassadors of the four big powers  at a meeting once that he knows Van Der Stoel personally, as a  classmate, and that he knows the man is "reckless and  unobjective."    This, then, is Van Der Stoel; reckless and unobjective as  certified by UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Ghali himself.  This is why Van Der Stoel has not stopped creating furors and  fabricating false allegations against Iraq.    This is not all Butrus-Ghali said about Van Der Stoel. He  also added: "Van Der Stoel thinks that Iraqi human rights issue  is the only human rights issue in the world!"    So why does this Dutch crow keep squawking and lamenting  Iraqi human rights, and why doesn't he also mention Western  imperialism's violation of these rights?    What is the secret behind Van Der Stoel's reckless,  unobjective, and unusually enthusiastic attitude toward the  so-called Iraqi human rights issue?    We the Iraqis, who have not appointed Van Der Stoel to  defend  our rights, and who refuse to have this reckless man as our  trustee, have the right to assume that Van Der Stoel has  received $1 million, or a sum close to that figure, from the Al  Sabah and Al Sa'ud families. We must assume that it is this  money that has made him reckless and overly enthusiastic to the  point of losing his balance and objectivity and behaving in this  irresponsible way.    It is also our right to assume that Van Der Stoel has come  under pressure from the Zionist lobby, and that it is this lobby  that is manipulating him and pushing him to cause problems and  make baseless accusations.    In short, we refuse to have this reckless and unobjective  character as trustee of our rights. Besides, who told them that  our rights need a reporter or a defender?!</p>

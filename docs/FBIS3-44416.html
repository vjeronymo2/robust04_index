In a relaxed and happy  atmosphere, provincial leaders, including He Zhukang, Gao Yan,  Wang Jinshan, Zhang Yueqi and Su Rong, and responsible persons  of some institutions of higher learning in Changchun gathered  here to attend a forum. When the forum began, Comrade He  Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, first  fully affirmed the 1993 work achievements of all institutions of  higher learning and extended festive greetings to the broad  masses of teaching and administrative staff on the educational  front on behalf of the provincial party committee and the  provincial government. [passage omitted]    At the forum, the participants spoke without any  inhibitions,  freely aired their views and felt that under the correct  leadership of the provincial party committee and the provincial  government, Jilin Province has witnessed a year of great success  in 1993, industrial production has been steadily developed, all  sorts of reforms have been unceasingly deepened, the society has  been stable and economic work has entered a new stage. Economic  development is an encouragement to the whole educational front.  What is touching to all is that the provincial party committee  and the provincial government have showed respects to knowledge  and trained personnel, issued special allowances to members of  scientific council and class masters of students studying for a  doctorate, and unceasingly enhanced the wages of the broad  masses of intellectuals, thus greatly encouraging the  intellectuals. The teaching and administrative staff of  institutions of higher learning across the province have based  on their own work, studied intensively, scored gratifying  achievements in scientific research work, unceasingly deepened  teaching reform, greatly raised the teaching quality, given  full play to the trained personnel and advantages of  institutions of higher learning and made contributions to Jilin  Province's economic construction.    At the forum, the participants respectively introduced their  progress in vying to join the 211 project in line with reality  and their situation in training personnel, building ranks of  teachers, conducting teaching reform, developing school-run  industries as well as their ideological and political work.  They also offered many suggestions on how to train personnel  that are badly need in Jilin Province, how to use the scientific  and technological advantages of institutions of higher learning  and their scientific research achievements to serve Jilin's  economic construction and talked about their personal views and  suggestions on the existing problems in the current educational  development.    On hearing that at present all institutions of higher  learning have a stable rank of teachers and good working  enthusiasm and that some outstanding personnel have come to work  in the northern province from the south, the provincial leaders  were very happy. They expressed one after another that they did  not fear of too many personnel and that they would like more  outstanding personnel to come and work in our province.    In referring to the importance of training personnel and how  to give better play to the role of young and middle-aged  outstanding personnel, the provincial leaders believed that this  issue is very important because it affects not only the  educational front but also involves the scientific research,  public health and cultural spheres. In the future, overall  consideration should be given to the personnel policy and  efforts should be made to unceasingly improve it. It is  necessary to formulate special preferential policies to mobilize  the enthusiasm of the broad masses of intellectuals. At the  same time, it is hoped that all participants would use their  mind more frequently and offer more ideas to jointly study and  solve this issue.    In referring to the issue of enrolling self-paying students,  the provincial leaders pointed out: In expanding the enrollment  of self-paying students, we must guarantee their quality, and  must not lower the educational quality in order to increase the  enrollment of self-paying students.    After listening to their briefings, Comrade He Zhukang said:  All of you have given very good views which will be beneficial  to the provincial party committee to further understand the work  of all institutions of higher learning. This year the situation  of the entire educational front has been good. Institutions of  higher learning across the province have achieved noticeable  results in deepening reform and raising quality, playing a  positive role in promoting Jilin's economic development. At  present, the international and domestic situations are favorable  for our development and the favorable conditions are many. We  must seize the opportunity and accelerate the pace of reform and  development of the institutions of higher learning. However, we  should also recognize the problems and difficulties in the  course of development, give emphasis to stability, unceasingly  improve and strengthen the ideological and political work of  institutions of higher learning. In short, it is hoped that all  of you will pay more attention to analyzing the existing  problems, do more profitable work and enable institutions of  higher learning across the province and educational work to  develop towards a higher level. It is hoped that in the days to  come, all of you will maintain ties and exchange views regularly  and exert joint efforts to successfully carry out all fields of  work in the province.</p>

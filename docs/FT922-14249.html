			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: New account sees share prices rally THE PROSPECT of a change in the complexion of the UK government after Thursday's general election failed to trigger any further slide in a UK equity market now regarded by many observers as already discounting just about every possible election scenario. On the contrary, the market moved decisively higher throughout the first session, stimulated by positive noises from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the securities house, in what is expected to be a three-week trading account of tremendous significance to the UK. The FT-SE 100-share Index, which dropped around 64 points over the previous two-week account, slipped smoothly into gear after an uncertain opening, eventually closing 18.2 better at 2,400.9. There was an air of uncertainty in the market at the outset after a series of weekend opinion polls continued to give Labour a slight lead over the Conservatives, indicating a hung parliament, possibly led by a Labour/Liberal Democrat coalition. The Footsie opened around five points lower, although the fall was easily accounted for by a number of the constituents being quoted ex-dividend. Wall Street's closing 15-point gain on Friday was seen as a stabilising influence and from then on the market moved quickly to the uptick. Dealers said good gains shortly after the opening came as the Footsie future embarked on a strong upward move, coinciding with keen support for equities from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. It was also pointed out that many traders had been carrying short books over the weekend, anticipating bad news for the Conservatives in the latest batch of polls. The Footsie, spearheaded by a sparkling performance from British Aerospace, after a Pounds 1.5bn cash injection from Saudi Arabia, linked with the Al Yamamah defence contract, and hefty gains in the oil sector, raced ahead to a session's high of 2,404.4 ahead of the opening shots on Wall Street. Turnover in London, however, was a miserable 411.5m shares. The Footsie faltered as the session drew to a close, wobbling as an opinion poll based on marginal constituencies showed Labour well ahead of the Tories. But as one top trader pointed out: 'There is scope for a rise in London from here. The market only needs a spark of good news.' He mentioned 2,300/2,350 as a solid floor for the Footsie 'even with a Labour government'. Outstanding gains in oil shares caught the market on the hop and were responsible for around eight points on the index. Demand was mostly US-sourced and European analysts remained unconvinced of a sustained upturn in oil prices. Mr Mark Brown, equity market strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the market was 'beginning to look attractive once more in risk-reward terms; below 2,400 the downside is limited in the event of a Labour government or an unstable hung parliament. There is little in the market for a Tory minority government or a coalition between Labour and the Liberal Democrats.' UBS concluded: 'The weighted average of five possible election outcomes gives a year-end Footsie level of around 2,650.'</p>

They have been  sent in after a series of armed bandit raids thought by the  Cameroonian authorities to have been carried out by Chadian  bandits. The attacks have inflamed the existing ethnic tensions  between Kotokos and Arab Choas in the north and hundreds have  been forced to flee the area. From Yaounde, William Wallace  reports:    [Begin Wallace recording] At least a thousand people have  fled into neighboring Chad from the region of Logone and Chari  in the last few days. Their flight, according to official  sources in Kousseri, the main town in the region, has been  caused by an unprecedented series of attacks on villages carried  out by armed bandits. Three days ago, the Cameroon Army was  called into the affected districts of (Blondjoua) and Makari,  situated between the banks of Lake Chad and the River Logone, in  order to restore order. But according to a local magistrate who  I talked to this morning, the situation remains extremely tense.    The fighting started 10 days ago when a group of armed  bandits attacked the village of (Kounze Akou) situated on the  River Logone which forms the border between Chad and Cameroon.  A bullet fired by the bandits reached the Chadian village of  (al-Deby) on the other side of the river, wounding one woman.  Members of the Chadian Army based there crossed over in a  pirogue [canoe] and, in an exchange of fire, killed four of the  bandits who, according to some reports, were identified as  Chadian rebels loyal to the now deceased dissident, Abass Koty.  Of the remaining bandits, six Chadians were said to have been  executed on the spot and a further 10 Cameroonians were arrested  and taken to Chad.    Following the incident, at least five more villages have  come  under attack, amongst them the Kotoko village of (Enganatia),  which, according to the local prefect, was burned to the ground  by bandits. When I asked the local prefect, Delphon Zono, if he  could confirm reports that fighting had broken out between the  long-term rivals, the Arabs and the Kotokos, he said that it was  not impossible but that today the area had been too risky to  enter and the exact motive of all the attacks was still unclear.    He attributed the conflict to the massive presence of armed  criminals from the area, many of them from Chad, but he did not  exclude the possibility that the bandits were being aided by  members of the local population. He said that those who have  fled the area in panic are from both the Arab and Kotoko  communities as well as Nigerians and Chadians resident in  Cameroon. The exact numbers of dead and wounded following the  attack have yet to be confirmed and according to local sources  many of the bodies have still to be found and identified. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Freedom Alliance considers next move South Africa's right-wing Freedom Alliance will take the weekend to consider a compromise offer made in constitutional talks yesterday with the African National Congress and government, but Alliance negotiators said the offer fell short of their demands, writes Patti Waldmeir. The offer would allow voters in April's elections to choose different parties at regional and national level, rather than voting once for one party to rule at both levels. The ANC made the concession hoping to avert civil conflict. Other items fell well short of Alliance demands: on regional autonomy, no new offer was made, though ANC negotiators made clear a readiness to move further on this issue, which is crucial to any settlement. There is intense dispute within the ANC on how much autonomy to offer. Talks must end by next Saturday, the day on which parties must register if they are to contest April's elections.</p>

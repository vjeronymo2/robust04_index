			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Money Markets: European contracts rise EUROPEAN interest rate contracts were a good deal stronger yesterday amid speculation that lower inflation in Germany could bring a faster pace to interest rate cutting, writes James Blitz. In comments made on Thursday night, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the outgoing Bundesbank President, suggested that the rate of growth of German M3 money supply was slowing down. Another Bundesbank member was also quoted yesterday as saying that German inflation could be as low as 3.5 per cent by the end of the year. Both of these statements had a direct impact on German interest rate futures. But the whole of Europe has received strong underpinning from a wide range of official moves and comments made earlier in the week. Both Belgium and Denmark have cut their key interest rates this week. Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the Danish central bank governor, also made a telling remark on Thursday, when he said that Danish rates no longer have to move in tandem with German rates and may decouple. Mr Adrian James, an economist with NatWest Markets, says that all these moves should be an example to other countries, including France, that high interest rates are not a viable way of keeping their respective currencies strong. The December Euromark contract rose 5 basis points to close at 94.00. The December Pibor contract was also very strong, closing 7 basis points higher at 93.83. However, the December Belgian franc contract was unchanged at 92.80. In the German cash market, the cost of call money rose to about 6.95 per cent as the month's tax deadline led to another liquidity squeeze. Traders said that most of the DM24.4bn injected into the market by the Bundesbank earlier in the week had been soaked up by dealers. Sentiment about interest rate cuts continued to be strong in sterling markets, helped by Thursday's unemployment figures. The December short sterling contract closed 6 basis points higher at 94.33. The March contract closed 8 basis points higher at 94.46. In the sterling cash market, there was also a slight softening of interest rates, helped by the swift despatch of an Pounds 800m shortage forecast by the Bank of England at the start of trading. The overnight rate of interest was quoted as low as 3 per cent at one stage. Three month sterling cash was more-or-less unchanged, however, at 5 15/16 per cent on the bid side and 5 7/8 per cent offered.</p>

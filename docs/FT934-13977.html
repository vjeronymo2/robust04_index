			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Trizec halts payments on debt securities TRIZEC, the Calgary-based property developer, has halted all payments on its debt securities pending the outcome of debt-restructuring talks. As a result, the company will not redeem a SFr100m (Dollars 70.1m) debenture which falls due this Thursday. Under proposals made in early August, Trizec plans to issue a combination of new equity and debt securities to holders of CDollars 1.1bn (USDollars 829m) of senior debentures and CDollars 292m of junior debt. Preferred shareholders have also been asked to convert their holdings into common shares. Trizec said yesterday it aimed to release details of its final plan by mid-November. An Alberta court last week convened meetings of all debt and equity holders for December 7 in Calgary to vote on the plan, which would, if approved, be implemented the following day. Trizec, which is North America's biggest publicly-traded property developer, is controlled by the Bronfman family, whosestake will be substantially diluted by the recapitalisation plan.</p>

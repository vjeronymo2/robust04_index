			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (3): Unique status in the market  -The Ecu THE European currency unit occupies a unique position in the foreign exchange market, having neither legal tender status nor any certainty over its future composition - let alone its future value. Yet nearly every major bank has traders buying and selling the currency. The last official volume figures relate to April 1989, when the Bank of England recorded an average daily turnover of Dollars 4bn equivalent. Volume of trading has now grown well beyond this level but remains below that of the major currencies - perhaps one-tenth the volume of dollar or yen trading, according to those active in the market. Ecu bonds have become a favourite tool for borrowers and investors. Last year, the value of Ecu bonds issued reached Ecu14bn (Dollars 17.5bn), making the Ecu the fourth most popular currency after the dollar, sterling and yen. This year the growth of Ecu bond issuance has been still more spectacular. In the first quarter alone Dollars 17bn equivalent of new paper was issued, boosted by large benchmark issues from sovereign borrowers, notably the UK, Belgian and Italian governments. Investors wanting to buy these bonds have to buy Ecus on the foreign exchange market, often in exchange for non-Ecu currencies such as dollars or yen. Equally, Ecus received as coupon payments are often sold in the market. The basket nature of the Ecu might be expected to moderate its volatility against currencies outside the European monetary system. To an extent, the Ecu is indeed more stable than the underlying national currencies. However, the D-Mark alone accounts for around 30 per cent of the Ecu basket. Currencies informally linked to within 0.5 per cent of the D-Mark (the Dutch guilder and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs) bring the total 'D-Mark bloc' weighting up to 47 per cent of the Ecu basket. For example, the D-Mark's rapid depreciation against the dollar during February and March was mirrored in the Ecu. From Ecu0.70 in mid-February, the dollar was valued at Ecu0.83 by the end of March. Users of the Ecu also monitor its market value against a theoretical value. Until recently the Ecu rarely drifted far from this theoretical value, calculated by taking proportionate amounts of each of the European currencies which make up the Ecu basket. This was because many banks employed arbitrage traders ready to exploit brief differences which open up between the theoretical value of the Ecu and its quoted value on the foreign exchange markets. However, the arbitrage trading relies on the assumption that the actual and theoretical values of the Ecu will eventually converge. This is no longer something that many firms are willing to take for granted. Many believe that the Ecu basket will soon be reweighted, changing the Ecu's composition and value. The Ecu's market valuation therefore reflects both the current theoretical value and a range of possible future theoretical values. Recent expectations of a realignment within the Ecu currencies have tended to push the Ecu's market value higher than its theoretical value  - as much as 1 per cent higher. This is a state of affairs which may shape the future development of the Ecu. For example, some proposals for the future structure of the single European currency have centred on a regular annual reweighting of the currencies within the Ecu basket. On recent evidence this would leave the foreign exchange market embroiled in a constant guessing game with the proposed European central bank. However, the popularity of the currency is clear from the performance of Ecu-denominated financial instruments. Just as the Ecu itself is overvalued against theoretical models, so Ecu bonds are far more expensive than theoretical calculations suggest they should be. For example, 10-year maturity large liquid Ecu bond issues are currently yielding around 60 basis points less than the theoretical Ecu yield curve - calculated from the national bond markets which make up the Ecu basket. Analysts explain the phenomena in terms of the political momentum towards economic and monetary union. For the first time, it is argued, investors seriously believe that the Ecu will become a single European currency. However, the value of the Ecu, at least as expressed through the international bond market, remains volatile. Ecu bond yields tend to rise sharply when the political or economic outlook is clouded. For example, the extent of economic dislocation in eastern Germany has push Ecu bond prices down from the peak of the market in early February. Volatility may be lessened with the advent of Ecu bond futures contracts, which give investors the chance to hedge their positions. The London International Financial Futures Exchange launched its contract earlier this year. The Paris future exchange, the Matif, has had a contract trading since October last year. The thriving bond market and the growing foreign exchange market in Ecu have led to the development of an interbank netting and settlement network - another example of a developing financial infrastructure. The clearing system was set up in 1986 and now has 45 participating banks. Interbank payments are first netted through the SWIFT system and then cleared through a special unit of the Bank for International Settlements in Basle.</p>

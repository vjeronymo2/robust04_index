			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Dunkeld returns to profits of Pounds 0.6m Dunkeld Group, the clothing manufacturer formerly Aitch Holdings, returned to profits in the six months to May 31. However, expected second half losses, due to trading patterns, should reduce this for the year. The new management said the turnround was achieved by a large reduction in costs and substantially higher profits by subsidiaries. Under its reorganisation 10 offshoots were closed or sold. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 626,000, compared with losses of Pounds 995,000 and losses of Pounds 7.32m for the year to November 30, which included exceptional costs of Pounds 2.86m. Turnover fell from Pounds 18.7m to Pounds 12m. Earnings per share came out at 0.9p (losses of 1.8p).</p>

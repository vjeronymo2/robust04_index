			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH VISIT TO DRUG SITE  </P> <P> Your April 17 editorial ("Bennett's Drug Plan") suggested that drug czar  William Bennett's drug plan should be focused on reducing drug demand rather  than punishing its suppliers and users. This reminds me of other vague  suggestions for reducing crime by eliminating its "root causes" (poverty  intolerance, etc.) We will never succeed in reducing crime (including illegal  drug usage) until we realize as a nation that the real cause of crime and use  of illegal drugs is selfishness.  </P> <P> Japan and other countries that have much greater success in this regard  understand that the basic cause of crime is not external circumstances but is  the individual's and society's response thereto. Once understood, criminal  conduct will not be tolerated by society and we won't be sidetracked by  never-ending attempts to eliminate its "root cause."  </P> <P> Prompt and reasonably certain punishment is the only cure for crime and is  always successful if supported by society.  </P> <P> GEORGE KINKLE  </P> <P> San Marino  </P></p>

Regarding the situation on the fronts, al-Jifri said the  southern forces have repelled northern troops who had been  trying to draw close to Aden this evening.    He added he had confirmed information that the southern  troops stationed on the Lahj front destroyed three (Doshka)  artillery sets, seized 16 other artillery sets, and took 80  northern soldiers prisoner.    KUNA's correspondent in Aden, confirmed that the northern  shelling of Aden is still in progress and has reached areas  close to the Aden hotel.

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / International Company News: Hutchison takes over UK port Hutchison Whampoa, the diversified Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing, has moved to take full control of Britain's Felixstowe container port. The company - through its newly-created Hutchison International Port Holdings - has paid Orient Overseas International Pounds 50m (Dollars 75.2m) for the 25 per cent of Port of Felixstowe that Hutchison did not own. Hutchison is the world's largest independent operator of container terminals. The Felixstowe deal gives it full control of Europe's fourth largest container port and one which handles 38 per cent of Britain's container trade. The company's main focus is on port facilities in China and Hong Kong. It owns 77.5 per cent of Hongkong International Terminals which is responsible for handling 50 per cent of the container traffic in the colony, itself the world's busiest container port. In China, Hutchison recently added a port development project in Shantou, a special economic zone in Guangdong, to an impressive list of ventures under way on the mainland. It is developing container port facilities in Shenzhen and Zhuhai, the two main special economic zones in Guangdong, as well as in Shanghai. Meanwhile, Hutchison appears to have opted for bank finance to fund its capital-hungry telecommunications subsidiary in Britain. According to local press reports the company wants to raise a three-year Pounds 500m loan for its Orange mobile telephone subsidiary, in which it has a 65 per cent share. The loan is priced at 55 basis points over Libor and is fully guaranteed by Hutchison. Barclays and NatWest Markets arranged the loan. Barclays owns 5 per cent of Hutchison's UK telecoms subsidiary and British Aerospace 30 per cent.</p>

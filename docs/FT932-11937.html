			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Leading Article: A last chance for Lloyd's JUST over a year ago, Mr David Rowland offered Lloyd's of London a blueprint for its future. Yesterday, transformed in the meantime from adviser to chairman of the insurance market, he started building. The contrast between the two occasions is striking. Last year, Mr Rowland's tone was optimistic: Lloyd's faced serious challenges, but, provided the market cut its costs, it stood every chance of prospering. This year, the tone is far more sombre. 'Many members have been brought to the brink of financial ruin,' he says. 'Should membership and market not unite behind this plan then Lloyd's may have no future.' There are other noticeable contrasts. The launch of last year's Rowland report was marked by a brisk dismissal of one of its central recommendations by the Lloyd's Council. This year, the Council is gone in all but name, overshadowed by an executive team that has done away with rule by committee. The plan itself is a far more drastic break with Lloyd's traditions than was envisaged in last year's consensus document. True, the central building blocks - lower costs, separation of market management and regulation, membership by companies as well as individuals, greater professionalism - are the same. But no one, a year ago, would have envisaged the centralisation now intended, nor the abandonment of the market's laisser-faire past. 'We need to protect Names from excessive exposure to catastrophic losses,' says the plan - a modest sentence which breaks with a tradition that made members and their agents solely responsible for judgment of risk. Competition case Mr Rowland makes no bones about the scale of the change. Competition - between underwriters, between members' advisers, between managers of run-off syndicates - is an important element of his plan. But it is to be competition within limits, ruthlessly suppressed where it is seen as inappropriate. Thus, administration of Names' affairs is to be centralised; computer processing is to be mandatory and standardised; claims handling is to be simplified and centralised; managing agents' fees are to be capped; and the weaker agencies closed or merged. Reinsurance practices that help individual syndicates but harm the market as a whole - such as those that fed the LMX spiral in the late 1980s - are to be banned. The market cannot be left 'red in tooth and claw' to do what it likes, says Mr Rowland, or it may bring itself to the brink of destruction. Members are, in effect, to be owner/franchisees, free to compete within limits, but not free to harm the nature of the franchise itself. Breaking free These are drastic measures. They may not be enough. As a future recipe for prosperity, they are dependent on the restored health of the international insurance industry. As a means of breaking free from the past, they hang on three unpredictable processes: the way US courts handle liability cases; the creation of a complex and potentially fragile vehicle to 'ring-fence' past liabilities; and the successful resolution of the spate of lawsuits that sets Name against Name and syndicate against syndicate. Lloyd's can do little to influence the working of the US judiciary. It is intimately involved in the other two processes, but its managers cannot guarantee success in either. Even if they carry out their part of the processes perfectly, either may be undone by the difficulty of reaching agreement between a large number of people with fiercely conflicting interests. Names faced with acute financial pressure as a result of the market's past excesses will find a frustrating contrast between the new management's willingness to admit the errors of the old, and its inability to summon up the resources necessary to compensate for them. That is, however, both a more honest, and perhaps a more realistic, response than Lloyd's has previously offered. Mr Rowland and his colleague Mr Peter Middleton have no illusions about the difficulty of the tasks they face. By making a break with the past, and setting themselves explicit targets and timetables, they have given themselves the right to ask for the support of the Lloyd's community in general, and the goodwill of the litigating Names in particular. If Lloyd's is to survive, that is the least they deserve.</p>

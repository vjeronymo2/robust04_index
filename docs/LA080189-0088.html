			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FIRES BLACKEN 70,000 ACRES IN 4 STATES  </P> <P> Blazes whipped by hot dry winds have destroyed 70,000 acres of forest and  brushland in four western states and are still raging out of control in many  areas, fire officials said.  </P> <P> Officials said they had nearly contained one of the worst of the fires, an  11,700-acre blaze about 45 miles northeast of Fresno in the central Sierra  Nevada foothills.  </P> <P> Investigators said an arsonist lit the fire that has burned out of control for  three days. It has destroyed seven houses, forcing some 2,500 people out of  their homes over the weekend and filling the area around the community of  Auberry with thick smoke.  </P> <P> A 5,700-acre wildfire in the Cleveland National Forest was also continued to  burn out of control Monday in a remote area of San Diego County. About 900  firefighters saved 13 homes and structures in the Cleveland National Forest  blaze Sunday, said a U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman, but a house and a trailer  were destroyed.  </P> <P> A 1,200-acre brush fire in the Sand Canyon area of the Santa Clarita Valley was  brought under control Monday. The blaze, about 30 miles northwest of Los  Angeles, had earlier forced the evacuation of 100 people.  </P> <P> Firefighters also mopped up a stubborn 10,500-acre wildfire that had burned  since late last week near Atascadero in central California, and officials said  it was expected to be controlled late Monday.  </P> <P> Lightning strikes ignited several hundred fires in Idaho, where nearly 4,000  personnel were battling blazes that have blackened more than 40,000 acres. Two  dozen buildings, including a popular resort lodge, were destroyed in the south  central Idaho community of Lowman.  </P> <P> In eastern Oregon, a 17,000-acre fire overran a state highway, forcing  officials to close it to traffic.  </P> <P> More than 11,000 people already have been assigned to firefighting duty in  California, Idaho, Oregon and Washington. Soldiers were called out from Fort  Lewis, Wash. to help firefighters who were already backed up by National  Guardsmen in Oregon and Idaho.  </P> <P> Forestry officials said fire danger is extremely high in the region because  much of it is suffering from a third consecutive year of drought.  </P></p>

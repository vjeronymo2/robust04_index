			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Lebanon plans return home for 350,000 refugees THE Lebanese government plans to move more than 350,000 citizens displaced by the 1975-1990 civil war to their pre-war homes, writes Lara Marlowe in Beirut. The proposal seeks to defuse Christian opposition to the holding of parliamentary elections before a scheduled Syrian redeployment to eastern Lebanon in September. The first relocations should begin within two weeks. They involve Maronite Christians from more than 80 villages in the predominantly Druze Chouf mountains and the region east of Sidon. Maronites have objected to the elections on the grounds that free elections cannot be held while foreign troops are still present in Lebanon, and that the failure to return displaced people would weigh against the Christians in the poll. People's right to return to their homes was recognised in the October 1989 peace accords, but the government has been slow to spread its authority. The government now promises to provide Lebanese army protection for returnees. Mr Elie Hobeika, the minister for displaced persons, is best known as the man the Israelis claimed led the Phalangist militia when it massacred hundreds of Palestinians at the Sabra and Chatila refugee camps in 1982. He is now responsible for establishing co-ordinating committees in the villages to be repopulated. The government has not said how it will finance the operation, or what will happen to those who have moved into the homes of the displaced. The director-general of the Ministry of Housing recently estimated the cost of rebuilding nearly 87,000 destroyed homes at more than Dollars 750m (Pounds 393m) and said another Dollars 1.6bn would be needed for new housing.</p>

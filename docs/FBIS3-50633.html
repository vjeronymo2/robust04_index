			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Tuxtla Gutierrez (Mexico), 4 Jan (EFE) --  Military sources have disclosed that clashes between the Armed  Forces and the Zapata National Liberation Army (EZLN) increased  in recent hours near Ocosingo, in Chiapas, as the rebels are  drawing closer to the capital of this state in southern Mexico.    According to unofficial reports, at least 200 people were  killed in the fighting but it is estimated that there could be  more bodies scattered in jungle areas and in the cities, but  access to these sites have been denied to reporters. The  Mexican Army closed the roads that link Tuxtla Gutierrez, the  capital of Chiapas, with San Cristobal de las Casas -- where the  insurrection began on Saturday -- because the rebels are  approximately 16 km from Tuxtla Gutierrez, military sources told  EFE.    The Armed Forces established a general headquarters outside  Tuxtla Gutierrez and are keeping all entry into the city under  very close surveillance. In addition, these forces are totally  occupying Chiapa de Corzo, one of the main tourist zones, which  the rebels could use to enter the area.    Sources close to the Army noted that 25 rebels were captured  and that "Commander Marcos" (who headed the attack on San  Cristobal de las Casas) could be among them. [passage omitted]</p>

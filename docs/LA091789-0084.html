			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASY START FOR TITANS IS MIRAGE  </P> <P> The last time Earle Bruce won a football game as a Division I coach, he beat  Michigan in his Ohio State farewell, the Saturday after he was fired.  </P> <P> There won't be another one like that as long as he lives, but Bruce got one  with a bit of sweetness to it Saturday, guiding Colorado State to its first  victory in his three-game tenure as coach by beating Cal State Fullerton,  42-14, in front of 20,098 at Hughes Stadium.  </P> <P> Colorado State lost on the road to two nationally ranked teams, Tennessee and  Colorado, in its first two games.  </P> <P> The Rams took a 14-point halftime lead but saw Fullerton trim it to seven in  the third quarter before breaking open the game with three fourth-quarter  touchdowns.  </P> <P> "I'm really pleased with our first win," said Bruce, who was fired at Ohio  State in 1987 and coached at Division I-AA Northern Iowa last year. "That's the  way we want to do it."  </P> <P> It was not at all the way Fullerton wanted to do it. The Titans committed seven  turnovers, including four interceptions by starting quarterback Dan Speltz and  a fumbled punt reception at their own 16-yard line that quickly became a Ram  touchdown.  </P> <P> "When you've got a mediocre team and you turn the ball over seven times, you  don't expect to win," Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said. "I don't care if it's  football, baseball or dominoes."  </P> <P> With the Titans' help, Colorado State rolled to only its third victory in the  past 27 games.  </P> <P> Saturday's victory broke a six-game losing streak dating to Oct. 22, 1988, when  the Rams beat San Diego State. Before that victory, the Rams had lost 11  straight.  </P> <P> They had not scored so many points since the third game of the 1986 season.  </P> <P> Fullerton now must contemplate a nonconference season that has gone awry.  </P> <P> The Titans were fortunate enough this season to get a break in a brutal  nonconference schedule that has included Florida, Louisiana State, West  Virginia and Wyoming in recent years and will include Auburn and Georgia in the  next two.  </P> <P> This year, the Titans had four opponents who combined to go 17-27 last season.  A 4-0 start seemed possible; 3-1 would have been acceptable. But after three  games, the Titans are 1-2, with the only victory a come-from-behind victory  over Division II Cal State Northridge.  </P> <P> The Titans lost to Northern Illinois in their opener, and will finish the  nonconference season against San Diego State Saturday.  </P> <P> "I guess the objective of any head football coach is to win every game you  play, but if you don't win, you expect to get better as a football team,"  Murphy said. "We got better individually today, but I don't think we got better  as a team."  </P> <P> Todd Yert, a Mission Viejo High School product, scored four touchdowns, all  from three yards out or less, tying a Titan record he set two years ago.  </P></p>

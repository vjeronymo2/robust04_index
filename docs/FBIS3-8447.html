President  Michal Kovac and Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar were also  present. Peter Weiss, the parliament's deputy speaker, has  informed us about the meeting's results:    [Begin Weiss recording] The cross-party standing committee  has met on my initiative. I based it on the final part of the  president's speech on the need to seek ways toward national and  political conciliation, healing political wounds, easing the  atmosphere of confrontation, and creating peaceful conditions  for early elections.    On the basis of this initiative, a meeting was held in the  presence of both the president and the prime minister.  Representatives of all parliamentary parties and movements were  there. Various proposals were presented there for the creation  of a broad coalition government--also by the president and  myself.    It must be said that the prime minister explicitly rejected  the idea of a broad coalition government until early elections  are held. The atmosphere that arose there was more likely to  lead to a new confrontation than to a constructive dialogue.  That is, the prime minister showed unwillingness to seek a  solution that would be generally acceptable. [end recording]</p>

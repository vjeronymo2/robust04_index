			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CURT BYRUM LEADS BY ONE AT COAL VALLEY  </P> <P> Curt Byrum, looking for his first victory in seven years on the PGA Tour, beat  the wind and rain to finish with a three-under-par 67 Friday and take the  second-round lead in the Hardee's golf tournament at Coal Valley, Ill.  </P> <P> Byrum finished just before a storm hit the Oakwood Country Club course.  </P> <P> The foul weather, a constant on the tour this year, caused play to be suspended  for more than an hour in the late afternoon. Showers also delayed the start of  the round for an hour.  </P> <P> Byrum's total of seven-under-par 133 put him a stroke ahead of defending  champion Blaine McCallister and Greg Ladehoff.  </P> <P> McCallister shot a 69, his sixth straight subpar round in this tournament,  while Ladehoff had a 65.  </P> <P> Amy Alcott just missed an eagle at the 18th hole, then settled for par, a  four-under-par 68 and a share of the lead with Penny Hammel, Shirley Furlong  and Cathy Marino after two rounds of the LPGA's Boston Five tournament at  Danvers, Mass.  </P> <P> Hammel shot a 69, Furlong a 66 and Marino a 67.  </P> <P> All were at eight-under-par 136, one stroke ahead of Beth Daniel and two ahead  of Kathy Postlewait and Cindy Rarick.  </P> <P> Alcott, seeking her 28th victory in 15 years on the tour but winless so far  this year, had cleared a large pond and was about 30 yards from the cup in two  shots on the 485-yard, par-five final hole. Her pitch hit the pin, then the cup  but rolled about six feet away. She missed the putt that would have given her a  one-stroke lead.  </P> <P> Chick Evans, a last-minute entry, birdied six straight holes on the back nine  for a six-under-par 66 and a share of the first-round lead with Dick Rhyan in  the first Ameritech Senior Open at Cleveland.  </P> <P> Evans did not find out he was playing until Bob Goalby dropped out Tuesday  night.  </P> <P> Former Masters champion Charles Coody and South African Harold Henning were one  shot back at 67, while Larry Mowry, 1964 PGA champion Bobby Nichols and Jimmy  Powell were at 68.  </P></p>

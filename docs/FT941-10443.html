			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: German company takes 25 per cent share in Polish brewery Brau und Brunen, a leading German brewing and soft drink company, has taken a 25 per cent share in Okocim, a listed Polish brewery with about 8 per cent market share and a high profile brand name, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. Okocim was told by Brau and Brunen of the share purchase last week. The news surprised the industry which has seen the government barring foreign investors from brewing privatisations. Changes in Poland's securities laws which come into force next week bring the point at which share purchases have to be referred to the securities commission and the anti-monopoly board down from 33 per cent to 25 per cent. A purchase of 33 per cent would trigger a mandatory bid for Okocim's remaining equity. However, Brau and Brunen has said it did not intend to increase its share above the 25 per cent which cost the German company an estimated Dollars 20m.</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: In no man's land - neither a hard discounter nor superstore / A look at Kwik Save amid fears that it may be hard hit in the supermarket price war It is one of the ironies of retailing that Kwik Save, for so long one of the UK's cheapest supermarket chains, is facing fears that it may be one of the hardest hit by the latest supermarket price war. On the face of it, all is well at the 810-store discount chain, with Kwik Save forecast today to announce a rise in full-year pre-tax profits from Pounds 110.6m to about Pounds 125m. Its share price has also held its value rather better this year than those of the superstore chains. But while the most recent slide in the shares of the biggest chains, which began after Sainsbury cut the price of 300 own-label products, has abated, the downwards spiral has continued at Kwik Save. Its shares have lost almost 10 per cent in the last three weeks. That might seem puzzling, since Kwik Save virtually invented 'hard' discounting - selling a limited range off narrow margins at very low prices in no-frills shops - in the UK. Its founders developed their first supermarket, Value Foods, at Prestatyn in North Wales in 1962. Renamed Kwik Save in 1965, the chain was modelled on the pioneer of discounting in Europe, Germany's Aldi. It developed a potent formula which outlasted would-be rivals such as Victor Value and Pricerite, and has enjoyed both the highest returns on capital - at close to 40 per cent - and the fastest underlying sales growth in the industry. However, fears now surfacing in the City centre on a strategic decision Kwik Save made in 1988 to expand its range from about 600 to about 2,500 product lines. That was made possible by investment in new computer systems linked to laser-scanning at the check-outs. The move, say critics, has slowed Kwik Save's stock turn, pushed up costs, and left it no longer able to offer the keenest prices. They fear Kwik Save has wandered into 'no man's land', where it is neither a hard discounter, nor a superstore. Competition is stiffening at both ends of the market. At one end, Kwik Save faces competition from a new generation of fast-expanding hard discounters. Ironically, one of these is Aldi, inspiration for Kwik Save in the 1960s, while another is Shoprite, set up by the son of one of the co-founders of Kwik Save. These stick more faithfully to the original discounting principle of carrying only 600 to 1,000 lines. At the other end of the spectrum, market leader Sainsbury has cut the prices of basic goods to a level where they compete with the discounters, and Tesco, the UK's number two, has launched its Tesco Value line of low-priced basics. Safeway is cutting prices too. Kwik Save counters that it is not in danger of losing sales in either direction, as its introduction of new technology allowed it to extend its range without sacrificing its edge on price. It claims it can match or beat the prices of the hard discounters while offering up to three times as many items. Moreover, it argues that the expansion of range by the big supermarket operators through the 1980s from about 4,000 lines to more than 15,000 raised customers' expectations about the number of products they should find even in a discount store. Kwik Save says it is alone among discounters in meeting those expectations. City analysts dispute this, however, claiming that Kwik Save has resorted to tactical pricing, lowering its prices in areas where it competes directly with a hard discounter, and so sacrificing margins. One claimed last week that Kwik Save was even having to lower prices to compete with the superstores. Kwik Save's other counter-argument is that it is under-represented in several parts of the country, particularly south-east England and Scotland. It is opening up to 80 new stores a year, at an average cost of less than Pounds 1m per store - against about Pounds 20m for a large superstore - all funded organically. In spite of its expansion plans, Kwik Save could be facing a slow-down in profits growth, and a squeeze on its margins. While some analysts have kept their forecast for next year's profits at about Pounds 145m to Pounds 150m, others have dropped them as low as Pounds 128m. The operating margin is forecast to drop from more than 5 per cent in the late 1980s to below 4 per cent next year. The pressure is now on Mr Graeme Bowler, who replaced Mr Graeme Seabrook as managing director in June and gives his first results presentation tomorrow. As a former managing director of Franklins, a hard discounter in Australia, some analysts expect him to be a more aggressive retailer than his predecessor. They will be listening hard for any indications that Kwik Save may trim its range to improve prices and move back towards its hard discounting roots.</p>

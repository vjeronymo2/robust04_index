			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: DUARTE;  </P> <P> SKATEBOARD BAN AT CITY HALL  </P> <P> Skateboarders will be banned from the City Hall complex, under an ordinance  adopted by the City Council on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The ban is intended to save curbs, steps and handrails from abuse by youths who  turn the complex into a skateboard park on weekends, said Assistant City  Manager Manuel Ontal. Steps have been chipped, and wide handrails have been  damaged by skateboarders who use them as ramps, he said.  </P> <P> The ordinance, which takes effect in 30 days, imposes a $100-fine for a  first-time offense and a $200-fine if it is repeated within a year. The  skateboard would also be confiscated until it is no longer needed as evidence.  </P></p>

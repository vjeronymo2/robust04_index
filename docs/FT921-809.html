			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Buoyant sales leave Wellcome 35% ahead WELLCOME, the UK pharma-ceuticals group, yesterday reported pre-tax profits up 34.8 per cent from Pounds 181m to Pounds 244m for the six months to February 29. Mr John Robb, chief executive, said the past two years' results were as near outstanding as any he had achieved with any company. Turnover at the prescription and consumer healthcare businesses reached Pounds 812m for the first six months, an increase of 27 per cent. Sales at non-continuing and other businesses were Pounds 79m, bringing the group's turnover to Pounds 891m compared with Pounds 731m. Exchange rate movements increased sales by 6 per cent and pre-tax profits by 11 per cent, said Mr John Precious, finance director. He warned, however, that exchange rate benefits were unlikely to be as significant during the second six months. The tax charge was also likely to increase for the full year by 1 percentage point to 37.5 per cent. Sales of Zovirax, the herpes and chicken-pox drug, were up 34 per cent to Pounds 278m. Those for Retrovir, the Aids treatment, rose 31 per cent to Pounds 103m. The strong dollar helped the figures, but underlying growth for the two products was 26 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively. Profits from other patented products increased from Pounds 77m to Pounds 87m. Price increases, mainly in the US, represented only 3 per cent of underlying sales growth of 21 per cent at the pharmaceutical operations. Sales of consumer health products rose 32 per cent from Pounds 94m to Pounds 125m. Mr Robb said he viewed long-term growth of this business as one of the group's strategic aims. Operating margins improved 2.4 points to 26.7 per cent. Mr Robb said a margin of 30 per cent was a realistic objective but declined to say when it might be achieved. The improvement so far had been achieved through the disposal of low-margin businesses, a continued drive on costs and a change in sales mix to higher margin products. Cost of sales fell from 24.8 per cent of turnover to 22.6 per cent. The sale of the environmental health and diagnostic businesses resulted in a net loss of Pounds 42m, said Mr Precious. Research and development spending increased 23 per cent from Pounds 103m to Pounds 127m, or 18 per cent at constant exchange rates. Earnings per share increased 33 per cent to 17.5p against 13.2p. The dividend was 4p, an increase from 3p. Lex, Page 20</p>

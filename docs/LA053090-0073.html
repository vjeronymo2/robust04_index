			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLE WATCH  </P> <P> Henson Film Applauded: The late Muppet creator Jim Henson's movie "The  Witches," about a dastardly scheme to turn children into mice, won him  posthumous plaudits Thursday from London critics.  </P> <P> The movie stars Anjelica Huston as the head witch. "It leaves us a testament to  the glory that was Jim Henson," Nigel Andrews wrote in the Financial Times.  Annabel Llywelyn-Cowper, who described herself as high priestess of two English  covens, wrote in the Independent that the film's effects were admirable but  that it perpetuated the "tired old theme (of) the witch as loathsome creature  hellbent on destroying young lives." It opens in the United States in the fall.  GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

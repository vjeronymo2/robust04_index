			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: ConsPress takes 8.27% stake in Westpac Banking CONSOLIDATED Press Holdings (ConsPress), Mr Kerry Packer's privately-owned publishing group, yesterday emerged as the buyer of an 8.27 per cent stake in Westpac Banking Corporation, the troubled Australian bank. The shareholding, worth ADollars 434m (USDollars 299.3m) at last night's closing price of ADollars 2.99, is close to the 10 per cent ceiling placed on individual shareholdings by Westpac's deed of settlement and federal banking law. ConsPress could move to 15 per cent ownership of Westpac, but only with the approval of both the board and Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer (finance minister). Mr Packer, who is travelling abroad, was not available for comment. Mr Al Dunlap, managing director of ConsPress, said Westpac was 'a very good company, with great potential'. Mr John Uhrig, Westpac chairman, said the bank was very pleased to have Mr Packer as a shareholder. He said the ConsPress holding would add stability to the share register. Mr Packer was also welcomed by the AMP Society, Australia's biggest financial institution, which owns 15 per cent of Westpac. Mr Ian Salmon, managing director, said Westpac was 'a strong company with an excellent future, and it is pleasing that Mr Packer shares that view'. ConsPress said it had acquired the rights to 145.16m Westpac shares since it began buying in mid-October. The stake comprises 4.61 per cent of Westpac's ordinary shares and 3.66 per cent in the form of options. Buying by ConsPress pushed Westpac shares briefly above ADollars 3 yesterday, for the first time in two months. The shares fell back in later trading to close 1 cent higher on the day. ConsPress has been rumoured to be acquiring Westpac shares since the failure in October of the bank's ADollars 1.72bn rights issue. The issue closed 72 per cent undersubscribed, leaving many sub-underwriters holding unwanted shares. Analysts said Mr Packer's investment was likely to provide a significant lift for the shares, which fell to a low of about ADollars 2.65 last week after the group announced a record net loss of ADollars 1.5bn for the year to September. The shares were trading at about ADollars 4.50 at the start of the year. ConsPress gave no indication of its motives in buying Westpac shares. Analysts said Mr Packer would probably seek a seat on the board, but would be prevented from seeking control by the law and the bank's deed of settlement. Mr Packer may be counting on a takeover bid for Westpac by one of the other three Australian banks, National Australia Bank (NAB), Australia and New Zealand banking Group (ANZ) and Commonwealth Bank. The banks are excluded from the legal restriction on bank shareholdings, but are prevented from bidding for each other by a separate government policy which bans mergers between the six largest financial institutions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- The Kurdistan Democratic Party  [KDP], led by Mas'ud Barzani, has stressed that the "initiative"  taken by the Kurdish leader Barzani for the declaration of Iraqi  Kurdistan as a "UN protectorate" is "of a temporary nature  linked to the downfall of the Iraqi regime, and would not affect  the issues of democracy for Iraq and federation for Kurdistan."    A KDP spokesman in London has told AL-HAYAH that the  initiative "is based on Chapter 12 of the UN Charter, defining  UN protection and trusteeship." He emphasized that the Iraqi  Kurdish region "requires a definition of status under  international law on which dealings with the Kurdish  administration would be based."    Barzani had linked his proposal to the "failure" of the  Kurdish administration experiment, especially the powersharing  between his party and Jalal Talabani's party (Patriotic Union of  Kurdistan [PUK]). He particularly underscored the  demilitarization of Iraqi Kurdistan.    The spokesman pointed out that the proposal-initiative has  "political, economic, and humanitarian dimensions and, at any  rate, it is up for discussion locally (in the Kurdish areas), at  Iraqi resistance level, and at the international level. There  is an urgent need for a stable political situation in northern  Iraq."    He said that "one point in the initiative's favor is the  regime's violation of international law and the fact that it has  completely blockaded Kurdistan, thereby isolating it from the  rest of Iraq." He drew attention to the importance of "securing  a more stable economic situation in that the international  community should take more serious measures to tackle the two  blockades: the local and the international." He affirmed that  "there should be a more stable political situation after  demilitarization."    It is worth noting that Barzani's proposal calling for the  demilitarization of northern Iraq and for making it a UN  protectorate came after a month of fighting between his party's  forces and the forces of Talabani's party.    The KDP spokesman confirmed that future meetings between the  two leaders "would be devoted to the discussion of ways of  ending the crisis and finding alternatives to this experiment."  He emphasized that the KDP did not take part in the fighting  which broke out the day before yesterday in the area of Qal'at  Dizah near the Iranian border. He said the fighting was between  Talabani's forces and forces of the Islamic Movement.    PUK sources have denied yesterday's IRANIAN NEWS AGENCY  report that the KDP and the Islamic Movement's forces seized  control of Banjwin and Qal'at Dizah. The sources did not say  how many casualties fell in the fighting of two days ago. The  agency had quoted an Islamic Movement official as saying that  the PUK suffered a large number of casualties. It also expected  the leaders of the three parties to meet in Irbil yesterday to  try to contain the fighting.</p>

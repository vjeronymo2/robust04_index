			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Inept east German police fail to act THE near-paralysis of the east German police in the face of rightwing violence against asylum seekers in Rostock last week may have surprised those who recall the swift suppression of opposition by the Communist police state before its collapse in 1989. It also contrasted sharply with the tough tactics used by the west German police against many of the protesters at the economic summit in Munich in July. But the police in the former East Germany - as in other Communist countries  -were in reality a remarkably inept arm of coercion. Far more effective intimidation was assured by the all-seeing state security force, the Stasi, and its tens of thousands of informers. 'Policemen in the East were part of the system of blindly obeying orders,' says Mr Dieter Schenk, deputy president of the Berlin police. Rank and file policemen were generally loyal servants of the old regime. After unification their senior officers remained largely in place and only at the top were commanders replaced by west German officials. In a state unable to conceive of any threat but a political conspiracy, legions of police often proved incapable of coping with riots by football hooligans. These were the forerunners of the frustrated youths in Rostock's Lichtenhagen estate last week. The fall of communism, and the police's patent ineffectiveness in halting this, led the inedemoralised force to adopt a virtually invisible profile after unification. This was dramatically evident in Rostock at the start of the rightwing attacks. Some of the problems encountered in east Germany were avoided in eastern Berlin, where policemen in the eastern part of the city East were immediately assigned a Western 'minder' counterpart after unification. The trouble in Rostock obliged Bonn to draft in thousands of reinforcements from the west to back up the eastern force and prompted Monday's announcement that the five east German states would get help setting up special anti-extremist surveillance units.</p>

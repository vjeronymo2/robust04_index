			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Graham open offer subscribed 1.5 times Some investors in Graham Group, the builders' merchant which comes to the market this month with a value of Pounds 210m, will receive only half the number of shares for which they applied in the open offer. The group announced yesterday that the offer had been subscribed 1.5 times, with applications for 58.8m shares, or 51 per cent of the total issued. However, some 74.5m of the 114.6m new shares had already been placed with institutions and only 40.1m were available for the public offer. Investors seeking more than 200,000 shares will receive 50 per cent of their application. Those seeking between 200 and 2,000 will be satisfied in full, while investors wanting a greater amount will receive between 85 per cent and 66.7 per cent of their applications.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Be wise about warrants SOPHISTICATED private investors might be tempted by the world of warrants. But they should understand the risks. A warrant is rather like an option - it gives the right to buy shares at a given price (called the exercise, or strike price) at some future date (or dates). If the share price rises substantially above the exercise price, then the warrant-holder can make a substantial profit, either by selling the warrant in the market or by exercising it and buying the shares at a low price. However, if the share price fails to rise above the exercise price, the warrant will expire worthless. In other words, warrants are highly geared investments. Most warrants are issued by companies as a 'sweetener' linked to some other capital-raising issue. In Japan, for example, many companies issued bonds with equity warrants attached in the late 1980s. By offering the sweetener, the company was able to achieve a lower interest rate on the bond issue. The UK warrant market is small by international standards. James Capel calculated that, at the end of 1991, the market capitalisation of UK equity warrants was under Pounds 700m; compared with Dollars 9bn (around Pounds 5bn) in Japan. One group of companies which has issued warrants is investment trusts, which use them to get round a new issue problem. Most investment trusts trade at a discount to their net asset values; thus a new trust has a difficulty - why should investors pay full value for shares which will quickly drop to a discount? By offering a warrant 'for free', trust promoters hope that the value of the warrant will offset the potential discount and thus persuade investors to buy shares. Those who have acquired warrants via a new issue can treat them as a bonus. But things are different for investors who want to buy them in their own right. In some ways, warrants are rather like the capital shares of split level investment trusts. River &amp; Mercantile's guide to split capital investment trusts issues a double warning. Warrants will rise faster than capital shares in rising markets and fall farther in declining markets. In addition, investment trust warrants can be difficult to buy or sell, and the spread between buying and selling prices can be large, making dealing costly. In the non-investment trust world, the most notable warrants are those issued by four FT-SE 100 companies: BTR, Eurotunnel, Hanson and BP. Valuing a warrant is a complex process. There are three key components: Time. The longer it is before the warrant expires, the greater the chance that exercise will become profitable. Thus the price of the warrant needs to be higher. The relationship of the exercise price to the current share price. If a company's share price is 150p, then a warrant enabling the investor to buy shares at 100p is obviously worth at least 50p. Such a warrant has 'intrinsic value' and is described as being in-the-money. If the share price is 80p, then the warrant has no intrinsic value and will be a lot cheaper. Volatility. The more erratic the company's share price movements, the greater the chance of warrant exercise being profitable at some point. Hence a warrant relating to a more volatile share will be more expensive. The investor must also allow for other factors. Warrant-holders do not receive the dividends payable to ordinary shareholders; conversely, since a warrant is less expensive than the underlying share, the cash outlay for buying a warrant is lower. As a consequence, James Capel says, when interest rates rise, warrant values should rise; and when dividend yields increase, warrant values should fall. All these elements can be bewildering for the private investor, and the advice of a stockbroker is essential.</p>

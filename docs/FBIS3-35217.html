			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice chairman of the Yemeni </F> Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni  Socialist Party, at the Royal Hashemite Court in Amman -- live]    [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. Praise be to God, who has guided us to this felicity,  never could we have found guidance, had it not been for the  guidance of God. [part of a Koranic verse] Blessed be this  Ramadan. Blessed be this agreement, God willing, and blessed be  your efforts.    To begin, I am pleased and honored to thank, once again, our  dear brother, His Majesty King Husayn Bin-Talal, and Jordan's  leadership and beloved people. We in Yemen are honored that  Amman would host this gathering and this blessed agreement, God  willing, to start the new phase in Yemeni history that we sign  here and continue there, in Yemen.    Thank God, the agreement has been signed. Despite the  wounds, the wound of the homeland is dearer and greater as far  as we are concerned. Everything dear becomes worthless for the  sake of Yemen. Our sincerity and seriousness will be tested  tomorrow, when we return there. What is important in this  agreement is our ability to implement it.    Never mind. This time, in Yemen we had another kind of  conflict, a dialogue with words. We ruled out the dialogue of  bullets and the dialogue of violence. We appealed to national  unanimity. We signed this document. And today, we say, after  signing, that this is the document of the homeland, the document  of national unanimity, and not the document of any one party.  With the blessings of God, we will all join hands and work to  implement it, despite our reservations, or feelings -- which are  based on past experiences -- that there will be difficulties in  implementing it. However, let us be optimistic. We must be  optimistic all the time.    From our people, we will find blessings. We will find  support from all faithful people. This is the document of all  faithful people. We hope we will succeed in taking  it...[pauses] despite our pains. I now have a picture of martyr  Majid, martyr Kamil, and martyr Hashim al-'Attas [Yemeni  Socialist Party officials or relatives of party officials  assassinated in Yemen], but Yemen is more precious than them  all. We must place our country above all other considerations,  above all personal considerations. We beseech God to grant us  success. We will work seriously to move into implementation  with all the faithful people.    What is new today is not the coalition formula. What is new,  with this national consensus document, is the formula of the  larger- scale coalition, the national consensus that helped us  reach this document. We think that now after this crisis -- and  I stress the need to admit that it is a crisis in order to be  able to address it, understand it well, and treat it, at the  minimum level of the common denominators that we have reached.    It is all right. With the blessings of God we march. But as  a result of this crisis, awareness must be promoted about the  issue of unity in Yemen and Arab unity in the future. From now  on, we must use our minds to produce knowledge. We must also  allow feelings their role. We are only human. With the  blessings of God, time has caught us. It is Ramadan and the  fast-breaking time is approaching. May God accept your fasting  and bless your fast-breaking meal.</p>

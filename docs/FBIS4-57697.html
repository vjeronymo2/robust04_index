			<p>BFN     [Text] On 22 May, we learned from reliable sources in  Port-au-Prince that the Haitian Army was put on a maximum state  of alert on 20 May, while the government of provisional  President Emile Jonassaint, which is not recognized by the  international community, has issued a severe warning to any  persons having ties with the enemies of the fatherland or one of  their agents. There were numerous members of the Armed Forces,  including many in civilian clothing, bearing arms, circulating  in the streets of Port-au-Prince on 22 May.    A communique issued by the Ministry of Information, Culture,  and Coordination and signed by Jacques Saint-Louis reminds all  that any person found to have had ties with the enemy with a  view to making it easier for the enemy to enter the national  territory, or to turning over military buildings,  fortifications, fortresses, arsenals, ammunition depots,  fortified towns, and harbors to the enemy will be sanctioned by  hard labor for life. Anyone giving away their [not further  identified] plans will be liable to the same sanction, the  communique says, which does not specify the nature of the enemy.    The law will also punish anyone who attempts to shake the  loyalty of officers, soldiers, and sailors toward the  government. Any insulting words or threats uttered against an  officer in command of a force charged with public order will be  punished by one to six months' imprisonment. The communique adds  that if the speaker is a member of the legislature, the sentence  will be one to three years.    In case of crimes or offenses of inciting to rebellion  through speeches or public documents, the agitator will be  punished by an imprisonment of a minimum of six days and a  maximum of one year, provided the rebellion did not take place.    Any fired civilian or military employee who continues to  carry out his duties after he has been replaced will be punished  by six months' to two years'imprisonment, adds the text.    The government of resigning Prime Minister Robert Malval is  nevertheless the only one recognized by the international  community.    The reminder of these sanctions comes in order to avoid any  confusion detrimental to social peace, concludes the text.    This communique was issued 24 hours after the near-total  embargo against Haiti went into effect in an attempt to force  the military to resign.</p>

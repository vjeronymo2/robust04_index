			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [The 120th, 121st, and 122nd installments of book by Xu </F> Jiatun: Xu Jiatun Xianggang Huiyilu (The Hong Kong Memoirs  of Xu Jiatun)]  <H5>  [1 Sep 93 p 2] </H5>   [Text] Got Involved in Infighting at the Core (Part 3  of 3)    Beijing imposed martial law to terminate the turmoil.  The center summoned me to get me "informed." Yang Shangkun  unequivocally promised me that Li Peng would not be allowed to  become general secretary.    On 22 May the center sent a telegram, asking me to go to  Beijing immediately. I estimated that this was about the  center's reorganization. Thus I arrived in Beijing on the 23d.  The deputy director of the General Office of the CPC Central  Committee, who met me at the airport, had a very unusual  expression on his face and looked very nervous. He told me that  Beijing Municipality's public security police could no longer  perform their duties, that workers, students, and residents were  maintaining checkpoints along the streets in the city, checking  pedestrians and vehicles, and that government and military  vehicles could be detained at any time if they were found at the  checkpoints. Therefore vehicles of party organizations and  public institutions as well as government and military vehicles  had now all changed into using ordinary municipal license  plates. To avoid any trouble, we went from the airport to my  place of lodging in a roundabout way. That deputy director also  told me that the center had transferred Jiang Zemin, secretary  of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, to the center, and that  to avoid trouble he had pretended to be a doctor after getting  off the plane. I asked him why the center had transferred Jiang  Zemin here. He replied that he was "not clear," and that he only  heard that Jiang had already replaced Hu Qili as the person in  charge of propaganda work. I was already mentally prepared since  I had learned that Zhao Ziyang had not participated in the  meeting of party, government, and military cadres on the 19th,  and therefore did not make any further inquiry. But I did not  thought that Jiang Zemin would become general secretary.    On the 25th Yang Shangkun met with me in a lounge at Mao  Zedong's Zhongnanhai swimming pool. At that time they believed  the situation in Beijing to be very grave, and many responsible  persons had moved. Yang Shangkun and Li Peng had moved into the  Zhongnanhai compound, and had become next-door neighbors. One  was living at Mao Zedong's swimming pool, and the other was  living in a residence next to the swimming pool, which had been  Mao Zedong's residence at the time of his death. While waiting  for their summoning, I had learned that this trip was for the  purpose of getting me "informed," that responsible persons of  most provinces and municipalities had already been to Beijing,  and that I was one of the last few persons. As for the question  of what I would be told, I could already guess 80-90 percent of  the answer.    Yang Shangkun did not say to me anything about the things  that the two of us had discussed on 4 May. As soon as he saw me,  he explained: "The Standing Committee has decided that I should  talk to you and several others (Yang Shangkun did not mention  who those several people were) because I am well-acquainted with  you and those several persons." He also said: "According to the  decision of the Standing Committee, Zhao Ziyang has been  temporarily relieved of his duties. Comrade Xiaoping has said  that there does not exist any route of retreat, and that that is  why martial law has been used and why the People's Liberation  Army [PLA] is being used to put down the turmoil. It is hoped  that you can show understanding and support the center's  decision."    I felt very bad then, and was speechless for a while. It was  only after quite a while that I said: "Be sure that no blood is  shed in the course of using the PLA!" Yang Shangkun immediately  said: "Of course not. Of course not." He also said: "Several  marshals, like Marshal Xu and Marshal Nie, are of the same view.  They have also given the center the same advice." Then he said  again: "Of course not." I then asked: "Who will be general  secretary?" Yang Shangkun replied: "No decision has been made  yet." Then he added: "The center has not had time to consider  the issue." I immediately said to Yang Shangkun in a serious  tone: "Be sure not to let Li Peng assume that office!" Yang also  unequivocally replied: "Of course not."    During this process of asking and answering questions, I  became so emotional that I shed tears.    Yang Shangkun also asked about the activities in Hong Kong  in  support of the student movement and about the situation of the  institutions in Hong Kong which had been set up by China. He  showed particular concern over the situation of the run on the  Bank of China. After the meeting went on for approximately 20  minutes, he said that he had to deal with a matter and asked me  to see Li Peng: "You may go there to talk with him about the  economic situation in Hong Kong." I asked myself whether it was  because I had just criticized Li Peng that he had asked me to  see Li Peng so that my relationship with Li Peng could become  less tense.    After saying goodbye to Yang Shangkun, I immediately went to  see Li Peng. Li's secretary said that Li was at a State Council  meeting, and asked me to sit there for a while. He said that he  would tell Li Peng to come back immediately. After I just sat  down in the front room, Li Peng's wife, Zhu Lin, came out to  greet me, and said, putting on high-official airs,: "You have  worked very hard in Hong Kong." I was disgusted and gave a  forced smile in reply. After sitting down, Zhu Lin immediately  began to sing her husband's praises: "Our Old Li is steadfastly  righteous, and is not afraid of being opposed by people. He has  not been having an easy time lately!" She then said: "The  students are creating so much trouble, but Zhao Ziyang would  still play his golf...." She was talkative and arrogant. I had  all kinds of emotions, and did not say anything to her. Seeing  that she could not engage me in conversation, she left the room.    As soon as he came, Li Peng asked in a reproaching manner,  even before sitting down: "What was the matter with WEN WEI PO  and TA KUNG PAO? How could such an incident have happened." I  answered directly: "Because of the effects of Tiananmen." I did  not make any further explanation. He might have also sensed  something; as at that time he could not do much to punish me, he  changed into asking me about the situation in Hong Kong in a  relaxed tone. I described how Hong Kong residents had taken  energetic actions to support the Tiananmen student movement.  After listening to me, Li Peng requested that I take up the  matter with the British Hong Kong government, asking the British  Hong Kong government to impose restrictions on the movement. He  also suggested that the WEN WEI PO and TA KUNG PAO incident be  investigated and that stern measures be taken accordingly. I  said to Li Peng at once: "Circumstances in Hong Kong are  different from those in the hinterland and therefore the way of  handling things should also be different." I again refused to  cooperate. After hearing my reply, Li Peng became very unhappy,  and did not express his views any further. I did not talk to him  about the economic situation in Hong Kong as Yang Shangkun had  asked. I only raised to his consideration the issue of  developing the Yangpu Special Economic Zone of Hainan once  again. As said in the preceding pages, I had been asked by Xu  Shijie [6079 1102 2638], secretary of the CPC Hainan Provincial  Committee, to raise the issue. I thus raised the issue in the  hope of persuading Li Peng to approve the report by the CPC  Hainan Provincial Committee as soon as possible. Li Peng also  repeated his set answer that he would approve the use of land on  a project-by-project basis, thereby dodging the issue. This was  the last time that I talked with Li Peng alone. As we did not  see eye to eye with each other, I left before the talk was half  a hour old. (120)  <H5>  [2 Sep 93 p 2] </H5>   [Text] Got Involved in the Infighting at the Core  (Part Three of Three)    Li Peng issued three instructions. I transmitted them  but had reservations. The CPC changed with the shooting in  Beijing. I made up my mind to retire.    After Beijing declared that the student movement was a case  of turmoil, on two occasions Ji Pengfei [1213 7720 7378] asked  his secretary to telephone me, giving me the "suggestion" (he  perhaps knew my inclination concerning the movement) that I  follow the three instructions that Li Peng had decided to issue  in handling the student movement-related matters in Hong Kong:  1) the student movement in Beijing was a case of turmoil; 2) it  was necessary to educate office cadres and workers in a positive  manner, asking them not to participate in street activities in  support of the students; and 3) it was necessary to persist in  carrying out work and production.    After discussion, we at the CPC Hong Kong and Macao Work  Committee decided: that Li Peng's three instructions should be  transmitted, and that those having different views should be  permitted to maintain reservations but should nevertheless  implement the three instructions. In fact, this was a measure  showing some reservation about the three instructions. After the  talk with Yang Shangkun, I returned to Hong Kong. I relayed Yang  Shangkun's remarks to a meeting of the CPC Work Committee, and  reiterated Li Peng's three instructions to those within the  institutions. However, in general people did not change their  views on the student movement in Beijing and the mass movement  in Hong Kong as a result.    Some time after 2300 on the night of 3 June, Chen Bojian,  deputy president of WEN WEI PO, told me by phone: "Shots have  been fired in Beijing!" For his home was at Muxudi in Beijing  which was the first place in Beijing where shots were fired.    Beginning on the night of 3 June, I was sleepless for three  days and nights in a row, that is, on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th. I  sat on a sofa and watched television. I would lie down on the  sofa when sleepy. Throughout the period of several days, I had  two television sets and one radio placed in front of me. There  was news on Beijing on television every half hour, and there was  news on Beijing on the radio every fifteen minutes. In effect  there was 24-hour continuous coverage of the situation in  Beijing and reactions from Hong Kong and the outside world. No  words can describe my contradictory emotions and indignation at  that time. I said to myself that the CPC had changed and that  those so-called Communists in Beijing had changed, and asked how  they could have stood on the side opposed to the masses of the  people. I made up my mind to retire and quit my job. I reasoned  that I was nevertheless faced with the issue of making  preparations for my leaving, for I did not want some office  cadres in Hong Kong to experience problems because of my  leaving. In addition I wanted to make some arrangements so that  after retiring I would be able to do as much practical and  research work as I could with regard to the use of the method of  one country, two systems in Hong Kong. I believed that some  Communists were finished but that this did not mean the collapse  of the CPC, and that communism would be realized eventually in  the future.    After the CPC Central Committee declared that Zhao Ziyang  had  been relieved of his duties and that Jiang Zemin had succeeded  him as general secretary, I immediately asked someone to deliver  to Zhao Ziyang a message of two sentences; one was "people  always know who is right," and the other was "keep fit." Later  the person delivering the message told me that after listening  to the message, Zhao said: "Thanks!" As I recall, in history  those upholding truth have often been treated badly and wrongly,  but history would do justice to them in the end; people will not  forget them, and truth will not be lost.  <H5>  Great Changes in Popular Sentiment (Part One of Two) </H5>   The statement that today's Beijing would be tomorrow's  Hong Kong demonstrated the 1997 mentality. The effort to win  over people was dealt a severe blow. We were in a position which  was isolated to an unprecedented degree.    In the June 4th Incident the Communist Party of China opened  fire on the people. The masses shed their blood, and the people  of Hong Kong became disappointed to an unprecedented degree.    Against the background of the "end of time" 1997 mentality,  people of all sectors in Hong Kong, seeing the June 4th  Incident, came to think that they themselves might encounter  something similar after 1997, and therefore took part in the  movement more energetically than ever. The slogan, "today's  Beijing is tomorrow's Hong Kong," clearly demonstrated the 1997  mentality of the people of Hong Kong, and touched the residents'  heartstrings. Large-scale "black" sit-ins, "black" denunciation  meetings, and small rallies and marches of various kinds as well  as large million-man rallies and marches stirred Hong Kong, and  expelled Hong Kong people's long-standing political apathy; Hong  Kong people took part in the movement in an almost frenzied  manner. In the past, "The Internationale" and the National  Anthem had been songs sung by people on the mainland, but now  they were also sung by Hong Kong people. The song, "Bloodstained  Elegance," even became a popular song sung by the general  public. Seeing such a mentality characterized by the effort to  express opinions through songs, one did not know whether to cry  or laugh.    In addition to those who participated in the marches, in  fact  many more people were also affected, including all those people  of the left, the middle, and the right in Hong Kong.    Almost all the local employees of the Hong Kong Branch of  the  XINHUA NEWS AGENCY and leftist organizations participated in the  activities. A large portion of our basic masses--patriotic  students and workers and CPC members including some old CPC  members--participated in the activities. Rightist forces also  openly took part in the marches, holding the Taiwan flag of the  blue sky, the white sun, and red land. People of all political  tendencies, from big capitalists to the working masses,  including even some foreign nationals, all participated in the  activities. There emerged a phenomenon in Hong Kong society:  those who did not participate in the activities would be  isolated and discriminated against.    In reality such activities in Hong Kong had two sides. On  the  one hand, in those activities the broad masses exhibited  unprecedented enthusiasm for taking good care of China, hoping  that the country would further reform and make progress, and  supporting the student's patriotic movement demanding democracy  and reform. On the other hand, the activities manifested the  discontent with, distrust of, and opposition to the policies of  the Communist Party of China as well as the resentment against  the CPC's practice of suppressing the students, opposing reform,  and opposing progress.    Surely it could not be ruled out that some forces which were  hostile to the Communist Party of China and which hoped to see  the collapse of socialist China played a role, thereby  constituting another aspect of the activities. But it should be  pointed out that such was not the main aspect.    As all kinds of forces and people of all walks of life all  participated in the movement, a patriotic united front opposed  to the erroneous policies of the Beijing authorities was formed.  As a consequence there were great changes in popular sentiment,  resulting in crushing blows to our protracted work of winning  over people in Hong Kong, that is, the work on a united front  based on patriotism and the love for Hong Kong, thereby putting  us in an unprecedentedly isolated position. (121)  <H5>  [3 Sep 93 p 3] </H5>   [Text] Great Changes in Popular Sentiment (Part Two  of Two)    There was a run on the Bank of China. Within three  days, HK$17 billion was withdrawn. When mourning for those who  had died during the June 4th Incident, Huang Wenfang led  employees of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY in holding a memorial  ceremony.    After shots were fired in Beijing during the June 4th  Incident, the people of Hong Kong were in an uninterrupted state  of indignation. Many people expressed their mourning for the  compatriots who had died in Beijing by carrying out workers'  strikes, students' strikes, and shopkeepers' strikes. The stock  market fell by 1,000 points, resulting in a loss of HK$200  billion in the market value. The market value of real estate  also fell by at least HK$200 billion. That is, the stock market  and real estate alone experienced a loss of nearly HK$400  billion.    As people could not express their anger in a political way,  they staged a run on the Bank of China. Within three days, HK$17  billion was withdrawn, creating a huge momentum. In the 1960s  and 1970s many young students at Hong Kong's universities had  been followers of Mao Zedong Thought, and had loved socialist  China, thereby being called the Chinese cultural quintessence  faction. Now those young people had mostly become the elites of  Hong Kong society. Some were presidents or managers of Hong Kong  branches of foreign banks, and some were chief executives of  some large corporations. After the June 4th Incident, some of  them held meetings. Most indignantly advocated bringing down the  Bank of China by exploiting the run on the bank. What did this  show? Once they had been the young people who had been the most  patriotic and who had loved the Communist Party of China the  most among the people of Hong Kong. But they had now undergone  such a radical change!    Surely the run on the bank did produce destructive effects  on  Hong Kong's financial industry, but those who were hurt the most  were in the final analysis the people of Hong Kong. After some  discussion, the CPC Work Committee asked the Bank of China to  take up the matter with the British Hong Kong government and the  Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank in an urgent manner. They agreed to  give help. The British Hong Kong government would issue a  statement, and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank also planned to  mobilize some funds to provide help. Surely the Bank of China  would mainly rely on its own capabilities, and mobilized funds.  The headquarters on the mainland also transferred funds here to  provide help. Thus the run on the bank was terminated as quickly  as possible.    After the June 4th incident, there was another upsurge of  emigration. There were long lines of immigration applicants  outside foreign consulates. Many of the hinterland-sent cadres  who had acquired Hong Kong residence status were also planning  to emigrate, openly standing in lines outside the consulates.  There were intermittent reports of defections of personnel of  Chinese embassies to foreign countries.    There was another wave of getting Hong Kong corporations and  enterprises chartered in other countries. Even Li Ka-shing who  had always indicated his disinclination to emigrate and change  the chartering country also changed his tone and said that the  matter of whether to change the chartering country would be  decided by the board of directors.    Before the June 4th incident the Hong Kong Branch of the  XINHUA NEWS AGENCY had been much visited. Even during the period  of petitions and marches, there was contact with many people of  all kinds. After the "shooting," things suddenly cooled down.  Many people who had maintained good relations with China began  to keep a distance. Even those people who had been close to  China would not see us, and they also wanted to draw a  demarcation line with Beijing and keep Beijing at a distance.  Some merchants stopped doing business with entities inside China  or even withdrew their offices from the hinterland.    After the June 4th Incident, some Hong Kong organizations in  support of the student movement in Beijing set up a mourning  site opposite the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY  Building to mourn for those who had died in the June 4th  incident. Passersby would all take part in the mourning and pay  last respects. Zheng Hua told me nervously that Huang Wenfang  had prepared a banner, intending to take some cadres and  employees of the branch with him to the mourning site to take  part in the mourning. Huang Wenfang was director of the Taiwan  work department, and he had also taken the lead when the  department directors had given their signatures some time  before. Zheng Hua told me that their efforts to persuade Huang  Wenfang had failed. Zheng Hua suggested that I try to persuade  Huang Wenfang, and that he himself try to persuade the masses. I  expressed agreement. I told Huang Wenfang the opinion of the CPC  Work Committee, and expressed the hope that he would not take  the lead and that he himself would also refrain from taking part  in the morning activities. Huang Wenfang said nothing. But  immediately afterwards he still led a group of local employees  in walking out of the door of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, with a  banner being held high. They conducted mourning activities at  the mourning site. Zheng Hua's persuasion efforts only produced  some effects on a few hinterland employees, and they did not  take part in the mourning activities.    For four months the walls of the Hong Kong Branch of the  XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Building and the gymnasium across the street  had been covered with big character posters and cartoons of all  kinds. A little over a month after the June 4th Incident, having  received permission from the British Hong Kong government, we  planned to have employees of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA  NEWS AGENCY clean the walls. As the big character posters had  been attached with glue, they could not be washed away. Thus the  administrative department asked a cleaning company which  belonged to Chinese-owned institutions to help clean the walls.  Of course money would have to be paid. However, when the  cleaning company under "leftist" institutions learned that it  was to wash away the big character posters on the walls of the  Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Building, it  resolutely refused to do the job.    The national go master, Nie Weiping, stopped over  in Hong Kong, when traveling to Southeast Asia to participate in  a go tournament. The bridge team of Zhejiang Province  was also traveling with him. I invited them to a dinner at the  Stanley guest-house of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS  AGENCY. According to the appointment, they were supposed to  arrive at 1600. For I also liked to play go and  wanted to take the opportunity to get some coaching from Nie  Weiping.    Nie Weiping and some others came a little after 1600. The  captain of the bridge team needed to run some errand in Kowloon,  and therefore would come a bit late. We waited for him, while  chatting. He did not came until 2100. We asked why he had come  so late. According to him, when he had tried to hire a taxi in  Kowloon, the taxi drivers would immediately drive away and  refuse to take him after learning that the destination would be  the Stanley guest-house of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA  NEWS AGENCY. He said that four taxis had all behaved in that  manner.    Later he could not but ask a passerby to hire a taxi for  him,  only giving the address but not making clear that the place  belonged to the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY. Only  in this way had he succeeded in getting a taxi to bring him  here. I and Nie Weiping were shocked to hear the story. We had  not thought that even the basic masses such as taxi drivers  would assume such an attitude toward us.    After the June 4th Incident, in order to have Hong Kong  people resume contact with China so as to understand the policy  of the new leadership in Beijing, I made active efforts to talk  to those upper- and middle-strata personalities in Hong Kong who  were willing to have contact with us, encouraging them to visit  Beijing. Yue-kong Pao and Li Ka-shing agreed to go to Beijing,  but would see Deng Xiaoping only. I agreed to make arrangements  for them. Pao and Li saw Deng Xiaoping on separate occasions.  After coming back, they both met with me, and discussed their  meetings. Yue-kong Pao mentioned Deng Xiaoping's attitude of  confronting toughness with toughness towards the British  Government. Li Ka-shing expressed his worries in a not very  clear manner: "Mr. Deng's continuing to do what he said will not  be good for Hong Kong." I understood that "Mr. Deng's  statements" he referred to were the same thing Yue-kong Pao had  talked about.    Successively a few other groups of people also agreed to go  to Beijing, but the condition was that they would see only Jiang  Zemin but not Li Peng. I also expressed my consent, and made  arrangements. They saw Jiang Zemin. Some agreed to see both  Jiang and Li, but demanded that the meeting with Li be not made  public and that no news report be issued. I also accepted the  demand and made arrangements. Only Lo Tak-shing did not express  refusal. He saw Li Peng, and the meeting was publicly reported.    No matter whom they had seen, most of those who had visited  Beijing would say the same thing in talking to me about their  feelings: "The Beijing leadership does not understand the  situation in Hong Kong." They would indicate their great  disappointment. Some even said: "They (referring to the leaders  they met) regard Hong Kong as an enemy." I did not feel proper  to make nay further inquiry, and thus it was difficult to make  explanation to those people.    Later Li Hou [2621 0683] telephoned me, saying that Jiang  Zemin was no longer willing to see people by himself, and that  the reason was that if they did not want to see Li Peng, then it  would not be proper for him to see those people by himself. As  a result several groups of people for whom arrangements had been  made delayed their trips. At the same time it was not advisable  to tell them Jiang Zemin's reason explicitly; so I could not but  evade the issue. I deeply felt that there had been great changes  in popular sentiment in Hong Kong, but Beijing was unable, and  did not want, to understand the situation. The work on Hong Kong  would be very difficult in the days to come. (122)</p>

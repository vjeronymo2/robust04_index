			<p>BFN     [Text] Business people throughout the country and drug  traffickers from the Upper Huallaga pay MRTA [Tupac Amaru  Revolutionary Movement] approximately $5 million per year in  "war duties," according to documents confiscated from Emilio  Villalobos Alva, "Comrade Polo," a MRTA national directorate  member recently arrested by Dincote [National Counterterrorism  Directorate].    According to what Villalobos Alva told Dincote agents,  currently approximately 50 powerful Peruvian businessmen and  industrialists and 200 medium-size merchants are on MRTA's  computerized list of those who paid from $100 to $400 per month.    However, Operation Alacran III, during which Divicote-2  [Dincote 2d Division] agents found MRTA strongholds in Lima,  Barranca, and Arequipa, revealed all this information and  radically cut the resources MRTA received from Peruvian business  people through either blackmail or abductions.    In the meantime, MRTA terrorists continue receiving money  from drug traffickers in Upper Huallaga whom they protect when  transporting drugs from one place to another or shipping drugs  abroad.    According to our sources, Comrade Polo's confessions, and an  assessment of the documents and archives the Divicote-2 agents  confiscated from MRTA strongholds revealed that the money was  distributed as follows:    Part of it was deposited in current bank accounts in Paris,  France, where Hugo Avellaneda Valdez, Comrade Eloy, lives.  Avellaneda Valdez, who is MRTA international coordinator, is in  charge of distributing the money together with other MRTA  leaders living abroad and with leaders of the MIR [Movement of  the Revolutionary Left] international wing.    Deposits are made by computer via "modems," which were  seized  at one MRTA stronghold raided by counterterrorist agents.    As we reported some days ago, the MIR international wing is  financed by contributions by American and European terrorist  groups, to whom they send weapons and highly trained subversive  elements in military tactics.    Another part of the money is withheld by the terrorist  leaders in Lima to pay foreign -- Chilean -- terrorists for the  crimes committed together with MRTA and for the logistics  apparatus that was run by terrorist Ramos Edison Loayza Alferez  (arrested).    This group used the money to buy or rent houses used as  strongholds; to purchase vehicles, weapons -- brought from  abroad, computers, faxes, and communications equipment; and to  set up clandestine workshops to make military or police uniforms.</p>

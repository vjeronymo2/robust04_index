			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> WORLD AIDS CASES CLIMB 6.5%  </P> <P> Reported cases of AIDS around the world rose in June by 10,181 or 6.5%, to a  total 167,373 as of July 1, the World Health Organization said today.  </P> <P> WHO said the relatively large increase was due to updated reports from African  and Latin American nations as well as the United States and several West  European countries.  </P> <P> With 95,561 cases, the United States accounted for 57% of the latest global  total, cumulative since WHO began keeping AIDS statistics in 1980.  </P> <P> As of July 1, the U.N. health agency said, 149 countries had reported one or  more cases, with Fiji having its first case during June.  </P> <P> Experts said the real global total is probably two to three times higher  because African and many other Third World countries lack detection facilities  and are many months late in sending reports.  </P></p>

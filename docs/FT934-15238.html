			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Ministers act to end rail revolt THE GOVERNMENT headed off another revolt by Tory backbench peers against the Railways Bill last night by promising to consider providing additional legislative safeguards for British Rail's 130,000 pensioners. Ministerial assurances that a new pension fund to be established after privatisation would not be allowed to become insolvent, and that benefits would be index-linked, failed to satisfy critics of the bill. They were led by Lord Peyton of Yeovil, former Conservative transport minister, who moved the amendment permitting British Rail to apply for franchises to operate passenger services on which the government was defeated in July. Lord Peyton was strongly supported by Lord Marsh, the cross-bench peer and former chairman of BR, when he insisted that guarantees covering solvency and index-linking should be written in. They were unimpressed by claims by the Earl of Caithness, transport minister, that the government had gone '85 per cent of the way' on their concerns. Lord Peyton maintained that by enshrining guarantees in the bill, the government would be able to remove a 'residue of suspicion and ill-will' among BR pensioners. He finally agreed not to move an amendment seeking to achieve this objective pending the outcome of further talks with ministers. But Lord Peyton warned that unless they reached a satisfactory conclusion he would move a similar amendment at the next stage of the bill. In an effort to avert a further setback for privatisation, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, and Mr Roger Freeman, a transport minister, are to meet Tory backbenchers who want BR to be allowed to bid for franchises.</p>

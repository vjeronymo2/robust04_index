However, the construction of Hong Kong's new airport has not  been able to unfold in a comprehensive manner, and the cause is  that the Chinese and British sides have not been able to reach  an agreement on the financing arrangements for the airport.    The British side did not negotiate with the Chinese side  from  the very beginning, but the Chinese side, proceeding from the  interests of the residents of Hong Kong, has still taken the  positive attitude of being willing to give support. The heads  of the Chinese and British governments signed the Memorandum of  Understanding on the New Airport in Beijing in 1991. The  memorandum states that the airport project should meet the  requirement of cost effectiveness, and that the project should  not become a financial burden for the special administrative  region [SAR] government after 30 June 1997. It also states that  on handing over the sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997, the  British side should only leave HK$25 billion [Hong Kong dollars]  to the government of the Hong Kong SAR and debt incurred should  not exceed HK$5 billion. If the British side had acted in  accordance with the Memorandum, the financing arrangement for  the new airport would not have become a knotty issue. The  question at present is that the airport financing arrangement  proposed by the British side greatly exceeds the amount stated  in the memorandum. The plan involves high costs and low  effectiveness, and the future Special Administrative Region  Government is bound to incur much greater debts than HK$5  billion. This may even exceed the financial reserves of HK$25  billion. The British side has also insisted on setting no upper  limit on "contingent liabilities." However, the construction  costs of the new airport put forward by the Hong Kong Government  have soared at a shocking speed. In November 1991, the cost of  construction put forward by the Hong Kong Government was HK$98  billion, but it was readjusted to HK$112 billion in March 1992.  Now, some people are saying that the cost of construction has  been readjusted to HK$150 billion, or even HK$175 billion. How  can the Chinese side jump lightly into a trap which will  inevitably cause the SAR government to incur enormous debts!    However, the Chinese and British sides have not been able to  reach an agreement on the financing arrangements, but the Hong  Kong Government has already started a series of construction  projects for the new airport. Moreover, the British side has,  without the agreement of the Chinese side, unilaterally applied  for funds to be allocated for the airport in the Legislative  Council on many occasions, and by the end of 1992, an  accumulated total of over HK$14 billion had been allocated.  During rigorous inquiries by members of the Legislative  Council, the Hong Kong Government promised that it would not  apply for further allocations of funds before reaching an  agreement on the financing arrangement between the Chinese and  British sides. However, as those words still rang in the ears,  the Hong Kong Government recently made an application for the  allocation of HK$1.67 billion in the Legislative Council again.  This has increased the total allocated funds to HK$16.26  billion, which is less than a HK$400-million difference from the  total amount of HK$16.6 billion promised by the Legislative  Council to the Provisional Airport Authority in advance.  Secretary of the Treasury Donald Tsang even stated that the  possibility of future applications for funds had not been ruled  out.    Evidently, the Hong Kong Government has always been  enthusiastic about separating the construction of airport  projects and "putting uncooked rice into the pot first" in an  attempt to compel the Chinese side to meet the demands of the  British side on the general financing arrangements for the new  airport and to swallow the bitter fruit of high costs, low  effectiveness, and unlimited "contingent liabilities." However,  the Chinese side has repeatedly reiterated that the issue of the  financing arrangements for the construction of the airport  should be settled by the Chinese and British sides through  negotiations in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding  on the airport. Before an agreement is reached between the two  sides, unilateral actions will not be conducive to a solution on  the financing arrangements for the new airport.</p>

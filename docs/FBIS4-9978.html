			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Marcelo Faga] </F>   [Text] An auditing study that the National Accounting  Office (TCU) made of Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc. has  detected differences, amounting to billions of dollars, between  the figures reported by Furnas and the real cost of construction  of Brazilian nuclear power plants, especially Angra-2. The  report, which raises objections to the figures released by  Furnas, remained shelved for months within the TCU. Its  conclusions could destroy the executive branch's reasons for  justifying the decision to continue with the construction of the  plant.    The auditing study reveals, for example, that Angra-2 has so  far cost $5 billion, according to the most reliable  calculations. This figure is more than three times the amount  that Furnas has officially declared to have spent since 1977 --  $1.7 billion.    The TCU report also concluded that the estimates of the  investment that is necessary for concluding the project are not  reliable. It is expected that the plant will call for  investments that are higher than the cost of a hydroelectric  plant with the same generation capacity of 1,300 megawatts.    Based on the results of the auditing study, the Greenpeace  environmentalist organization will request suspension of  construction of the plant. "Angra-2 accounts have been revealed  for the first time," says Greenpeace leader Rui de Goes. He  remarked that the auditing confirms the theses of  nongovernmental organizations which are against the nuclear  program.    The TCU document has not only challenged the credibility of  Furnas, but has also cast doubts over the accounts of the entire  electric power sector. It says that in the face of the  estimated cost, "nuclear energy is not competitive in Plan  2015," which was prepared by Eletrobras [Brazilian Electric  Power Company Inc.]. "With the most pessimistic hypothesis,  thermal power will not be competitive with hydroelectric power  until 2005," the TCU report says, noting that the nuclear option  is the most expensive thermal power generation alternative.    "For FURNAS, building a hydroelectric power plant or a  nuclear power plant makes no difference, because the Union  subsidizes the cost of nuclear energy," the TCU report says.  Based on this report, the $5 billion that has already been  spent, plus the $2.3 billion that is necessary for completion of  the project, amounts to $7.3 billion for the total cost of  Angra-2.    The limit for Furnas spending on the construction of Angra-2  corresponds to the amount that would be spent on a hydroelectric  power plant of the same size -- of approximately 1,300  megawatts. This would mean an investment of $1.2 billion for  Furnas. The Treasury must supply the remaining $6.1 billion,  which amounts to two minimum salaries for each Brazilian family.    These figures, however, could be even larger. The TCU  auditing did not estimate the financial expenses included in the  construction of the plant. In the case of Angra, they account  for 40 percent of the cost. For its part, Eletrobras has other  estimates of the cost for completion of the project. It  estimates that $2 billion is necessary for completion of the  project.    The TCU auditing study also has doubts about those  estimates.  "Angra-2 cost estimates should be considered cautiously." The  report recalls the case of Angra-1, "whose cost was estimated at  $319 million, but which turned out to be several times higher."    The conclusions of the TCU concerning Angra-1 accounts are  equally devastating. The auditors estimated the cost at $3.9  billion, noting that this figure "affords a new base for  calculation of the cost-benefit ratio for Angra-1," adding that  this project "has obviously contradicted the terms of the  economy-efficacy- efficiency trinomial." Angra-1 has been  disconnected for one year, after a radioactive leak in the  cooling system caused by a deficiency in the nuclear fuel rods.</p>

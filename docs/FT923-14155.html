			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentina tries to rouse dormant mining sector - A look at efforts to attract foreign investors to a long-neglected industry ARGENTINA'S MINING industry is like a sleeping beauty that is gradually waking from a deep slumber that lasted most of this century. A fortifying dose of pro-business government policies is reviving the dormant industry, while the promise of barely explored territory is making Argentina the apple of many an international mining company's eye. Mr David Ancieta, executive director of Minera Aguilar, Argentina's largest mining company, says: 'Argentina is a country of opportunity. There has hardly been any exploration. It is virgin territory for mining'. Mr Jorge Cuomo, a mining consultant, says Argentina's mining industry accounts for just 0.3 per cent of GDP. And 96 per cent of the industry's output is in industrial minerals like talc and borax, rather than metallic minerals like gold, silver or copper. Argentina has never bothered to exploit the Andes' mining potential, even though neighbouring Chile has developed some of the world's largest mining projects in its Andean territory. The distance of the Andes from Buenos Aires, around which most of the population is concentrated, Argentina's agrarian rather than industrial or mining tradition, plus six decades of political chaos and bureaucratic restrictions explain the Lilliputian mining sector. Furthermore, government policies actually discouraged mining. For instance, the Andean border region was declared a security zone, effectively closed to foreign investment. All that began changing with Argentina's adoption in 1989 of orthodox free market policies. It has lifted import barriers, made the currency freely convertible, swept away xenophobic investment controls and introduced successive deregulation packages. The result of this whirlwind is low inflation and one of Latin America's most business-friendly environments. But since mining has never been a national priority, it was only recently that President Carlos Menem turned his attention to it, announcing in May new plans to attract private investment and technology to revitalise the industry. Mr Luis Prol, hydrocarbons and mining secretary, says: 'If we are to become a more important mining country, much depends on our geology, our legal and regulatory framework. We are introducing interesting changes - improving regulations, making them more transparent and open to investors'. The government is working on a new mining investment law intended to buttress the 1886 mining code by further guaranteeing foreign investors' rights, such as freedom to remit dividends. It is also trying to convince provincial governments, which are largely responsible for regulating and taxing the industry, to adopt a uniform mining policy and tax regime. At present, provincial mining royalties vary from 2.5 per cent to 12 per cent while both national and provincial governments apply a confusing variety of taxes. Mr Miguel Angel Guerrero, national mining director, is also trying to bring together a wealth of dispersed geological information - some of it once considered a military secret - and begin a national geological survey. At present Argentina lacks adequate production statistics, let alone detailed survey data. Foreign investment is essential, given Argentina's tiny mining industry. But while foreign companies obviously applaud the new policies, they are still wary. After all, few countries can rival Argentina's long history of military coups, massive inflation, bewildering policy shifts and widespread corruption. Mr Ancieta, whose company is based in Bolivia and is part-owned by Britain's RTZ, says: 'Mining requires considerable risk capital, so Argentina needs to offer security. If I invest now, will the rules be the same in ten or 15 years?' The government's planned mining investment law is intended to provide such guarantees. But laws have traditionally meant little in Argentina. About a dozen foreign companies are known to be looking at possible projects, but are expected to wait for Argentina to consolidate economic and political stability before making significant investments. Aguilar, which produces lead, silver and zinc at a mine in northern Argentina, is dusting off a copper project in the Andes it had mothballed for 20 years because either international prices were too low or Argentina was too unstable. Overcoming investors' fears is only part of the trick. Investors will have to work hard to find attractive investment targets. For example, Cerro Castillo, Argentina's largest locally-owned mining company, is looking for foreign partners. But Buenos Aires equity analyst Mr Christopher Ecclestone says it lacks adequate 'finance skills and management approach'. He says Cerro Castillo, which operates a gold, silver, zinc and copper mine in southern Argentina, lost Dollars 15.3m on sales of Dollars 8.7m in the year to November 1991. Foreigners can buy into new, untried prospects. The government lists 138 projects of potential interest to investors. But only seven are operating and only two of them have attracted much interest. Alternatively, investors can do their own exploration. This seems to be the favoured approach. Among companies sniffing around Argentina are RTZ's Australian-based affiliate CRA, Noranda, Cyprus Metals and FMC of the US, and Canada's Pacific Rim. Mr Prol says Chilean subsidiaries of multinational companies are expected to be among the first to invest in Argentina, given their proximity and knowledge of the Andes. The government's abolition of the border security zone and other restrictions was specifically intended to encourage Chilean companies to cross into Argentina. Argentina must also modernise its uncompetitive economy and reduce costs. Wages and equipment costs are rising, despite a fixed exchange rate, threatening competitiveness. The provinces have done what they can to lessen the tax burden. Fortunately, strong local demand has increased company profitability, offsetting deteriorating export competitiveness. Aguilar, for example, has annual sales of Dollars 50m, but last year lost about Dollars 9m. This year it hopes to turn in a profit of Dollars 1m or more. Yet the inefficient and undercapitalised industry's does offer investors huge scope for profit-making by applying elementary management and technological improvements. For instance, the quarrying industry ships huge marble and granite blocks to Italy where they are processed and re-exported, rather than being processed in Argentina. Ultimately, as Mr Guerrero recognises, Argentina must invest heavily to 'add more value to the final product. Without vertical integration with industry raw materials are not worth much'.</p>

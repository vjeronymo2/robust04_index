			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications which meet the screening requirements in Part V, item E below will be reviewed competitively. Such applications will be referred to reviewers for a numerical score and explanatory comments based solely on responsiveness to the guidelines and evaluation criteria published in this announcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications will be reviewed by persons outside of the OCS unit which will be directly responsible for programmatic management of the grant. The results of these reviews will assist the Director and OCS program staff in considering competing applications. Reviewers' scores will weigh heavily in funding decisions but will not be the only factors considered. Applications generally will be considered in order of the average scores assigned by reviewers. However, highly ranked applications are not guaranteed funding since other factors are taken into consideration, including, but not limited to, the timely and proper completion of projects funded with OCS funds granted in the last five (5) years; comments of reviewers and government officials; staff evaluation and input; geographic distribution; previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program performance of applicants; compliance with grant terms under previous DHHS grants; audit reports; investigative reports; and applicant's progress in resolving any final audit disallowances on previous OCS or other Federal agency grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OCS reserves the right to discuss applications with other Federal or non-Federal funding sources to ascertain the applicant's performance record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E.

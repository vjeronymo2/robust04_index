"If they (the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina army) do not stop  the offensive, I will order a counteroffensive and they will not  be able to obtain the territories they could obtain through  political negotiations," Karadzic said. He added: "There is no  way they can get the territories where they are now killing our  people."    Karadzic believes the international community will soon  exert  more pressure to stop the war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

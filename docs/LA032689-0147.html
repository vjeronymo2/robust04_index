			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Drug-related internal corruption and other staff problems are the targets of a  special group of "field associates" deployed throughout the nation by the U.S.  Customs Service. Spokesman Richard Weart said the agents "are assigned to a  district office or regional office or to the office of enforcement" and are "to  be alert for serious types of corruption. But they are not directly assigned to  internal affairs." The Washington Post reported that Assistant Customs  Commissioner for Internal Affairs William F. Green had recruited about 40  agency employees as field associates assigned to key offices nationwide to  "keep their eyes and ears open for any wrongdoing" among their colleagues.  Weart said the approach of having employees act as informers against co-workers  was "nothing new."  </P></p>

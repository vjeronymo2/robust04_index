			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Matsushita lowers profit forecast MATSUSHITA, the world's largest electronics company, yesterday lowered its profits forecast and said it expected to see a third year of falling earnings. It blamed depressed demand in Japan and the unexpected appreciation of the yen. It said pre-tax profits for the parent company would be 35 per cent down at Y63bn (Dollars 595.4m), rather than 3 per cent up at Y100bn, as forecast earlier in the year. The company is expecting a 4 per cent decline in sales, to Y4,350bn, compared with a forecast 1 per cent increase, to Y4,600bn. Mr Yuji Hijikata, a director of Matsushita, said the revision was necessary due to a worse-than-expected trading environment in the first half to September. During this time, the company expects sales to have been Y70bn less than forecast. This was blamed largely on a sharp downturn in sales of products that normally enjoy strong demand in summer - such as air conditioners - after an unusually cool summer in Japan. The decline in these products accounted for 70 per cent of the drop in first-half sales, Mr Hijikata said. Overseas sales, on the other hand, rose 3 per cent in local currency terms, largely due to the strength of demand in Asian countries. However, the yen's strength against almost all main currencies has dragged overseas sales down 10 per cent to Y3,130bn. Consolidated pre-tax profits for the year to March, 1994, are consequently expected to be 11 per cent down on the previous year, at Y150bn, rather than 25 per cent up, at Y210bn, as forecast earlier. Sales are forecast at Y6,550bn, which represents a 7 per cent decline from a year ago, compared with a previous forecast of flat sales of Y7,060bn. Matsushita does not expect to see a strong recovery in consumer demand in the near term. It is also uncertain of the impact of currency fluctuations in the second half. The company is hoping to deal with the difficult situation by further rationalisations and cost cuts. It expects to achieve cost reductions of Y14bn this year, and will reduce capital expenditure by about Y10bn to just over Y60bn. However, it has no plans to follow the lead of a growing number of Japanese companies to have introduced voluntary retirement schemes. Nor does it plan to close any facilities temporarily, or reduce the number of new recruits next year.</p>

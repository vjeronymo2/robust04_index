			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Books: Perfect poems, poor lives - Anthony Curtis on the French poets Baudelaire and Mallarme BAUDELAIRE by Joanna Richardson John Murray Pounds 30, 602 pages MALLARME: A THROW OF THE DICE by Gordon Millan Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 30, 389 pages Yeats said 'The intellect of man is forced to choose, perfection of the life, or of the work'. Never can that dilemma have appeared with greater clarity than it does in the lives of the two French poets, Baudelaire and Mallarme, of whom new biographies have just appeared. Both of them sought ceaselessly for perfection, and in many of their poems actually achieved it. Between them they are largely responsible for the modern notion of formal perfection as a poetic ideal. It was their disciplined response to the interminable flood of verse that poured out of a Victor Hugo or a Tennyson. Ironically it was the last of the fluent Victorians - Swinburne - who was the first English poet to hail Baudelaire's genius - in an article in The Spectator in 1862. Since then almost every major English poet, starting with Yeats, Eliot and Auden, has paid tribute to Baudelaire as the founding father of modernism. The ideal of perfection helps to explain what we find most puzzling about Baudelaire and Mallarme, their veneration for the work of Edgar Allen Poe. Baudelaire's admiration for Poe verged on idolatry; he translated much of Poe into French, one of the few things that brought Baudelaire some regular income. Though Baudelaire was by far the greater poet, it was Poe's writings on poetic technique and theory as well as the morbidity of his subject-matter that fertilised the mind of Baudelaire. The seeds of the Frenchman's notion of correspondence - involving a synthesis through words of all the arts, music, dance, painting, literature - the bedrock of symbolism, may be found in Poe. But, as emerges from Joanna Richardson's massive new life of Baudelaire, there were also remarkable parallels between his life and that of Poe. Both lost their natural fathers when they were little; both became mother-fixated; both had adoptive fathers of a military cast who despised poetry; both adored women but found straightforward sex impossible; both became chronic invalids; both were invariably in debt. The last full biography of Baudelaire was by Enid Starkie in 1957. If her scholarship could at times be faulted, Starkie was always an enthusiast and she presented a Baudelaire redeemed by her admiration for his work. With much fresh material at her disposal, Richardson gives us a remorseless march of all the grim facts, concentrating on the poet's disastrous financial situation. From his improvident youth to his death aged 46 it never improved. What makes it so heart-rending is that his degradation could easily have been avoided. Baudelaire inherited a sizeable fortune at the age of 21. Prudently managed he could have lived off it - supplemented by his small literary earnings - in comfort and dignity for the rest of his life. Within a few years he had got through half of it, and had burdened himself with supporting a mulatto mistress Jeanne Duval - the Black Venus of his poetry - from whom he caught the syphilis that ultimately resulted in the aphasia (loss of the faculty of speech) that caused him to spend his last years as a virtual mute. General Jacques Aupick, the epitome of careerist respectability in the Second Empire, called a family council to decide what to do about his prodigal stepson. It was decided that Baudelaire's remaining capital should be administered by a conseil judicaire allowing him a small annual income. Baudelaire's stormy relations with his administrator, a family friend who kept very tight control of the purse-strings, provide an element of pathetic comedy in the sad story. Apart from Jeanne Duval, two other women captured his heart - Apollonie Sabatier, the white Venus who looked like one of Rubens models and who inspired many of les Fleurs; and the actress Marie Daubrun, who was the inspiration behind 'le Beau Navire' and 'L'Invitation au Voyage'. Baudelaire competed for their favours among many gifted men. With the former he triumphed to the point where she finally confessed her love for him. The saddest episode of all is his inexplicable failure to turn this dream of a perfect love into a reality. Mallarme was one of the earliest of the younger French poets to recognise Baudelaire's poetic mastery. His own life, freshly told by Gordon Millan, professor of French Studies at Strathclyde University, was not quite such a mess, though he too suffered from continual financial constraint. He made a stable marriage, fathered a daughter who became his literary executor, and acquired a reputation in his lifetime. But his work as a provincial schoolmaster, irksome from the start, became intolerable as his poetic gift developed. Somehow he managed to get a posting to Paris where his house became a forum of abstruse poetic speculation. His regular Tuesday evening gatherings were attended by many artists and writers including the young Paul Valery, his most gifted disciple. They were in no doubt about Baudelaire's genius and they developed his theory of correspondence. Some of Mallarme's abstruse poems and sonnets, always popular with English readers, exemplify it. At least one of his longer works - 'L'Apres midi d'une Faune' - found a perfect musical correspondence in the mind of Debussy - and after that in the work of choreographers and dancers, Nijinsky, Lifar, Arthur Mitchell. Millan's book reveals the slow evolution of the original poem. He demonstrates the contrast between the poet's tormented, precarious existence and the radiant purity of his vision. That indeed is the message of both these books.</p>

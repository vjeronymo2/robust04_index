			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Pay deals near 4% expected next year Average pay settlements next year are likely to rise to between 3 per cent and 4 per cent, independent pay analyst Incomes Data Services says in its annual review, David Goodhart writes. Stronger economic growth is likely to bring with it much higher levels of staff turnover, deferred from the recession, and the re-emergence of skill shortages. The review also says that pay settlements are likely to continue becoming more complex and differentiated with the spread of profit-related pay, all-merit reviews and additional performance awards, making it increasingly difficult to assess how much a settlement is worth. In the public sector, the government's pay bill freeze has created an informal norm of pay rises at or around the rate of inflation. But the report warns that it may be more difficult to achieve such outcomes in the second year of the pay-bill freeze. The report says: 'Labour markets are tightening in the south-east at a much faster rate than in most of the rest of the country'. In areas such as Cambridge, Bury St Edmunds, Crawley, Newbury and Winchester unemployment rates are down to or below 5 per cent.</p>

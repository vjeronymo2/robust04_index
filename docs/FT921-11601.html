			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar weak on economic woes THE dollar continued to trade lower yesterday on the foreign exchange markets as dealers digested the contents of the US budget package and the bleak outlook for the US economy, writes Simon London. Having closed sharply weaker in New York following the release of poor consumer confidence indicators on Tuesday, the US currency fell further overnight in the Far East. By the end of Tokyo trading the dollar stood at DM1.5895, from DM1.5997 in New York, and Y125.17, from Y125.79. In European trading, the dollar appeared to regain its poise, rising from early lows at DM1.5840 and Y124.75. But poor economic figures again contributed to a negative tone, preventing any sustained rally. US gross domestic product rose by just 0.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year, from 1.8 per cent in the third quarter, underlining the weakness of the economy. Details of the US budget package for the next fiscal year underlined that lower interest rates rather than tax cuts or government spending hold the key to recovery. The budget contains reflationary fiscal measures amounting to Dollars 20bn to Dollars 25bn, rather than the Dollars 50bn injection which some economists had called for. The US currency closed in London at DM1.5900, from DM1.5965 on Tuesday; Y125.40 from Y125.60; and Dollars 1.8065 against sterling from Dollars 1.7955. In New York the dollar improved to finish at DM1.6020, Y125.75, and Dollars 1.7980 per pound. Elsewhere, the D-Mark continued to rally against the yen as traders unwound holdings of the Japanese currency built up last week, ahead of the meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven industrial countries. The G7 meeting was widely expected to declare in favour of a controlled appreciation of the yen, but no concrete exchange rate policy emerged. The German currency rose to a peak just above Y79, having hovered at around Y77 for most of last week. By the close in London the D-Mark was trading at Y78.95. In addition to technical strength, the German unit is also attracting buyers on the basis of high interest rate differentials with the US. Money supply figures released on Tuesday and hard-line comments by Bundesbank board member Mr Otmar Issing have dispelled any worries about an early reduction in German interest rates. Within the European exchange rate mechanism, the peseta remained the strongest currency and sterling the weakest. But the peseta did not carry forward its recent appreciation against the D-Mark and traded around the Pta63.00 level for most of the day. This left sterling's floor, determined by its maximum permitted divergence from the peseta, little changed. The UK currency maintained a buoyant tone, with dealers encouraged by the publication of an opinion poll showing a slender lead for the government. The pound ended at DM2.8725, from DM2.8675 on Tuesday.</p>

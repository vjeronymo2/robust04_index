			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT ALL STARTED WITH VERMEER;  </P> <P> MOVING PICTURES BY ANNE HOLLANDER (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $29.95; 295 PP.)  </P> <P> With great erudition and intellectual facility, Anne Hollander argues in  "Moving Pictures" that motion pictures are rooted in the visual art of the  Dutch and Flemish genre painters of the 17th Century and their impact, in turn,  upon artists as diverse as Tiepolo, Piranesi, Canaletto, Hogarth, Goya, Turner,  Whistler, and others. For Hollander, movies have less to do with the history of  photography -- with its presentation of reality "congealed in an aspic of  perfect details" -- than with the properties of light and motion inherent in  the Dutch paintings. Hollander posits the idea that the images of a Vermeer, a  Rembrandt, a Van Eyck, in their ambiguous drama of everyday life served  directly and indirectly (through graphic reproductions of these paintings) as  sources for 20th-Century film directors and cinematographers.  </P> <P> The important distinction for Hollander is that these painters -- unlike the  great artists of the Italian Renaissance who created more painterly works of  art and focused their viewers' attentions upon "the interplay of color, the  accord of shapes and volumes, the poetry of line, or . . . the dazzling array  of visible strokes dealt by a masterly wrist" -- created an engulfing art, an  art that "comes to claim the viewer, acknowledging no barrier between the  action and his inner life."  </P> <P> The one is theatrical, while the Dutch paintings and their tradition are  essentially dramatic; and so, too, according to Hollander, are films innately  dramatic, being works of art based on a sequence of light that ask the viewer  not to "read" them, but to become immersed in them, sustaining "a drama of  imminent disclosure and incipient revelation."  </P> <P> Movies, accordingly -- that is, "good" movies, good in the way that the Dutch  interiors are good -- engage the viewer in a seemingly endless drama of visual  messages that function just as "real" experience, a series of subjective images  and actions that weave themselves into the individual consciousness. We cannot  "read" a film any more than we can "read" the meaning of life.  </P> <P> For anyone who has seen Vermeer's "The Girl With a Red Hat" at the National  Gallery of Art of Washington, or George de la Tour's "Magdalen With the Smoking  Flame," at the County Museum of Art, and has observed how like a movie still  these paintings are, Hollander's argument seems to make sense. And one  immediately recognizes the relation of such paintings to particular films by  directors as diverse as Jean Renoir, Ingmar Bergman and David Lean.  </P> <P> On the other hand, for anyone who has seen more than a dozen movies, the  comparisons immediately begin to disintegrate. For one quickly recalls that one  of the central structural elements of cinema -- particularly of American cinema  -- is the "play within the film." From the Marx Brothers' comedies to "An  American in Paris," from Melies' early films straight through to the hundreds  of Hollywood studio musicals and comedies of the 1930s and 1940s, one of the  major elements of motion pictures has been staged productions, theatrical  tableaux that break the continuous action of psychological immersion and  display instead their own formal and narrative meanings.  </P> <P> Whether or not such "interruptions" are "inconsistent" with the medium (as  Siegfried Kracauer argues in "Theory of Film") or not, they are a dominant  aspect of film making and one of its major structural devices. And no matter  how one finally judges the "accord of shapes and volumes, the poetry of line,"  and the dazzling formal displays of a Busby Berkeley chorus, one must admit  that it has helped to define and to shape much of today's cinema.  </P> <P> Perhaps these are simply examples of "bad" film making, films that the art  world cannot take seriously. However, we find similar devices in the films of a  great director such as Orson Welles. In all of his films, but particularly in  "The Magnificent Ambersons," Welles stops the dramatic action he so brilliantly  projects elsewhere with montage and cross-cutting by creating staged tableaux.  </P> <P> Within the many scenes of the Amberson staircase, with the characters listening  and whispering. Welles purposely distorts the dramatic reality; through strange  camera angles, theatrical lighting and melodramatic acting techniques. Welles  calls the viewers' attention to the scene. Suspending the so-called dramatic  action, Welles reminds his audience that they are, after all, witnessing a  film, a kind of staged event.  </P> <P> Welles' roots, one recalls, were in theater. And so, too, have been those of  many other directors, who, when they filmed theatrical plays, brought many of  the stage's techniques with them. Even Elia Kazan, a realist at heart, whose  body of work might easily be placed in Hollander's tradition, is overcome by  the theatrical in a film such as "A Streetcar Named Desire." Despite the  intense method acting of Marlon Brando, the film turns into an expressionist  (and mannerist) frieze when Vivien Leigh takes on Tennessee Williams'  poeticized dialogue: Furniture and set disappear and we are left with a frozen  image of romanticized madness as powerful and as painterly as Munch's "The  Scream."  </P> <P> This "theatrical" tradition has been perpetuated by some of today's most  talented film directors. Francis Ford Coppola's unsung "musical," "One From the  Heart," Herbert Ross' dubbed musical "Pennies From Heaven," and Alan Rudolph's  "Choose Me" all present the viewer with a more theatrical cinematic art, an art  that distances both character and audience from the continuous flow of  narrative and permits them to "read" or interpret the preceding action.  </P> <P> Indeed, one might question the whole issue of film being divorced, as it often  is by theorists, from literary readings. Certainly, there is a danger -- one  that Hollander recognizes -- when literary types, such as your reviewer,  attempt to apply the same critical stratagems of fiction and poetry to film. I  well remember when I taught film as a graduate assistant how we were forbidden  by the lecturer to discuss the story or dialogue in our sections; everything  was camera angles and light. Those, of course, are the functional devices of  film; but cinema has always -- even in its silent days -- been interwoven with  language, visual and linguistic. Sitting at the dining table across from Melvyn  Douglas, Garbo may remind us, visually, of Vermeer's red-hatted lady; but for  Lubistch and his viewer, hers is not just any hat but the hat, a hat of  particular ideological significance; for this hat represents for the Soviet  Ninotchka the triviality and corruption of the West. This hat is not simply an  accouterment of a young, innocent girl, but is an emblem of Ninotchka's  conversion to capitalist values; the hat atop her head is funny because it  represents a moment so joyful -- yet so sad.  </P> <P> One of the most exciting aspects of film is its mongrel breeding, encompassing  as it does visual art (including photography), theater, literature, dance and  music. Hollander's attempt to place film in the visual art tradition,  accordingly, is useful if it is seen as part of the larger story. It is one  thing, in short, to say that some film makers have been influenced --  consciously or unconsciously -- by the Dutch tradition of art and have drawn  images and even methodology from these works of art.  </P> <P> But it is quite another thing to claim, as does Hollander, that such art forms  both background and foundation for moving pictures. Both visual art (in the  guise of Clement Greenberg) and fiction (in the critical statements of Robert  Penn Warren and Cleanth Brooks) have been delimited by notions of their proper  lineage. Let film -- the young, eccentric genius -- stay clear of such claims  for its paternity.  </P></p>

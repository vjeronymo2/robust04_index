			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong falls sharply as HSBC drops 3 per cent Active buying by overseas investors and brokers boosted share prices, and the Nikkei 225 average gained ground in spite of a lack of corporate news, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index ended 160.03 firmer at 20,786.36, having opened at the day's low of 20,657.28 and peaked at 20,842.23 in the early afternoon before slipping on small-lot index-linked selling. Volume recovered from 152m shares to 254m. Foreign and brokerage buying helped, and a rise in Nikkei futures prompted index-linked purchases by arbitrageurs. Many domestic investors were absent due to the Obon holidays, while others remained inactive ahead of yesterday's US Federal Reserve Board's open market committee meeting. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 6.30 to 1,658.68, while the Nikkei 300 gained 1.47 at 301.62. Winners led losers by 593 to 334, with 216 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.42 to 1,343.90. Basic material issues, including steels, chemicals and cements, were actively traded. These stocks are seen as beneficiaries of an economic pick-up, and are easily traded due to low share prices. The three most active issues were steels: Nippon Steel rose Y3 to Y375, NKK Y3 to Y288 and Kobe Steel Y7 to Y327. Buying also spread to smaller steelmakers, with Hitachi Metals gaining Y50 at Y1,330 and Nippon Metal Industry, the stainless steel maker, rising Y13 to Y468. Overseas investors supported chemicals. Sumitomo Chemical rose Y6 to a new high for the year of Y572, and Showa Denko added Y4 at Y383. Banks were higher on arbitrage buying. Sakura Bank moved up Y10 to Y1,420, as did Fuji Bank, to Y2,340. Brokers were also stronger, with Nomura Securities up Y30 to Y2,260 and Nikko Securities Y20 better at Y1,230. Retailers, which had gained recently on the rise in consumer spending, met profit-taking. Mitsukoshi receded Y10 to Y1,030 and Ito-Yokado lost Y40 at Y5,220. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 72.22 to 23,065.45 in volume of 32.2m shares. Roundup The region awaited yesterday's meeting of the US Federal Reserve for an announcement on a possible rise in US interest rates - a factor which would have an effect on those countries linked to the dollar. HONG KONG was dragged down by selling of HSBC and Hang Seng Bank following Monday's results, and the Hang Seng index lost 119.51, or 1.26 per cent, to 9,366.62. Turnover remained thin at HKDollars 2.88bn, after HKDollars 2.32bn on Monday. HSBC dropped HKDollars 3 to HKDollars 89, its turnover accounting for 20 per cent of total market activity. Hang Seng Bank fell HKDollars 2.75 to HKDollars 52.25. Brokers said HSBC was likely to slip back to the HKDollars 85 to HK88 range before settling at a new support level. The Hang Seng H share index of Chinese companies slipped 15.92, or 1.2 per cent, to 1,320.97. BANGKOK rallied on heavy buying in the finance and banking sectors against a background of broad but muted selling. The SET index put on 8.30 at 1,461.71 in high turnover of Bt18.1bn. The finance sector rose 2 per cent on good earnings reports. Properties slipped on weak results: Bangkok Land lost Bt1 to Bt79.50 and Tanayong fell Bt1.50 to Bt65.00. KUALA LUMPUR was boosted by an announcement from the central bank that it was to end a ban on swap deals by banks with non-residents in an effort to encourage foreign funds back into the country. The composite index rose 15.38 to 1,108.18 in MDollars 1.9bn turnover. SINGAPORE gained ground on foreign buying of blue chips. The Straits Times Industrial index added 6.82 at 2,308.57, with 192m shares worth SDollars 518m traded. Activity was largely concentrated on Malaysian shares listed in Singapore. Brokers noted that the lifting of the ban on swap transactions in Malaysia drew funds back into the market. SEOUL's composite index shed 4.71 to 939.0 in thin trading, but Samsung Electronics, whose half-year profits tripled, went the day's limit up to this year's high of Won98,900, adding Won2,500. TAIPEI saw its financial and paper sectors rebound after five consecutive days of falls, and an announcement by the Ministry of Finance that it would inject funds into the banking system to ease the tight liquidity. The weighted index rose 40.3 to 6,583.9 in turnover of TDollars 59.07bn. SYDNEY ended at its lowest closing level in more than a month as nervousness about the likelihood of a rise in US interest rates continued to take its toll. The All Ordinaries index fell 15.7 to 2,040.0 in turnover of ADollars 339.3m. BHP declined 22 cents to a three-week low of ADollars 19.22. Bunnings held at ADollars 10.50 after the diversified hardware group said it expected a continued earnings improvement following a 63 per cent increase in annual profits. WELLINGTON lost ground on profit-taking after a post by-election rally at the start of the week. The NZSE-40 capital index ended 14.67 down at 2,082.97 in NZDollars 40.4m turnover. Fletcher Challenge, in particular, was singled out for profit-taking after a strong six months' run, ending 11 cents cheaper at NZDollars 3.93. KARACHI's KSE index shed 23.99 to 2,247.06 as financials and high-priced stocks fell back, and investors squared positions on settlement day. SRI LANKA remained steady in thin election day trading. The composite index rose a marginal 4.6 to 1018.4.</p>

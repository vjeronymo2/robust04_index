			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Celestion on track with Pounds 11,000 AN EXTENSIVE restructuring at Celestion Industries, which now concentrates on supplying lingerie and womens' swimwear almost exclusively to Marks and Spencer, saw the company return to the black last year after disposing of its audio division and Slix swimwear brand. Pre-tax profits in 1992 were just Pounds 11,000 after a 1991 loss of Pounds 1.06m. But profits on continuing business more than trebled to Pounds 1.42m (Pounds 395,000). A similar picture applied to sales. Overall turnover was Pounds 35.5m (Pounds 36.6m). But after stripping out results from Celestion Audio, sold last June, and Slix, sold in December, turnover for the remaining core business rose by 46 per cent to Pounds 28.9m (Pounds 19.8m). Operating losses from the audio division and Slix totalled Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 1.03m). There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 522,000 relating to the disposal of the businesses. Mr Charles Ryder, chief executive, said the disposals left Celestion free to concentrate on building its business with M&amp;S through Celestion Textiles and Vega, a lingerie supplier acquired last September. He expected sales growth in Celestion Textiles this year to be in line with the 30 per cent achieved in 1992. Earnings per share were 0.2p (5.1p losses). The single dividend is increased 17 per cent to 1.4p (1.2p).</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Observer: Gerry joins up The vacuum at the top of the Institute for Public Policy Research, the left-leaning think-tank, is to be filled by a middle-aged City scribbler. Gerry Holtham, 49, Lehman Brothers' international economics guru, has been leant on to take the job after the front-runner - Patricia Hewitt, the IPPR's telegenic deputy director - went off to make some money as a management consultant. Holtham has a lower pink profile than the likes of Goldman Sachs millionaire Gavyn Davies or Citibank's Neil Mackinnon. But he has a sound, if unexciting, pedigree - 10 years with the OECD in Paris, and he was an adviser to the shadow Treasury team. If Holtham can get the IPPR to figure more prominently in Labour's economic policy debates he might be rewarded with a walk-on role in any future Labour administration. In the meantime, his departure leaves a big hole in Lehman's economic think-tank since Ruth Lea, the chief UK economist, leaves at the end of the month to be Channel Four's economics editor.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by the Trade Union Information Center under the </F> rubric "FITUR": "The North Does Not Forgive Deceit"]    [Text] At present, our entire country is in a calamitous  situation. However, it is particularly hard on northerners. If  it were not enough that they live under the most severe climatic  conditions, they fail to get their wages for months at a time.    The hopes attached to the enactment of the Law on State  Guarantees and Compensation for Individuals Working and Residing  in the Regions of the Far North and Areas Equated With Them on 1  June 1993 were dashed. A number of statesmen have come to wish  for the northerners to be deprived of even the relief envisioned  in the document. As we have learned, this was discussed on 13  December 1993 at a conference with First Deputy Prime Minister  Ye. Gaydar (by now, the former first deputy prime minister). On  instructions from the conference, the Ministry of Finance  prepared for the government proposals of precisely this nature  to be subsequently submitted to the Federal Assembly.    The FITUR [Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia]  considers such a decision impermissible. Social tension in a  number of northern regions has reached the limit; the labor  collectives of many industries are on a pre-strike status.  Because of this, the FITUR was forced to approach the head of  the government, V. Chernomyrdin, as well as the chairman of the  State Duma, I. Rybkin, with the request to provide for  reinforcement of rather than reduction in socioeconomic  protections for the residents of the North.    What caused this? The law proposed by the Ministry of  Finance  omits the highly significant words "state guarantees and  compensation." The reference is simply to "guarantees and  compensation". That is to say, it is proposed that the issues of  survival be resolved on the principle "to rescue the drowning is  up to the drowning themselves." This begs a reasonable question:  Why does a state need rulers who do not guarantee anything to  their subjects?    How does the Ministry of Finance justify the intention to  omit the guarantees of the payment of regional coefficients and  percentage bonuses in addition to the wages of the northerners?  By the fact that the list of areas classified as regions of the  Far North and localities equated with them has been changing  continuously. (What if the North Caucasus lays a claim to  preferences tomorrow?) However, the northerners will get a great  "benefit" from a proposal in Article 12: "The combined volume of  the payment of regional coefficients and percentage bonuses in  addition to the wage of one worker per month shall be restricted  to six times the minimum monthly volume of remuneration for  labor."    One gets the impression that the people in the Ministry of  Finance are simply unaware of the fact that regional  coefficients and bonuses were introduced in the North in  conjunction with sharp differences between local prices for  consumer goods, foodstuffs, and services from prices "on the  mainland." They were introduced in conjunction with special  geographic, natural, and climatic conditions of the North. As  residents of these regions state, the cancellation of  coefficients and bonuses will reduce their wages by 60 percent.  Between 70 and 75 percent of employees will end up below the  physiological subsistence minimum.    The losses that northerners will suffer, if the proposals of  the Ministry of Finance are accepted, are not restricted to  those enumerated. Preferences for women and a block of articles  concerning retirement benefits will also be abolished. Extra  leave and the right to free passage to the site of vacation, the  right to tax relief for enterprises manufacturing consumer goods  and agricultural products, and so on will be restricted.    Of course, we cannot say that the developers of proposals  that infringe on the rights of Northerners have acted on their  own whim. They were prompted to do so by the most acute crisis  in the economy. At the same time, they cannot slice through  living flesh in this way, dooming millions of our fellow  citizens to the status of Siberian hostages.    [Signed] Trade Union Information Center.</p>

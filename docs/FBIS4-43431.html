			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Mr Clarke's Optimism"] </F>   [Text] The Chancellor of the Exchequer cannot have been  displeased by the statistical auspices on the eve of his annual  Mansion House speech last night. A raft of encouraging numbers  shows unemployment down, inflation still subdued and wage  increases in modest decline, after some months of worrying  increase. These figures served to emphasise Mr Kenneth Clarke's  message that a period of sustained noninflationary growth is now  in prospect.    Every Chancellor must juggle two audiences -- the voters and  the markets. Conventional wisdom holds that their interests --  and especially their ideas on public spending -- inevitably  diverge. Last night, with several years to go before the next  electoral reckoning, there was no doubt which audience Mr Clarke  was looking harder at. Particularly after the recent turbulence  in the world's bond markets, a man with a 38 billion pound  deficit to fund cannot take chances with the City. Growth, he  assured his listeners, will be responsible. Tax cuts were  promised, but with strict qualifications: "low expenditure is  the key to lower taxes"; taxes will be cut again "only when we  can afford to do so and not before we can afford to do so."    Tax cuts are, of course, what many in his panicky party  would  most like to hear about, but the days are gone when a Government  could buy easy popularity with a shilling off a packet of 20 and  a penny off income tax. Over the past five years the public has  had to relearn the hard way the lessons of the 1970's, that  inflation and excessive deficits are painful and dangerous. In  that sense, the gap between the financial markets and the wider  world has narrowed. Tax cuts which the markets deem  irresponsible would soon prove politically counter-productive.  Yet it remains arguable that, unless the Conservatives can  deliver or credibly promise some reduction in taxation before  the next election, they will offer little if anything to  differentiate themselves from a refurbished Labour Party.    The question for Mr Clarke, therefore, is how genuine scope  can be found for reducing some of the extra imposts with which  he and his predecessor have burdened us. On this, the  Chancellor had little to say beyond reaffirming his aim of  getting public expenditure back beneath 40 per cent of Gross  National Product in the medium term. On present plans, that is  not due to happen during this parliament.    Here, the spotlight switches to Mr Michael Portillo, Chief  Secretary to the Treasury and darling of the tax-cutting Tory  Right. Mr Portillo is in charge of public expenditure. He is  also charged with carrying out "fundamental reviews" of various  departments' spending -- including the massive 80 billion pound  Social Security budget. If meaningful savings are to be found,  they will have to come through these reviews. So far, ominously  little has been heard of them, either officially or via  anguished leaks from their targets.    In most respects, Mr Clarke's optimism last night was well  founded. The economy is again growing reasonably strongly.  Thanks to the supply side reforms of the past 15 years, we are  better able than most of our European partners to face the  changes and challenges that confront all developed countries.  With a semi-independent Bank of England anxious to win its  spurs, it should even be possible to keep inflation under  control. But, if Mr Clarke wishes to present himself at the  next election as the man who reduced taxes as well as increased  them, he and Mr Portillo will have to show more mettle in the  forthcoming public expenditure round than they have so far  managed, and it is difficult to be optimistic that they will  succeed.</p>

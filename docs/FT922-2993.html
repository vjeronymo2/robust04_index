			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Books: Before and after the Shah DAUGHTER OF PERSIA by Sattareh Farman Farmaian Bantam Pounds 16.99, 404 pages IT HAS become fashionable for exiled Iranians to reminisce, mourning the passing of a 'Persia' filled with the scent of pomegranates and the loyalty of loving servants. These accounts are usually written by those deeply embarrassed by Ayatollah Khomeini's lslamic Republic and anxious to show the West that an Iran other than one populated with black-turbanned mullahs once existed. The strength of Farman Farmaian's book is that she records events that most families - much less an upper class Iranian one - might choose to ignore. Such as the time her mother, fed up with having constantly to harangue her husband for money, used his electric bullhorn to broadcast to the whole neighbourhood that his children had no shoes. Or that financial and other pressures on her mother resulted in her hitting Sattareh as a little girl. Sattareh was one of 36 children born to Abdol Hossein Mirza Farman Farma, a relative of the Qajar family which ruled Iran for several hundred years until the beginning of this century. The description of her childhood years are the most fascinating in the book. Sattareh was brought up with her siblings and four of her father's eight wives in his large compound in Tehran. 'I accepted his rule, as did everyone, with fear and reverence and distant adoration. He was the lodestar of our busy cosmos and his will held it together.' Despite having a harem and an autocratic disposition, Farman Farma valued a good education for his children, whether male or female. To this end, Sattareh was able to persuade her mother, after her father's death, to allow her to go to the US to study social work. Since the Farman Farmaians were involved in Iranian politics, the autobiography is rooted in the political turmoil afflicting Iran and its immediate effect on Sattareh's family. The ascent of Reza Shah meant the forcible loss of much of their land to him. Sattareh, like many others was delighted at his overthrow, albeit at the hands of the British, during the Second World War. She is good at explaining the process by which Iranians came to hate the US. As a young girl, she admired the US because of the value she thought it set on liberty and democracy in contrast to the imperialism of the British. But once Dr Mohammad Mossadegh, who nationalised the Anglo-Iranian oil company, came to power in 1951, 'It was the beginning of a long, complex tragedy that would alter forever what I and other Iranians felt about America.' Mossadegh was overthrown in a CIA-funded operation drawn up by an irate British government. Once back in Iran, Sattareh founded the Tehran School of Social Work. But Sattareh was to see her life's work in ruins when Islamic students took over the school during the 1979 revolution and compiled a dossier denouncing her as a counter-revolutionary. The author's role as a self-appointed saviour of her country can be wearing, but her story and her views are not predictable, nor does she attempt to portray herself and her family as innocent victims of fanatical mullahs. 'We, who should have been teachers of the ignorant, did not set an example of leadership, did not sacrifice ourselves, our careers, our cherished dreams, to protest what the Shah was doing to us . . . Unlike us, the mullahs had had guts. They had endured jail and exile. They had let themselves be beaten, tortured, and killed to destroy the Shah.'</p>

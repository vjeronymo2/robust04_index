			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers' diamond sales hold up DIAMOND SALES by the Central Selling Organisation, through which De Beers of South Africa controls 80 per cent of world rough (uncut) diamond trade, last year fell by 6 per cent or USDollars 240m from the 1990 level to Dollars 3.927bn. The CSO said demand for both uncut and polished diamonds was 'flat' for the whole of last year and no rebound could be expected until 1993. The sales figures were at the upper end of analysts' expectations - forecasts ranged between Dollars 3.6bn and Dollars 4bn. Analysts said the results illustrated how the CSO has been able to sustain the diamond market in the most dire conditions. In 1991 it had to cope with recession, the Gulf war and the inability for much of the year of the Indian cutting houses to pay for diamonds because of their government's foreign exchange restrictions. 'This is a very good result and will please a lot of people,' said Mr Vincent Tattersall, analyst with Williams de Broe, stockbrokers. 'The (diamond) this will give it heart.' The CSO also reassured traders by saying that its Dollars 5bn five-year deal to market Soviet rough diamonds would continue with a new partner, Rosalmazzoloto of Russia. The CSO has also recently concluded new five-year marketing agreements with Angola, Australia and Botswana. The organisation will also maintain promotional spending on diamonds at about Dollars 150m. 'Stocks are not overly high in the major consumer markets which means that, once a better consumer environment takes shape, increased demand for rough diamonds should follow,' the CSO stated. The organisation insisted that the highly-publicised financial problems of two big jewellery chains, Zales in the US and Ratners of the UK, was unlikely to make much of a difference to the diamond market 'except for sentiment'. The CSO has not increased prices since March 1990 (when they rose by an average of 5.5 per cent). Against calls for a March increase, the organisation said yesterday: 'You can only think about price increases when the market can sustain them - and it does not look that way at the moment.' In the two biggest retail markets, analysts suggested that destocking by US retailers had probably ended but Japanese retailers would continue to destock for three months.</p>

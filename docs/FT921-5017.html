			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Arts: Rare operas produced in Lyon and Geneva / Review of Busoni's 'Turandot' and Berlioz's 'Benvenuto Cellini' All that remains of the dear old Opera building in the centre of Lyon is its four stone walls, which will provide the shell for a new multi-storey theatre complex opening in May next year. The project speaks of a risk-taking spirit, tons of public money and a mission to extend opera's contemporary appeal - just the combination which has helped the Opera de Lyon to maintain a high-quality profile during these past six years of enforced homelessness. The current season includes both Puccini's Turandot and Busoni's earlier, German-language opera of the same name, last revived at Wexford in 1988 after a long period of neglect. Perhaps things are beginning to look up for Busoni. After four staged performances in the Auditorium Maurice Ravel, Turandot will be commercially recorded together with Arlecchino, which was premiered on the same bill in Zurich in 1917. The Lyon production made just about the strongest imaginable case for the Busoni work. Staged by Henry Akina and conducted by Kent Nagano, Turandot came over as a compact, highly-charged blockbuster. Busoni reveals himself as a master-technician: the dramatic structure is taut, the scene-painting swift and punchy. Turandot's three riddles - with more than a musical whiff of the Wanderer-Mime encounter at the beginning of Siegfried - are answered by the end of the first act, and the whole show is over in 90 minutes. The music is a pot-pourri of sounds and styles - neo-Romantic harmonies, oriental pastiche, even some choral variations on 'Greensleeves' - none of which lingers long enough to become tiresome. The plot, too, is a bit of a hybrid, largely because Busoni took Gozzi much more to heart than Puccini did. In Busoni's hands, Chinese antiquity ranks as little more than an incidental setting for the marriage of Italian commedia dell'arte to post-Wagnerian music-theatre - a bit like Ariadne auf Naxos, but with a pronounced air of tragi-comedy. This collision of cultures was the key to Ric Schachtebeck's designs for the Lyon production. The stage - a triangular platform free of the usual proscenium constrictions - was dominated by a pair of expressionist panels, decorated with three Chinese riddle-motifs and flanked by a sloping rubbish-dump of masks and theatrical accessories. The costumes ran the gamut from oriental black head-dresses to ceremonial morning suits, while Calaf and Turandot looked as if they had dropped in from a 1950s film set. The performance began with an enigmatic (and unnecessarily long-winded mime, Altoum appeared in a wheelchair, the male chorus periodically swarmed onto the stage from trap-doors and the ending was pure Hollywood. However you describe it - comic anarchy, an operatic Theatre of the Absurd - the approach somehow made dramatic sense. Akina, a Hawaian who directs the Berlin Chamber Opera, gave a sharp focus to the key confrontations and drew strongly-characterised performances from everyone on stage. After briefly doubling as Queen Mother of Samarkand in the opening scene, Karen Huffstodt portrayed Turandot as a fiery, glamorous red-head, singing with ample, steady tone. The elegant young Swedish tenor, Stefan Dahlberg, gave an equally fearless performance as Calaf. In the bass role of Emperor Altoum, Franz Hawlata delivered a brilliant cameo and sang beautifully. Helene Perraguin was a rather pale Adelma, and Bruce Brewer no longer has the voice for Truffaldino. The choral and orchestral contributions were beyond criticism: Kent Nagano deserves credit above all for capturing the exotic, energetic exhilaration of this chameleon-like score. The new production of Benvenuto Cellini at Geneva's Grand Theatre will not go down as one of the highlights of the season, but it was a courageous stab at an impossible work. The challenge of Berlioz's rarely-staged first opera lies in bridging the chasm between its intimate opera-comique origins and its exalted ambition. The only unifying element is the music, a reckless fireball of invention which demands virtuosity and flouts convention. Thanks to an electrifying performance by the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande under the eminent Berliozian John Nelson, the originality of the score could be properly appreciated - its romantic colouring, its impatient energy, its dazzling profusion of rhythm and cross-rhythm. But the problems of dramatic structure and proportion remain, as Francesca Zambello's production illustrated all too clearly. Her solution was to explore a vein of comic satire running through the work, bathing it in the visual atmosphere of renaissance Rome. It would certainly be hard to imagine a wittier Cellini. The stage was framed in the theatrical parentheses of commedia dell'arte, with a group of mimes discreetly oiling the wheels of the plot. John Macfarlane's designs, imaginatively lit by Davy Cunningham, included an ingenious trompe-l'oeil room of cloth walls and flaps for the opening scenes, the farcical overtones of which were exploited to the full. There was also a delicious air of mock seriousness about the papal visitation in the final act. What the staging lacked was convincing spectacle. The carnival, acted out beneath a series of tall wooden gate-frames, was feebly animated and unimpressively sung by the Geneva chorus. The final forging scene huffed and puffed, but looked artificial. In the end, Zambello failed to resolve the work's split personality - a Falstaffian love story belatedly recast as a parable of heroic artistic struggle. It was hard to treat Cellini's final burst of creativity as anything more than a joke. The title role was elegantly sung by Chris Merritt, whose bright timbre and high vocal extension brought out the music's Italianate charm. He is rare among his tenor colleagues in never seeking to hog the limelight. But his tubby, somewhat camp stage appearance robbed him of the romantic guise necessary for the part. As Teresa, the Australian soprano Deborah Riedel made a strong impression, singing with clear, expressive tone and acting with a discreet twinkle in her eye. As the crusty old bureaucrat Balducci and the hapless suitor Fieramosca, Jean-Philippe Courtis and Jeffrey Black very nearly stole the show with their superbly-realised comic double-act.</p>

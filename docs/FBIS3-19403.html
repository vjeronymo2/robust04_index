Last week, the  foreign ministers of Ukraine and Azerbeijan were here; this  week, the Hungarian prime minister, the Belarus foreign  minister, and the foreign policy commission of the Czech  parliament appeared; and next week, the foreign ministers of  Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are expected.    Why does Germany attract them all like a magnet? Because for  our Eastern neighbors, we are the bridge to Europe, and  simultaneously a model for the ascent from politican and  economic destruction. Just as the Germans after the collapse of  1945 built a flourishing community from ruins and have preserved  to this day a much-envied measure of stability and prosperity,  the people in the East want to do the same--and use German  advice and German support for it. This wish was strengthened by  the fact that the FRG itself is integrating into its political  and economic system a formerly communist constituent state; that  furthermore, it is not a great power in the classical sense and  hence more attractive to many in the East than the old Western  powers.    Actually, the trust resulting from this--beyond the known  financial assistance--has already led to a dense network of  connections. Important in it are the vocational and professional  trainers who are sent from Germany to the neighboring Eastern  states to provide practical assistance and establish the dual  educational system considered worthy of emulation. A second arm  of the Trust Agency, the Trust Agency East, does privatization  consulting in the East. The Reconstruction Loan Corporation is  represented in all Central and East European states and in all  CIS countries.    Especially effective is a private senior experts service  headquartered in Bonn, which aids the governments of the reform  countries in getting qualified expert consultants: Retirees help  in building up democratic structures, even in establishing a  foreign service. For example, a chief of government asked for a  consultant to explain to him from case to case to which  institutions and persons in West Europe he can turn. Quite  officially, young diplomats of the Central and East European  countries and the CIS states are being trained in Germany. In  two training courses with 25 participants annually, the Bonn  Foreign Office sees to the adjustment to Western ways of  thinking and behavior.    An expert summarized: "We are on hand everywhere in  practical  reform work." Against this background, prominent politicians  also flock to Bonn to ensure cooperation on concrete questions.  Thus the chief of the Belarus foreign office, Petr Kravchanka,  sought assistance from colleague Kinkel for the victims of  Chernobyl and financial aid for the destruction of 2,000 former  Soviet tanks, withdrawn from eastern Germany and left behind in  Belarus. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Anatoly Slenko, was  primarily concerned with cooperation in economic reforms.    Hungary's head of government, Peter Boross, beyond details,  wanted to nail down--like all his colleagues in Central, East,  and southeast Europe--a more general support by the federal  chancellor for the road to membership in the European Union [EU]  and NATO. And one does not need much imagination to predict that  next Wednesday [9 March], the three Baltic foreign ministers  will emphatically demand German solidarity for their peoples,  menaced by new greater-Russian emotions.    The new responsibility stemming from this is immense for the  Federal Government. It is furthermore complicated by the fact  that certain aspects of cooperation are contradictory within  themselves:    How is one to lead the East and Central Europeans to the EU  and NATO and at the same time satisfy the Russian president,  esteemed as a partner, with his totally different views? And how  does the desired strengthening of the Baltic states fit into  this? These are questions confronting Kohl and Kinkel. Good will  alone is not enough to answer them conclusively.</p>

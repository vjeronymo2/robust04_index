			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report on interview with Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, </F> member of the Political Bureau of the Islamic Resistance  Movement, in Damascus; date not given]    [Text] Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, member of the Political Bureau  of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), has denied the  existence in Hamas of a trend that supports the Oslo agreement  or participation in the elections "at the present time." He  affirmed that the Movement "is immune to division" and that its  detained cadres did not sign the document pledging not to resort  to violence except after the deletion of the part on support for  the Oslo agreement.    He said that the truce with Israel has been there since the  birth of Israel and that "it did not mean recognition, just  postponement of the conflict."    In an interview with AL-HAYAH, Abu-Marzuq said that all the  Hamas detainees had refused to sign the document, "which was  rejected by Hamas because it included support (for the Oslo  agreement) and nonopposition to the recent agreements between  the PLO and Israel." He said that "when that provision was  deleted and the old version, which the detainees used to sign,  was revived, the central command in the prisons ordered the  Movement's detainees to sign, with the exception of that command  itself."    In his interview, which was held in Damascus, the Hamas  Political Bureau member reaffirmed Hamas' position on the  autonomy authority, "which has not changed. We oppose it (the  agreement) politically and at the popular level and we seek to  mobilize the people against it in order to revoke it and  preserve the Palestinian people's rights to their territory,  full and undiminished." He said that the Israeli forces did not  withdraw from Gaza and Jericho. We did not feel their  withdrawal. They were redeployed. That is why our firm policy  is to resist and confront the occupation." [quotation mark as  published]    Abu-Marzuq said that the expected elections in Gaza and  Jericho "are bound by ceilings imposed by the Oslo and Cairo  agreements. They will not be free elections and will be a  violation of the Palestinian people's right to say what kind of  leadership they want and what political course relects their  views." He asked: "What is the meaning of elections while  there is Israeli occupation and sovereignty on the ground? The  elections should be rejected and there should be no  participation in them. The arena is not restricted to  (President) Yasir 'Arafat and Fatah. We challenge them to first  hold a Palestinian referendum on the agreement itself to find  out what the people think first." He said that Fatah would be  risking its history and future when it comes inside [the  territories] and participates in the elections.    Asked about the existence of a trend in Hamas that supported  participation in the elections, he replied: "The Movement's  general trend and unanimous view is refusal to participate at  this stage. We are not required to politicize our cadres. We  want to prepare them for resistance against the occupation and  for the preservation of the Palestinian people's rights."    Abu-Marzuq, who visited Damascus recently and attended the  meeting of the Central Command of the Alliance of Palestinian  Forces [APF], said that "the truce (with Israel) has been in  existence since the emergence of the enemy state. The lines  between the Arab states and the enemy state are armistice lines  but a truce does not mean recognition, just a postponement of  the conflict."    He stressed that Hamas is immune to division. He said: "We  are a Palestinian faction, but to apply factional divisions to  us is out of the question. Abu-'Ammar ['Arafat] tried the  various skills he used on others but failed with us. I do not  believe that his movement is as immune to division as Hamas."  He added that he has been hearing about a split "for years, but  it never occurred."    He denied that it is coming under pressure from any party.  He asked: "Where are the parties which back us and support the  agreement? What form of aid do they give us? What pressures  would they put on the Movement if it continued to oppose the  agreement?" He emphasized that the Hamas leadership makes the  political decisions "and it knows that its decisions stem from  its own institutions, and nobody has the means to put pressure  on us." He affirmed that no one in Hamas supported the  Gaza-Jericho agreement "whether inside or outside [the  territories]."    On his meeting with [Syrian] Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim  Khaddam and Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' two days ago,  Abu-Marzuq said that the two meetings were held "in the course  of the Movement's political moves to hold consultations, explain  its positions, and discuss a better future for our region." He  added that the two meetings "strengthened steadfastness against  the designs aimed at splitting the positions which reflect the  nation's hopes and aspirations."</p>

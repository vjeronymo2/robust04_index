			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Possible Bid for Dunkin' Donuts: Kingsbridge Capital Group, which announced  last month that it had acquired a 7.6% stake in Dunkin' Donuts, said it wants  to meet with Dunkin's chairman to discuss acquiring the firm and may offer $42  a share, or $300 million. Shares of Dunkin' Donuts, which has vowed to remain  independent, shot up $5.25 a share to $40 on news of the announcement before  closing at $39.875. Kingsbridge is a unit of Unicorp Canada Corp. An arbitrager  said the company could be worth $55 a share in a takeover, noting that it holds  a dominant position in its industry and has had 15 consecutive years of  earnings gains. Dunkin' Donuts has about 1,500 doughnut shop franchises in the  United States that carry the firm's name and 221 shops abroad.  </P></p>

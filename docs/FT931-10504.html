			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Tuskar thwarts bid attempt Shareholders in Tuskar Resources, the Dublin-based oil and gas company, have thwarted a takeover attempt from fellow Irish resource company, Aminex, by voting overwhelmingly for the purchase of Shenandoah Expro, a North Sea subsidiary of Bula Resources, which holds a 0.90628 per cent interest in the Buchan Oil Field. Aminex said its Pounds 2.75m offer for Tuskar, launched last month, would not proceed if the purchase was approved.</p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Revival in gilts set to continue - Despite political concerns, prospects are bright / Outlook 95 A dark and bruising year for investors in UK government bonds finally draws to a close. The prospect for gilts next year looks a lot brighter but political uncertainty could again cast a shadow over the market. Concerns about the pace of economic growth, inflation and rising interest rates will no doubt continue to dominate market sentiment. But further displays of anti-inflationary zeal by the UK authorities, a more benign international environment and proposed gilt market reforms promising greater transparency and liquidity should support prices. Gilts began this year in a positive mood, with the yield on the 10-year benchmark bond at a low of 6.1 per cent in January. What happened next has been well-documented - a turn upwards in US interest rates in February, the unwinding of speculative bond positions by highly-leveraged funds and bond investors fleeing the market at the prospect of rising inflation and higher interest rates worldwide. The US, much further advanced in the economic cycle, led the way. In spite of much talk of 'decoupling', European countries, many barely out of recession, followed suit. An explosion in German money supply growth added to the jitters and the UK, with strong economic growth and a poor record on inflation, was badly hit. Gilt yields climbed to around 9 per cent by September. Part of this 300 basis point rise was due to the increase in real yields, attributable to stronger economic growth: the yield on index-linked bonds rose by more than 100 basis points to 3.9 per cent in September. The remainder was due to a rise in inflation expectations and a risk premium associated with, for example, political uncertainty. The difference between nominal and index-linked yields, a rough measure of inflation expectations, jumped from 3.2 per cent at the turn of the year to 5.1 per cent by September, while actual inflation averaged around 2.4 per cent - a clear sign that the markets doubted the authorities' ability to keep inflation under control. Since the autumn, however, things have changed. There have been modest signs of stability, as yields have fallen back to 8.5 per cent, and the proportion of that yield due to inflation expectations has shrunk. The Treasury and the Bank of England can take much of the credit, having promoted the transparency of economic policy. They produce monthly inflation reports and publish minutes of monthly meetings between the chancellor and the Bank governor. Most important, however, they have twice raised interest rates - in September and in December - to leave base rates at 6.25 per cent. The rises were well received by the markets as timely and aggressive moves to head off inflation. At last, it seems, gilt investors are beginning to believe the authorities are committed to keeping inflation low. It was their reluctance to do so that caused much of the this year's difficulties. 'Gradually, more and more sceptics are being won over,' said Mr Ian Shepherdson of Midland Global Markets. 'Next year is going to see a coming together of the actual economic fundamentals and what the market perceives them to be - something which has not happened this year.' Mr Kevin Adams of BZW agrees: 'Hopefully, 1995 will be a year in which the market begins to see that the authorities are operating in a pre-emptive fashion to ensure inflation remains subdued.' He thinks next year will see a flattening of the yield curve, with the spread between short and long maturities narrowing to less than 100 basis points, and the spread against German bund yields falling for a time to below 100 basis points. He says that one crucial question for next year is the size of the UK output gap - the difference between the actual growth rate in an economy and its theoretical potential growth rate if all spare capacity were used. This will determine how much longer the UK economy can grow at above-trend growth before beginning to overheat. The OECD estimates the gap at 4 per cent. With trend growth rate estimated at around 2 1/2 per cent, this means the UK economy could have two to three years to continue growing at a rate of around 3 1/2 per cent before inflationary pressures begin to emerge. Another boost to the gilt market next year is likely to come from an improvement in government finances. This year's busy funding programme weighed heavily on the gilt market early in the year, but the public sector borrowing requirement is now expected to fall from Pounds 34.5bn in 1994-95 to Pounds 21.5bn in 1995-96. Further good news should come from various structural reviews. A gilt 'repo' market and a calendar for gilt auctions are being considered, both of which would make the market more attractive to international investors. There is also the possibility of legislation forcing pension funds to hold more gilts rather than equities. 'This would provide a new boost for gilts from overseas flows,' said Mr Mark Reckless of at SG Warburg, who estimates the impact could be 10 to 15 basis points narrowing across the yield curve. However, perhaps the overriding influence on gilts next year will be the international environment. 'This should be supportive, particularly with the US economy slowing and (US) interest rates near their peak,' said Mr Adams. Others are more cautious. Mr Paul Cavalier of Lombard Odier said: 'Any progress will be limited, with growth picking up across Europe and interest rates heading upwards,' although there is the potential for the UK to perform the best of the European markets. Towards the end of next year, however, political concerns may begin to weigh heavily on the gilt market as investors begin to worry that the government, lagging in the opinion polls, will be tempted to cut taxes to engineer a pre-election boom. The signs are that the modest revival in gilts will continue, at least for the first half of 1995. There will be no dramatic recovery. But if the authorities do not convince the markets that they are prepared to be as strict on fiscal policy as they are on monetary policy, then any progress could easily be undone.</p>

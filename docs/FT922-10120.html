			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / How To Spend It: The best platform for dancefloor poseurs - The shoe sculptures of Michel Perry IF YOU glance around any of the hot Paris nightclubs, such as the Folies Pigalle or Les Bains, it sometimes seems as though every self-respecting girl on the dancefloor is wearing a pair of Michel Perry platform shoes. Perry used to be one of the best kept secrets in Paris. For years the fashion parties and art openings in the city have been packed with Parisiennes shod in his spindly stilettos. Now he sells his shoes further afield to shops such as Joseph in London and Barney's in New York. What makes the 42-year-old Perry different from most of the current crop of fashionable shoe designers is that he does not design for a particular type of woman. 'It's a question of esprit, of attitude,' he says. 'My shoes are for women of all ages, from girls of 17 to women in their 50s.' The cast list of his customers bears this out. The funkier styles are snapped up by super-models, such as Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer, or by the new generation of French stars, like Vanessa Paradis, the pouting 'tweetiepie' in Chanel's Coco commercial. But Elizabeth Taylor, a star of a very different vintage, picked up a pair of Michel Perry's while she was shopping in New York. His collection is certainly eclectic. The spring range, now being sold from his pretty pink and yellow shops on the rue de Grenelle in St Germain and rue de Turbigo near Les Halles, includes elegant '50s stilettos and dainty mules which could be worn anywhere, however smart, as well as the platforms. Perry sees his shoes as 'archetypally French, very sexy, always elegant but with a witty twist'. He takes classic styles such as mules or stilettos and makes them in new colours - pale pastels for this season  - with distinctive heels in square or circular shapes. His designs are always idiosyncratic, but never too much so. 'I like my shoes to be witty, but never to the point of caricature like some of the young English designers.' Each collection has a different theme. This summer he was inspired by images of 'haute couture in the late 1950s' and the 'elegance of Paris after the war'. For next autumn, he has gone for a 'more decadent look, a little Moulin Rouge, a little Baroque' with high-heeled boots embellished with the sort of buckles and straps which would not look too out of place in the shop windows of the seedy Saint Denis district near his rue Turbigo shop, and a 'Roman Holiday' range of dapper brogues with flat heels and very, very pointed toes. His prices are about the same as those of his compatriots, Robert Clergerie and Stephane Kelian, at around Pounds 150 a pair, and his shoes are made to a similar standard. All his shoes are made in the same factory near Venice that he has worked with for ten years. 'It's an artisan sophistique, not too big and not too small. My shoes designs have so many little details that the shoes are difficult to make. It is the only place I've ever found that can do exactly what I want.' Perry now employs seven people in Paris and makes 30,000 shoes a year at the Italian factory. His business is expanding - a new shop, his first outside France, opens in Madrid later this month - but he does not want it to get much bigger. 'There will only ever be a limited market for my shoes,' he says. 'In any case, I want to spend my time designing, not trying to be a businessman.'</p>

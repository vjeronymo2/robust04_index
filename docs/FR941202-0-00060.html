			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Twenty-seven comments were received. Four of the commenters were entirely in favor of the proposed regulatory amendments as written and suggested no changes. Twenty-three commenters opposed the proposals. The comments in opposition are discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All of the commenters opposing the proposed rule indicated that the proposed conditional release period of 180 days on all textile importations did not take into account the commercial reality of textile importation and distribution. Textile and apparel sales are subject to seasonal requirements and stylistic variables, and the commenters charged that it would be commercially untenable to maintain on hand seven months worth of inventory in order to be insulated from any liability for possible redelivery violations. Many of the commenters noted that they operate in a ``just in time'' environment so that as little inventory as possible remains on hand. It was generally agreed upon by the negative commenters that the proposed rule would impose a significant economic burden on the legitimate importer but that the nefarious importer would continue to operate without regard for any possible consequence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Customs response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Customs recognizes that some potential economic risk would result from the establishment of the 180-day conditional release period. As noted in the analysis of the following comment made with regard to the proposal, Customs acknowledges the potential economic hardship that might be caused by a sweeping regulation and, therefore, has drawn the conditions upon which redelivery can be based narrowly so as to affect as few entries as possible. In weighing the economic harm caused by illegally transshipped goods against the potential liability incurred by an importer because of the extension of the 30-day redelivery period, Customs believes that this objection to the proposed amendment does not constitute a sufficient basis for not proceeding with a final rule on this matter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All of the commenters opposed to the proposed regulation stated that it was overly broad, noting that the proposed text would apply a 180-day conditional release period to all textile and apparel entries on any issue of admissibility, including issues of classification, valuation or duty assessment. The following observation was typical of the comments submitted on this point: Although the release period modification was intended to address the assumed abundance of transshipment violations, importers may be exposed to liability merely for instances of classification/quota category disputes; Customs will therefore have the opportunity to penalize importers for matters independent of the intentions of the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Customs response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Customs agrees that the sweep of the proposed regulation is too broad. Accordingly, the regulatory text in question, as set forth below, has been redrafted to establish a conditional release period of 180 days for textiles and textile products only for purposes of determining whether a transshipment violation has occurred. This narrowing of the scope of the regulation will serve to alleviate many of the concerns of risk raised by the commenters. The 180-day period would not be applicable to issues of classification, valuation or other issues of admissibility not related to a transshipment violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters suggested that the proposed rule directly violates section 621 of the Customs Modernization (hereinafter the ``Mod Act'') provisions contained in Title VI of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Public Law 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 2057). These commenters asserted that under the Mod Act provisions and the intent of the Congress expressed therein, an importer is held to a standard of ``reasonable care'' in discharging those entry and related activities for which he is responsible. Failure to maintain that standard will result in assessment of penalties for violation of the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1592. The commenters claimed that Customs, through liquidated damages assessment, is gutting the reasonable care concept and imposing a strict liability standard on a situation which Customs admits cannot be sanctioned through a 1592 action due to a failure of proof. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Customs response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Customs does not agree with this analysis. By acting as importer of record, an importer or broker knowingly accepts the terms of the Basic Importation and Entry Bond. When a transshipment violation occurs, the importation of violative goods into the United States results. Compensation for that harm, which is the purpose of a liquidated damage claim, is not readily quantifiable and need not be based upon a finding of culpability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

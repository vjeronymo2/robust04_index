			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DESIGN LIGHTING TO ACCENT GARDEN  </P> <P> Outdoor lights can dramatize your house and yard, letting you enjoy your garden  or pool for longer periods during the day while increasing security.  </P> <P> You can set up a lighting design of your own by using one of the new  low-voltage lighting kits that contain all the essentials -- stake or mounted  fixtures, transformer, cords and switches.  </P> <P> One maker of the kits, Toro, has advice for ways to get the most pleasing and  professional-looking results:  </P> <P> First, draw a scale plan of your yard on graph paper, showing location of paths  or walks, gardens, statuary and the house.  </P> <P> Note any architectural details you'd like to play up or utility areas you want  to play down. Identify focal points and lines of sight you want to emphasize.  Then note where you think fixtures will do the best highlighting.  </P> <P> Using the graph as a guide, set up the equipment and test it at night.  Fine-tune the result by moving the fixtures until you're satisfied with the  mood and effect.  </P> <P> Lights can add depth to a shallow yard if you use brighter lights near the  house and dimmer lights in the distance.  </P> <P> "Uplighting" -- shining lights up into trees and bushes -- is best for creating  emphasis and mood.  </P> <P> "Downlighting," while not as dramatic, serves double duty for functional  lighting in access areas such as paths and drives.  </P> <P> Moonlighting -- shining a light down from a fixture high in a tree -- can  diffuse light over a large area.  </P> <P> In most cases, cords need not be buried for safety, though for appearance you  may want to conceal them in a shallow trench or cover them with gravel or wood  chips. Cords should be buried under the turf where you may be mowing grass.  </P> <P> The company's kits contain parts designed to snap together without tools, and  you can begin with a starter kit and add more later. Fixtures come in durable  plastics or redwood, with stakes to position them in the ground or mounts for  trees and buildings.  </P> <P> The weatherproof low-voltage equipment is safe and economical and delivers both  dim and bright lighting, Toro says.  </P> <P> Optional features include timers or photoelectric sensors to turn the systems  on automatically, motion detectors, wired and wireless remote controls, and  indoor security alarms.  </P> <P> Basic kits cost about $50; Toro estimates cost of an average installation at  about $200.  </P></p>

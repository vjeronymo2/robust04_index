			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Arts: Engraved in history - An exhibition and biography of George Cruikshank, the influential Victorian caricaturist OUT OF the tens of thousands of drawings Cruikshank made during a long working lifetime the two that remain lodged permanently in the mind of posterity are 'Oliver Asking For More' and 'Fagin In The Condemned Cell'. In the latter, the dim light filtering through the window-grill of a cell illuminates the terrified figure sitting biting his nails on the narrow bed; his eyes are popping in terror; his hat is placed upturned beside him; its removal from his head shows us for the first time the shape of his skull, and makes him seem curiously naked. Cruikshank's emphatic point is that Fagin has not just been caught - he has been unmasked. That illustration - one of 24 he did for Oliver Twist - is a fine example of Cruikshank's love of melodrama. Born 200 years ago this year, he was an actor manque having tried as a young man to get a job on the stage. He had learnt the art of engraving at the knee of his father Isaac Cruikshank who was of Scottish descent, but settled in London, a contemporary and colleague of Rowlandson and Gillray. George was the second son, he had an older brother Robert who was also a fine artist. The theatre people told George Cruikshank that if he liked he could try his hand at painting scenery. Cruikshank settled instead for caricature, an art to which he brought a variety of skills combined with an infinite capacity for invention. He eventually appeared on stage as an amateur, performing in theatrical events organised by Dickens. The great novelist became a chum when Cruikshank made the drawings for Dickens's first book Sketches by Boz. Cruikshank always insisted that it was he who had originally had the idea for Oliver Twist. He had, he claimed, given Dickens the story complete with all the characters. This claim is the subject of an learned essay by Richard A Vogler on the relations between author and artist printed in the symposium Cruikshank edited by Robert L Patten in 1973. This valuable collection, with an introduction by John Fowles and a cover design by Ronald Searle - both are dedicated Cruikshankians - is now reissued by the Princeton University Press at Pounds 15.95. After Oliver, Dickens and Cruikshank never worked together again. It was Hablot Browne (Phiz) who became Dickens' regular illustrator. In his youth Cruikshank was a clubbable roisterer, but not a desperate one like his father who died, after a life that combined excessive drinking with great industry, at the age of 47. His son's career lasted almost twice as long and in his late forties Cruikshank became a reformed character - or so it seemed - through the influence of his second wife. From now on he zealously promoted the teetotal cause. Sets of drawings by him with titles like The Bottle, The Drunkard's Children, the Worship of Bacchus appeared after the manner of Hogarth and were a huge success. Before his conversion Cruikshank had combined conviviality with domesticity. He married twice; both these unions were childless; but like Dickens, Cruikshank, it came to light long after his death, had a clandestine establishment near to his marital home where he kept a mistress who bore him nine children. The enormous range, the rollicking exuberance of his art with its love of minute detail, may be sampled in the exhibition at the Museum of the Order of St John, Clerkenwell, near where Cruikshank lived for some years. The catalogue Cruikshank 200 (Pounds 5) by John Wardroper - the moving spirit behind the exhibition - gives a useful concise account of the artist's life and career. On show are examples of his work as a radical, a scourge of the government during the Regency period, alongside a handful of the many books and pamphlets he illustrated. Several were published by his courageous friend William Hone who vindicated the right of a publisher to disseminate such subversive material in three separate historic libel actions brought by the Lord Chancellor. The exhibition also includes a fascinating selection of Cruikshank's hand-coloured etchings, watercolours, pen-and-ink drawings. It is the first comprehensive Cruikshank exhibition since the one organised by William Feaver in 1978 at the V &amp; A to mark the centenary of the artist's death. In these days of ever worsening unemployment figures, devalued currency, and of Napoleonic gestures emanating from across the Channel, Cruikshank's scurrilous and brilliant treatment of all these topics in such a manner as to drive home their impact in human misery, seems as relevant to our time as to his own. Robert L. Patten, professor of English at Rice University, Texas, is the leading academic Cruikshank scholar. Patten has been steadily researching this biography for 20 years. The task included going through Cruikshank's 8,500 unpublished letters now dispersed in collections all over the world. The biography will be published in two parts, the second will appear next year. This first part takes us up to 1835. It covers the period when Cruikshank established himself as the foremost British caricaturist of his day; an artist whose work conditioned public awareness of political and social events - at that period caricature had a similar importance to television in our society. Patten's mastery of the different disciplines in the career of such an artist is apparent from the first chapter. He is always ready to expound the national and international history behind the work, the Hundred Days, Waterloo, Peterloo, the Reform Acts, the careers of the Prince Regent, the Duke of Wellington - all of which were grist to Cruikshank's mill. Patten also deals thoroughly with caricature as a form of folk art and he traces the development of print-making techniques in the 19th century. It was during the life of Cruikshank that book-illustration, to which he made such a contribution, enjoyed one of its finest periods. As this volume ends, Cruikshank has begun work on Scott's Waverley. If the depth of insight into Cruikshank's life and art shown in volume one is sustained in the concluding volume, as there is every reason to believe it will be, then Patten's biography will surely become the indispensable work on this ferocious but endearing artist. Cruikshank 200 is open at the Museum of the Order of St. John, St John's Gate, EC1, Monday to Saturday, 11am-4pm, until Oct 21. After that it will go on tour to Burnley, Maidstone and Sheffield.

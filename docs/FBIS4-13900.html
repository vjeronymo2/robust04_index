			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] Commenting on U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's tour of the region, TISHRIN says: The U.S.  secretary of state is scheduled to begin a Middle East tour to  advance the peace process. No two observers would disagree that  the peace process has stumbled and that chances of peace are  gradually narrowing as a result of Israel's intransigence and  the fact that the U.S. role has been confined to wishes rather  than using Washington's huge capabilities to force Israel to  implement Security Council resolutions and withdraw from the  occupied Arab territories.    TISHRIN adds: By virtue of its great responsibilities as a  major and leading party to the peace process, Syria has made  every possible effort to make concrete progress. It has also  contributed actively to saving this process from collapse more  than once on account of Israel's reckless conduct and practices,  which are far from the spirit of peace. Syria expected the  round of talks held following the Geneva summit to yield  substantive results to achieve a just and comprehensive peace.  The results of the talks, however, clashed with the same  Israeli intransigence and the Israeli negotiating team's refusal  to discuss the question of withdrawal from the occupied Syrian  Golan.    The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre then came to shed light on the  crimes of the settlers and the risks inherent in the continued  presence of settlements in the occupied territories. The  massacre also placed the international community before its  responsibilities toward the removal of Israeli occupation.    As Christopher was preparing to come to the region, the  rulers of Israel, as usual, released a spurt of statements  ostensibly stressing efforts to achieve peace, while the  substance of these statements points to obstructing just peace,  reshuffling cards, complicating the situation, and confusing  responsibilities. Syria and the other Arab parties to the  Washington talks have a simple, clear demand that is in perfect  harmony with UN resolutions, the principles of international  law, and the foundations of the Madrid conference.    TISHRIN adds: Since the launching of the U.S. peace  initiative, Syria has made it clear that it will not relinquish  an iota of its national soil nor any national or pan-Arab right;  that there can be no compromise on the Golan; and that there is  no alternative to the return of the Golan in full to its  motherland and the return of the Syrians who were displaced to  their homeland. In return, and for over two years, Syria has  not heard anything from the rulers of Israel except vague hints  and has only seen evasion of withdrawal.    The paper concludes: The U.S. secretary of state's tour will  be fruitful inasmuch as it places the rulers of Israel before  the facts of a just and comprehensive solution and employs the  U.S. weight to establish a just and comprehensive solution. The  peace process has been going on for far too long and it faces  the threat of collapse if the Arabs do not see tangible results  toward regaining all of their occupied territories and usurped  rights.    AL-BA'TH devotes its editorial to the contradiction in  Rabin's statements. Perhaps, the paper said, the head of the  Israeli government thought, through the statements he made on  the eve of Christopher's visit to the region, that he had scored  a great success in the peace process or that he had fulfilled  all his obligations, so he left for Moscow having on top of his  agenda bringing in more Jewish emigrants to settle them in the  occupied Arab territories.    AL-BA'TH adds: If we pause for a second to consider what  Rabin said about the dismantling of the settlements on the  occupied Golan, we see that the words he used hide concepts that  do not serve the peace process in any way. Thus, we quickly  come to the conclusion that Rabin was only playing on words and  resorting, as usual, to maneuvers and deception.    AL-BA'TH goes on: Rabin chose to make his statements only  hours before Christopher's tour of the region to sound as if he  were making concessions on the peace process. He has, however,  as usual, ignored the fact that what he termed concessions is  something that contradicts reason and international charters  because anyone who makes a concession should own whatever it is  in the first place. Since Israel does not own an inch of the  territory, it cannot claim to be conceding it.    The paper asserts that the question of settlement activity  has been an obstacle to the peace process in the same way the  absence of a clear, unequivocal commitment to withdrawal from  the occupied territories is an obstacle to this process.  Therefore, we can conclude that Rabin, who spoke at great  length about the Golan without announcing full withdrawal from  it, has once again sought to circumvent the aim of Christopher's  tour by making deceptive, propagandistic statements that do not  at all change the Israeli position, which still rejects the  peace process.    AL-BA'TH concludes: Hence, the U.S. secretary, who said he  was not optimistic about his current tour, will meet an adamant  Israeli position. To break this position, emphasis must be  placed on the requirements of the peace process and rectifying  its course through Rabin's commitment to full withdrawal from  the Golan and consequently translating what he said into action  on the ground if he truly wants peace.</p>

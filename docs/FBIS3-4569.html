			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 26 KYODO -- Japan's 47 prefectural  governments are expected to start supplying special  standard-price rice, composed entirely of imported rice, in  March to secure a stable supply of the staple food, according to  results of a survey released Saturday [26 February].    Of all of the prefectural governments, 46 have already  decided to start supplying the rice, with the sole exception of  Chiba Prefecture which is expected to make a similar decision  Monday, the KYODO NEWS SERVICE questionnaire showed.    The survey also showed that the supply of such rice to  consumers will lead to uniform rice prices across the nation and  a 30 percent price fall from current levels.    Responding to the survey, local governments said they have  no  choice but to provide imported rice as special standard-price  rice so as to ensure a stable rice supply following the worst  postwar harvest last year.    The survey found that in almost all prefectures such rice  will consist of 60 percent U.S. rice, 20 percent Chinese rice  and the remaining 20 percent Thai rice.    The rice will be priced at 316 yen per kilogram, including a  3 percent consumption tax.    The Food Agency had instructed prefectural governments to  start supplying special standard-price rice from March in the  form of either 100 percent imported rice or a blend of 70  percent imported rice and 30 percent domestically produced rice.</p>

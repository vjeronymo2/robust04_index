When meeting with Papua New Guinean Defense Minister Paul  Tohian in Jayapura, Brigadier-General Rustam Kastor, Commander  of the 8th Trikora Regional Command, stressed that Papua New  Guinea's news report about ABRI's patrols intruding into the  neighboring country was untrue. He said he considered the  reports as irresponsible and that they have been brought up by  certain groups to destroy the existing good relations of the two  governments. He said Indonesia respects the sovereignty of  other countries, including Papua New Guinea and ABRI, in  carrying out its responsibilities, places its territorial  operations as top priority. In carrying out its duties, ABRI has  never used military strength. Rather, it chooses to use greater  contact with the local community, including separatist groups in  efforts to make them realize of their mistakes.    Apart from meeting with the 8th Trikora Regional Commander,  the Papua New Guinean defense minister also met with the  governor of Irian Jaya, Jacob Pantiri. He also observed the  ongoing development of a toll road network from Irian Jaya to  Mutong in Papua New Guinea.</p>

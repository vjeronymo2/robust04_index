			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Part IV: Availability of Additional Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The text for this Notice and a detailed data file with county, CEA, and economic-area codes is available, for downloading only, from the New England Electronic Economic Data Center. Connect to the Data Center's Internet node at neeedc.umesbs.maine.edu using the anonymous FTP (username=``anonymous'' with no password) and ``get'' the binary file EADATA.EXE from the node's root directory. (Do not use GOPHER or MOSAIC Internet technologies at this node.) This file decompresses into self-explanatory text files when the DOS command EADATA is used. Counts of the number of counties in each CEA and economic area and of the number of CEA's in each economic area are included to assist in understanding and evaluating the proposed economic areas. The file EADATA.EXE also is available through the Commerce Department's Economic Bulletin Board (EBB). First-time users of the EBB may access it with their personal computer and modem by dialing (202) 482&hyph;3870 and following instructions. The user's cost is an annual fee of $45 and per-minute connect charges, which vary by time of day; users will be billed by the Department of Commerce. (The EBB is also available through the Internet.) A hard-copy listing of the records in the detailed data file is available for public review at the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Public Information Office, Room 1026, 1441 L Street, NW., Washington, DC. The hours of availability are 8:30 a.m. to noon and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Part V: Summary of Comments and Responses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the previous  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Notice (56 FR, 13049, March 9, 1993) interested persons were invited to provide comments regarding methodology for the economic area definitions. Two formal comments were received. One suggested that greater clarity in the explanation of the means by which nodes for the economic areas are selected would be useful; a description of the selection process is included above. The second comment specifically requested that the two-county region defined by Nassau and Suffolk counties in New York be treated as separate from the New York MSA in the redefinition procedures. Nassau-Suffolk is a separate PMSA in the larger CMSA surrounding New York, so it is treated separately in defining the CEA's. However, no counties other than Nassau and Suffolk are in the Nassau-Suffolk CEA, and it was grouped with other CEA's to form its economic area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Public Review Procedure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All comments received in response to this notice will be available for public inspection at the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Public Information Office, Room 1026, 1441 L Street, NW., Washington, DC.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Socialist People's Party Chairman </F> Holger K. Nielsen by Ole Lorenzen and Rikke Andreasen; place and  date not given]    [Text] The possibility of a Liberal-Conservative-Progress  Party majority that surfaces from time to time in the opinion  polls is due to the voters' dissatisfaction that there was no  major change in Danish politics when Poul Nyrup Rasmussen  (Social Democratic Party) became prime minister.    Therefore, it is not a good idea that the present government  should continue after the next election even if all the four  government parties manage to stay above the threshold for  representation in the Folketing. This is the view of Socialist  People's Party [SF] chairman Holger K. Nielsen.    According to his timetable, at 1400 today he is to start the  debate at his party's national conference. And with the  European Union [EU] discussion behind it, the dominant item on  the party's agenda is the Folketing election and the situation  after it.    Increasingly often in recent months, we have seen the  government and the SF backing the laws that the Folketing has  passed.    After a year out in the cold, the SF has therefore come back  into the warm. But this does not make Holger K. Nielsen keen to  continue along this path after the election.    [NIELSEN] "Nyrup is quite clearly trying to avoid situations  where the voting split is 90-89. That is why the government  tries to draw us in when things are tight. But this is still  not satisfactory.    "I also sense that there is so much dissolution in the  government parties that this in itself will create an impetus  that will mean that the Christian People's Party and the Center  Democrats will not continue in the government after the election.    ``So after the next election there will probably be  negotiations with us about the shape of a government platform,  and it seems to me totally improbable that we and the Center  Democrats will be able to reach agreement. After all, the  Center Democrats entered the government in order to keep us out."    [DET FRI AKTUELT] Is it not better that the Center Democrats  are part of the government and are therefore tied to it, than  that the party is outside the government and is therefore able  to do even more somersaults?    [NIELSEN] "No, I am not so sure that it is. My point of  departure is that I should defend the interests of SF voters.  It is not our historic task to keep Poul Nyrup Rasmussen in  power. Our task is to get as much SF policy through as  possible. And in addition the present government is proof that  there is not that much of an advantage in having the Center  Democrats involved.    "The government's profile is becoming so changeable that  this  gives rise to much more concern. At bottom the four parties  want something different. The Center Democrats have entered the  government and lost almost all their voters to the  nonsocialists. And those voters they have have a more obvious  orientation toward the nonsocialists than to us. That is why I  believe that it would have been a much, much better solution in  January 1993 if we had gotten a purely Social Democratic  government.    "It could have maneuvered quite a lot and quite effectively.  The Center Democrats could have adopted a high profile on issues  where they wanted to adopt a high profile without this causing  any problems, and agreements could have been reached with us  without this causing any problems."    [DET FRI AKTUELT] Is this not because the Social  Democrats, the SF, and the Radical Liberals today have a  majority? After the election it looks as if this will not be  enough.    [NIELSEN] "There is a difference of course. But I still  believe that a continuation of the four-party government is a  pretty hopeless construction. Nor do I believe that they will  all manage to stay above the threshold for representation in the  Folketing. I also believe that the Social Democrats, the SF,  and the Radical Liberals will attract quite a lot of votes and  have a majority again if we state quite clearly what we want.  There are quite a lot of stay-at-home voters in the opinion  polls, and we should therefore not attach too much importance to  them. A lot will happen in the election campaign."    In the fall of 1992 the SF made public a government program  in the expectation that a Folketing election was on the way. It  never came. The SF negotiated with the Social Democrats about a  government platform after the fall of the Schluter government,  but drew a blank. That is why it is a more cautious chairman  who will wait until after the election before he airs his hopes.    [NIELSEN] "Not everywhere in the SF is there enthusiasm for  the Radical Liberals, but I believe that people accept that a  majority comprising the Social Democrats and the SF alone is not  just around the corner. That is why it must be a case of the  three parties' trying to create a base for some reforms in the  field of green politics and in the field of increased  democratization."    [DET FRI AKTUELT] Is it really the case that you want to  have the Radical Liberals involved in putting pressure on the  Social Democrats rather than doing so alone?    [Nielsen] "No, that is not the case. Despite everything the  Radical Liberals are quite a problem in the field of economic  policy. But there are many good prospects in a majority which  also includes the Radical Liberals."    There are six topics on the agenda when the weekend's  national conference comes to put together an election program  for the party.    -- More must be done to bring down unemployment -- including  reducing working hours to 30 hours a week.    -- Higher environmental levies and other green proposals  will reduce consumption. The environment comes before growth.    -- Public services must be improved with more on offer for  children and old people, and the disappearance of waiting lists  for hospital treatment.    -- Economic democracy must be brought back onto the agenda  again -- in pension funds, too.    -- A new security policy must be formulated, representing  massive savings in defense.    -- The efforts to get the EU to pursue a different policy  will continue. Denmark's national compromise must be adhered to.    [DET FRI AKTUELT] This sounds like a very expensive program.    [Nielsen] "Yes, but the whole thing can hold together. We  are not so keen that taxes should be brought down the whole  time. Also, there are still places from which money can be  taken. It is pointless for Denmark to have the lowest gasoline  taxes. There is also scope for introducing an advertising levy."    However, he is consciously low profile in his concrete  demands on a Nyrup Rasmussen government after the election.    For example, it is not a demand that the SF should be  involved in the next multiparty defense agreement.    "If Defense Minister Haekkerup would rather reach an  agreement with the Conservatives, I think this will cause him  bigger problems than being outside an agreement causes us,"  Nielsen said.    Nor will the tax reform of which the SF has been highly  critical need to be recast. The necessary redistribution to  benefit those who are worst off will be achieved in other ways.    The debate in Kolding over the next few days will show  whether Holger K. Nielsen has the party with him on this.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpts] President Suleyman Demirel has stated that he  referred back to the Assembly the bill on housing for civil  servants because it would exacerbate already difficult  conditions in Turkey. Demirel held a breakfast meeting with  reporters in Isparta. [passage omitted]    Reacting to a 25 percent cutback of U.S. aid to Turkey,  Demirel said claims of human rights violations and the Cyprus  issue were given as the reasons for the aid cut. Stressing that  there is no question of Turkey violating human rights, Demirel  said that the same measures used against human rights violations  in the United States are being implemented in Turkey.    On the Cyprus impasse, Demirel said that Turkey is not  responsible for the stalemate.</p>

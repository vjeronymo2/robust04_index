			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CITY SECTION CROSS-COUNTRY;  </P> <P> ARELLANO'S WIN PUTS BELMONT BACK ON TOP;  </P> <P> CHAMPIONSHIPS: UNLIKELY TRIUMPH SETS UP SENTINELS' EIGHTH TITLE IN NINE YEARS.  TAFT FINISHES SECOND.  </P> <P> A surprising victory by Belmont High's Rene Arellano in the City Section  cross-country championships at Pierce College on Saturday led to a  not-too-surprising outcome in the race for the team title.  </P> <P> Arellano won the three-mile race in 14 minutes 58 seconds and Belmont placed  five runners among the top 12 to easily win its eighth championship in the past  nine seasons.  </P> <P> The Sentinels totaled 32 points; defending champion Taft was second with 115,  two points ahead of Garfield.  </P> <P> Monroe (188) and Birmingham (196) were eighth and ninth.  </P> <P> Belmont won its second consecutive girls' title, placing four runners among the  top eight to win with 19 points. San Pedro was a distant second with 108 and  Narbonne was third with 134.  </P> <P> El Camino Real tied with Garfield for fourth with 148 points but finished fifth  on the basis of a slower sixth runner.  </P> <P> Taft (165), Birmingham (176), Chatsworth (258) and Grant (297) finished sixth,  seventh, ninth and 10th.  </P> <P> Belmont, which also won the boys' sophomore and junior-varsity divisions,  became the first school to win girls' and boys' City titles in the same season.  </P> <P> The top two teams and the first five individuals not on the top two teams  qualified for the state meet Nov. 24 at Woodward Park in Fresno.  </P> <P> University's Robin Snowbeck powered past Kennedy's Jennie Armenta on the final  downhill stretch of the race to win the girls' race in 18:40. Armenta was  second in 18:47.  </P> <P> North Hollywood's Oshonda Posey led during the early stages before fading to  third in 19:06.  </P> <P> El Camino Real's Gina Zeno finished ninth, holding off Poly's Janet Bailon for  the fifth individual qualifying berth. Both were timed in 20:06.  </P> <P> Arellano ran in a pack that included pre-meet favorites Steve Gonzales  (Carson), Brian Godsey (Taft) and Ben Mesfen (Venice) before breaking away with  just under a mile remaining.  </P> <P> "I told myself I was going to go out with them," said Arellano, who ran 15:33  and finished 24 seconds behind Gonzales in the City preliminaries the previous  week.  </P> <P> "They started slowing down and I was kind of afraid when I took the lead. It  was a perfect race."  </P> <P> Gonzales, third last year, finished second in 15:08. Godsey (15:29) edged  Mesfen (15:30) for third. Monroe's Lorenzo Ortiz was ninth in 16:00.  </P> <P> "Unbelievable," Belmont Coach Gordon Weisenberger said. "I thought we might  have a shot at winning the team title, but there was no way that I thought  (Arellano) would win the race. He just rose to the occasion."  </P> <P> Taft did not.  </P> <P> Godsey ran 14 seconds slower than in the preliminaries, and Taft's five scoring  runners ran an average of 28 seconds slower than their best on the Pierce  course.  </P> <P> "I just tried to hang back," said Godsey, who placed fifth last season.  "(Gonzales) was making a lot of surges and that took out a lot out of  everybody."  </P> <P> Kipp Ortenburger (16:29) and Torino Carr (16:30) placed 20th and 21st. Chip  English (17:16) and Caesar Rodriguez (17:23) finished 42nd and 46th to round  out Taft's scoring.  </P> <P> "I don't know what happened," Taft Coach Mel Hein said. "We've done the  training and we've done the sprints. We were prepared, but everybody was off.  We were lucky to finish second."  </P></p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Gardening: Letts' Guide to Garden Design - Correction Letts' Guide to Garden Design: In Bridget Bloom's June 5 review of four books in the series of Letts' Guide to Garden Design, she castigated the publishers for failing to identify photographs of gardens singled out for praise. The publishers have asked us to say that the photographs in the books are identified in the acknowledgements section at the beginning of each book, and we apologise for this oversight.</p>

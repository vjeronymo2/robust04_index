			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alberto Hughes and Victor Darwin Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Durazno -- The Herreraism-Wilsonism [Herreraist  faction-Wilson Ferreira Aldunate faction] faction yesterday  named Alberto Volonte as its presidential candidate. The  ceremony was attended by a big crowd which completely filled the  large installations of the Ernesto de Leon municipal stadium.    Volonte announced that on 8 June he will resign as the  president of the UTE [General Administration of State Electric  Power and Telephones] board of directors and immediately begin  to participate in the electoral campaign with his running-mate  Alvaro Ramos.    The crowd exceeded the expectations of the organizers. Many  said they were witnessing "a phenomenon similar to that observed  in 1971 [not further specified]."    A note was read identifying the faction and explaining the  reasons behind the choice of Volonte, who was identified as the  right person to turn their vision of the country into a reality.  It was said that the UTE president shows he is a "tough  administrator" who does not "hide his interest in social  questions and who shows real sensitivity over the problems of  the people."    During his speech, Walter Santoro stressed and recognized  the  achievements of the current National Party administration.</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Whessoe shares shed 26p on full-year loss warning Shares in Whessoe fell 26p to 108p yesterday after the instrumentation, control and piping systems group warned it was likely to report losses this year following a sharp deterioration in trading conditions. The shares have fallen from 219p in May, when the group said that interim pre-tax profits had halved from Pounds 4.02m to Pounds 1.89m. The problems have been blamed on the piping systems division, which has suffered from a lack of orders, an unsuitable product mix and delays in existing customer contracts. Although 'comprehensive action' had been taken to reverse the decline, the company said it would be inappropriate to pay a final dividend. However, it hoped to resume payments next year.</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANA: ALUMNA, 91, HELPS MARK COLLEGE'S 75TH  </P> <P> Black and red balloons soared into the hot sky. The Santa Ana High School Band  struck up "When the Saints Go Marching In." And 91-year-old Martha Ehlen, class  of 1919, proudly raised the state flag in front of Rancho Santiago College's  Administration Building.  </P> <P> With this ceremony, the college on Wednesday morning launched a yearlong  observance of its 75th anniversary.  </P> <P> Originally called Santa Ana Junior College, the institution was founded in  1915. It is the second oldest college in Orange County; Fullerton College, the  oldest, opened in 1913.  </P> <P> For alumni and civic officials, the Rancho Santiago anniversary ceremony on  Wednesday triggered a series of remembrances. World War II veterans recalled  the bare, sparse look of the campus in the 1940s, when many structures were  Quonset huts. College district Trustee Shirley Ralston recalled the ruckus  among some alumni in the 1980s when the Board of Trustees changed the college's  name to Rancho Santiago to reflect a service area bigger than just the city of  Santa Ana.  </P> <P> But none of the remembrances could outstrip Martha Ehlen's recollection of how  the infant campus looked in 1917, when she entered Santa Ana Junior College  after graduating from Orange High School. The college was only two years old in  1917, but Ehlen said it was already a superior place to prepare for transfer to  a four-year school.  </P> <P> "Absolutely wonderful instruction," she said. "Every remembrance I have of  Santa Ana Junior College is one of gratitude and happiness. I got such  wonderful instruction here that when I transferred to (UC) Berkeley, I was able  to graduate from there in just a year and a half," Ehlen recalled. "And I  graduated Phi Beta Kappa and summa cum laude (with highest honors)."  </P> <P> After getting her degree from UC Berkeley, Ehlen taught at Fullerton College.  One of her most notable students, she said, was Richard M. Nixon -- a young lad  from Yorba Linda. "Oh, he was a fine student, a straight-A student, and I  remember that he played the violin," Ehlen said. "I've always liked him, but,  of course, I'm a Republican." Ehlen said she taught Nixon in her Latin I and  Latin II classes.  </P> <P> Ehlen, who still lives in Orange, received a standing ovation from the outdoor  crowd of about 100 persons when she was introduced for her flag-raising duties  at the ceremonies.  </P> <P> College officials said the next major event commemorating Rancho Santiago's  75th anniversary will be a homecoming pep rally and potluck dinner at 4 p.m.  Oct. 27 on the Santa Ana campus.

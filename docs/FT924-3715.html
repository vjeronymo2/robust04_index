			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Motoring: Peugeot 106 diesel THIS urbane five-door diesel will join the Peugeot 106 range in Britain early in the new year. Already a firm favourite in France - not least because of its 59 mpg (4.8l/100km) average fuel consumpion - it is quiet, rides beautifully and is quite spacious inside, although it is small enough to tuck into tiny parking spaces. Power-assisted steering, an optional extra within a year, will make it an ideal urban car with legs long enough to make light work of motorway journeys. Prices will be slightly higher than for the three-door, 106 diesels, which start at Pounds 7,142.</p>

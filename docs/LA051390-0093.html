			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTLOOSE: VERMONT HAS MUCH MORE TO OFFER THAN JUST WINTER SKIING ACTIVITIES  </P> <P> In this day of resorts that try to blend into the scenery but all too often  fail, it's comforting to find one that's known worldwide yet doesn't have so  much as a post office.  </P> <P> Sugarbush is near Waitsfield. It's also near Warren, Mad Valley Glen, Irasville  and other places you probably never heard of unless you're a dedicated skier.  </P> <P> Vermont's Green Mountains hide many resorts in their great stands of beech,  birch, elm, maple and poplar. Sugarbush once had the reputation of being the  most chic for crowds bent on showing off the very latest in glitzy ski wear. So  much so that its most popular skiing area earned the nickname "Mascara  Mountain."  </P> <P> Although the ski-to-be-seen set is still around, Sugarbush has become a  year-round family resort where horseback riding, hiking, tennis, golf,  sailplane soaring and the fall influx of foliage seekers account for most of  its visitors.  </P> <P> Getting here: Fly USAir, United or Continental to Burlington, Vt., for about  $405-$468 round trip, depending upon advance-purchase and day of week flown.  The bus service isn't the greatest, so plan on driving to Sugarbush in about an  hour.  </P> <P> How long/how much? Most visitors stay at least a week, winter or summer. Make  reservations early for foliage season. Many inns here quote prices based on  half-pension, but they're still moderate. Ski-season costs usually climb from  those mentioned below. The end of March through April are considered the "mud  months" in New England and should be avoided.  </P> <P> Getting settled in: The Inn at Round Barn Farm (Box 247, Waitsfield 05673;  $85-$125 B&amp;B double) sits beside a round barn built in 1910 and is one of  Vermont's few remaining examples of this Shaker structure. Recently opened as  an inn, the main house and grounds are a symphony of flowers. Of the six rooms,  all with bath, two have Jacuzzis, two have canopied beds and each has handmade  quilts and wall stenciling.  </P> <P> The Waitsfield Inn (Box 969, Waitsfield 05673; $100-$130 double, half-pension)  has stood since 1825, with the common room an old barn added a decade later.  It's a spread out and informal place, with the former barn now warmed by a  fireplace, original planked flooring, bookcases and comfortable couches.  </P> <P> Some of the bedrooms have lofts, handcarved wooden beds and beamed ceilings.  Dining is a combination of continental and traditional Vermont, with a choice  of main courses at dinner. A simple wine list also is available.  </P> <P> Tucker Hill Lodge (Box 147, Waitsfield 05673; $130-$178 double, half-pension)  has gained national acclaim for its cozy atmosphere and magnificent food. It's  set on a wooded hillside surrounded by stone walls and English gardens, and has  a pool and tennis courts.  </P> <P> The simple and rustic bedrooms have rag rugs in bright colors, oak furniture  and old-fashioned coverlets on the beds. And there's a separate 1805 farmhouse  with handhewn beams and fireplace that's suitable for a family or two or three  couples who want privacy, with their own garden and mountain stream.  </P> <P> Regional food and drink: One of the things that jumps out at you about Vermont  dining is the superior quality of the veal and turkey. Look for both on menus.  </P> <P> Many inns and restaurants make good use of the fiddlehead ferns, wild leeks and  the blueberries, raspberries and strawberries that seem to blanket the state.  You'll find the berries and their jams and jellies sold at roadside stands  throughout the season.  </P> <P> Maple syrup and wonderful Cheddar cheeses are Vermont staples, with apple cider  the only indigenous drink.  </P> <P> Good dining: Millbrook Lodge (Vermont 17, Waitsfield) has an atmospheric dining  room in an 1850 building crammed with antiques and original art. Just about  everything is homemade here, including the breads and pastas. Many vegetables  come from the inn's garden. Millbrook does all sorts of veal dishes in  marvelous ways, plus chicken, seafood and pastas. Meal prices $11 to about $17.  </P> <P> Beggars Banquet (Vermont 100, Waitsfield 05673) is an unpretentious place, yet  has an open terrace surrounded by flower beds for summer dining. Expect good  homemade soups, generous salads and hearty sandwiches. There's a full dinner  menu, and Sunday night's specialty is Mexican food.  </P> <P> The dining room at Tucker Hill Lodge is small and romantic. Try the ravioli of  house-made pasta filled with rabbit flavored with Pommery mustard, shallots,  honey and thyme, or perhaps the Maine Spinney Creek oysters. Then select from a  menu that includes fresh New England bluefish grilled and served with a saute  of tomato fillets, red onion and garlic, finished with fresh-basil butter and  steamed lobster claws. Or choose the farm-raised partridge grilled and served  on a bed of fresh fava beans, summer cabbage and julienne of ham.  </P> <P> On your own: Summer activities in the Waitsfield-Sugarbush area include trout  fishing, canoeing, bicycling, outdoor concerts, antique and covered-bridge  stalking, folk-music festivals, horse shows and gymkhanas.  </P> <P> Sugarbush Village also has a sports center featuring indoor-outdoor pools,  squash courts, whirlpools, indoor tennis courts, saunas, massage rooms and 20  Universal and Nautilus rigs for the really dedicated.  </P> <P> Or you may just sit on a mountainside, do a little bird watching and rest up  for ski season.  </P> <P> For more information, call the Sugarbush Chamber of Commerce toll-free at (800)  828-4748, or write to Box 173, Waitsfield 05673, for a brochure on Sugarbush,  another on coming events, plus other information you might need.  </P></p>

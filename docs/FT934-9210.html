			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Goodrich to acquire Rosemount Aerospace BF GOODRICH, the Ohio-based specialty chemical and aerospace company, is to acquire Rosemount Aerospace from the Emerson Electric Company for Dollars 300m in cash, pending regulatory approval. The acquisition is the largest in Goodrich's history, and strengthens the company's position as a producer of intelligent aircraft monitoring systems. Analysts said the sale by Emerson reflected continuing consolidation in the US aerospace industry. Rosemount Aerospace, based in Burnsville, Minnesota, posted fiscal 1993 sales of Dollars 130m and has 1,200 employees, with manufacturing facilities in Minnesota and Bognor Regis, UK. Mr David Burner, president of BF Goodrich Aerospace said: 'This acquisition is a significant step in our planned growth as a developer and integrator of aircraft systems.' Goodrich employs 12,000 and had sales of Dollars 1.6bn in 1992. Its aerospace division reported operating income of Dollars 27.4m in the third quarter, on sales of Dollars 243.2m. Huntsman, the US's largest privately-owned chemicals group, yesterday continued its acquisition campaign with the purchase of two American businesses of Monsanto. The transaction price was not disclosed, writes Paul Abrahams. The operations, with a combined annual turnover of Dollars 200m, manufacture linear alkyl benzene, used in detergents, and maleic anhydride, a chemical contained in bathroom fixtures, mouthwash and artificial sweeteners.</p>

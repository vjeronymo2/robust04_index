			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Nissan to export engines from UK for Spanish plant NISSAN, the Japanese car maker, is to begin exporting engines for the first time from its UK car plant. The engines will go to Spain for a range of vehicles to be launched late this year. Nissan yesterday unveiled in Geneva its new-generation Nissan Serena 'people carrier', a seven-to-eight seat high-roof estate car, to begin production in autumn at Nissan Motor Iberica, its Spanish vehicle subsidiary in Barcelona. The Serena will compete in one of the fastest-growing segments of the European market, pioneered in the 1980s by the Renault Espace. Several European vehicle makers are developing rival products, including Volkswagen and Ford, in a joint venture in Portugal, and Peugeot and Fiat in another in northern France. Nissan said yesterday it would export about 8,000 1.6- and 2-litre petrol engines from its Sunderland plant to Spain this year for use in the Serena. It expects Serena output to grow to about 35,000 in 1993. It is installing capacity to build 50,000 units a year, and estimates some 70 per cent will be powered by petrol engines supplied from the UK. A diesel engine will be manufactured in Spain. Nissan has invested about Pounds 53m in its aluminium casting, engine component machining and engine assembly plants at Sunderland, to supply the UK and Spanish vehicle assembly plants. UK car output is set to rise to 175,000 this year and to 270,000 in 1993, when the Japanese manufacturer will also launch a range of four-wheel-drive leisure/utility vehicles.</p>

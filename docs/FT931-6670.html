			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Arts: Songmakers in town FOR AN all-too-brief period at the beginning of the 19th century two kindred spirits poured out their feelings in poetry and song: John Keats and Franz Schubert. As the composer made no song settings of the poet, there is no way that their art can be enjoyed in harmony, but the Wigmore Hall's programme on Tuesday did everything it could to come as close as possible. This was the first in a short series of International Songmakers at the Wigmore Hall, devised by Graham Johnson. By interleaving readings from Keats's poetry and letters he gave the Schubert songs a larger dimension. So much the two had in common - in Keats's words, the love for 'nature's gentle doings', the romantic sensibility, the shared embrace of Grecian ideals. This last was tellingly caught by setting Keats's Ode on a Grecian Urn alongside Schubert's haunting 'Die Gotter Griechenlands'. (The reader throughout was Jill Balcon.) No other music by Schubert evokes so well that classical poise and timeless beauty, both beautifully caught in Johnson's accompaniment, if less palpably by the Austrian baritone, Oliver Widmer. Nevertheless, the deep resonance of his singing, unforced, generously projected, rich in tone, every word clear, was the primary vocal pleasure of the evening. Whether or not it is the Wigmore's new Bosendorfer piano, Johnson is playing better and better at the moment. The accompaniment to 'Nachthymne' sang with a wealth of expression that the soprano Susan Gritton could not equal; that to 'Die Sternennachte' captured more of the moonlit, silvery atmosphere than tenor Jamie MacDougall's vocal line, sensitive though his quiet singing always was. At forte, the tone can become unpleasing. Alongside Widmer's eloquence in his own language, the linguistic efforts of his British colleagues were apt to sound problematical. ***** Earlier in the day another songmaker, by profession at least, had appeared at Covent Garden. This was the Irish mezzo Patricia Bardon, giving one of the Royal Opera's Tuesday lunchtime recitals. Hers is a splendidly individual voice, mezzo in name, perhaps, but rich, deep, touching alto depths with an old-fashioned steadiness and majesty when she wants to. With Kathron Sturrock her fine accompanist, she tackled a varied programme that included vivid Barber and intense Rakhmaninov. Sometimes there is a tendency to allow the basic, distinctive colour of the voice to run unvaried for too long, but her Hahn group found a new, quietly luminous quality for 'L'Heure exquise'. In Brahms's 'Die Mainacht' the voice showed that it could encompass both the tender and the deeply serious. It was brave, too, to carry on when the din of an Italian comic opera in rehearsal broke in from the main auditorium.</p>

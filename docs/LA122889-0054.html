			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: WESTCHESTER;  </P> <P> BUILDING RULE EXTENSION  </P> <P> Los Angeles Councilwoman Ruth Galanter has called for a one-year extension of  the city's interim controls on development in the Westchester Bluffs area.  </P> <P> Galanter introduced a motion this month to extend temporary restrictions on  building while city planners continue work on a final plan to regulate  development and protect the scenic bluffs.  </P> <P> The proposed extension has yet to be considered by a council's Planning and  Land Use Committee. It also needs the approval of the full City Council.  </P> <P> The interim controls, which took effect in September, 1988, were intended to  limit building on bluff-top lots in Westchester and Playa del Rey while  planners wrestled with how to protect the aesthetic values of the area.  </P> <P> The original control ordinance states that if unregulated new development  occurred, there would be an "irreplaceable loss" of scenic resources and  natural features unique to the area. The fragile bluffs also have experienced  erosion and drainage problems.  </P> <P> The area affected by the controls on development extends west from Sepulveda  Boulevard along the bluff top to Vista del Mar in Playa del Rey.  </P></p>

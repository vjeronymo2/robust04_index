			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Krasulin: "Corfu Is Just the </F> Beginning"]    [Text] The results of Russian Federation President Boris  Yeltsin's visit to the Greek island of Corfu and the agreement  with the European Union which he signed there are being actively  discussed in the West.    The agreement should be welcomed in every way, since it will  help to "civilize" Russian exports and will promote Western  capital investment in the Russian economy. This opinion was  expressed with typically English restraint by British Prime  Minister John Major.    A more frank and optimistic assessment of this event was  given by FRG President Richard von Weizsaecker. "The spirit of  unity which has been established in Europe testifies that the  Cold War era will never return," he said.    On the whole, the tone of the statements by all the EU  representatives was almost wholly positive. Only journalists  expressed a certain skepticism. Thus THE LOS ANGELES TIMES,  while noting that the agreement will undoubtedly facilitate  European capital investment in Russia, which is undergoing a  severe economic crisis, at the same time reminds its readers  that the document still has to be ratified.    Journalists accredited to the EU Council session noted that,  despite the significance of all Russia's latest diplomatic  steps, much mutual suspicion still remains in the new partners'  relationship. Questions on which agreement has not yet been  reached include Russian access to the European Investment Bank,  the unconditional application of international rules in mutual  trade, and the relaxation of visa regulations for Russians in EU  countries. And the demand for the removal of restrictions on  the activity of five Western banks on Russian Federation  territory is hardly going to increase the optimism of Russian  financiers.    But Britain's THE GUARDIAN notes that the resolution of  virtually all international problems will be made easier for the  Russian leadership by the fact that the West has staked too much  to allow the risk of Russia's returning to isolation.    Russia will undoubtedly receive a number of benefits. Almost  all Russian and Western observers incline to this conclusion.  Above all, there is access to Western markets. But the Russian  Federation has secured this access on the same terms as other  countries whose economic development and cooperation led to the  elaboration of today's market laws. Here a problem arises. The  Russian economy urgently needs to reorient itself toward the  harsh conditions of competition. Concessions should not be  expected here. And observance of the strict norms in the EU's  relations with other states in Europe is closely monitored, with  a whole arsenal of punitive measures being used against  offenders. Will Russia, with its current legislative chaos, be  able to be a normal partner for the EU, and observe its own  interests as well?</p>

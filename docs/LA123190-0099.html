			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> O.C. YOUTH PAROLE PROGRAM TO CEASE  </P> <P> The California Youth Authority's Volunteers in Parole program for Orange County  ends the year primarily in boxes and crates, as its director, Patricia C.  Ruhlman, prepares to close down the office.  </P> <P> Volunteers in Parole, which matches attorneys with ex-youth offenders in a type  of Big-Brother/Big-Sister program, opened an Orange County office in 1982, and  since then has made 175 matches between lawyers and parolees.  </P> <P> But state budget woes are forcing it to close. The state Volunteers in Parole  program will keep an eye on Orange County from a new regional office in San  Diego.  </P> <P> Ruhlman said the director there, James Pauley, will try to keep the current 25  Orange County matches going.  </P> <P> The state maintained three of its seven programs in the budget squeeze, but  Orange County did not make the cutoff.  </P> <P> "We've had some failures, but we've had some wonderful successes," Ruhlman  said. "We have one youth who is now in law school. We've had several who have  been able to start their own businesses. I still believe strongly that the  concept is a good one."  </P> <P> The idea was to help ex-offenders adjust to parole by matching them with  someone who would show an interest in what happened to them.  </P> <P> "We had some negative influences we had to deal with with, primarily gangs and  the growing use of drugs," Ruhlman said.  </P> <P> The program was co-sponsored by the California Bar Assn. and the Orange County  Bar Assn. But the bulk of the money came from the Youth Authority, and the two  bar groups did not have the funds to make up the difference when the state  agency had to curtail its Orange County expenses.

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Sir, your plan will not work: Advice for the French government The following letter has come into our possession. It is addressed to Mr Jean Syrota, the man charged with merging the civil electronics and nuclear activities of Thomson, the French state-owned electronics group, with CEA-Industrie, the state-owned nuclear plant and fuel business. The sender appears to be an executive in a large investment bank and the letter concerns the new group, to be called Thomson-CEA-Industrie (TCI). Dear Mr Syrota, I was honoured to receive your request to seek private corporate investors in the government's latest industrial policy initiative. My bank has never been asked to advise on a proposal of such international importance. So it is with great reluctance that my directors have decided that we are unable to attach the bank's name to the project on the ground that we could not, in honesty, advise private-sector contacts to invest in it. Sadly, the plan as presented to us falls down on just about every count we can think of. First, financial. Our analysts are disturbed by the many years of losses they see at Thomson's consumer electronics and semiconductor units. They believe Thomson Consumer Electronics faces continuing huge investments in a high-definition television, based on a technical standard that is by no means guaranteed to win wide acceptance. Then there is the disadvantage of being a high-cost producer in an industry dominated by low-cost suppliers. As for the semiconductor unit - SGS-Thomson - we accept that your Italian government partner in the project might help bail it out temporarily. But we cannot easily measure the unit's continuing huge needs for cash in this fast-moving and capital-intensive business; nor do we see any guarantee that SGS-Thomson will achieve the market share needed to ensure long-term survival. The upshot of all this is that the cash earners in TCI - nuclear plant and fuel, and the sale of nuclear-related technology - could at worst see their resources eaten away by the parts of Thomson they are destined to inherit. We hear that there might be some limit or even a ban on Thomson's use of the nuclear business' cash reserves. Even so, we could more easily attract investment for them if they had no connection with Thomson's civil electronics activities. In other words, reshuffling the cards in this way does not improve the public sector's nuclear and electronics hand, and might even make it worse. Second, management. We liked the parts of the original version of the plan, promoted by Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the industry minister, whereby Thomson would take over CEA-Industrie. Thomson has professional, dynamic managers, who might be able to teach the academics at CEA-Industry a trick or two. Yet the final version of the plan is the other way round, with parts of Thomson to become subsidiaries of CEA-Industrie. Where is the sense? Third, political risk. We are unsure that future French governments will continue to support this idea. We admire the courage of Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime minister, but fear she could lose her job at any moment, possibly leaving investors high and dry. Fourth, feasibility. Perhaps cynically, some of our analysts argue that no sane private investor in charge of these same state-owned businesses would ever come up with a plan quite like this. Neither would they invest more money in it, as I believe the French government is planning to do. We remind you that the question of whether the state is behaving like a rational private investor is the test used by the European Commission to decide whether or not a government industrial investment contravenes EC state aid rules. Let us assume, however, that we can persuade a private investor to accept the risks. This might encourage the Commission to clear the project on the grounds that it had attracted private money. Yet that leads to a wider problem. The plan appears to be based on a Colbertist idea of the state's responsibility to direct important industries. If this worked in the 18th century, it was because the companies created were supported by guaranteed state orders and protected from international competition by high import tariffs. Our legal advisers fear that current international trade law makes it nearly impossible to achieve either of those conditions. That concludes our view of the project. May I be so bold as to suggest an alternative? Your government's interests as a shareholder in these companies would be best served by starving Thomson's consumer electronics and chip businesses of capital - not by investing in them. We suggest you employ us to sell some of Thomson's best consumer brand names, like Telefunken and Ferguson, ideally to Japanese groups which would welcome a European identity and could make them profitable. In your position, we would use the funds from these asset sales to invest in the profitable businesses remaining, such as Thomson-CSF in defence electronics and Cogema in nuclear fuel. Forget the reshuffle and leave them as they are, as separate holdings in your government's portfolio, so that they can go on concentrating on what they do best. We look forward to hearing from you . . . At this point the text has been torn.</p>

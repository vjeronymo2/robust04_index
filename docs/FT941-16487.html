			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Observer: UN likely Business sponsorship window of the moment must be the United Nations' 50th anniversary, due in 1995 - a 'unique opportunity to reposition the UN' as the hopeful press release puts it. No-one would deny the organisation needs a facelift. This week, for instance, UN sources expect Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to take the unusual step of backing the appointment of a special 'force inspector' for former Yugoslavia. His brief? To hasten investigations into months-old allegations of black marketeering, prostitution and the transporting of people from Sarajevo for payment.</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow tumbles on Clinton tax proposals Wall Street US SHARE prices tumbled across the board in very heavy trading yesterday after investors greeted details of President Bill Clinton's economic proposals negatively, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 82.94 down at 3,309.49, just off its low for the day. The index has fallen 133 points, or 3.8 per cent, since it reached a record high of 3,442.14 earlier this month. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dropped 10.67 to 433.91, while the American SE composite finished 9.66 lower at 405.81. The Nasdaq composite, which has risen the furthest in recent months, was the hardest hit index, shedding 25.15 to 665.39. Trading volume on the New York SE swelled to 332.8m shares, and declines outnumbered rises by more than four-to-one. After incurring sizeable losses last week, the markets opened in a depressed mood following the extended President's Day weekend. Mr Bill Clinton's television address on Monday night was the main cause for the weakness in equities. In the broadcast he warned that a wide range of tax increases would be introduced which, coupled with selective spending cuts, he hoped would go some way towards shrinking the huge federal deficit. Investors disliked what they heard, fearing that the tax increases and spending cuts would hinder the economic recovery, which has only recently begun to gather pace. They were also disappointed that there was no mention of a reduction in capital gains tax. Consequently, investors rushed to liquidate some of their holdings in an attempt to cash in profits earned during the record-breaking rally earlier this month. Drug and healthcare stocks were especially hard hit because of concern that health system reforms will involve placing restrictions on pharmaceutical prices and healthcare costs. Sector leader Merck fell Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 37 7/8 , while Schering-Plough tumbled Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 59 1/2 and Pfizer Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 60 1/8 . Leading Dow issues were all victims of the sell-off: IBM fared better than most, losing just Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 50, while Philip Morris retreated Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 70 3/8 and AT&amp;T Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 52 5/8 . Airline shares were troubled by talk of a broad-based energy tax. AMR, parent of American Airlines, fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 60 5/8 , Delta lost Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 49 and UAL weakened Dollars 6 1/2 to Dollars 119 1/2 . On the Nasdaq market, selling was particularly fierce. Biggest losers in the healthcare sector were US Healthcare, Dollars 2 5/8 lower at Dollars 45 3/4 , Healthcare Compare, Dollars 4 1/8 cheaper at Dollars 16 1/2 , Coventry, Dollars 6 7/8 down at Dollars 20 1/8 , and PacifiCare, off Dollars 7 1/2 at Dollars 40 1/4 . Canada TORONTO stocks retreated sharply in heavy trading as Canadian markets were dragged down by the steep Wall Street setback. The TSE 300 index closed 31.7 off at 3,410.5 and declines led advances by 443 to 215 after volume of 48.7m shares. The gold shares group was a bright exception, gaining 2.3 per cent as the spot price for gold rose USDollars 3.35 an ounce to USDollars 332.30 in New York. Gold dealers in New York attributed the precious metal's rally to fears about President Clinton's economic plans.</p>

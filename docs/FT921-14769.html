			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Independent Bank is central, Ashdown says - Liberal Democrat Policy OPERATIONAL independence for the Bank of England was yesterday spelt out as a key aim for Liberal Democrats in a hung parliament. In a letter to the party's MPs, Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, said that removing the control of interest-rate policy from politicians to an independent bank would be particularly important in the context of a hung parliament 'to provide economic stability and credibility'. Neither Labour nor the Conservatives favour giving the Bank of England independence, although its role would necessarily change as a result of European economic and monetary union. The letter elaborates on Mr Ashdown's weekend statement that a four-year government programme and no income tax cuts would be among the conditions for Liberal Democrat support if no party had an overall majority. He has already made clear that the party would insist on electoral reform as the essential condition for involvement in a coalition government. Mr Ashdown's letter balanced the need to invest in public services, especially education and training, with a commitment to use Liberal Democrat influence to stop Labour imposing 'penal tax rates' on middle management employees earning salaries greater than Pounds 27,000. Senior ministers in the present cabinet had called for a freedom of information act before taking office, Mr Archy Kirkwood (Lib Dem Roxburgh and Berwickshire) said yesterday as he launched his freedom of information bill. The private members bill may be debated in the Commons on January 24.</p>

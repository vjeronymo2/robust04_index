			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from Miraflores Palace in </F> Caracas; from the "Union Radio News" newscast]    [Text] As is known, the president of the Republic, in full  use of his legislative powers, on 28 February decided to suspend  economic guarantees nationwide. Today, however, following an end  to the problems that prompted the suspension, President Caldera  decided to reinstate these guarantees at a cabinet meeting.    According to Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez, once  taxes on luxury goods and wholesale transactions were enacted,  the continued suspension of economic guarantees was no longer  justifiable. In turn, President Caldera decided to fulfill his  promise to rescind the suspension soon after these two taxes  were promulgated.    [Begin Sosa recording] The reinstatement of economic  guarantees is not that significant in and of itself, because  Venezuelans survived without such guarantees for 30 years.  Nevertheless, this action is significant because it proves to  various economic sectors that they can maintain confidence in  the government's promises and its deeds. The government said it  was going to do something, and it followed through on its  promise. I believe this move has enormous significance. [end  recording]    Sosa also expressed confidence that the dollar might fall  below 150 bolivares. Sosa added that he hopes the psychological  effects that triggered a rise in the price of the dollar will  come to an end and, in turn, prompt the stabilization of the  foreign exchange market.    Sosa said that as a result of his recent trip to the United  States, delegations from the Inter-American Development Bank  [IDB], World Bank, and IMF will soon visit Venezuela. He also  indicated that IDB representatives will assist the government in  planning a very important social housing program. The World Bank  delegation will arrive in Venezuela on 13 June to consult with  Venezuelan officials on the financial crisis. The IMF delegation  will examine fiscal problems projected to occur within the  1994-1996 period.</p>

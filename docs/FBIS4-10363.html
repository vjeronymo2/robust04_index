			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Sergio Lopez, a member of the Chamber of  Deputies Defense Committee, yesterday visited the Armed Forces  Command building where he met with Colonel Carlos Medina  Monjagata, the Military Forces' public relations director.    Lopez was accompanied by Deputy Carlos Riveros and Senator  Fernando Pfannl. The visitors wanted to clarify the incident on  5 April when NOTICIAS photographer Ismael Villalba was held for  one hour after he committed "the sin" of photographing a  conversation between Lopez and soldier Crispulo Sanchez.    A captain whose last name is Galeano and other two officers  were also arrested as a consequence of this incident.    "The colonel told us there had been a misunderstanding in  the  case of the reporter and explained that the Armed Forces does  not intend to restrict freedom of the press," the deputy said.    Regarding the arrest of the captain and the other officers,  the colonel said they were arrested for not carrying out the  already famous "order from above." The deputy, however, could  not say who gave that order.    "It seems that the order was that I could not speak with the  soldier either despite the colonel's remark that the soldier was  at my disposal. Those were the two reasons for the arrest of  Galeano and his comrades," the deputy said.</p>

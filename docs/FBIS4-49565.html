			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wang Hongyang (3076 3163 3152)] </F>   [Text] Shanghai, 19 Apr (XINHUA) -- In issuing an  announcement here on 18 April regarding the official  establishment of the China Foreign Exchange Trading Center, Zhu  Xiaohua, vice president of the People's Bank of China and  director of the State Administration of Exchange Control, said:  Our country's foreign exchange reserves have increased  substantially this year.    Speaking at a no-frills opening ceremony, he said: Since 1  January, our country has implemented a new foreign exchange  control system. People in all circles at home and abroad have  fully affirmed this practice. Over the past three months or so,  we have successfully unified exchange rates, keeping the  renminbi's exchange rates generally stable throughout and  striking a basic balance between supply and demand on the  foreign exchange market. We have kept foreign exchange trading  conduits relatively free for all types of enterprises, thereby  basically guaranteeing enterprises' reasonable demands for  foreign exchange.    He said emphatically: Because of the influx of foreign  capital, the growth of imports, and the expansion of foreign  exchange receipts from nontrading sources such as tourism over  the past three months, our country's foreign exchange reserves  have grown by a record margin in both absolute and relative  terms compared to the corresponding periods in past years.    On the significance of establishing the China Foreign  Exchange Trading Center, Zhu Xiaohua said: The official  operations of this establishment will serve Chinese- and  foreign-funded banking institutions, as well as banking  institutions funded jointly by Chinese and foreign investors, in  balancing their surpluses and deficits in foreign exchange, and  they will provide a reliable guarantee for the nationwide  circulation of foreign currencies and for foreign exchange  settlements in banks; they will also provide an effective market  facility for improving the mechanism for shaping exchange rates,  for implementing a unified and managed floating rate system  based on market supply and demand, and for gradually making the  renminbi freely convertible.    According to the relevant experts, foreign exchange trading  and clearing on this unified national foreign exchange trading  market, which formally went into operation on 4 April, has been  basically normal over the past two weeks.</p>

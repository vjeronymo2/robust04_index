			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (24): Driving force behind capitalism - Technological Innovation / Andrew Fisher is fascinated by inventors and their times Exploring the Black Box, Technology, Economics and History by Nathan Rosenberg, Cambridge University Press Pounds 40 hardback, Pounds 14.95 paperback 274 pages Innovation, the process by which the 'black box' of the title is created, can be fascinating and fruitful or arduous and frustrating. Sometimes, it can be all of these. For while technological innovation is vital to economic advancement, the route to success is anything but straightforward. In Professor Nathan Rosenberg's book, it is made abundantly clear that innovation can bring either pain or reward, probably more of the former. Innovations can be premature so that the pioneers may fail to reap the profits which are then garnered by those coming later - in such cases, the products may be technologically brilliant but not yet economically ripe. Innovations can also go unrecognised so that companies miss the boat. A telling example cited by Rosenberg, professor of economics at Stanford University, is that of Western Union which was offered Alexander Graham Bell's telephone patent for Dollars 100,000 in 1877 but turned it down. Apparently, it did not regard the telephone as an adequate substitute for the telegraph. Inventors and innovators themselves may underestimate or wrongly assess the value of their breakthroughs. Guglielmo Marconi, for example, did not foresee how widely radio could be applied in mass communications. Computers, in their early days, were generally seen as having only limited research applications. Another intriguing point made by Rosenberg concerns innovators themselves. 'Major inventions are frequently the work of outsiders - people whose conceptual frameworks and training are not defined by and limited to the prevailing technology.' Bell was a teacher of the deaf, Marconi had little technological training of any sort and Samuel Morse had been a portrait painter before inventing the telegraph. All three produced their own versions of the 'black box' which Rosenberg uses as a metaphor for the mysteries and benefits of technology. In fact, the book's title is rather more catchy than his treatment of the subject. (Some chapters developed from earlier papers are written with collaborators.) His chief aim is to show how innovation proceeds from the economic, social and scientific background of the time. Thus the book is not a management manual or a guide for businessmen seeking advice on how to translate ideas into commercial success. It is a serious, challenging and often fascinating study - by no means a relaxing read - of how complex technologies arise and find their way along a tortuous and obstacle-strewn route to the market. The book follows an earlier one called Inside the Black Box in which Rosenberg sought to examine its contents. In this one, he is trying to establish how they got there in the first place. He analyses, in historical, economic and technological terms, the processes by which information comes to pervade new technologies. Two of the most fascinating chapters in the book are about Charles Babbage, whose calculating engine was an early precursor of the computer, and Joseph Schumpeter, the Austrian economist who wrote of the 'perennial gale of creative destruction' to which capitalist economies are subject. Rosenberg regards Babbage as a pioneer in the analysis of technological change. He seeks to rehabilitate him from what he calls his 'furtive, almost fugitive existence in the literature of economics'. Babbage, whose book, On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures, was published in 1833, wrote from a deep knowledge of the newly developing mechanical age. Schumpeter's contribution to the debate on innovation was to show that this was a driving force behind the very progress of capitalism. He described capitalism as 'by nature a form or method of economic change' which never is and never can be stationary. He also believed in the primacy of economic history, regarding this as more important than theory or statistics. As well as delving into the history of technological change and analysis, Rosenberg looks separately and in considerable depth at innovation in the energy, chemical, telecommunications and forest products industries. But while these chapters are undoubtedly valuable, it is the broader concepts developed in the first half of the book that are likely to interest most readers.</p>

He said that, if no consensus is  reached, a parliamentary crisis will be solved through  democratic means.    Mircea Snegur said that the terms for the withdrawal of the  14th Army cannot be made conditional on granting special legal  status to the rayons on the left bank of the Dniester River and  added that the secessionists are supported by pro-imperial  forces, but that the revitalization of the empire can be ruled  out.    The president of the Republic of Moldova reiterated the  intention to sign the 'Partnership for Peace' program, after the  public opinion poll scheduled for 6 March. Regarding the  national army, he ruled out the possibility that it will be  liquidated by a decision of the future parliament -- our  Chisinau correspondent Anca Florea reports, citing the press  service of the presidency.</p>

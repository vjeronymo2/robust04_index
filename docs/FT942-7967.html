			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / British Coal paid under Pounds 1/2m by subsidy scheme: Ministers indicated millions were on offer A coal subsidy scheme, which helped the government suppress a backbench revolt over pit closures last year, has provided British Coal with less than Pounds 500,000 from the several hundreds of millions of pounds that ministers indicated were available. Although private-sector mining companies are also benefiting, it is likely that the final bill for the scheme, which ends next March, will amount to less than Pounds 10m. The figures will be used by the Labour Party to support its claims that the subsidy scheme was a cosmetic exercise aimed at saving the jobs of ministers rather than miners. However, the Department of Trade and Industry says the low subsidy level is the result of the weak market which prompted it to implement pit closures in the first place. In addition, the subsidies bill would have been several million pounds higher had British Coal not closed Ellington, one of its few pits to win aid. The promise of subsidies was a cornerstone of a government strategy last March in which ministers 'reprieved' 12 pits from closure while British Coal looked for markets for their coal. Most of the reprieved pits have since closed, along with several others which then looked safe. However the strategy enabled the government to defeat an opposition motion over its coal policy. British Coal would not comment yesterday. However it is understood to have stopped applying for subsidies after complaining the rules of the scheme were so tightly drawn that aid was rarely granted. That means the sum of less than Pounds 500,000 it has already received will not increase. Under the rules of the scheme, no profitable pit is allowed a subsidy and only those pits with the potential to become profitable in three years can qualify. In addition, sales from stocks cannot be subsidised. In last March's coal white paper, the government said it was prepared to 'embrace the range of figures' on subsidies put forward by a House of Commons industry select committee. The committee had sought a subsidy until 1998, saying the total cost would be unlikely to exceed Pounds 500m. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, told parliament this month his department had offered four subsidies, two to British Coal and two to the private sector, and was considering another. In 1993 it paid out about Pounds 1m. The DTI said yesterday that more than that had been paid out in 1994 already, but would not say how much. It said it had received further claims for subsidies. Whitehall sources say the biggest subsidy, Pounds 1.8m, was won this year by the independent Monktonhall pit in Scotland.</p>

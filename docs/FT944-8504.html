			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / UK Company News: GrandMet's involvement in Inntrepreneur reduced Grand Metropolitan and Foster's Brewing Group have refinanced Inntrepreneur Estates, their British pub joint venture, and given it an independent management in an attempt to improve its performance. The partners remain joint owners, however, leaving unresolved the long-term future of Inntrepreneur. GrandMet, keen to focus on its drinks and food businesses, was thought to be seeking a buyer for its stake. 'The market is disappointed that GrandMet has not made a complete exit,' an analyst said. Its shares fell 2p to 408p. Lord Sheppard, GrandMet's chairman, said Inntrepreneur might be 'floated in three or four years when it achieves its value. It does not fit our strategy.' Meanwhile, Grand Met's financial and management involvement would be reduced by the new arrangements. Australian-based Foster's is known to be reviewing whether to sell Courage, the British brewer through which it holds its stake in Inntrepreneur. With 20 per cent of Courage's output sold through the 6,000-pub estate, the City saw the strengthening of Inntrepreneur as a prerequisite to any decision on Courage. Courage's agreement to supply the estate expires in March 1998. GrandMet has managed the joint venture since the partners pooled their pubs in 1991. It has been criticised for running Inntrepreneur more like a property company than a pub business. Some licensees have complained about the terms of their leases. 'Whitbread and others have spent more time developing relations with licensees than GrandMet has,' one analyst said. The changes will bring Inntrepreneur's management 'closer to the lessee,' said Mr Mike Foster, Courage chairman. 'It is about selling beer not just bricks and mortar.' Under the terms: GrandMet and Courage will each convert Pounds 84.5m of interest-free loans to Inntrepreneur into equity and inject a further Pounds 28m of new equity into it. An Pounds 800m main bank facility has been agreed with a group of lenders consisting of National Westminster, Sumitomo, Chase Manhattan, Citibank and JP Morgan. These have less restrictive covenants than Inntrepreneur's existing loans. Inntrepreneur will repay to GrandMet a Pounds 360m interest-bearing loan. The freehold of 320 Chef &amp; Brewer pubs leased to Scottish &amp; Newcastle will be transferred from Inntrepreneur to Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, for an in initial Pounds 203m pending sale of the freeholds. Inntrepreneur's pubs have been written down by a further Pounds 20m, or 1.4 per cent. After the refinancing, Inntrepreneur will have net borrowings of Pounds 969m and shareholders' equity of Pounds 424m. Analysts estimate profits of Pounds 40 to Pounds 50m pre-tax in its first year.

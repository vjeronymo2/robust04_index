			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / News Corp in Dollars 525m deal for Hong Kong TV group MR RUPERT MURDOCH's News Corporation yesterday bought control of HutchVision, operator of StarTV, a Hong Kong-based satellite television system whose broadcasts reach 38 countries from China and Indonesia to Japan and Afghanistan. The Dollars 525m (Pounds 350m) deal takes Mr Murdoch a large step towards realising his media ambitions in Asia. Star TV's five channels, including BBC World Service Television, are available to an estimated 45m viewers in 11m homes. Half the consideration for the deal, which values Star at Dollars 850m, is in cash and the other half in News Corp shares. Mr Murdoch said last night: 'I am very, very thrilled. It's got a long way to go but it has got the potential to be two or three Skys.' News Corp has a 50 per cent stake in British Sky Broadcasting, which runs Sky Television in the UK, a venture in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, also has a stake. Mr Murdoch beat Pearson, the media and banking group, to take a 63.6 per cent stake in the Hong Kong broadcaster. Some Pearson executives apparently thought until recently that the deal was theirs. Pearson was not available for comment last night. Mr Murdoch signed the HutchVision agreement last Thursday on his yacht Morning Glory in the Mediterranean with Mr Li Ka-shing, one of the richest men in Hong Kong. Mr Li and his family own 50 per cent of HutchVision. The rest is owned by Hutchison Whampoa, a company which Mr Li controls. A Hong Kong executive close to the negotiations said last night: 'I don't think that Julian Mounter (chief executive of Star) is a very happy man. He's not sure if it is Christmas or Easter. He was dealing with Pearson.' Pearson is believed to have offered considerably more than News Corp for the Star stake. A key factor in the deal may have been an undertaking by Mr Murdoch to have a public issue of HutchVision shares so Mr Li could sell his remaining stake if he wished. It was also clear that News Corp would have found a way of competing against Star if it had failed to buy control. Hutchison and the Li family will retain 36.4 per cent of the venture and will remain in control of the company that holds the operating licence from the Kong Kong government. This means that unlike Mr Murdoch's Dollars 238.8m bid last month for a 22 per cent stake in Television Broadcasts (TVB), a domestic television company in Hong Kong, no regulatory issues on ownership are involved. The TVB deal was withdrawn for consideration in the face of opposition, partly because Mr Murdoch already owns the highly profitable South China Morning Post but is still not being ruled out formally by News Corp despite yesterday's acquisition. Hutchison and the Li family said the transaction represented six times the funds which the partners had invested in the satellite venture. This excludes the money put into Media Assets, a separate company set up to buy programme rights. Media Assets will now be acquired at cost by HutchVision for Dollars 64m. Hutchison said it had made an extraordinary gain of HKDollars 1.5bn (Pounds 129.3m). Mr Murdoch who has been targeting the Asian television market for some time made a bid, worth an estimated Dollars 250m, for control of Star some months ago that was rejected. Although he then made his move on TVB, which has linked up with Turner Broadcasting and other American broadcasters to transmit a service on an Indonesian satellite, many believe Star was always the target. Star plans to launch a pay television package of channels in October. Lex, Page 18</p>

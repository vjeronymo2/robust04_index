			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (4): Champion of free enterprise - Profile of a young Russian entrepreneur A PHYSICS graduate, Mr Karim Arginbayev, 28, used to dream of devoting his life to science. As it happens, he turned out to be more suited to making money in the new Russia. Occupying a little office leased from a scientific institute in Siberia, Karim Arginbayev has all the qualities it takes to make it as an entrepreneur in the former Soviet Union: brains, contacts, daring and a willingness to get his hands dirty. His path to success is typical of a first generation of biznesmyeny (businessmen) to grow up in the rubble of Communism but who are still perceived by the people at large as vile spekulyanty (speculators). The day I met him he was taking a second-hand Japanese car to a bank manager as a present for lending him Rbs15m at 30 per cent interest for nine months. With monthly inflation estimated at 40 per cent, such a negative interest rate was indeed worth such a gift. Karim's career started just three years ago when he decided, upon finishing his military service, to take advantage of a new law allowing the establisment of co-operatives. Thanks to the new legislation, Karim was able to do legally what blackmarketeers under the late Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev did illegally. He set up a co-operative to bottle ginseng lotion made in his native Kazakhstan. But 'because it takes time to get money back on productive investment,' he also opened a small firm called ARNA for lucrative trading in goods in short supply. His business plan for ARNA, of which he designated himself chairman with a board of directors, was breath-takingly simple. On the strength of a contract he concluded to buy imported audiocassettes in the far eastern port of Vladivostok, he persuaded a friendly bank manager to lend him Rbs1m for three months at 15 per cent. He put Rbs50,000 into ARNA as its starting capital and bought a container full of audio-cassettes. He then sold the cassettes, bought himself a car, a house, and a dacha, and returned the money to the bank. He then borrowed a further Rbs3m from another bank, hired some people to work for him, bought a second car and. . .a new batch of audio-cassetttes. Having repeated this process a few more times, but not returned the subsequent bank loans, he now has outstanding debts of Rbs28m. While other entrepreneurs laundered Communist party funds or stole state property to get started, Karim accumulated his capital on the back of the primitive Soviet state banking system. Each loan was rewarded by a present for the bank manager - usually an audio-cassette player or a microwave oven  -without which he would have been told that credit was either not available or only offered for a triple-digit rate of interest. The beauty of the whole scheme now is that should he default, the banks will not be able to seize the cars and dacha because the money was lent to ARNA as a limited company. On the production side, Karim has used some of the money to set up a small factory on leased premises at the state-owned Botanical Gardens, just outside the Novosibirsk akademgorodok (academic township). In return for his co-operation, the Botanical Gardens director has been given shares in the enterprise, which produces ginseng essence to revitalise tired Siberian miners. From Karim's viewpoint, he is simply spreading wealth and benefitting from a vacuum of effective laws to regulate business activity. From a young age, he was well-disposed towards free enterprise and capitalism - 'my grandfather was shot by the Communists; my father brought me up not to like them.' Having attended a special school for children with scientific talent, the affable young man quickly decided after univerity and a year working at the Institute of Inorganic Chemistry that science was not for him. He preferred 'working with people.' His next project is to set up investment trusts for Russian capitalists to fund research by Russian scientists into new civilan-oriented technology - 'otherwise we will pay for this in future by relying on foreign brains.'</p>

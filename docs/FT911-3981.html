			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Think-tank criticises telecoms white paper PLANS to liberalise the UK telecommunications market have not gone far enough, says a paper published today by the Centre for Policy Studies, the rightwing think-tank. The pamphlet, written by Professor William Letwin of the London School of Economics, argues that the government should build on its telecommunications white paper, published last month, by promoting further liberalisation and tightening the regulatory framework. The white paper proposed abolition of the British Telecom/Mercury Communications duopoly for domestic communications and opening the market to new competitors. Prof Letwin says the government should in addition abolish the duopoly in international services because this would help reduce prices. He also favours greater openness in the way Oftel, the industry watchdog, regulates BT's prices. Prof Letwin argues that BT should be forced to disclose detailed accounting data and to hold public hearings about its prices. 'Transparency in regulation can help to stimulate competitive entry; a lack of it tends to exacerbate uncertainties that discourage entry,' the paper says. Similarly, Prof Letwin argues that excessive vagueness over criteria that determine whether competitors are granted licences will discourage new entrants. The paper proposes that BT and Mercury networks should be treated like 'public highways', with competitors being free to inter-connect with them by paying charges that reflect costs.

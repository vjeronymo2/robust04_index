Speaking at the seminar, F. Limo, member of the national  executive committee of the Revolutionary Party of Tanzania, said  that the work is of weighty significance as it was published at  a time when socialism has suffered a setback in Eastern Europe  and a serious politico-ideological struggle was taking place on  the international arena.    He stressed:    The cause of the collapse of socialism in some countries was  made clear by the great chuche idea.    The collapse of socialism was a product of the conspiracy  between the imperialists and counterrevolutionary forces and a  result of the ideological and cultural infiltration of  imperialism and the corrosive influence of the right opportunist  idea.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in the work fully laid  bare the reactionary nature of the sophism of the imperialists  and renegades of socialism who accused socialism of being  "totalitarian", "barracks-like" and "administrative and  commanding".    The speakers at the seminar said it is an immortal classical  work which dealt a decisive blow at the moves of the  imperialists and renegades of socialism by fully laying bare the  reactionary essence of the sophism of the enemies of socialism  and gave firm conviction and courage to the people by powerfully  demonstrating the justice of the cause of socialism.    A letter to Comrade Kim Chong-il was adopted at the seminar.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ronaldo Brasiliense] </F>   [Text] Brazil is betting on space conquest. In the  beginning of 1995, the National Institute of Space Research  (INPE) in Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo State, will put a  second Data Gathering Satellite (SCD) into orbit. If everything  runs smoothly, it will launch the first Brazilian communications  satellite in 1996. Thus, Brazil will be the Latin American  leader in a scarcely exploited field: cellular telephone systems  supported by satellites.    The INPE is an island of prosperity in a country where  investment in science and technology has been decreasing each  year. With a budget of only $1 billion and the promise of $180  million in supplementary credit, the Science and Technology  Ministry has to define priorities. The space race is one of  these priorities. The ministry's budget represents only 0.7  percent of the Brazilian GDP. This is very little in the face of  Brazil's needs."We had to define priorities and one of them will  undoubtedly be the space program," said engineer Oskar Klingl,  Science and Technology Minister Jose Israel Vargas' chief of  staff.    On 19 May, INPE Director General Marcio Barbosa, engineer,  exhibited in Cachoeira Paulista, in interior Sao Paulo State,  INPE's main achievement: a NEC SX3/12R supercomputer. It was  purchased for $20 million and can process 3.2 billion operations  per second. This supercomputer will be used in the weather  forecast complex. "We will be able to forecast the  metereological conditions five days ahead with 70 percent  accuracy," Marcio Barbosa reported. He said the current system  only forecasts the metereological conditions 24 hours ahead.    According to Barbosa, the supercomputor will have a great  impact on agriculture, civil defense, recreational activities,  and tourism. Not everything is positive, however. At the  national level, Klingl admits that the ministry has been losing  experts, who join private companies as a result of the low  salaries being paid to scientists. He added that there should be  more investment in science and technology, particularly, by the  private sector.</p>

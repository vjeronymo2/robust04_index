			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections: California goes from ballot box to courtroom A San Francisco judge yesterday afternoon issued a temporary restraining order preventing enforcement of parts of the referendum denying social services to illegal immigrants which was approved by the voters of California on Tuesday. Judge Stuart Pollack commented of Proposition 187, supported by a 59-41 per cent margin, 'there are serious legal questions here that need to be resolved.' The move from the ballot box to the courtroom had been expected regardless of the extent of the referendum's victory. Strength of support for the Proposition was clearly a contributory factor in the easy re-election of Governor Pete Wilson over Democratic contender Ms Kathleen Brown and to the narrowness of the defeat of Republican Congressman Michael Huffington by Senator Dianne Feinstein. Both Republican candidates had been vocal advocates in favour and both Democrats against. It also helped the re-election on Tuesday of Mr Dan Lungren, the Republican state attorney general, who only came out in support on Monday. The proposition's passage also prompted an angry response from the Mexican government yesterday. A foreign ministry statement condemned 'all open and undercover forms of discrimination and any xenophobic practices'. Legal challenges to its constitutionality and legality derive from its two principal clauses - the denial of education and non-emergency healthcare to illegal immigrants and the obligation on teachers, doctors and hospitals to report to the federal government any individual suspected of illegal status. Mr Demetrios Papademetriou, an immigration expert at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, who has helped prepare one legal challenge, said the suit was 'very broad' and based on the contention that the proposition would not accomplish what it claimed to do - force the repatriation of the estimated 1.6m illegal immigrants in California. He predicted that the state legal processes could be finished 'quite quickly', though an ultimate judgment by the US Supreme Court, which would take much longer, is considered likely. Mr Papademetriou described Proposition 187 as 'a nasty primal scream'. A Supreme Court ruling in 1982, Plyler v Doe, found that the 14th 'equal protection' amendment to the US constitution prohibited a state from denying admission to schools to any child living within its borders. Federal education law also requires that government funds be withdrawn whenever confidential information is revealed without consent of parents. A problem still to be addressed in the lawsuits is the consequences of forcing out of school the estimated 300,000 sons and daughters of illegal immigrants in California. Proposition opponents argued this was certain to contribute to juvenile delinquency. Governor Wilson has already conceded the inevitability of lawsuits and Mr Lungren last week said he would defend the proposition in court because he was obliged by his office so to do. But he added that he lacked the authority to prosecute teaching and medical professionals accused of not informing on illegal immigrants. Mr Wilson, along with some other governors from states with high levels of immigration, has already sued Washington to require the federal government to cover state expenditure on the health, welfare and education services provided to not only illegal immigrants but also a new flood of refugees and asylum seekers. The principal immigrant recipient states, after California, are Florida, Texas, New York, New Jersey, Illinois and Arizona. Only in Florida has political controversy remotely comparable to that in California been evident, a reflection in part of different economic conditions and political traditions.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tea planters to suspend production India's major tea companies, hit by falling exports and growing stocks, have decided to halt production during the three months to February, reports Reuters from Bombay. Traders said the industry had been facing a glut for the past two years, caused by two bumper crops and dwindling exports to Russia, once the biggest buyer of Indian tea. 'Now we are strapped with huge stocks, and some of that is of inferior quality. The halt in production was thus unavoidable,' explained Mr Vijay Dudeja, chairman of Paramount Tea Marketing. According to the Consultative Committee of Planters' Association, production will be suspended in all prime plantation areas in the eastern and north-eastern regions. These include the gardens of Assam, Terrai, Dooars and Cacchar, which account for nearly 50 per cent of the country's total output. 'We need to export at least 180m to 200m kg of tea every year to prevent an uncomfortable surplus, but that has failed to happen,' said Mr Dudeja. India's annual exports have not risen beyond 140m kg in the past two years. In the three years following the collapse in 1991 of the Soviet Union, which had been buying nearly 100m kg a year, they fell by at least 55m kg. That had resulted in a 12 to 15 per cent cut in the prices of all good and medium quality teas, Mr Dudeja said. Traders said the situation had worsened this year after most planters stepped up production in anticipation of higher purchases by Russia under a debt repayment deal. 'The speculation, however, has backfired, with the Russian buying not picking up as expected,' said Mr Haresh Parekh of tea brokers J. Thomas &amp; Company. Traders estimate that 1994 production will touch 770m kg, up from the previous year's 758m, adding further to the rising stockpile.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / World Trade News: European steelmakers hit out at 'trade war' THE European Community steel industry accused US steelmakers yesterday of launching a full-scale trade war with apparent government support and urged the EC to use all legal and political ways to combat it, Reuter reports from Brussels. The industry lobby group Eurofer said a co-ordinated protest should be made against US trade practices at the G7 summit in Tokyo next month, in the light of final anti-dumping and countervailing duties imposed this week against steel imports from a score of countries including seven states in the European Community. Eurofer said all legal and political means must be used by the European Commission and EC national governments to confront the situation, which it said risked severely prejudicing the outcome of the Gatt Uruguay Round and of negotiations for a Multilateral Steel Agreement. It said the duties announced by the Commerce Department on Tuesday were unfair and resulted from 'largely arbitrary calculations which have no basis in economic logic and are of a political nature'.</p>

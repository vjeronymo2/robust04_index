The PLO leadership's attempts to return those who left the  committee in protest against the Palestinian-Israeli agreement  were made by Sulayman al-Najjab, Palestinian People's Party  representative at the Executive Committee, 10 days after the  Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. They coincided the efforts being  exerted in Israel, Washington, Tunis, and Cairo to rescue the  peace process.    The PFLP and DFLP expressed a desire to return to the PLO  Executive Committee on condition that the Oslo and Cairo  agreements are canceled and the negotiations are conducted  according to international legitimacy's resolutions.    'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, PFLP Political Bureau member, who  represented the front in the Executive Committee before  resigning in protest against the peace talks, paid tribute to  al-Najjab's efforts to return the resigning committee members  and appreciated his care for Palestinian institutions and his  objection to the Cairo agreement.    Malluh told SAWT AL-SHA'B that he emphasized to al-Najjab  that he refuses to distinguish between the Oslo and Cairo  agreements because the latter was an honest translation of the  former. He said his front does not understand the current  attempts to distinguish between the two as if they were  different things. He said his return to the PLO Executive  Committee is conditional on a commitment by the negotiators to  reconsider all past policies, particularly the cancellation of  the Oslo and Cairo agreements, and the presentation of  guarantees to do so.    He pointed out that meetings [not further identified] sought  to discuss the best ways by which the Executive Committee  members, in their capacity as legitimate representatives elected  by the Palestine National Council, can confront the state of  deterioration being experienced by PLO institutions and the  dangers surrounding the Palestine question and the PLO,  considering the organization the Palestinian people's political  entity and unified framework.    Malluh admitted that nothing has thus far emerged from these  meetings despite the sense of national and political  responsibility demonstrated by the Executive Committee members  toward the serious situation of the Palestine question and  toward re-adherence to the PLO's program, the program of return  and self-determination.    Regarding the possibility of re-forming the Executive  Committee, he said: We have to note the stands of the Committee  members. These stands are mixed; some members accept the Oslo  agreement and reject the Cairo agreement.    Asked if he would withdraw his resignation from the PLO  Executive Committee to secure a majority that could bring about  a coup, he said that, based on the members' position on the  overall political process, it is still premature to expect a  white coup in the Executive Committee. He added: A white coup  needs to be studied. The issue is not one of a coup in the full  sense of the word; it is the issue of safeguarding the  Palestinian people's national interests and protecting the PLO  from the concessions made by the negotiating team.</p>

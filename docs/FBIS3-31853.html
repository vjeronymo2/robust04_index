			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Solving Problems Through Dialogue"] </F>   [Text] Hans van den Broek, EU commissioner for  international relations, arrived in Skopje yesterday at the  request of the EU ministers. Just after his arrival, van den  Broek had talks with President Kiro Gligorov. According to the  announcement released by the president's cabinet, they exchanged  opinions about the present questions in Macedonian-Greek  relations and the latest events after the trade embargo embarked  on by the Republic of Greece against the Republic of Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM].    President Gligorov gave the European commissioner a written  message for Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, in which he  reiterated the goodwill and preparedness of the Republic of  Macedonia to resume talks in the framework of the United  Nations, with the assistance of the European Union. The  economic damages caused by the Greek embargo and the danger of  new tensions in the region were particular subjects of  discussion.    EU Commissioner van den Broek made a short statement after  the discussions he had with Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov  regarding the situation created after the Greek embargo and the  possible consequences and implications for Macedonia, but also  for security and stability in the region.    "We had over two hours of intensive, fruitful discussions  and  exchanges of opinions with President Gligorov," Mr. van den  Broek stated to the numerous journalists. "You know about our  mission here -- we are here, first of all, to help resume the  dialogue between Skopje and Athens on a number of very dangerous  and sensitive subjects. We are certainly convinced that the  process of normalization in relations between Skopje and Athens  is irreplaceable for stability and peace in this part of the  region. And I think that both sides are very much aware of that.    "You live here, in a very dangerous part of the world, and  it  would be very careless if the relations between Skopje and  Athens were to escalate the situation in the region," van den  Broek said.    "I shall take the message of President Gligorov to  Papandreou, whom I expect to meet tomorrow afternoon after my  talks with Foreign Minister Papulias this evening, and tomorrow  we are leaving for Brussels," said van den Broek.</p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> HUBBLE TO VIEW HUGE SATURN STORM  </P> <P> The space agency is preparing to use the Hubble Space Telescope to observe a  celestial spectacle: a gargantuan storm on Saturn that is 1 1/2 times wider  than the Earth.  </P> <P> "It's creating a lot of excitement.  </P> <P> As soon as the space telescope people heard about it, they wanted to point the  telescope at it," said Daniel Green of the International Astronomical Union's  Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, a reporting agency for discoveries  in space. The bureau notified Hubble scientists about the storm.  </P> <P> The oval-shaped white spot on the solar system's second-largest planet is  growing, and now measures 12,500 miles wide by 3,100 miles long, New Mexico  State University astronomer Reta Beebe said last week. By comparison, Earth has  a diameter of about 7,900 miles.  </P> <P> Beebe said Saturn's new storm has formed a disturbance that includes two  smaller white spots. The disturbance stretches 50,000 miles east to west --  about one-fifth of the way around the equatorial region of the ringed planet --  and 3,100 miles north to south, she added.  </P> <P> Such storms appear on Saturn roughly once every 30 Earth years -- the length of  a single year on Saturn. They are probably created by a sudden upwelling of  Saturn's internal heat that carries ammonia gas high into the planet's  atmosphere, where it freezes into white crystals of ammonia ice, Beebe said.  </P></p>

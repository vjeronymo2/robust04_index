			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Motoring: Ford puts on the style for estates GOOD-LOOKING estate cars have joined Ford's Mondeo range. The subtly-curved rear end makes the estate's styling far less anonymous than that of the saloons and hatchbacks. The re-designed independent rear suspension is exclusive to the estate car. It minimises intrusion so successfully that Ford claims the Mondeo has a class-leading load space volume (58.3 cubic feet) and a load floor length (73.5 in/184 cm) which is virtually the same as a Volvo 940. All estates cost Pounds 1,000 more than their saloon or hatchback equivalents. Prices range from Pounds 12,835 for a 1.6-litre LX to Pounds 14,155 for the 1.8-litre GLX and Pounds 18,450 for a 2.0-litre Ghia. This flagship model comes with ABS brakes, alloy wheels, self-levelling rear suspension and air-conditioning as standard. Most of these features can be had as extra-cost options on other Mondeo estates. A traction control system is available only on the two-litre models, but every Mondeo Estate has a driver's side air bag and power steering. At present, buyers get a pleasant five-speed manual gearbox without the option, but on their way are automatics and four-wheel drives (although these will have manual transmission only). Before that come 1.8-litre turbo-diesels, which should perform at least as well as Mondeo estates with 1.6-litre petrol engines. Even the cheapest 1.6-litre LX has 60:40 split folding rear seats, a load space cover, and tie-downs to stop heavy things sliding forward should you have to make a panic stop. YOU ARE driving along a motorway in pouring rain when, suddenly, the steering becomes suspiciously light. Turning the wheel produces no response. Your front tyres are aquaplaning. Instead of biting on the tarmac, they are riding on a film of water that the grooves and slots of the tread pattern cannot clear away fast enough. Aquaplaning is alarming and potentially lethal. Mostly, it happens when you hit a long puddle or a sheet of water streaming sideways across a road. But continuous aquaplaning conditions can occur for hundreds of yards on level but poorly-drained road surfaces in a deluge. The faster you go, the greater the risk. Many unexplained wet-weather accidents of 'the car just went into a skid' variety are because of aquaplaning, especially if the tyres have wide treads and are well worn. The best way to avoid aquaplaning is, of course, to slow down when it rains cats and dogs. But risks can be lessened by choosing a tyre like Goodyear's new Aquatred, which has just gone on sale in European markets, including Britain. At a glance, the deep drainage channel in the middle of the tread makes the Aquatred looks like two very narrow tyres side by side. This channel lets a lot of water flow through the tyre's footprint, with the surplus pumped out to the side through slots. These are so curved that the Aquatred is a one-way tyre; a big arrow on the side wall shows the direction of rotation. The 'twin tyre' principle has been used before on tyres for vehicles with very high performance, but the Aquatred is the first aimed at cars like Golfs and Mondeos, Peugeot 405s and Rover 400s. It costs about 7 per cent more than a conventional summer-pattern tyre, but reduces the risk of aquaplaning considerably . At Goodyear's Mireval proving ground near Montpellier, France, last week, I watched two family hatchbacks drive round a 200-metre circle with a 30-metre segment flooded by 8mm of water. One car was on normal tyres, the other on Aquatreds. At about 60 kph (37 kph), both kept on line when hitting the water. As speed rose, one ran wider and wider until, at 85 kph (53 mph), it aquaplaned out of control. But not the car with Aquatreds. I then drove several Aquatred-shod cars on Mireval's handling circuit. In the dry, they rode, steered and handled as they would on the best normal tyres. On a surface like that of a winding country road during a summer downpour, the Aquatreds let me corner and brake as though it were merely damp. Ideally, Aquatreds - which will last as long as tyres with conventionally patterns - should be fitted in sets but you could start with a pair on the back wheels. They are a logical choice for motorists who give wet-weather safety high priority.</p>

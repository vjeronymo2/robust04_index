			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by NEZAVISIMOST Editor in Chief Vladimir Kuleba: </F> "Such a Meager Selection..."]    [Text] Like it or not, that is the conclusion one  reaches when analyzing the list of aspirants nominated as  candidates for president of Ukraine. The first threesome of  probable victors consists of Leonid Kravchuk, Ivan Plyushch, and  Leonid Kuchma. Of course, a fascinating spectacle awaits us--the  "bear fight under the rug" promise to be super-entertaining,  better than the Western preelection shows. Indeed, only the  results are known beforehand--no matter how you shuffle our far  from saintly threesome, things will not be improved. Each of  them has made a worthy contribution over the past two years or  so to "getting the government mired down in communist dogma and  corruption, while the words 'Ukrainization' and 'Ukraine'  resound as synonyms for economic impoverishment, collapse, and  resistance to reforms." But let us take a closer look at their  prospects.  <H5>  Leonid Kravchuk </H5>   It would seem his political star has faded. Though as  recently as January his ratings were high. His base--the old  Communist Party nomenklatura, established structures in the  localities, the "party of power"--seemed to be powerful and  unshakeable. But on the very eve of activity of the Supreme  Council, "at the signal" as chessplayers say, Ivan Plyushch  somewhat unexpectedly outplayed that skillful grand master of  political intrigue, Leonid Kravchuk, confronting him not only  with the prospect of the presidential elections, but with the  dismantling of the organs of executive authority.    Like last year, this year has not been most successful for  the current president. Especially during the spring, in April.  According to all assessments, the elections to the parliament  did not have to be held. A great deal of effort was expended to  this end. Wily maneuvers were plotted, districts were "stuffed"  with deputies, and "his" people worked tirelessly. But despite  the predictions, the people of Ukraine went to the elections  even on a more massive scale than was the case in December in  Russia, where the campaigning was quite heavy.    We will risk making the conjecture that if the presidential  election is in fact held, L. Kravchuk will lose. It is possible  he will not even make it to the second round. Naturally, all the  actions of his team--the "party of power"--will be aimed at  postponing the election. The newspapers, radio, and television,  devoted to L. Kravchuk, have already set about accomplishing  this (at the same time they are attempting to resuscitate the  fairly shaken prestige of L. Kravchuk, to ideologically dust off  his somewhat worn political image, publishing all kinds of tales  of the variety that appeared in KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI, and not  only there). To the extent I am aware, an address by L. Kravchuk  to the parliament and the people on the need to postpone the  time frame for the presidential election is in the preparation  stage. I believe every possible alternative will be employed, up  to and including a referendum--to which, incidentally, the  president has the right. In other words, the tactics are  simple--prevent the election even if it kills him. Here like  never before another wave of anti-Russian hysteria will come in  handy, as will the search for enemies of sovereign power, the  "fifth column" headed by that ardent enemy of L. Kravchuk and of  the nation--Leonid Kuchma.    Well, such is the logic of the struggle for power. And as  yet  no one has ever voluntarily rejected it--power. Except perhaps  for Nikolay II, and he was actually coerced. Standing behind L.  Kravchuk is the giant mass of today's managers and  administrators. They will do everything in their power to see to  it that no one else is allowed to get near the feeding trough,  pretty heavily depleted though it is. The ideological refrain of  the "party of power" and national-democratic forces connected to  it: "To date there is no guarantor of sovereignty and statehood  in Ukraine other than Leonid Kravchuk."    This is all quite sad, for in maintaining our present  situation, our economic, political, and spiritual crises will  become irreversible.  <H5>  Ivan Plyushch </H5>   Candidate Number One. His popularity among the people is  legendary and anecdotal. "Wait, wait,"--they told me in one  village, drowning out the loudspeaker. "We had a stableman like  that in our crew who would stir everything up. Could this be  him?" Hidden behind a somewhat feigned simplicity, at times with  excessively painstaking effort to mispronounce his speech--not  overly literate to begin with--is a keen, shrewd mind,  phenomenal memory, and the ability to listen and to hear. Ivan  Plyushch is a 100-percent "crafty Ukrainian," and rural  residents constitute his electorate. Just the appearance of  Plyushch on the television screen is enough to elicit a grimace  of skepticism on reflective city intellectuals. Which he  realizes, incidentally, and answers representatives of this  "narrow segment" in the same vein. As if to say--you know what  they are all about, writers... His base is the powerful agrarian  lobby of large kolkhoz and sovkhoz owners, the diversified  system of rural soviets, etc. This system remains intact  probably only in Ukraine, and is named not in jest the party of  Plyushch.    From director of a poultry farm--to leader of parliament,  and  then president of the state. Those who have decided to vote for  him see their own--the Ukrainian dream, personified in this  manner. Open and direct, from the lower classes, he speaks  simply, like most of those raised in the rye and wheat.  Everything about him is clear. His language is strong if need  be, and he can be scolding. But he can withdraw just as quickly,  forgive and forget. And he will share his piece of bread and  butter. He will be a fair president, and perhaps will give some  land. God grant him health!    Meanwhile, the latest steps and actions of Ivan Plyushch  show  that he has become significantly more skilled in politics, where  the simpleminded and somewhat eccentric are left in the  background.    "I do not change my position time and again, as others do.  Incidentally, those who do change their position, who adjust  it--have many opponents. Leonid Makarovich likes this very much.  He believes a politician is one who does all this. I always  disagree with him here. He once said that a politician is a  person who is able to discern the mood of the masses. But I  believe a politician takes a mood to the masses and then leads  them behind it, behind himself. Otherwise the politician is not  moving ahead of the masses, but is instead following--which is  dangerous."    We will risk making the conjecture that if the election is  held, and if Plyushch and Kuchma make it to the finish line,  Plyushch will be the victor. He is the more "pro-Ukrainian"  candidate.  <H5>  Leonid Kuchma </H5>   One leader of the national-democratic movement made a  dreadful attributive comment with respect to the former Komsomol  organizer, party organizer, and Yuzhmash director, stating that  he destroyed the government and then left with extremely high  standing. Here is the opinion of a former comrade-in-arms. "He  was conniving with the mafia behind my back, and I--fool that I  was--trusted him." His current rival for the post says: "A model  protege of the military-industrial complex and mafia structures."    This in no way completes all the "gingerbread" attributed to  Leonid Kuchma, an outwardly calm and intelligent man with  pleasant manners and measured, quiet voice, the person who first  spoke of the existence of a mafia at the highest levels--selling  out the country wholesale and retail. At that time his words  aroused the people, and the hope emerged that perhaps everything  would change, that life would become at least a little bit  better and less dangerous. They called Kuchma's Cabinet of  Ministers the government of last hope. Alas time passed, and the  nomenklatura openly blocked and perverted the reforms. The  procuracy "delayed," the Ukrainian Security Council and Ministry  of Internal Affairs found themselves as always "outside the  loop," and mafia clans rallied, "knocking" the supporters of  reforms out of the government--I. Yukhnovskyy, V. Pynzenyk, Yu.  Ioffe--while Kuchma gave into them all too obediently. We know  full well how everything turned out.    But his memory among the people is a kind one. Perhaps  because--to the same degree as Plyushch--he responds to the  expectations of a fairly large number of average citizens of the  eastern region. He speaks Russian better than Ukrainian, is not  hurrying towards relations with Russia but is not shying away  from the issue either. He is trying to clarify, at least for  himself, exactly what it is we are trying to build--whether it  is a market with capitalism, or socialism with rationing for  some and special distribution for others. Though it would seem  no one else in Ukraine knows either.    The "red" directors, military-industrial complex, and  Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs are behind  Kuchma. Against him are all the national-democrats, the "party  of power," and Plyushch's group. The alignment is clearly skewed  in their direction. However, sociologists assert that were the  election held today, he would gather the most votes (15.2  percent--twice as many as L. Kravchuk). Who will gain the upper  hand?  <H5>  Vladimir Lanovyy </H5>   A hopeless reformer and market advocate. He has his own  concept of extricating Ukraine from its economic crisis, but no  one has ever asked for it. Under pressure from democratic  forces, he was brought into the conservative government of V.  Fokin as deputy prime minister and minister of economics. A  "strange bird" there, time and again he escaped the attacks of  experienced apparatchiks, but was soon dismissed by edict of the  president. Why--we do not yet know.    In ordinary life he is an intelligent, soft-spoken, likable  individual, an outstanding family man. He is an analytical  storehouse of knowledge, more a theoretician than a practical  organizer. He is hindered by a lack of experience in apparatus  work.    Following his departure from the Cabinet of Ministers, he  founded the Center for Market Reforms, where he assembled bright  minds. He is stubbornly biding his time, polishing up his  economic concepts. I am firmly convinced that Lanovyy's time  will come and his theories will prove useful. Many  entrepreneurial circles support him, people for whom it is  already too late to stop or ponder about where we are headed.  They believe him and have fallen in line. Now guarantees by the  state are needed. Guarantees which, in their opinion, may be  obtained if Lanovyy becomes president.    All the same, I believe his chances of victory are not  great.  It is not yet Lanovyy's time.  <H5>  Aleksandr Moroz, Petr Simonenko, and Others </H5>   Nor is it the time of Moroz or Simonenko. In fact their very  nomination is somewhat strange. On the one hand, yesterday's  second and even third-rank Communist Party functionaries are all  too fervently thirsting for power. They are displaying their  former eagerness, not ashamed of elbowing aside not only  inveterate Rukh people, but each other as well. "We have certain  grievances against the Ukrainian Communist Party which, despite  agreements reached previously, has nominated candidates in  districts we already occupy. There has not been such action on  the part of the socialists." Maybe in revenge the communists  conducted their own conference behind closed doors, discussing  "intra-party matters."    Incidentally, as we know, a parliamentary-presidential  structure is set into the program of the socialists, and so  their claims of victory are understandable. It is another matter  with the Communist Party of Ukraine, which rejects out of hand  the presidential form of rule. "But look, we have decided to  participate, taking into account the circumstances of the  present moment." There will be some laughter if they come out  and take the election--what do they do with the presidency? But  then again, no problem. You can always adjust the statutes a  bit--it would not be the first time!    Of course, neither the socialists nor the communists have  any  chance of winning the presidential election--so painfully  importunate are their slogans and the deceitful actions we are  so sick and tired of. I believe they too understand this and  will therefore use the present election round, which holds no  prospects for them, in the vein of the well-known sporting  principle--the main thing is to participate, "to get exposure."    And so, we have three clear leaders from among the nominated  candidates, those same familiar faces--L. Kravchuk, I. Plyushch,  and L. Kuchma. Leonid Kravchuk will most probably not register  as an official candidate, but instead propose to the parliament  that the election be postponed. In that event, whether the  election is postponed or not, the most probable contenders will  be down to two--Leonid Kuchma and Ivan Plyushch. I will state  quite frankly that the choice is not very great. And for  Ukraine, this is a major catastrophe.    P.S. When this issue was going to print, it became  clear that the number of candidates for the office of president  had increased. Among those additionally seeking the post: former  Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Pynzenyk and Nikolay Rud, associate  at a Kiev institute of higher education. It cannot be ruled out  that the ranks of contenders will be further augmented in the  coming days, to the extent that the presidential election  ballots may have to be printed on two sides. But, we are  familiar with this kind of thing...</p>

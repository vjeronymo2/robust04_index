			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: Swiss to grant banking licences to Japanese THE Swiss government is prepared to grant banking licences to up to 10 Japanese financial institutions by the end of this year. Mr Alexis Lautenberg, head of the financial and economic division in the Swiss Foreign Ministry, said yesterday that the government was also ready to grant a one-year extension to the 11 other Japanese-owned non-bank financial institutions in Switzerland which want to become banks but cannot yet qualify. These decisions reflect the successful conclusion of a lengthy bilateral negotiation on financial issues between Japan and Switzerland. The talks took place against the background of a Swiss law that requires all non-bank financial institutions to convert themselves into banks by the end of this year. The Swiss threatened to hold back banking licences unless the Japanese Ministry of Finance (MoF) eased restrictions on the operations of Swiss banks in Japan. In late June, the Japanese Diet (parliament) passed a law enabling foreign banks in Japan to increase their ownership of securities subsidiaries from 50 per cent to 100 per cent. No progress was made on two other issues, The ministry refused to lift its severe limits on Japanese individuals putting their capital in foreign banks. 'We understand and trust they will take steps in the future,' Mr Lautenberg said. For legal reasons, the ministry has also been unable to lift restrictions on securities companies' participation in the Japanese foreign exchange market. The ministry will now decide to which financial institutions the Swiss banking licences should be allocated. There is speculation in Japanese financial circles in Zurich that all but one of the nine subsidiaries of Japanese banks without banking licences will be selected, but only two of the subsidiaries of the 12 securities companies will convert themselves into banks. Mr Lautenberg said the offer of an extension to the rest should only be taken up by those who really intended to seek a banking licence. It should not be used to delay making a decision.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Indro Montanelli: "In the Name of `The </F> People'"]    [Text] [Prime Minister] Berlusconi should confine his  statements to monologues. Composed in advance, committed to  memory, rehearsed over and over in front of the mirror, they can  even seem spontaneous and impromptu. Press conferences -- where  you really do have to be spontaneous in response to journalists'  malicious and sometimes underhand provocations -- do not suit  him. He showed this again the other day when he allowed himself  to say that RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation], being a  public service of the state, cannot set itself against the  ruling majority. This displays an alarming conceptual confusion  on his part between state and government.    But this is not the worrying thing. What worries us much  more is the fact that, in the face of a tide of angry responses,  he said he was confident of having conveyed the thoughts and  feelings of what he calls "the people," as is proved, he says,  by opinion polls. We all know the unconditional trust that the  prime minister places in opinion polls, and the fervent  enthusiasm that the organizers of these polls grant him in  return. But in this specific instance we are afraid that they  did tell the truth: "The people" probably do like the prospect  of six television networks (three RAI and three Fininvest)  setting aside debates and disputes to praise the new regime and  its "helmsman."    We are very well aware of where this path leads. This is  particularly clear to members of my generation, who have already  experienced it. But before sounding the alarm, we who work in  the "mass media" should consider why "the people" prefer a  single sector of the media, not too concerned about whether or  not it is free. Have we so badly used, or rather abused, this  freedom, since the allies returned it to us, as to make "the  people" long for a return to censorship? We put this question  chiefly to the left-wing forces, recalling the fierce  sectarianism with which they persecuted whoever sounded a  different note from them.    Some will say that it is not opportune to hold a trial on  abuses of freedom at a time when freedom is in jeopardy. This  is true, which is why we will not persist with it. But only  these abuses can explain the indifference with which the  so-called man in the street responded to the helmsman's remarks  and justify his claim of having made them on behalf of the  people and with their tacit consent. I was still in short pants  when Matteotti [antifascist] was assassinated. But I still  remember what people around me said about it. After six months  of heated campaigning in the press (there was no television or  radio at the time) in which nobody could any longer distinguish  truth from lies, people welcomed with relief the 3 January 1925  speech with which Mussolini gagged the press and announced the  dictatorship -- that which, amid the forced silence of its  opponents, led us to the racist laws and to the disaster of  World War II.    Berlusconi is not Mussolini. He has no corpses on his  conscience. And we see on the horizon no earth-shattering  tragedies such as those into which fascism found itself drawn.  But it is this very climate of fascism, of exemption not from  problems (those, we have), but from the existential anxieties  that make us receptive to the great principles, that could open  Berlusconi's way to a "democracy by proclamation." Not of the  Palazzo Venezia [fascist] kind, which would be too extensive for  him. But that of the Casa Rosada, which permitted Peron to  harangue the crowd as follows, "They say a dollar costs 10,000  pesos. But when your wives go to the market to buy meat, do  they pay in dollars?" and to win the applause of those same  "people" whom Berlusconi now cites to argue, on their behalf,  the subjugation of the entire powerful and influential mechanism  of television to the interests of his majority.    He will succeed because the people are with him, and not  with  us. And when the people set themselves behind someone, the men  of the media eventually support the people. I saw this happen  at the start of my life. I never expected to see it at the  close. But it seems that it must be so.</p>

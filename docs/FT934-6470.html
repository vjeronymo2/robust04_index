			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Fears grow of Russian energy shortages The supply of energy to industry and homes in Russia over the winter is at risk - under the twin pressures of cuts in the budget and threatened mineworkers strikes. Mr Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister and acting head of the government in the absence on holiday of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, has warned of shortages by early next year unless billions of roubles are provided to energy producing industries. At a government meeting yesterday, Mr Soskovets lambasted the Ministry of Finance for 'behaving like an ostrich' in the provision of credits to the industry and said it had provided only half of a planned Rbs610bn to the energy sector. Mr Soskovets said that Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, should be made personally responsible for the supply of finance to the energy sector. Temperatures plunging to -20 per cent below zero throughout Russia have hugely increased energy consumption, while supplies have been cut in some areas down to 30 per cent of normal levels, according to Mr Soskovets. Mutual debts of enterprises in, or heavily dependent on, the energy sector are put at Rbs 8,000bn - a situation which is causing progressive paralysis, particularly in the coal sector. The flashpoint is the Vorkuta coalfield, where miners have threatened an all-out strike from December 1 if they do not get back payments for the last three months. A report in the daily Izvestiya said Rbs100bn had been set aside for pay arrears - on the eve of a planned visit to Vorkuta tomorrow by Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister and leader of Russia's Choice political group. The Fuel and Energy Ministry said yesterday 'an explosive socio-economic situation has developed in the coal regions' and said miners were due Rbs400bn in back pay. The miners have been the main industrial support for President Boris Yeltsin and reformers in the government. Their 1991 strikes fatally weakened the tottering Soviet government, and strikes in 1989 signalled the first widescale dissatisfaction with the policies of Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, then Soviet president. In an interview with Izvestiya, Mr Yuri Malyshev, head of the Rusugol coal enterprise, said a plan to shut 42 of Russia 236 pits which had run out of viable reserves would be put into effect between now and the end of the century.</p>

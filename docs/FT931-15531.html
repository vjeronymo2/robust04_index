			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Middle East fears put bourses in cautious mood WALL Street's fall on Friday and weakness in London yesterday contributed to the cautious mood on the Continent, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS fell on Middle East jitters which made fund managers reluctant to commit themselves either way to the market. The CAC-40 index fell 38.05 to 1,814.58 in modest turnover of FFr2.1bn. Lafarge Coppee fell FFr6.90 to FFr330 on news that its US unit will record a Dollars 62m exceptional loss on 1992 accounts due to new US accounting rules regarding post-retirement benefits and income tax expenses. Air Liquide, which also has a US subsidiary, lost FFr21 to FFr754, on fears that it might have to do the same thing. Weak oil prices weighed on Total, down FFr5 to FFr235 and Elf, down FFr15.20 to FFr341. AMSTERDAM was depressed by weakness in the transport sector while Royal Dutch shed Fl 1.30 to Fl 147.40 after Hoare Govett downgraded the stock to a 'sell' after forecasting dividends in 1992 and 1993 of Fl 8.35 after Fl 8.20 in 1991. The CBS Tendency Index lost 0.6 to 96.0. Nedlloyd lost Fl 3.00 or 10 per cent to Fl 27.40 as selling accelerated on last week's news that Mr Torstein Hagen had reduced his stake and had resigned from the supervisory board. KLM weakened Fl 1.20 to Fl 24.40 on unsubstantiated reports that it was losing some Fl 2m a day while Frans Maas shed Fl 2.50 to Fl 44.50 after forecasting sharply lower earnings in 1993. Hagemeyer went against the trend with a gain of Fl 8.00 or 6.2 per cent to Fl 136.00 on better than expected 1992 results and a positive 1993 forecast. MILAN fell in technical trading ahead of the expiry of options contracts tomorrow. However, dealers reported that the lira's weakness was encouraging some buying by foreigners. The Comit index fell 7.48 or 1.6 per cent to 449.21 in turnover estimated at around Friday's L225.9bn. Domestic political worries, as the ex-communist Democratic Party of the Left prepared a vote of no-confidence in the four-party coalition, also weighed on the market. Fiat was fixed L110 lower at L4,155 and slid to L4,065 after hours on a newspaper report that Italian car sales fell 8.5 per cent in December from the year-ago period. After the close, the trade group, Anfia, said that car deliveries fell 6.36 per cent year-on-year in December. FRANKFURT saw mark-ups among carmakers, mild weakness in banks and an average performance from chemicals as the DAX index closed a mere 0.44 higher at 1,531.96. Turnover was said to be thin again, after Friday's DM3.7bn. Daimler led the carmakers higher with a rise of DM6 to DM538.30 but analysts said that this was merely a reaction to last week's losses in the shares after a hefty 1993 earnings downgrade by brokers James Capel. In the same sector Volkswagen ended DM2 higher at DM256.50. Analysts expect its management to discuss a programme to cut costs significantly at a board meeting tomorrow. MADRID ran into selling pressure in the afternoon and the general index closed down 0.79 at 219.37. Endesa slipped Pta110 to Pta3,900 on profit-taking. FG Inversiones Bursatiles said at a presentation in London yesterday that it was recommending defensive stocks 'with clear overweightings in the electricity sector and motorways'. The Madrid broker continued to believe that the first-half of the year was unlikely to see much of a market rally, and that investors should reduce positions above 220 on the general index. ZURICH dropped and rumours about Nestle were mainly to blame in spite of a denial by the food company that it was planning a rights issue. Nestle bearers fell SFr50 to SFr1,080 and the SMI index closed 25.4 lower at 2,049.5. Bearers in the arms and engineering group, Oerlikon-Buhrle, rose SFr35 to SFr400 after a Sunday newspaper report that first payments had been received on an arms deal announced last March. BRUSSELS concentrated on Delhaize, up BFr50 or 4.8 per cent to BFr1,278 after it reported a better than expected 5 per cent increase in 1992 earnings and a rise in the dividend after Friday's close. The Bel-20 index closed just 0.14 ahead at 1,144.11 in turnover of BFr1.1bn. STOCKHOLM fell, but closed above early lows after publication of the budget for the fiscal year ending June 1994. Rising money market rates also weighed on prices. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 5.2 to 943.1 in turnover of SKr602m after Friday's SKr946m. Astra attracted more profit-taking, its A shares falling SKr10 to SKr716. OSLO continued its downward correction, pulled down by losses in Kvaerner and Norsk Hydro. The all-share index shed 3.41 to 385.86 in light turnover of NKr147m. Norsk Hydro lost NKr1 to NKr163, while Kvaerner ended down NKr4 at NKr156. HELSINKI was pulled down by the bank index which dropped 17.8 per cent on government plans to cut the nominal value on bank shares in compensation for state support. The Hex index fell 16.79 or 1.9 per cent to 888.3, closing above its early lows. ISTANBUL closed at its highest level since late September on expectations of good 1992 company results. The 75-share index improved 24.85 to 4,163.13 in turnover of TL195bn.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- January 11                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                  Open       10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100          1075.88     1077.18    1076.02    1075.01 FT-SE Eurotrack 200          1165.29     1164.14    1163.97    1160.08  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                 13.00       14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100          1073.36     1070.35    1069.18    1069.87 FT-SE Eurotrack 200          1157.92     1156.59    1154.16    1155.95  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Jan 8     Jan 7     Jan 6     Jan 5     Jan 4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1080.25   1081.92   1091.68   1090.07   1083.42 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1167.34   1171.90   1179.18   1180.16   1174.71  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1077.67; 200 - 1166.14 Low/day: 100 - 1069.04 200 - 1154.11  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

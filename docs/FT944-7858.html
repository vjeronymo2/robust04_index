			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Capital drive for Kyrgyzstan The World Bank is to co-sponsor a foreign investors conference in Paris to try to get capital flowing into Kyrgyzstan, whose market reforms, western economists say, have in many ways been a model for the Commonwealth of Independent States. The bank and the Kyrgyz government have invited 343 foreign investors from 27 nations to Paris on December 7-8. The conference is meant to allow the Central Asian republic to take an additional step to reviving its economy. Already, the republic, which has been following an International Monetary Fund-directed programme, has stabilised its currency, the som, and appears about to bring inflation below 1 per cent a month, according to western estimates. In addition, three years after the Soviet collapse, Kyrgyzstan appears set to become the first CIS republic to achieve economic growth. Western economists are predicting that its economy will expand by 1-2 per cent in the second half next year. While its wealth pales in comparison to neighbouring Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, the IMF and World Bank have put the spotlight on Kyrgyzstan because of its monetary stability and liberal investment laws.</p>

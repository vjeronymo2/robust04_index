			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (1): Where business success is prized above all - Atlanta has been the leading business city of the American South for several decades, but it now aspires to even greater things. The 1996 Olympics are widely believed by Atlantans to be the lever for catapulting the city to international standing The essence of other cities may be culture, high finance, beauty or glamour. But Atlanta has commerce in its heart. The city prides itself on being a place where people can succeed, and where business success is prized above all. 'The whole tone of the city is one of aspiration,' says Mr Alf Nucifora, a top local marketing consultant, who came from Australia some 20 years ago and rose to prominence. While dreadfully prone to boosterism, Atlantans say their hometown is characterised by a 'can do' attitude. Defeatism and 'thinking small' are anathema here. Although the heart of Atlanta is business, it is not a city that is money mad. It is more that Atlantans are single-minded in the pursuit of 'making it,' whether it be a successful dry cleaning shop or a leading worldwide television network - CNN. Atlanta's attitude is perhaps a product of its history. Originally a simple railway town known as Terminus, it changed its name in 1845 to the grander-sounding Atlanta. After being razed by Union Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman near the end of the Civil War, it rebuilt itself from the ashes to once again thrive in the late 19th century as a railroad town. Fittingly, Atlanta's symbol is the Phoenix. Entrepreneurial spirit always seems to have powered the town. In the 1880s, a shrewd businessman by the name of Asa Candler saw the immense possibilities of marketing sweet fizzy water and built the foundation of the Coca Cola empire. Coca Cola's worldwide headquarters remains here today. It has been the leading business city of the South for several decades, but it now aspires to more. It wants international status. Although some snigger, Atlanta wishes to be the 'next great international city,' in the same league as New York or Los Angeles, London or Rome. The 1996 Olympics, which will be held here, are widely believed to be the lever for catapulting the city to international standing. And Atlanta is putting every ounce of its energy into trying to make the Olympics a marketing opportunity for the city as well as the state of Georgia, of which it is the capital. Since August 1993, the Chamber of Commerce has run an international advertising campaign using the Olympics to boost the city on CNN International. The ads are part of a five-year, Dollars 10m-plus marketing program by the Chamber. Mr Nucifora is also trying to raise Dollars 5m for another campaign to market Atlanta in the run-up to the Olympics. He hopes the theme of the new campaign will replace the old slogan 'The City Too Busy To Hate,' which has endured since the days of the struggle for civil rights and is now clearly outdated. The new slogan will be about aspirations and dreams, a theme endorsed by nearly 90 per cent of those he has queried. At the same time, the Governor of Georgia, Mr Zell Miller, has appointed a group of business leaders to orchestrate a high level, individually targetted marketing effort called 'Operation Legacy.' It is hosting a series of invitation-only tours of Atlanta for top companies and individuals which might invest here. The best prospects will be invited back to attend the Games. While not yet of international stature, Atlanta has much to boast about. Already home to representative offices of more than 730 of the Fortune 1,000, it is consistently rated as one of the most desirable cities in America in which to relocate a company or start a new business. This year, Altanta was the winner of the 'Best Cities for Small Business' award by Entrepreneur Magazine. It also topped the World Trade Magazine's recent list for the best ten US cities for global companies. Good location and transportation facilities continue to be Atlanta's main economic attractions. By air, 80 per cent of the American population can be reached within two hours. Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, with over 1,500 daily flights, including some 300 international flights a week, is rated the world's second busiest. An average of 50m passengers a year pass through Hartsfield, which has just opened a new international concourse that can process 6,000 passengers an hour. Although mired presently in downsizing, Delta, one of America's top three air carriers, calls Atlanta home and accounts for about 80 per cent of the airport's passenger traffic. Atlanta is also a leading distribution centre for goods moving over land. Three interstate highways intersect the city. For rail distribution, CSX and Norfolk Southern Railroads operate 80 freight trains in and out of Atlanta daily. Telecoms capacity is high, with more fibre optic cable laid than any city in the US. BellSouth, one of the leading Baby Bells, has its headquarters in Atlanta as does Turner Broadcasting and Turner's worldwide news network CNN. If short on sophistication, Atlanta's quality of life is high at a modest cost compared to other large cities. Housing is moderately priced. Recreational amenities include an ample supply of golf courses, tennis clubs and city parks. Nearby, Lake Lanier is used for water sports, and the southernmost Appalachian mountains offer great hiking. Its attractions have made Atlanta a boom town. The prosperity has lured more and more people to 'Hotlanta,' as the boosters are fond of calling it. Between 1984 and 1993, 1,506 new companies, including 361 foreign firms, have relocated to Atlanta, investing Dollars 80bn and helping to create a net increase of 487,600 jobs. Between 1980 and 1990, Atlanta's population grew 32.5 per cent to 2.83m. Last year, an estimated 86,000 people arrived in metro Atlanta, driving up housing construction by about 40,000 units. Even with all of the city's appeal and formidable energy, there are still some who worry that the 1996 Olympics may not bring the glory to Atlanta that is expected. These sceptics say that the Olympics may prove that Atlanta lamentably believed its own hype and over-reached itself. A city of Atlanta's size with a more modest opinion of itself would probably have never even attempted to lure the Olympic Games. But Atlanta dared and won. And for the moment, the Dollars 1.5bn worth of Olympic preparations are reported to be on schedule and on budget. Perhaps because so many have come here and done well, Atlantans feel a deep affection for the city. This has in turn led to one of its greatest distinctions: the business community is perhaps the most civicly active in America. They not only give money to community causes, they give time and energy. They chair arts and community development committees, raise money for charities, clean up public parks, and volunteer for The Atlanta Project, the local anti-poverty programme of the former US president, Jimmy Carter. It is a point of pride for business and professional people to be involved in community affairs. Mr Wyck Knox, a senior partner at the Atlanta law firm of Kilpatrick &amp; Cody, has civic commitments that require a significant amount of his time, but he observes: 'People in business and professional circles are interested in making things happen here.' He admits civic involvement is also good for business - and he adds that 'it's important in Atlanta to be perceived as doing something useful for the community.' Another of Atlanta's distinctions is its ability to maintain racial harmony when so many other American cities have been riven by racial animosities. Despite the fact that the central city is predominantly black, while the larger metro area is predominantly white, Atlanta's black politicians and white business elite long ago recognised the value of racial harmony for economic growth. While all is not sweetness and light between blacks and whites, Atlanta's mayor, Mr Bill Campbell, who is black, says, that race 'has not been a hindrance to finding common solutions or trying to work together.' Black-white relations have been helped by the presence of a very large black middle class. With the biggest concentration of top black universities in America and an affluent black business community, Atlanta is considered a 'Mecca' for ambitious young blacks throughout the US. In addition, as the birthplace of Dr Martin Luther King Jr., Atlanta proclaims itself the cradle of the civil rights movement. The King Center, which attracts nearly a million visitors a year, is receiving a face-lift in anticipation of the Olympics' year. The 1996 Olympics will allow Atlanta to be on the international stage, at least temporarily. But whether it stays there will depend on whether it carries off the event with maturity and aplomb or overdoes its self-promotion. If it makes the latter mistake, it may simply look tastelessly opportunistic.</p>

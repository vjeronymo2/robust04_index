The meeting was attended by Juan Salazar, Finance Ministry  international policy adviser and future Foreign Ministry  economic affairs director; Alejandro Jara, bilateral affairs  director for the International Economic Relations Directorate;  and Fishing Corporation and Sofofa representatives.    Sofofa Secretary General Jaime Pozo said the Mexican  charges,  which resulted in temporary sanctions against Chile while an  investigation is conducted, are quite groundless:    [Begin Pozo recording, in progress] ...punctual. One must  adjust to the international market prices currently set by Peru,  which is exporting at significantly low prices. Chilean  industry cannot just fail to comply with previously made  contracts. Mexico also is buying in the international market  because Chilean fishmeal is of very good quality and, in this  sense, it is very competitive precisely because of its quality.  [end recording]    The Chilean business sector has asked the government's  support in confronting charges that, according to the Mexican  law system, Chile exports below cost. Salazar explained that  the government is concerned about this issue and will raise the  subject before the administrative council of the Chilean-Mexican  Free Trade Accord.    Moreover, Alejandro Jara said Chile is not causing Mexican  producers any harm:    [Begin Jara recording, in progress] ...we are very worried.  Mexican businessmen cannot categorically say that Chilean  fishmeal exports are the direct and main cause of the harm  suffered by the Mexican industry, which has experienced a  significant reduction in its sales in addition to having to go  by the international fishmeal price, which also affects Chile  because they have been relatively low or, at, least lower than  when the investigation was carried out. [end recording]    Jara said these measures are unjustified and must be  reversed  as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] Franjo Tudjman, president of the  Republic of Croatia and supreme commander of the Armed Forces,  promoted 11 Croatian Army officers to the rank of general.  [passage omitted] Patriotic war decorations for the 1990-92  period were also awarded at the ceremony. Zoltan Kabok reports:    [Kabok] Addressing the promoted officers and high-ranking  officials on Statehood Day, Franjo Tudjman spoke about the past  four years, the realization of the centuries-old dream of the  Croatian people, and the creation and strengthening of the  Croatian Army. Three-quarters of the homeland have been  liberated so far, and one quarter is still occupied. It is our  historic task to liberate every inch, Tudjman stressed.    [Begin Tudjman recording] Of course, this is the task of the  whole of the Croatian nation, but primarily of the Croatian  Armed Forces, the Croatian Army. We can fulfill that task only  if we have --as so far--a united Croatian people, and if our  authorities keep scoring successes in economic recovery and  international affirmation of Croatia. [end recording]    [Kabok] The president of the republic and supreme commander  of the Armed Forces also spoke about Croatia's international  position and said that we had to be ready to help the Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina to ensure their survival, and that we must  secure the strategic borders of the Croatian state.

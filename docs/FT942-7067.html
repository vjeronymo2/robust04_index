			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Nafta accord back on Chile's agenda - Environment and labour issues are expected to dominate talks with the US It was with more than a touch of bravado that Mr Eduardo Aninat, Chile's finance minister, announced earlier this month that a deal to join the North American Free Trade Agreement could be wrapped up by next March. 'What I did, on purpose, was to put Nafta on the front page again ..to start the discussion,' he says. It worked: a Nafta deal, or at least a bilateral accord with the US - an issue largely dormant during the final period of the administration of President Patricio Aylwin - has reappeared at the top of Chile's international agenda. Mr Aninat's crusade has been much helped by the publication in the US of a draft bill - sponsored by Mr Richard Gephardt, the Democratic House leader - seeking to initiate free-trade talks with Chile under 'fast-track' procedures. The bill seeks to bind provisions on workers' rights and environmental protection into the accord, rather than negotiating side agreements, as was done with Mexico. Although this could imply tougher criteria for Chile, the initiative from Mr Gephardt, who opposed Nafta, is seen as a sign of potential cross-party support. No one doubts the oft-repeated promise that Chile will be next. None of this means, however, that informal talks, due to begin in Washington next month will be straightforward. 'Negotiations will be much more difficult than people think,' says a US official. The environment is likely to prove the biggest sticking point. Chile's mining, fishing, forestry and fruit industries - backbone of the export sector - have been criticised on environmental grounds. Many older mines fall far short of international standards on disposal of hazardous by-products, while Chile still exports 100-year-old trees in the form of woodchips. Mr Aninat recognises that the environment is an issue on which 'frankly speaking, we do have some problems'. On labour, he is more sanguine. Workers' rights were greatly strengthened under President Aylwin, after years of repression under military rule, and are now more protected than anywhere on the continent, he says. But other difficulties are likely to emerge as talks proceed, such as Chile's price-band system of surcharges on agricultural imports. Washington will also push for stringent measures to protect investments. More tricky still may be the issue of intellectual property rights, particularly on pharmaceuticals. Although Chile has recently tightened up its patent laws, it has not introduced protection for pharmaceuticals being developed. 'There are quite significant differences (over patents) which it will be very difficult for Chile to address in the short-to-medium term,' says the US official. Mr Aninat is aware that negotiations on this topic will be 'hard'. Mr Jose Antonio Guzman, president of the CPC, Chile's main business organisation, said recently: 'We are only prepared to make an agreement with the US if it is beneficial for the country and if it doesn't impose environmental and labour clauses beyond our capacity.' The CPC would oppose any deal damaging Chile's ability to compete, he said. Farmers insist protective barriers cannot be dismantled until the US government stops subsidising its own farmers. For Mr Aninat, locking into the world's biggest economy has strategic implications. 'We feel that Chile, because of its size and dependence on foreign trade and investment, cannot remain isolated . . . . The world is walking away from multilateral Gatt rules, unfortunately, and more into regional trading blocs,' he says. 'We need to get hooked into intelligent alliances.' The US has wider objectives than the purely commercial. It is keen that Chile, which it regards as one of Latin America's most open and modern economies, should be rewarded for its progress. But it has yet to decide whether it favours a bilateral accord or Chile's joining Nafta. Until that issue is resolved and fast-track authorised, all talk of timetables is premature. Indeed, Mr Aninat confides that his March 1995 target is 'very optimistic' and 'more a signalling device than a real bet'. However, he believes that, once formal talks start, negotiations should be much quicker than those with Mexico, which took two years. Before this can happen, Washington must resolve to turn fine words into action. 'This process is like a tango, and you need both parties to dance,' says Mr Aninat. 'We cannot start dancing on our own.'</p>

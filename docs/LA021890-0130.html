			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE HOUSE: HOME WISE;  </P> <P> FEW WATER-SAVING DEVICES TESTED RIGOROUSLY  </P> <P> QUESTION: When I buy water-saving toilet products, what should I look for?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Many water-saving products for toilets haven't received rigorous  testing to determine long-term performance and reliability.  </P> <P> Until more testing is done, we can't be sure which are the best. If you do see  a water- or energy-saving device you think might work, consider these buyer  tips:  </P> <P> First, take your time. Don't be high-pressured into buying because of a  one-time special price. Reputable sales people will give you time to make up  your mind.  </P> <P> Then, look at your present costs. Estimate how much of your water and sewer  bill is due to toilet flushing. Note that toilet flushing uses more water than  any other tap in the home.  </P> <P> Once you have estimated the cost, find out the pay-back. How long will it take  you to get your money back after you purchase the product? Will the product  last that long? Do you plan to be in the same house that long?  </P> <P> Become educated about the water-saving device. Find out about the different  types of devices available, their cost, and their advantages and drawbacks.  Free information should be available through libraries. You might also try  contacting competing firms to see if they carry the same product. Estimates  from those firms can be very useful.  </P> <P> Look closely at claims. What kinds of tests are the claims based on? Was the  testing done by an independent, recognized testing laboratory?  </P> <P> Check out the business you are dealing with. It's a good idea to get estimates  from different companies for the water-saving device you are considering. Price  should not be the only factor in making the decision. Is this a product you can  install yourself, or will it require a plumber?  </P> <P> Contact the Better Business Bureau to find out how long the firm has been in  business. Ask also about its record.  </P> <P> Solar Pool Heater Is Inexpensive, Practical  </P> <P> Q: We spent $200 a month heating our swimming pool last year with natural gas.  Could we reduce costs by using a solar pool heater? How expensive, how  complicated, and how practical is it?  </P> <P> A: They can be inexpensive, simple and very practical. Solar pool heaters let  you dive into spring earlier and stroke deeper into fall.  </P> <P> The season in the sun can stretch from three months to as many as six. Your  energy savings will pay for the equipment and installation in just a few  seasons.  </P> <P> Solar pool heaters need a large area for the solar collectors, on average, 75%  of the surface area of the pool. A 20x30-foot pool needs 450 square feet of  south-facing collectors. In many cases, the pump that filters the pool water  can be used to circulate water through the collectors.  </P> <P> An automatic controller turns the pump on and off as it senses heating supply  and demand. Some installers are willing to reduce costs slightly if handy  homeowners donate semi-skilled labor.  </P> <P> And remember, a good pool cover saves money and time by keeping heat in and  debris out.  </P> <P> Refrigerator Consumes a Lot of Electricity  </P> <P> Q: We went away on vacation for a month and unplugged our electric appliances  to lower our electric bills. We also switched off the hot water heater. The  only appliance we left plugged in was the refrigerator.  </P> <P> Our electric bill still seemed high for that month. Can the refrigerator be  using that much electricity? It's only two years old.  </P> <P> A: Your refrigerator is the third greatest consumer of energy in the home. The  thermostat setting can make a big difference in how much electricity it uses.  Thermostats on refrigerators are often inaccurate. Manufacturers put arbitrary  numbers, like one through six, rather than temperatures on the dial.  </P> <P> To determine what setting to use, you'll need to find out the actual  temperature inside the refrigerator. Put a thermometer inside the refrigerator  compartment and look at the reading in an hour or two. Adjust the thermostat  until you get a setting between 35-38F.  </P> <P> If the freezer compartment has a separate thermostat, set it between 0-5F.  Stand-alone freezers should be set at 0F.  </P> <P> When you check the temperature inside your refrigerator, take it in several  places. Varying temperatures may mean you need to defrost the freezer  compartment or vacuum the dust from the coils on the back or bottom of the  appliance.  </P> <P> Dust on the coils makes the unit use more energy. If the heat can't be  dispersed easily, the compressor has to work longer for the same benefit.  </P> <P> Here are some other energy-saving tips:  </P> <P> Locate the refrigerator/freezer away from the stove, dishwasher or direct  sunlight.  </P> <P> Leave four inches around the condenser coils (usually located in the back of  the unit) for air to circulate.  </P> <P> Replace leaky or broken door seals.  </P> <P> Use "power saver" or "energy miser" switches unless excessive moisture buildup  on outside surface occurs.  </P> <P> Consumer Reports magazine found a 5F colder setting increased the electrical  consumption by as much as 30%. Models with the largest freezers had the biggest  increases.  </P> <P> According to the American Homeowners Foundation (AHF), disputes often arise  between homeowners and home-improvement contractors.  </P> <P> They usually concern issues that were not discussed clearly at the time of  hire.  </P> <P> To help reduce misunderstandings -- and legal problems -- the AHF has developed  a model contract. It alerts all parties to the areas most often resulting in  disputes, if not addressed in advance.  </P> <P> You can obtain a copy of the Model Owner-Vendor Contract ($5.95). Send a check  or money order payable to American Homeowners Foundation to the foundation, at  1724 S. Quincy St., Arlington, VA 22204. Additional copies are $1.95.  Professionals can buy a set of 20 contracts for $24.95.  </P> <P> Produced by the Washington Energy Extension Service, a division of the  Washington State Energy Office.

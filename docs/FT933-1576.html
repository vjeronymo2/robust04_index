			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: End 'free' petrol perk Sir, During the current controversies regarding our crowded roads and British Rail's revenues, any suggestion which could alleviate both situations and which should suit transport and environment lobbies as well as the Exchequer deserves to be looked at seriously. Many businesses still provide unlimited free petrol for their employees. Where this is done, a flat rate of tax benefit applies (just Pounds 300 a year is payable on an average car, even assuming higher rate tax). Clearly, an employee in this situation is encouraged to use his car excessively - for leisure and to drive to and from work, thereby adding to road congestion during the morning and evening rush hours. This mileage is in effect 'free', whereas the same employee would have to pay out of his own pocket for a season ticket if he chose to commute by rail or other public transport. The alternative is very simple: an employee pays for all his fuel and merely charges his employer (normally about 9p a mile) for genuine 'business' miles. I believe the provision of 'free' petrol, particularly with the current subsidy, should be made illegal in the autumn Budget. J M F Padovan, 61 Cleaver Square, London SE11 4EA</p>

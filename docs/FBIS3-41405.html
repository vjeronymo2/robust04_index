			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press release from the UK Home Office: "UK; Italy Link Up </F> To Fight"]    [Text] Information about illicit drug trafficking will soon  be exchanged between the UK and Italy using Teledrug--a computer  system developed in Italy.    This latest Anglo-Italian initiative follows a successful  joint operation on Christmas Eve where 263 kg of cocaine were  seized in Felixstowe.    A Memorandum of Understanding paving the way for UK/Italian  cooperation on drug trafficking was signed today by  Assistant-Under Secretary of State at the Police Department,  John Warne and the Director of the Office for the Coordination  and Planning of Italian Police, Prefetto Gaetano Piccolella.    The Memorandum Will: [subhead]    --enable the UK to join the Teledrug computer information  system;    --lead to better cooperation between both countries in  identifying and apprehending drug traffickers.    Home Office Minister of State, Peter Lloyd announced the  UK's  intention to join the Teledrug system at the Ministerial  Conference on European Drug Trafficking Routes, held in Rome in  May 1993.    The UK is the second European Union Member State to join the  Teledrug system. Greece signed an agreement with Italy last year.    Notes To Editors [subhead]    1. The Teledrug system was developed by Italy following a  Ministerial Meeting in Rome in 1990. Participants agreed to  exchange information about illicit drug trafficking along the  Balkan Route. The United Kingdom was not present.    2. Teledrug came into operation in September 1992, linking  terminals in Italy and Turkey to a mainframe computer in Rome.    3. Teledrug offers a potentially valuable source of  information. The UK's one year trial of Teledrug will enable an  evaluation of the system.    4. HM Customs and Excise and the National Criminal  Intelligence Service will operate Teledrug in the UK.</p>

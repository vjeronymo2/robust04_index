			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLEASURES OF THE ROAD;  </P> <P> BUGGED!;  </P> <P> NOT SINCE THE MODEL T HAS THERE BEEN A CAR WITH THE STAYING POWER OF THE  BELOVED VW BEETLE, AN UGLY DUCKLING THAT WAS ADOPTED BY A GENERATION OF  ADMIRERS.  </P> <P> People often grow fond of homely things, and perhaps nothing on wheels has ever  been as homely, or as popular, as the Volkswagen Beetle. Not since Henry Ford's  Model T has there been so prolific an automobile. Ubiquitous. There should to  be a picture of the VW next to that word in every dictionary.  </P> <P> The Volkswagen is known to have had several origins, but the automobile that  truly inspired the VW's design came from none other than Mercedes-Benz. It was  the 1936 Mercedes 170H that influenced the Volkswagen's author, Dr. Ferdinand  Porsche. As automotive ancestry goes, having Mercedes-Benz and Porsche at your  roots isn't too shoddy.  </P> <P> Based on the shape of the rear-engined Mercedes, the VW prototypes were built  in 1936, with the definitive form arriving in 1938. Had it not been for World  War II, the new Wolfsburg assembly plant would have had the cars in production  by 1940.  </P> <P> Later, with Germany's factories almost decimated by Allied bombing,  Volkswagen's reincarnation might well be attributed to the British, who took  control of the Wolfsburg plant in May, 1945. Demand for the cars by British  occupation forces helped put the company on the road to prosperity. By 1947, a  dealer organization had been set up, and plans were in the works to export "The  People's Car" to the people of the world.  </P> <P> In January, 1949, the first Beetle was officially shipped to the United States.  How many of the strange-looking, air-cooled, rear-engined sedans attracted  American buyers?  </P> <P> Two.  </P> <P> Not a particularly auspicious beginning. VW's first years in this country were  unremarkable, to say the least. In three years only 2,000 were sold. And then,  in the face of the great chromed and finned vehicles emerging from Detroit,  Americans suddenly "discovered" the Volkswagen. Sales began to soar, and  Wolfsburg never looked back.  </P> <P> What was the VW's mystique? Styling? It had all the charisma of a beetle, a  lasting moniker pinned on the car by American motorists. Performance? With an  output of 36 horsepower, the Volkswagen could go fast only if dropped from a  very great height. Features? It had few. For years, it didn't even have a gas  gauge. Its success has been puzzling to industry analysts for decades.  </P> <P> By the late '60s, the Bug had become something of a cult car, and in Southern  California, VWs could be seen cruising the beach cities covered with Peter  Max-style paint schemes. And, of course, there were the Beetle Boards. If you  owned a VW in good condition, Beetle Boards of America would paint your car  with an advertisement, (usually for cigarettes), and pay you a modest fee to  cover maintenance costs.  </P> <P> After nearly a quarter century of production, the Volkswagen became the most  popular car in the world. On Feb. 17, 1972, the 15,007,034th Beetle was built  in Wolfsburg, eclipsing the Model T's record as the most-produced automobile.  </P> <P> Following the fuel crunch of 1973, the Beetle became even more popular in  America. Its low-horsepower, four-cylinder engine was one of the most fuel  efficient on the road, returning 26 miles to the gallon.  </P> <P> Nothing lasts forever. With the Bug's popularity beginning to wane in the late  '70s, Volkswagen introduced its replacement, the Rabbit. The Beetle sedan  passed from the showroom in 1977, and two years later, the convertible bid  farewell.  </P></p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / M&amp;G increases dividend after strong rise M&amp;G Group, Britain's largest unit and investment trust company, yesterday announced a 14.4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 22.8m for the six months to March 30 and an 11 per cent increase in its interim dividend to 10p. It also announced a reorganisation of board responsibilities. Group managing director Mr Paddy Linaker, 59, said he will retire in July 1994 and will be replaced by Mr David Morgan, 60, managing director of M&amp;G's investment division. M&amp;G noted that all areas of its business had increased profitability. Britain's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism provoked a fundamental change in investor confidence, leading to buoyant share prices and renewed interest in the company's principal products, investment and unit trusts. Total funds under management have risen Pounds 2.4bn to Pounds 10.96bn. Mr Linaker expressed concern about the effects proposals from the Office of Fair Trading to require independent financial advisers to disclose commission payments would have on sales. Separately, M&amp;G is expanding the support services it provides to the IFA sector to increase market share. Mr Linaker said the company had no plans to start a direct sales force for at least the next two to three years. 'Among other things, we think such a thing might damage our IFA network,' he said. However, while unit trust sales were up sharply to Pounds 232m from Pounds 158m, redemptions were also up sharply as well, so net sales totalled only Pounds 4m. Mr Linaker said the very high levels of redemptions were a cause for concern. 'We are doing some research into redemptions,' he said. However, some of the activity may relate to M&amp;G's investment performance which has suffered during the recession because of its bias towards small to mid-sized companies, which have performed poorly. Mr Linaker said M&amp;G's Recovery Fund and Income Fund have performed well over the past six months. Sales of M&amp;G life and pensions products declined to Pounds 80m from Pounds 84m. Mr Linaker said this may reflect concern about investment performance as well as fears among IFAs that M&amp;G no longer viewed them as its leading sales channel. Lex, Page 18; Observer, Page 17</p>

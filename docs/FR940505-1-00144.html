			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes that fee collected under this program must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted to the United States treasury and can not be redirected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for air pollution mitigation projects or other purposes. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency requests comment, however, whether this is true for fees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collected from foreign flag air carriers under international  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aviation agreements. For a general discussion on the disposition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of collected fees see section III.A.2.b.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> d <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Averaging and Trading. The Agency proposes to allow an airline to calculate its average seasonal environmental performance across the entire area in order to determine compliance with the emission rate target.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This approach will provide airlines with the flexibility to shift  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations within the basin to meet demand in an environmentally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficial manner; an airline could move some of its operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a less-congested airport to take advantage of reduced taxi  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> times and resultant emissions reductions, for example. It also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allows an airline to operate at some airports in excess of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pounds-per-PEU level and offset the excess at other airports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where emission control may be more economical. EPA requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on the feasibility and desirability of determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance in such a manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also requests comment on including an emissions credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program as part of the control strategy proposed today. Any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial airline that achieves emission reductions greater than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those required could sell or otherwise transfer credits thus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated to other commercial airlines, which in turn could use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the credits to comply with the pounds per PEU target and minimize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or avoid paying emissions fees. Such a credit program would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide commercial aircraft operators with an incentive to reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions to a level below that required, thus rewarding those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airlines with the ability to operate in an efficient and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmentally beneficial manner. A credit program also would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodate those airlines that cannot achieve their individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission rate targets because of certain operating circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Simple, direct airline-to-airline credit trades could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated into EPA's annual reporting and fee calculation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program fairly easily with little extra resources on EPA's part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An expanded credit system in which credits become a commodity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that can be purchased and re-sold would require more monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and enforcement to prevent error and fraud. EPA would be likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to allow such a system only if a state or local agency took  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility for the work of keeping it honest and accurate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given the expected limits on EPA resources to implement all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aspects of the FIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA notes that the RECLAIM credit trading program for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions was recently adopted in the South Coast, and is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example of cross-source trading of excess emission reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative to well quantified baselines and requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further emission reduction. The RECLAIM program covers certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  source types that were most amenable to emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantification and verification. Such a cross-source trading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system has obvious attractions in terms of achieving a given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental goal, while allowing the most economically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficient business choices consistent with that goal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA anticipates that commercial airlines may be interested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a program that provides the option of purchasing emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits to allow more operational flexibility. Since the RECLAIM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program operates off a declining schedule of allowable emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the subject sources, rather than from the declining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions caps established by the FIP, RECLAIM NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  credits are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not necessarily surplus to the FIP and cannot be used by sources,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including commercial airlines, to meet their FIP emission limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or to reduce their fee liability. Given EPA's concern about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequacy of its implementation resources, EPA is not proposing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish a cross-source trading program of its own. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA welcomes comments on whether and how state or local agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could help operate a credit trading system which would be in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> keeping with the FIPs control levels and which would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to the airline industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Reporting and Recordkeeping. (i) Compliance plans. The stationary source cap program includes a requirement for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected sources to submit compliance plans that describe planned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission reduction measures. EPA could establish a similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement for commercial airlines as part of today's proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control strategy. Such compliance plans would be submitted by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airlines in advance of the control period and would describe in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some detail the various emission reduction measures planned for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 2001&hyph;2005 control period. Compliance plans also could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include information on expected activity during the control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period, which would provide EPA with an opportunity to review the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PEU forecast and update the environmental performance targets if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary. Most importantly, compliance plans could provide an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity for the FAA to review airline emission reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans for safety considerations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance plans would impose significant administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burdens on commercial airlines, EPA, and the FAA, however. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency therefore requests comment on the desirability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring airlines to submit compliance plans, and on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information that should be provided in such plans should they be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required. EPA does not contemplate that compliance plans if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required would become legally binding on the airlines that submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them since that would impede business flexibility and is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essential to the effectiveness of the program. However, if EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does require compliance plans, deliberate misrepresentation of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airlines plans may be made a violation of the FIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

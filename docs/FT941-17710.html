			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Anger stalks a scarred town: Gillian Tett finds deepening disappointment in Enniskillen at the premiers' peace initiative The old man in a flat cap sat at the dimly lit bar in the Northern Ireland town of Enniskillen and muttered angrily: 'Forget this peace declaration, those provos are going to come and blow us all up now.' 'Hey Jack]' chided his neighbour, looking nervously around the room where both Catholic and Protestant groups were drinking. 'Let's talk about the weather instead]' The disquiet may be expressed in hushed mutters, but there is a palpable sense of disappointment in Enniskillen, the town devastated by an IRA bomb which killed 11 and wounded 63 on Remembrance Sunday in 1987. For the last three weeks the 11,000-strong population, which is split fairly evenly between Catholics and Protestants, has watched the waiting game being played by the British government and the IRA. And with Thursday's murder of a British soldier now dominating the local news, attitudes across the town, which is 15 miles from the border with the Republic, are hardening. Mr Raymond Ferguson, a lawyer and Ulster Unionist party councillor, is already predicting a new onslaught of violence. Although he represents the largest and most moderate of the unionist parties  -and accepts last month's Anglo-Irish declaration - he feels increasingly angry. 'The British government has made a huge blunder in being involved in this so-called peace declaration,' he said. 'They are just boosting the morale of the IRA.' Across the town, activists in Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, are reluctant to talk, even though they once won a by-election in the town and now hold three of the 23 seats in the local council. Mr Gerry McHugh, a Sinn Fein councillor, said: 'The people here don't see much in the declaration - they're just really confused . . . with Major saying one thing and Reynolds another.' The comments seem particularly poignant as Enniskillen seems more prepared for peace than many towns in Ulster. The Remembrance Day bomb prompted a wave of anti-IRA feeling which allowed the Ulster Unionists to gain control of the local parliamentary seat. On a local level relations between the two communities are not bad. In the centre of the town a Catholic, Protestant and Methodist church stand side by side. Meanwhile, the trauma of the 1987 bomb has spawned a clutch of community initiatives to push towards peace. The Rev David Cupples, minister of the Presbyterian Church, believes that most of his congregation are still 'hoping against hope' that the peace initiative will be salvaged. But he admits that it will be difficult for many to accept any initiative which appears to reward IRA violence. 'The hurts are very deep here,' he said. But after 25 years of continual violence, the danger in a town such as Enniskillen is that terrorist activities already seem normal. Mr Chris Donegan, a senior journalist on a local paper, said they breed a mood of cynicism among many. The Impartial Reporter tries to be independent - a tolerance which Mr Donegan demonstrates by pointing to the one Catholic on its staff. But the existence of another, Catholic-dominated newspaper is evidence of the lingering tensions in the town, which for many have become normal. 'It's gone on for 25 years and people feel it could go on for 25 more - there is almost this sense of an acceptable level of violence,' he said. With most residents agreeing that the media hype that accompanied the declaration did not match attitudes on the ground, Father Patrick McGinn, a Catholic priest, believes the best hope for peace in the new year is for the media comment to subside. 'You can build up a false sense of hope - and a false sense of the divisions here,' he said. 'The people in this church and the one across the road are not so far away really. We just need the hope and divisions to be toned down.'</p>

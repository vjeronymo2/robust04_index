			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast: Video report from Sevastopol by </F> Ye. Orobtsova and A. Lomakin]    [Text] [Orobtsova] The Black Sea Fleet remains a bone of  contention between Ukraine and Russia. Vladimir Bezkorovannyy,  commander of the Ukrainian Naval Forces, believes that the naval  vessels of the Black Sea Fleet's coastal service should be  divided equally between Russia and Ukraine. However, in the  opinion of Valeriy Kuznetsov, the Crimean president's military  adviser, Ukraine is not capable of financing combat training  even with the minimal number of ships at its disposal. The  Black Sea Fleet numbers more than 100 naval vessels in all, only  five of which are Ukrainian. Meanwhile, as Valeriy Kuznetsov  stressed, Ukraine has considerably increased the number of its  ground forces on Crimean territory, where there are now around  50,000 Ukrainain servicemen together with their construction  units. Ukraine is probably afraid of the processes that are  taking place in Crimea, Valeriy Kuznetsov said, because Crimea  is Russian in spirit.</p>

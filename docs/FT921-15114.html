			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Denmark provides relief for gloomy Nordic year - Robert Taylor looks back on 1991, a year investors in Scandinavian equities would rather forget For the Nordic stock markets (Copenhagen apart) 1991 was a year they would prefer to forget, even though their overall performance improved on 1990, when the FT-Actuaries Nordic index fell by 25 per cent. Last year it rose by 10.5 per cent, but this was below the 14.4 per cent increase in the FT-Actuaries World Index, and investors suffered a lot at times. A 1991 Nordic overview hides significant differences between the region's stock markets. During the first half of last year, in the aftermath of the Gulf war, all of them appeared to recover from their lacklustre performances in 1990. But from mid-summer onwards the picture darkened outside Copenhagen. The worst performer in 1991 was Helsinki where the FT-Actuaries Finland index dropped by 13.7 per cent in local currency, and 24.4 per cent in dollar terms. Turnover fell 60 per cent to its lowest point since 1987. The year started well with a 20 per cent rise in the index during the first quarter but after that, the decline was remorseless, except for a a short-lived upturn in July and a temporary stabilising in the late autumn. The Helsinki bourse reflected the deterioration in the Finnish economy in 1991 as production plummeted and unemployment rose. Fewer than 20 out of the 63 listed companies made a profit last year and total combined losses amounted to over FM13bn (Dollars 3.2bn). Market capitalisation fell from FM160bn to FM64bn. The banking sector was the hardest hit as credit losses escalated. Kansallis Osake Pankki, the country's second-largest commercial bank saw it share price more than halve, while Union Bank's shares suffered a drop of one-third. Finland's paper and pulp companies were not in much better shape either and they face little prospect of a sustained recovery before 1993. The virtual disappearance of trade with the Soviet Union added to the worries of many manufacturing companies. For most of the year, Helsinki was plagued by speculation about the markka's devaluation. Persistent government denials that this would not happen failed to reassure investors. Not even the decision to link the currency to the European Currency Unit in June settled the argument. As foreign confidence ebbed away and interest rates soared to over 20 per cent, by November the government was forced to agree to a 12.3 per cent devaluation as the only way out. The Oslo exchange also suffered a severe setback in 1991 with a NKr22.7bn (Dollars 3.8bn) drop in share values and a decline of 11.2 per cent in the FT-Actuaries Norway index. There was a widening gap between the performance of shares linked to the mainland economy which remained in recession and the offshore oil and gas sector which prospered. The trouble lay in the Norway's banking and financial sector where mounting credit losses threatened the existence of many leading banks and forced the government to intervene in the autumn with a NKr11.5bn rescue package to save them from collapse. The domestic banking index nosedived by 78.5 per cent during the year as NKr8.58bn was wiped off share values. The worst hit were shares in den Norske bank which suffered a 94 per cent fall in 1991. Stockholm's performance was equally dismal. The 5.5 per cent increase in the Affarsvarlden General index for the year was an improvement on the 29.7 per cent fall in 1990, the bourse's worst performance this century, but it was still a disappointment. Between January and July, the index recovered by 40 per cent, triggered by a number of large deals, including the acquisition of Saab-Scania by Investor/Providentia and Tetra Pak's purchase of Alfa Laval. Confidence was also growing that the recession was over. But the optimism proved to be misplaced. Between mid-summer and the end of the year the index fell by 24 per cent as it became clear that Sweden's economy was still in a downturn. The halving in property prices ended the boom in Swedish real estate, and many companies revealed profit declines or even losses in their autumn interim reports. With leading banks announced huge credit losses, the Swedish government had to bail out the country's largest savings bank and rescue Nordbanken. Interest rates stayed high in an attempt to convince sceptical overseas investors that the krona was not about to be devalued. The Swedish decision to peg the krona to the European Currency Unit in May did not quell foreign speculation that the authorities might still manipulate the currency to improve competitiveness. However, a six-point rise in the Central Bank's lending rate to banks to 17.5 per cent in December to stem the outflow of foreign capital helped to calm nerves. The abolition of the 1 per cent turnover tax on share trading in the same month helped the bourse to make a year-end rally. Copenhagen was the only bright light with a 16.2 per cent rise. Traditionally a stable, defensive market dominated by domestic investors in family-controlled foundations and institutions, it aroused considerable foreign interest. The strong performance of the Danish economy added to the optimistic climate. It seems unlikely that Copenhagen will set an upward trend for the other Nordic markets this year. Much depends on what happens to the world economy. But observers believe that steps to further open Nordic bourses to foreign investors should boost liquidity and stimulate some revival, even if the region's economic outlook remains grim.</p>

			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER TOWER  </P> <P> In the matter of Tower, President Bush is behaving like a petulant child. His  having to picture a future without Tower, the arrogant gnome from Texas, really  shouldn't be all that difficult. Millions of us, after all, have had to accept  the fact that Michael Dukakis isn't President. If we can live with our  disappointment, George Bush should be able to live with his.  </P> <P> BURT PRELUTSKY  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Poison scare prompts NZ shellfish ban THE NEW Zealand government yesterday imposed a total ban on the taking of all shellfish, closing an industry that employs 3,000 people and exports mussels and oysters worth NZDollars 80m (Pounds 27m) a year to the US, Europe and and Asia. The ban follows a serious outbreak of a poison-producing algae that effects filter feeding shellfish. Ten days ago all the northern North Island fish farms and hatcheries were closed, but today the government extended the ban to the rest of the country after a woman became ill after eating mussels in the Marlborough Sounds at the northern end of the South Island, the main farming area for shellfish. Officials said that while there might be no connection, it was important that New Zealand could be seen internationally to be doing everything possible to contain the outbreak, which seemed to be related to higher summer temperatures in the water. The ban is expected to last 10 days.</p>

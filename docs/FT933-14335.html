			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Property groups agree Dollars 500m Mexican project REICHMANN International and Soros Realty, the property companies run by Mr Paul Reichmann and Mr George Soros, have agreed in principle to develop a new stage of the huge Santa Fe real estate scheme in Mexico City, in a project that could be worth about Dollars 500m (Pounds 337.8m). The companies, which formed a joint venture in February, are also negotiating property developments that could be worth up to Dollars 500m in the Alameda district in the city centre, and up to Dollars 300m in the construction of two tower blocks on the city's main avenue, Paseo de la Reforma. They are looking for partners to spread the cost. Sources close to Mr Soros said the sums mentioned would 'only represent the total value over a long time and would not represent any specific investment laid out'. They said talks over the Alameda shopping and residential project were 'nowhere near complete'. Mr Juan Enriquez Cabot, the city government official in charge of the Santa Fe development, said the investment was a vote of confidence in Mexico and its economic future. Observers may also interpret Mr Soros's interest as his blessing for the peso, which is considered vulnerable to the sort of speculative attack favoured by the US financier and his hedge funds. The Soros and Reichmann companies had agreed in principle to buy about 120,000 square metres of land in Santa Fe on the western outskirts of Mexico City, Mr Enriquez Cabot said. The companies will develop the fourth stage of the Dollars 5bn-Dollars 10bn project, building houses, office blocks, and shopping centres in what was once a rubbish dump and strip mine. Mr Soros's Quantum Realty Fund will not take a stake in the proposed investments. While the fund is advised by Reichmann International and Soros Realty, its purpose is to invest in finished developments in the US and Canada.</p>

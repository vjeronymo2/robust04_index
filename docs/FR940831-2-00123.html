			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Invesco's fiscal year ends on December 31. Invesco's transfer agent mailed Invesco's rule 24f&hyph;2 notice for fiscal year 1993 on February 21, 1994, seven days before the deadline. The filing was not received in the SEC's mail room until March 1, 1994, however, and was rejected as being too late to be eligible for a registration fee based on net sales. If Invesco had filed the rule 24f&hyph;2 notice within the two month period, it would not have been required to pay any registration fee because of net redemptions in fiscal year 1993. Since its filing was late, the rule requires Invesco to pay a registration fee based on gross sales, which would equal $252,007. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 6(c) permits the SEC to exempt any person, security, or transaction from any provisions of the Act if and to the extent the exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  In addition, the SEC must find that an investment company was not at fault to grant an exemption from the two month filing deadline of rule 24f&hyph;2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Decision of the Comptroller General of the United States, File No. B&hyph;239769.2 (July 24, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Invesco believes that its agent acted reasonably and in good faith in mailing its rule 24f&hyph;2 notice seven days before the filing deadline. Invesco states that the delay in receipt of its filing was caused by the fact that at the time the rule 24f&hyph;2 notice was mailed, the United States Postal Service's performance in delivering the mail was ``comparatively poor.'' According to Invesco, this resulted, in part, from extreme weather conditions in the early part of 1994. Invesco believes that it was reasonable to assume that mailing the rule 24f&hyph;2 notice seven days before the filing deadline would assure timely receipt by the SEC. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The United States Postal Service recently reported that 95.3% of first class letters are delivered within four days (USPS, Origin-Destination Info. Sys. Q. Stat. Rep. Postal Quarter II (1994). If the requested order is granted, the Division of Investment Management will apply a four day standard in evaluating future exemptive requests in which an investment company used the Postal Service to deliver its rule 24f&hyph;2 notice and the notice was not timely delivered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Rule 24e&hyph;2 under the Act permits open-end investment companies to register a definite number of shares, in addition to the indefinite number or amount registered under rule 24f&hyph;2. For a nominal amount, an investment company that had redemptions during the prior fiscal year, but missed the rule 24f&hyph;2 two month deadline, may register a definite number of shares under rule 24e&hyph;2 equal to the number of shares redeemed. Shares registered under rule 24e&hyph;2 then can be used in future years to offset registration fees due under rule 24f&hyph;2 when the company has net sales. Invesco, however, does not believe that its net sales in the foreseeable future will be close to the level necessary to use such a credit fully. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Invesco also believes that it is appropriate in the public interest not to burden Invesco and its shareholders with a registration fee based on gross sales. Thus, Invesco requests an exemption under section 6(c) from rule 24f&hyph;2 to permit it to pay the registration fee based on net sales even though their rule 24f&hyph;2 notice for fiscal year 1993 was not filed by February 28, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> By the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

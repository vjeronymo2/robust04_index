			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Short dates firmer SHORTER dated cash rates in the sterling money markets ended slightly firmer yesterday after dealers had difficulty removing a shortage of Pounds 500m forecast by the Bank of England. Although the shortage was, for the second day running, a good deal smaller than had been anticipated, a number of technical factors made it a sticky day in the market. Dealers believe that next week will see another round of big shortages, encouraging them to hold on to paper now. There was also a repeat of the common problem with middle-sized shortages: namely, that dealers in one discount house are often waiting for the others to remove it, and in the end, nobody does. As a result, the Bank ended the day providing late assistance of around Pounds 360m. In the morning, shorter dated money softened slightly as the shortage was declared. Adding to confidence was the good news on the retail prices index, with inflation falling to its lowest level for eight months after a sharp fall to 3.9 per cent in June. In the afternoon, rates firmed, however: 1-week money ended at 10 1/8 per cent from a previous close of 9 7/8 per cent and 1-month money ending unchanged at 10 1/16 per cent. Longer dated rates ended softer, swayed by hopes that the RPI figures will make a base rate cut more likely in the more distant future. Compounding this was a more stable performance from sterling on the foreign exchanges after two days of heavy losses. 3-month money ended the day softer at 10 1/32 per cent from 10 1/16 per cent, 6-month money remained unchanged at 10 per cent and 1-year money was at 9 7/8 per cent, down from 9 15/16 per cent. Trading in sterling futures plotted a similar trajectory to the cash markets, with the September contract rising to a high of 90.20 following news of the inflation figure. But in the afternoon, confidence petered out, and the contract ended down four ticks from its previous close, at 90.08. The December contract ended down 3 ticks from its previous close at 90.37. In its money market operations, the Bank of England did not operate in the morning. In the afternoon, it purchased Pounds 5m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 16m of Band 2 bank bills, also at 9 7/8 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn (DPA)--There was a slight fall in the number  of incoming orders for west German industry in November,  following a similar drop in October. Orders fell by 1 percent  after price and seasonal adjustments, the Federal Economics  Ministry announced in Bonn today. Domestic orders fell by 0.5  percent, foreign orders by 1.5 percent. For the first time in  1993, however, a month slightly exceeded (by 0.4 percent) the  figure for the corresponding month in 1992, the ministry  stressed.    Demand remained unchanged in the more significant two month  comparison between October/November and August/September. A 3.5  percent increase in foreign orders made up for a 2.0 percent  decrease in domestic orders. [passage omitted]</p>

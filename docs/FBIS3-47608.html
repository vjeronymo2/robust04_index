			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Jan 14 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- President Suharto  has offered a Super Puma helicopter used by the presidential  palace to Malaysia for the use of Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir  Mohamed and his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim;    The offer was made by Suharto when Anwar paid a courtesy  call  on him yesterday in conjunction with his two-day visit here,  Anwar told Malaysian reporters Friday.    The offer is very touching indeed, he said before leaving  for  home in an RMAF [Royal Malaysian Air Force] aircraft.    Malaysia bought a Super Puma from Industri Pesawat Terbang  Nusantara (IPTN) [National Aircraft Industry] in 1989 for VIP  use.    The helicopter crashed in Sungai Petani, Kedah, two weeks  ago  while on its way to pick up Anwar in Kangar.    Science, Research and Technology Minister B.J Habibie, who  heads the IPTN, also offered to provide the crew for the  aircraft.    Anwar said Habibie felt that initially, the Indonesian crew  might be useful.    He said he informed Suharto and Habibie that the offer was  very touching and Malaysia welcomed it.    Anwar said he would brief Dr. Mahathir on the offer for  follow up action.</p>

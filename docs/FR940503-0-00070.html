			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Eligibility To Provide Preferences for Elderly Residents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 651 of the 1992 HCD Act provides in relevant part, ``[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, an owner of a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> covered section 8 housing project designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  may in selecting tenants for units in the project that become available for occupancy, give preference to elderly families who have applied for occupancy in the housing&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.'' (Emphasis added.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the phrase ``designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families,'' the Department believes that in using the term ``primarily,'' the Congress intended to limit the applicability of subtitle D to either the section 8 units in those covered projects in which a majority of the section 8 units were designed for elderly families (i.e., seniors <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), or to the section 8 units in covered projects where a distinct portion of the project (e.g., a tower or a wing of a project, but not just a floor) exists in which the majority of section 8 units were restricted to seniors only. Thus, section 651 may apply to the section 8 units in an entire project originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (``covered section 8 housing project''), or section 651 may apply to the section 8 units in a portion of such project, but only where the section 8 units in this project or portion of the project were designed primarily for seniors. The preamble frequently uses the term ``covered section 8 units'' to recognize that there are partially assisted projects whose section 8 units will be covered by this interim rule .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As used in this preamble, the term ``seniors'' refers to families whose heads of household, their spouses or sole members are 62 years or older. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is important to note that the statutory system of preferences provided by subtitle D is only available to projects which qualify as ``covered section 8 housing projects designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families.'' The Department points out that many projects which have section 8 assistance are not ``covered section 8 housing projects designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families'' (as defined in Section I.A. of the preamble, which follows), and may not elect the subtitle D statutory system of preferences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Covered Section 8 Housing Project: Section 659 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subtitle D and these regulations define ``covered section 8 housing'' to mean housing that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) was constructed or substantially rehabilitated pursuant to assistance provided under section 8(b)(2) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act), as in effect before October 1, 1983;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) is assisted under a contract for assistance under such section; and (3) was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Projects That are Newly Constructed or Substantially Rehabilitated Pursuant to Assistance Provided Under Section 8(b)(2) of the 1937 Act, as in Effect Before October 1, 1983.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department administers six section 8 programs that involve newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated housing. However, the system of preferences under subtitle D does not apply to all these programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The programs to which subtitle D applies are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The section 8 New Construction Program, 24 CFR part 880; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Section 8 Substantial Rehabilitation Program, 24 CFR part 881;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The State Housing Agencies program (insofar as it involves new construction and substantial rehabilitation), 24 CFR part 883;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The New Construction Set-Aside for Section 515 Rural Rental Housing Projects Program, 24 CFR part 884; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The Section 8 Housing Assistance Program for the Disposition of HUD-Owned Projects (insofar as it involves substantial rehabilitation), 24 CFR part 886. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The ``Additional Assistance Program for Projects with HUD-Insured and HUD-Held Mortgages'' (see 24 CFR part 886, subpart A) involves only existing housing. However, the ``Section 8 Housing Assistance Program for the Disposition of HUD-owned Projects'' (see 24 CFR part 886, subpart C) involves substantially rehabilitated housing, in addition to existing housing. Accordingly, this rule would amend subpart C of 24 CFR part 886, but only for projects involving substantially rehabilitated housing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other programs which may involve section 8 new construction or substantial rehabilitation assistance, but which are not covered by the preferences in subtitle D are identified in section 658 of the 1992 HCD Act. Under section 658 of the 1992 HCD Act, an owner of a project (or portion of a project) that was originally designed for occupancy by elderly families, and assisted under the Section 221(d)(3) Below Market Interest Rate (BMIR) program, the Section 236 Mortgage Insurance and Interest Reduction Payment for Rental Projects program, or Section 202 Loans for Housing for the Elderly or Handicapped Program, may continue to restrict occupancy in such projects (or portion of such projects) to elderly families in accordance with the rules, standards and agreements in effect when the housing project was developed. Accordingly, under this interim rule, the subtitle D statutory system of preferences does not apply to newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated section 8 projects with HUD insurance or assistance under any of these three programs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department emphasizes that it is critical that a project owner understand the type of assistance a project receives to determine eligibility under subtitle D and these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Although in this regard, the Department is aware of no Section 221(d)(3) BMIR projects or Section 236 projects with Section 8 new construction or substantial rehabilitation assistance. As such, by its terms, ``covered section 8 housing'' does not seem to encompass the Section 236 Mortgage Insurance and Interest Reduction Payment for Rental Projects program or the Section 221(d)(3) BMIR program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Project owners should note that the following types of projects or assistance would  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NOT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  be covered by this interim rule: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Section 202 housing projects,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Section 221(d)(3) BMIR housing projects,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Section 221(d)(4) retirement service centers (because such projects have FHA mortgage insurance but no section 8 assistance),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Section 236 housing projects,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Housing projects with contracts for section 8 loan management set aside (unless the projects also have contracts for section 8 assistance involving new construction or substantial rehabilitation, in which case the units could be covered), <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

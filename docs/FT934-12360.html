			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Management: Personnel crisis? what crisis? - David Goodhart explains why the role is becoming less pigeon-holed The recession has been rather kind to Britain's personnel practitioners. The annual conference of the Institute of Personnel Managers, which opens today in Harrogate, is the biggest yet staged. The IPM is expecting 1,800 delegates and now claims 52,000 members out of a total number of personnel managers estimated at 100,000. And the latest issue of Personnel Today reports that personnel vacancies are on the rise again. On the face of it this seems strange. Larger companies might have temporarily boosted their personnel function to cope with the large redundancy packages of the recession years, but the longer term outlook for the traditional personnel function is supposed to be poor. The conventional view of decline states that as the importance of human resource management has been recognised, so large parts of the personnel function have been devolved to line managers. Geoff Armstrong, now head of the IPM and a veteran of industrial disputes in the car industry, recalls: 'In the 1960s and 1970s we had constant bargaining about change and line managers abdicated the personnel function to big, centralised personnel departments.' Most of those big departments have been slimmed down or even closed. And not always because of a belief in the virtues of decentralisation. When hard-nosed conglomerates such as Hanson Trust took over a company in the late 1980s one of the first things they did was to close the central personnel department. In smaller companies, too, the specialist personnel function has often disappeared completely, creating more work for employment lawyers. 'A lot of companies have lost all internal expertise on employment law matters which law firms have capitalised on,' says Paul Nicholls of Dibb, Lupton and Broomhead which has increased its employment law staff from four to 14 over the past two years. Privately, many senior personnel managers admit these changes have led to an identity crisis for the personnel function. 'Personnel often has a rather dated 1970s image, still trying to find a balance between labour and management,' says one. 'The personnel function is being pulled in so many different directions but it really has got to prove its hard-edged business advantage,' says another. Sometimes this identity crisis is played out in the conflict between 'soft' personnel people trying to balance interests, and 'hard' human resource managers trying to improve efficiency, often in a non-union environment. It also seems to be afflicting the government-appointed lead body which is having trouble defining what personnel managers actually do in order to establish National Vocational Qualifications for them. John Hougham, now head of Acas and former head of personnel at Ford, is suspicious of the hard-liners and fears the decline of the more traditional personnel function. 'The personnel function is showing some signs of losing its organisational status in some quarters,' he warns. But even if the traditional, 'collectivist' personnel manager is disappearing, the personnel function is adapting to survive, as the continuing growth of the IPM seems to show. Peter Reid, head of employment affairs at the Engineering Employers Federation, says that personnel is now less pigeon-holed than it used to be and that a spell in personnel is increasingly useful for a board-level director. Indeed, if board-level representation is an indicator of the status of the personnel function then there is little to worry about. According to the Cranfield School of Management, 49 per cent of all private and public organisations employing more than 200 people have a personnel representative on the board, up from only 40 per cent at the start of the 1980s.</p>

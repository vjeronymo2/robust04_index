			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 23 KYODO -- Michio Watanabe, former  foreign minister and a heavyweight in the main opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), urges political forces favoring  the "public interest" to unite in a book to go on sale next  month. The outspoken politician predicts in his book "The New  Conservative Revolution" that the country's political forces  will divide into two in the future -- one that places priority  on the public interest and one that is at the mercy of public  opinion.    Demanding that the coalition of Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa be dissolved, Watanabe urges "public interest"  political forces to unite against others which he claims merely  go along with the current of the times.    Watanabe criticizes the Hosokawa coalition of seven parties  ranging from conservatives to reformists, saying, "parties with  different basic ideas cannot do anything." He proposes  realigning the LDP and four coalition parties -- Shinseito,  Komeito, the Japan New Party (JNP) of Hosokawa, and the new  party Sakigake -- into two conservative groups.    Watanabe, who was both deputy premier and foreign minister  under the government of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa from 1991  to 1993, also sanctioned dissolving the LDP to help create "the  two conservative forces."    Shinseito and Sakigake are mainly made up of LDP defectors.    Shinseito and the Buddhist-backed Komeito are also seeking  to  establish a two-party system of the LDP and a new rival party to  be made up of non-LDP forces, including Shinseito and Komeito.    Hosokawa, whose coalition was inaugurated last August when  the LDP lost its 38-year grip on power, is reportedly tilting in  favor of ties with the Shinseito-Komeito camp, shifting from  close relations with Sakigake which is in favor of a multiparty  system, though fewer than the current number.    The three other coalition parties are the Social Democratic  Party (SDP), the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and the minor  United Social Democratic Party (USDP). The SDP and the DSP are  in line with Sakigake on political realignment.    Ichiro Ozawa, the alliance's chief strategist and  Shinseito's  secretary general, and Masayoshi Takemura, Sakigake's leader,  have also published books discussing the future of politics in  Japan.</p>

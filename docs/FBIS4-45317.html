			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning customs officials at Beirut airport  foiled an attempt to smuggle a quantity of drugs into Lebanon.    Husayn 'Ali al-Sahili, born in 1973 in Kafr Zabad in  al-Biqa', was arrested upon his arrival from Colombia via  Amsterdam, and 2,250 grams of cocaine were seized with him. The  drugs were hidden in an innovative and technical way--inside a  case with a false bottom and inside two nylon envelopes. The  case passed, undetected, through X-ray machines in European  airports. Al-Sahili was arrested and referred to the  counternarcotics office.    The local value of the seized drug was estimated at $70,000  and estimated at $5,000 in Colombia.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jimmy Seepe] </F>   [Excerpts] Government bureaucrats this week put the lid on  any information relating to perks given to cabinet ministers.  This comes at the time when discontent over the high benefits  given to political appointees is a matter of heated debate.    NEW NATION's attempts this week to confirm the high grants  and car allowances that ministers enjoy -- said to amount to  R276,000 [rand] a year -- were met with deafening silence from  government offices.    A reputable source in government told NEW NATION that  cabinet  ministers were offered various payments beyond their R30,000  monthly salaries that included in addition to car allowances,  R10,000 a month and extra cash to cover their telephone and fax  bills -- and even their groceries.    The allowances have reportedly been accepted by three  ministers, while others are said to be still unsure whether to  accept the perks or refuse them. [passage omitted]    A clerk in the Ministry of Finance confirmed that ministers  got a monthly allowance of R10,000, but when questioned further  she said the matter was "classified information". She referred  NEW NATION to the Public Service Commission (PSC), where  attempts to speak to chairperson Dr Roe Venter proved fruitless.    A spokesman for the PSC, Corrie Smith, denied that  ministers'  allowances were dealt with by the department and said the PSC  only "handled salaries of public servants and not political  appointees (ministers)".    Efforts to get a response from President Nelson Mandela's  spokesperson, Joe Netshitenzhe, also proved fruitless -- he was  said to be out of the office. An official at the President's  Office, Sakkie Olivier, told NEW NATION through a secretary that  all inquiries about information on salaries should be referred  to Netshitenzhe.    This week, the South African Communist Party (SACP) called  for the reduction of salaries for members of Parliament as  proposed by the Melamet Commission. The SACP's opposition to  MP's salaries comes weeks after an ANC parliamentary caucus  supported minimum salaries of R161,000 a year -- as proposed by  the Melamet Commission.    The SACP said it believed that "in a country beset with  enormous poverty, excessive salaries for elected public  officials are simply unjustifiable. The gap between the lowest  paid state employees and the highest paid is staggering".</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Slaughters tops takeover advice table SLAUGHTER and May, the City firm of solicitors, has emerged as the leading legal adviser to companies and financial advisers involved in UK public takeovers during 1991. The firm ended the year well ahead of its nearest rival as a result of its part in 24 UK public bids with a combined value of Pounds 5.49bn, according to a league table that ranks lawyers by the value of the takeovers in which they acted as advisers. The table, produced by Acquisitions Monthly magazine, places Freshfields second, with 21 deals which were worth Pounds 4.17bn, and Norton Rose third, with 18 deals worth Pounds 2.85bn. Freshfields came first in 1990. In 1990 Slaughters was third in the rankings, having dealt with a total of 30 deals worth Pounds 5.5bn. Although it was ranked leading adviser in the first six months of 1991, having acted for Williams Holdings in its Pounds 406m bid for Yale &amp; Valor and helped Frogmore Estates beat off a Pounds 139m bid from Southend Property, most of its mergers and acquisitions work fell into the last quarter. In the last three months of 1991, it acted for BTR in its Pounds 1.4bn bid for Hawker Siddeley, Lasmo in its Pounds 1.03bn bid for Ultramar, and Williams Holdings in its Pounds 764m unsuccessful bid for Racal Electronics. Slaughters, however, is ranked only fifth in the league table of those working for financial advisers involved in UK public bids in 1991, having acted notably only for Kleinwort Benson in its advice to American Brands in its unsuccessful Pounds 350m bid for Invergordon Distillers. Freshfields was the top legal adviser to financial advisers in 1991, having acted for Hambro Magan and BZW on their advice to BTR in its bid for Hawker Siddeley, and for County NatWest, which advised Beazer on its Pounds 403m sale to Hanson. Overall, the 20 most active law firms in the field acted on 145 failed and completed UK public bids worth Pounds 15bn in 1991. This compared with 200 deals worth Pounds 24bn in 1990 and 263 deals worth Pounds 137bn in 1989. This demonstrated the dramatic decline in merger-and-acquisition activity in the UK over the past two years. The magazine comments that in spite of the decline law firms seem to have survived the recession very well. Unlike bankers, they do not work on a contingent fee basis and so they get paid regardless of the outcome of a deal. Also they do not take any risks in the corporate market in terms of lending, investing or underwriting.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LEGAL ADVISERS TO FINANCIAL ADVISERS OR COMPANIES INVOLVED IN UK PUBLIC                          TAKEOVERS 1991  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Adviser                     No. of deals    Value, m pounds 1 Slaughter and May             24               5,495 2 Freshfields                   21               4,173 3 Norton Rose                   18               2,858 4 Linklaters &amp; Paines           15               2,840 5 Simmons &amp; Simmons             10               2,050 6 Ashurst Morris Crisp          20               1,490 7 Herbert Smith                 21               1,218 8 McKenna &amp; Co                   7                 541 9 Allen &amp; Overy                 12                 511 10 Travers Smith Braithwaite     6                 509  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ranked by value of transactions based on completed and failed offers for UK public companies and including only those advisers involved in two or more transactions.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Acquisitions Monthly  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

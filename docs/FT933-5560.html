			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Litton wins round in Dollars 1.2bn patent infringement case A LOS Angeles jury has awarded Litton Industries, the Californian high technology group, Dollars 1.2bn for the alleged infringement of a patent by Honeywell, the Minnesota-based controls company. Honeywell insisted that the case was far from over, however, pointing out that the judge was continuing to hear evidence in the case. Trading in the shares of both companies was halted on Tuesday ahead of the award announcement. Honeywell's shares fell sharply yesterday morning when trading resumed on the New York Stock Exchange. In early trading, Honeywell stood at Dollars 35 7/8 , down Dollars 3, while Litton rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 68. The case centres on ring laser gyroscopes, a device used in aircraft navigation, which Honeywell pioneered in the 1960s. Litton alleges that Honeywell infringed its patents, which it took out in 1979 and 1989, for a process to coat mirrors used as part of the gyroscope's measuring system. Honeywell argues that Litton's patents are invalid and that its coating process is anyway different from that of Litton. Mr Edward Grayson, Honeywell's general counsel, said the company was 'disappointed and outraged' at the verdict, but he added that it was 'only one stage of this trial and Honeywell believes it will have no independent value'. Honeywell said the presiding Judge Mariana Pfaelzer still had to consider two issues which could reduce or eliminate the jury's ver-dict. These are Honeywell's argument that Litton failed to follow the correct procedures in obtaining its patents and that the reissuing of its patents in 1989 invalidated those it claimed in 1979. Litton's lawsuit, filed in 1990, alleges that Honeywell tried to monopolise the ring laser gyroscope market, but no trial date has been set for this anti-trust portion of the case. Honeywell has counter-sued, accusing Litton of attempted monopoly.</p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Net assets fall 16.9% at Land Securities LAND SECURITIES, the UK's largest property company, suffered a 16.9 per cent fall in its net assets in the year to end-March, which its chairman described as 'the most difficult period for the property industry that I can remember'. 'High real interest rates, over-borrowing in both the personal and corporate sectors, the over-supply of accommodation, particularly in central London and, until recently, political uncertainty, all took their toll,' said Mr Peter Hunt, chairman. But the company stressed its financial strength, which was underlined by a 5.7 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 215.2m to Pounds 227.5m in the year to March 31. The company owns Pounds 4.3bn of property, the value of which fell 12.6 per cent during the year. Its borrowings of Pounds 1.52bn, up from Pounds 1.27bn, correspond to gearing of 43.2 per cent, which is relatively modest for a property company. The fall in net assets per share from 668p to 555p was mainly blamed on the central London market, which has been particularly badly hit by recession and oversupply of space. Properties in the West End and Victoria were worst affected, falling 21.3 per cent in value, while those in the City fell 17.6 per cent. Elsewhere in the UK, the value of shops and offices fell 2.8 per cent. The value of out-of-town retail property increased 9 per cent; industrial and warehouse property increased 0.7 per cent. Mr Hunt criticised the government for neglecting central London's transport systems, describing the priority given to Docklands transport as 'ridiculous'. He is also lobbying the government to remove the 'patently unfair' rate charges on empty buildings. Earnings increased 5.7 per cent to 32.62p. A final dividend of 15.75p makes a total of 21.75p for the year. See Lex</p>

Chancellor Franz Vranitzky  made this clear in an interview with DIE PRESSE on Monday.  "Austria's main course is the establishment of a collective  security system in Europe. To achieve this aim, the Maastricht  Treaty is a much more specific tool than Partnership for Peace."    "If there is to be a specific offer to the European Union  applicants, much of what the PFP could do is covered by the  European Conference on Security and Cooperation (CSCE) anyhow,"  Vranitzky said. Austria already participates in individual  areas, such as a working group for peacekeeping measures within  the NATO Cooperation Council. As far as further PFP elements  are concerned, such as holding joint military maneuvers, Austria  is not interested at the moment, Vranitzky signalled.    He pointed out that the PFP offer is mainly being addressed  to former Warsaw Pact countries. With this in mind, Vranitzky  considers it very "positive." The chancellor was also pleased  that the PFP offer involves "no disassociation from Russia."    At the same time, Vranitzky praised President Clinton's  introductory speech at Brussels. "What is particularly  important is the basic tone of his speech, saying that turning  his back on Europe is not part of his policy." Equally  important is Clinton's favorable comment on European  integration, which put economic and political cooperation at the  center.    Like Vranitzky, Defense Minister Fasslabend and Foreign  Minister Mock consider the PFP "not relevant" for Austria.  Speaking to DIE PRESSE, Fasslabend said: "Joint maneuvers are  not an issue for us. We have already had joint exercises, such  as the catastrophic exercise at Wiener Neustadt." The minister  also expects in the future the United Nations will to pass  increasingly more complex peacekeeping missions to NATO.</p>

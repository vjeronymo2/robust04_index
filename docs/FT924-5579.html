			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Auction reflects unsettled market: Saleroom THE ART market is in a very unsettled state, with some important items selling, some not. That was apparent at Christie's in London yesterday when auctions of illuminated manuscripts and books, and of silver, were a third unsold. A Book of Hours produced in Paris in about 1430 sold for Pounds 154,000. Silver, until recently a sound market, was disappointing. Two important lots, a pair of William III andirons (estimated at up to Pounds 150,000) and a pair of George II tea caddies, offered by the St Germans family, were unsold. The top price was the Pounds 48,400 paid for a George IV silver-gilt two-handled tray by Philip Rundell, which doubled its forecast price. A saleroom discovery, a Rembrandt drawing of 'Joseph Explaining the Dreams of the Butler and the Baker', sold for Pounds 151,648 at Christie's in Amsterdam to a New York dealer. The owner brought it into the auction house in London for attribution. It was estimated at Pounds 100,000. Another discovery, 'Phaeton's Fall' by the Dutch artist Hendrick Goltzius, was sold to the London dealer Hazlett, Gooden &amp; Fox for Pounds 80,037.</p>

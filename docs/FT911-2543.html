			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Dirty tricks cast shadow over the Indian election: The phenomenon of 'booth capturing' is on the increase AS the most populous democracy in theworld prepares to hold national elections for the 10th time since independence in 1947, the question of whether they will be free and fair is being raised withconsiderable unease because of the atmosphere of violence. India's Election Commission, an autonomous constitutional body that has the responsibility for conducting the mammoth poll - the country has an electorate of 510m - arguesthat democracy has been an overwhelming success. 'The Indian voter watches silently until the last day and then acts decisively. After all, he has frequently changed governments through the ballot box,' says a senior Election Commission official. Yet he concedes that the last two decades have witnessed, with alarming frequency, the rigging of elections in some constituencies and the practice is spreading. The phenomenon of what is known as 'booth capturing' began 20 years ago in Bihar and has spread to other states like Uttar Pradesh and Haryana in the north and, more recently, to Andhra Pradesh in the south. In the 1989 parliamentary elections, the commission officially recorded 1,599cases of 'booth capturing' and took remedial measures, including ordering a new poll. But officials concede that there could be hundreds, even thousands, of cases that will go undetected. In all fairness, though, there have been no complaints of rigging from many states (including, curiously, the insurgency-affected state of Punjab where 'booth capturing' is unknown). 'Booth capturing' actually means massive stuffing of ballot boxes and is officially categorised as being either 'silent' (when false ballot papers are literally stuffed in the boxes with the connivance of the supervisory staff) or 'violent'. The latter involves actual intimidation of voters and polling staff, often at gunpoint. There are many other dirty tricks, particularly during campaigns. Candidates frequently hire thugs for the purpose of disrupting meetings of rivals, or to battle against thugs owing allegiance to others. In some stateslike Bihar, there are highly skilled and highly priced gangs who are experts in'booth capturing' and illegal practices. In the southern state of Karnataka, such gangs distribute lorryloads of arrack liquor on polling day. Despitean elaborate code of conduct framed by the commission, such 'corrupt practices' are growing. Thus, organising an election is no easy task. The commission hasno field staff of its own and depends entirely on the central and state governments to provide 3.5m workers to man the 600,000 polling booths. The commission does not think that the coming elections will be unduly violent, but the Home Ministry thinks otherwise because of the heightened communal tension. It hasdrawn up a list of about 80 'hyper-sensitive' constituencies which are prone to communal violence, part of nearly 300 constituencies categorised as 'sensitive'. Polling is to be held on three days spread over a week (May 20, 23 and 26) because security personnel have to be re-deployed for the elections. In addition to nearly 1.5m state police and home guards, the central government will provide 640 companies of troops, numbering about 1,000 each. These are far less than are needed, but large numbers of paramilitary forces arealready committed to fighting insurgencies in Kashmir and Punjab and cannot be spared for election duties. Hence the fears of increased violence  -the death toll of 179 in the last elections in 1989 could be exceeded. There are many more problems, most of them perennial. In such a diverse country, the weather is always a factor. In some Himalayan constituencies, polling will be held only when snow melts later in the summer. Demarcating constituencies is a massive pre-election exercise made more difficult because 25 per cent are reserved for lower castes. Much of the electorate is illiterate and cannot read the namesof candidates on ballot papers. The commission provides all the nine national parties and 38 state parties with permanent symbols (for instance, the Congress symbol is an open hand). This does not always simplify matters asmany constituencies have scores of candidates. In 1989, Belgaum, in Karnataka, had a record 301 candidates and the ballot paper was more than a metre in length. The cost of the national election in 1989 was Rs1.1bn (Pounds 30m) and is expected to be at least 25 per cent more this time. This does not include the money spenton campaigning or funding dirty tricks. The official limit for electionexpenses is Rs150,000 for each candidate, but this is invariably exceeded many times over by parties and candidates. The commission describes the elaborateexercise, including the violence and the corrupt practices, as 'a part of the pangs of democracy'.</p>

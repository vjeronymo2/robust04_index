			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALZER ON WINE: MORE FROM ARROWOOD  </P> <P> ON THE ROSTER OF WINEMAKERS enjoying international fame, there are about 10  from Europe, one or two from Germany and about a dozen from California. And  Richard Arrowood of Sonoma County is among this select few.  </P> <P> Arrowood startled the wine world during his beginnings at Chateau St. Jean in  the '70s by being the first to release vineyard-designated Chardonnays -- made  with grapes from vineyards that were identified on the wine label.  </P> <P> When the Japanese wine and spirits company Suntory bought Chateau St. Jean for  $40 million in 1984, it was assumed by many observers that Arrowood would  remain at the helm. He did. His production of the legendary, award-winning  Chardonnays had made him one of the winery's chief assets, which Keizo Saji,  Suntory's wine-loving president, thoroughly understood.  </P> <P> Suntory and Arrowood developed a synergistic relationship, one so close that in  1987 Suntory helped Arrowood open his own winery, Arrowood Vineyards and  Winery. It led him to lending sources that allowed him and his wife, Alis, to  finance their venture as sole proprietors. (Arrowood remains a consultant at  Chateau St. Jean.)  </P> <P> Unlike Chateau St. Jean's, Arrowood's wines are a blend of grapes from a  variety of vineyards, not merely one.  </P> <P> The Arrowood 1988 Chardonnay ($18.75) is produced from grapes of different  clones selected from seven ranches in three Sonoma County viticultural regions.  The Arrowood 1987 Cabernet Sauvignon ($22) is from five grape varieties from 13  vineyards, all vineyard lots separately fermented and aged before blending.  "Wines are not made in the cellars but in the vineyards," Arrowood says.  </P> <P> The flavors in the Chardonnay are lush, supple yet crisp, suggesting ripe  pears, vanilla and spice, with floral overtones.  </P> <P> Arrowood Cabernet Sauvignon is a brilliant, deep ruby, of almost chewy  substance, gaining bouquet intrigue from five varieties: Cabernet Sauvignon,  Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. There are suggestions of black  cherry, boysenberry and even chocolate. It's ready to drink now, but time will  enhance the wonders. Robert Lawrence Balzer  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ALL-VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL TEAM  </P> <P> TEAM CAPSULES  </P> <P> Pat Treend (El Camino Real, 6-4, 205, senior): The right-hander made mammoth  strides since last season when his earned-run average was well above five.  Treend pitched the Conquistadores into the City Section 4-A Division final and  his 12-1 record and a 1.23 ERA helped earn him a scholarship to UC Santa  Barbara. His 85-m.p.h. fastball helped rack up 106 strikeouts in 91 innings.  Treend was just as eye-opening with the bat, finishing with a team-high 28 runs  batted in. The offensive highlight came when Treend slammed home runs in  consecutive innings of a mid-season game against Canoga Park. The final touch  on Treend's superlative season came last week when he was drafted in the 16th  round by the St. Louis Cardinals.  </P> <P> Andrew Lorraine (Hart, 6-3, 190, senior): Journalism's loss has become  baseball's gain. Lorraine, an honors student, covered the Indians' team until  the school paper folded last season, saving him from conflict-of-interest  charges this spring. It would have been difficult for any reporter to write  about the Indians without praising Lorraine. The Stanford-bound left-hander  posted the most impressive pitching statistics in the region. Armed with an  85-m.p.h. fastball and a biting curve, he posted a 9-0 record and an 0.91 ERA.  He also struck out 138 and allowed only 41 hits and 29 walks in 85 innings. For  good measure, he saved six games. He was drafted in the 37th round by the New  York Mets.  </P> <P> Tom Meusborn: Credit the first-year Chatsworth coach with knowing his team's  strengths and weaknesses -- and those of its opponents. In the City Section 4-A  Division final at Dodger Stadium last month, Chatsworth trailed El Camino Real  and unbeaten right-hander Pat Treend by a run in the bottom of the seventh.  After a leadoff walk, Meusborn ordered three consecutive bunts. The third was a  suicide squeeze. The bunt accounted for the winning run and Meusborn, who last  season was the junior varsity coach at Grant, became the second consecutive  first-year coach to win the City 4-A title, joining Manny Alvarado of Kennedy.  </P> <P> FIRST TEAM  </P> <P> Reed McMackin (Chatsworth, 6-1, 190, senior): McMackin set school records for  wins in a season (12) and career (22). His versatility helped Chatsworth win  the City Section 4-A Division title. He posted a 1.98 ERA and batted .402 with  28 RBIs. He shared the City 4-A Player of the Year award with El Camino Real's  Pat Treend.  </P> <P> Joey Rosselli (Alemany, 6-1, 180, senior): The left-hander was an All-Valley  pick as a quarterback and earned a football scholarship to Arizona State, but  Rosselli signed last week with the San Francisco Giants, who drafted him in the  second round. He posted a 7-3 record with a 1.12 ERA and also batted .425 with  nine doubles, five homers and 23 RBIs.  </P> <P> J. B. Johnson: (Saugus, 5-11, 205, senior): Even in the offense-happy Golden  League, Johnson's numbers stood out. He batted .444 with seven doubles, six  home runs and 28 RBIs to earn the league's MVP award. He was one of the big  reasons Saugus weathered the loss of Roger Salkeld, last year's Valley Pitcher  of the Year, to win the league title by six games.  </P> <P> Kendial Armstrong (Quartz Hill, 5-9, 170, senior): A two-sport star, Armstrong  passed for 1,067 yards but contributed even more in the spring. As the team's  third baseman, he batted .420 and ranked among the Golden League's top power  hitters with seven homers and 32 RBIs. He will play next season for College of  the Canyons.  </P> <P> Benji Belfield (Taft, 5-9, 165, senior): Belfield's contributions in Taft's  first-round upset of top-seeded Poly in the City 4-A playoffs earned him the  award for best individual playoff performance. Belfield, a shortstop, batted  .413, hit six home runs, had 34 RBIs, was 4-1 as a pitcher and made the  All-City team.  </P> <P> Keyaan Cook (Montclair Prep, 5-10, 210, senior): The Mounties' shortstop made  the right decision when he stopped playing football after his junior season to  concentrate on baseball. He led the Mounties to the Southern Section 1-A  Division title and was named the division's player of the year. He batted .537  with 11 doubles, five home runs, 36 RBIs and had 14 stolen bases.  </P> <P> Rob Davis (Hart, 5-8, 165, senior): The Indians will be hard-pressed to replace  Davis, a three-year starter at shortstop and the team's top clutch hitter. He  batted .452, scored 29 runs, had 14 extra-base hits, drove in 26 runs and stole  14 bases. Saugus probably still wonders what might have been. After starting as  a freshman with the Centurions, Davis transferred to Hart.  </P> <P> Nestor Martinez (Chatsworth, 5-9, 175, junior): Martinez earned All-City  honors, batting .423. He scored a whopping 39 runs, had 12 doubles and 24 RBIs.  He was good to the very end: Martinez scored the winning run in Chatsworth's  3-2 win over El Camino Real in the City 4-A final.  </P> <P> Ryan McGuire (El Camino Real, 6-2, 185, senior): The UCLA-bound left-hander  struck out 20 in a victory over Cleveland, causing his soon-to-be college coach  to wonder if McGuire has a future as a pitcher. Primarily a first baseman, the  All-City player batted .341 with five homers and 23 RBIs. He was 7-1 with a  1.84 ERA and had 91 strikeouts in 57 innings.  </P> <P> Lance Migita (Hart, 5-6, 150, senior): The other half of Hart's double-play  combination turned in his best season as a fourth-year starter. Although he is  among the smallest players in the lineup, Migita led the team with five home  runs and 30 RBIs. He also batted .414, scored 33 runs and led the team with 21  stolen bases.  </P> <P> Garret Anderson (Kennedy, 6-3, 190, senior): Anderson, who has signed with  Fresno State, is a two-time All-City selection and the only player on the 1990  Times baseball team to have also made All-Valley in basketball. Anderson batted  .393, hit eight home runs to lead area City players and drove in 36 runs.  </P> <P> Dereck Ornelas (Sylmar, 5-11, 180, junior): The Spartans' center fielder will  return next season as a leading candidate for the City 4-A Player of the Year  award. He was one of the hottest hitters in the region the last six weeks of  the season and finished with a .458 average, 33 runs and 28 RBIs.  </P> <P> Mitch Root (Chatsworth, 6-2, 170, junior): Root started the season at shortstop  but moved to center field. He batted .388, scored 37 runs, drove in 35 runs and  was 2-1 with four saves as a pitcher. Root was the winning pitcher in relief in  the City 4-A final and was selected to the All-City team.  </P> <P> John Najar (San Fernando, 6-1, 185, senior): Najar gave San Fernando something  it had not had in years -- the long ball. The Fresno State-bound pitcher and  designated-hitter slammed a school-record seven home runs. Najar batted .316  with 32 RBIs and was 5-2 with a 1.85 ERA and two saves. He was an All-City  selection.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ALL-VALLEY SECOND TEAM  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.99IN:2.77IN:2.22IN:1.56IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE>

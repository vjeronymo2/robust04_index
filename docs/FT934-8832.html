			<p>931113 FT  13 NOV 93 / Yorkshire colliery to be closed FRICKLEY colliery near Pontefract, West Yorkshire, is to be closed, British Coal confirmed yesterday, putting 740 miners out of work. British Coal said up to 60 per cent of Frickley's output was being stockpiled because there was no market for the coal. The situation was unlikely to improve and production costs were among the highest of any British Coal pit. The NUM miners union will today urge members to reject the closure.</p>

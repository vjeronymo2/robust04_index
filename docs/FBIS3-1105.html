Here is the text of the speech:    Brothers, presidents and heads of delegations, secretary  general, representative of the African National Congress,  representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress, ladies and  gentlemen: Once again we meet in this ancient African city to  ponder the recent developments in the southern part of our  glorious continent and discuss the moves that we should make in  the coming months. We need to ensure that we remain on the  course that will bring us nearer to our righteous goals and  reward the bitter struggle in which we all have taken part for  the principles of freedom and justice. The fraternal people in  South Africa have taken the heavier share in this struggle, but  all African nations and peace-loving forces in the world have  come to their support.    To begin, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to  my brother and dear friend, President Robert Mugabe, and the  brotherly Zimbabwean people for hosting this momentous meeting  that comes at a crucial juncture in the history of African  struggle for liberation and progress. It is propitious that we  meet today in a capital that has witnessed many of Africa's  historic achievements.    I recall that our committee met in 21 August 1989. I and  many of you had the honor to participate in that meeting in  which we discussed ways of providing support to the South  African people who were fighting a ferocious battle against  apartheid and struggling for a just and safe society, one that  is free from the shackles constricting the majority of this  great people.    At that time, my brother and friend Nelson Mandela was in  prison and many looked upon the abolition of apartheid as a  distant dream. The daunting obstacles were there all right, but  the will of the people triumphed in the end. Our great people  in South Africa, braving the difficulties, faithful to their  ideals, made a sizable contribution to the history of struggle  for justice and freedom. We are now only a few steps away from  the establishment of a democratic state in this precious part of  this tenacious continent.    We are fully aware of the challenges we will have to face in  the months and years ahead as we seek to build a strong and  cohesive society capable of shaking off the painful legacy of  the past and exploring the vast potential of its new horizons.    We have no other recourse but to accept these challenges and  plunge into the battle of building a democratic state with the  same grit that marked our struggle against the unjust system of  apartheid.    It may be fitting here to point out the establishment of the  Transitional Executive Council, which is working tirelessly to  accelerate the march of democracy, create a pluralistic system,  and supervise the holding of general elections within the next  few weeks.    We are confident that all the forces supporting legitimacy  and progress will unite their ranks and come up with a formula  for comprehensive national reconciliation that would spur and  guide the current process. For this to happen, all national  forces should take part in the elections, for the latter  represents a first but crucial step in this historic  transformation and the light that guides our hopes.    We, for our part, will not hesitate to engage in every  necessary effort to protect this process. We see our task,  within this committee, as one that will continue until the fruit  of this struggle, which we launched side by side, is harvested.  We will remain prepared to get in touch with all parties and  urge them to participate in a positive way so that a democratic  state in South Africa will come into being on schedule and take  its place within the larger African community.    Long live the unity of African struggle. Long live the  struggle of African nations for a new dawn of prosperity and  construction, an end to hatred and grudges, and a deeper  commitment to freedom, democracy, and justice. May God guide  our efforts to achieve this goal. Peace and the mercy of God be  upon you.</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Portugal (10): Blue flags and a tinge of green - Environmental Awareness ABOUT 50km south of Lisbon in the protected natural park of the Serra da Arrabida, 2,000 tonnes of toxic waste were dumped in the open air almost six years ago. The waste came from environment-friendly Switzerland - part of 20,000 tonnes exported to Portugal between 1987 and 1990 by a Zurich-based aluminium recycling plant, writes Sarah Provan. The Portuguese company that received the waste lacked the facilities to deal with it. The Swiss company has closed, and Switzerland refuses to take the waste back since it was exported more than four years ago - the legal limit beyond which waste cannot be returned to Switzerland. Local protests, and an open letter by Quercus, an environmentalist group, to Mr Carlos Borrego, environment minister, failed to get the waste removed. In desperation, the park authorities began moving it themselves last month. Environment groups condemn the Portuguese authorities' lack of concern. 'The environment is hardly a top priority for the government. It seems more important to increase industry (and) build more roads,' says Mr Antonio Eloy, a consultant of Friends of the Earth in Lisbon. Mr Borrego, whose ministry was promoted to cabinet level less than three years ago, says the criticism is unfair. 'Portugal is not the European Community country with the worst environment.' This, he admits, is partly due to Portugal's structural backwardness. 'However, it is precisely for this reason that we've had greater difficulties in applying certain regulations that other countries have applied for years.' In a programme outlined to parliament last month, he stressed the need to raise public awareness. Priority areas were 'hydraulic resources, and the preservation of natural spaces, together with ecological education', especially among the younger generations. Environmentalists are unconvinced by the minister's programme. 'In 1971, the government targeted water and natural spaces; 20 years later, protected areas continue to be eaten up by fires, tourism, urban development and industry,' Mr Eloy says. Mr Jose Macario Correia, former secretary of state for the environment, agrees. 'We don't need more laws, we have enough legislation.' The problem, he suggests, is enforcement. As a relatively poor country, Portugal lacks the resources available to its richer European partners to fight pollution, but environmentalists say the country's recent rapid pace of development makes action to protect the environment more urgent. Every summer, fires - not all accidental - devastate large chunks of forest and countryside, about 25 per cent of rivers are subject to pollution while around half the 10m population has inadequate water supplies; many beaches near the main towns are polluted, and in the cities, noise, exhaust fumes and chaotic building sites contribute to making life less pleasant and more hazardous. This year, Portuguese beaches could muster only 50 EC blue flags which give them a clean bill of health, compared with 96 flags in 1991. Only Germany, Britain and Belgium were worse off. Mr Borrego blames this year's decline on a sanitary technicians' strike which prevented proper analysis of the country's beaches. But the biggest culprits are inadequate sewage systems and factories which dump chemicals and waste in nearby rivers or unused land. The picture is not all bleak. Uncontrolled development has ruined part of the coastline in the Algarve and as a result the authorities have began to impose strict building regulations in an effort to avoid further damage. The experience is also encouraging local authorities elsewhere in the country to give more thought to the environmental consequences of planned developments. Late to industrialise, Portugal also has avoided many of the environmental pitfalls of rapid postwar reconstruction. 'Portugal emits much lower quantities of carbon dioxide than any other country (in Europe). The UK emits 2.4kg per inhabitant a year, while Portugal emits 0.9kg,' Mr Borrego says. But it still has a long way to go towards improving awareness of green issues. People will carelessly toss wrappers and rubbish onto the streets, ignoring the many green plastic bins dotted around the capital and many other cities. Lisbon has few bottle banks, and paper recycling is poorly organised. For all these shortcomings, people have become more conscious of the need to care for the environment. The press and television are more aggressive in reporting environmental issues, and there have been official publicity campaigns to raise awareness. Mistakes that have been made, as in the Algarve, will be costly to correct, but Portugal in its dash to modernisation is still ready to benefit from the experience of others.</p>

			<p>920325 FT  25 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: World coal consumption forecast to grow WORLD COAL demand and trade will increase steadily over the next two decades, though by the turn of the century increased energy efficiency and measures to protect the environment will begin to brake growth. These forecasts are made by the United Nations' Economic Commission for Europe in a study just published on prospects for world coal trade to the year 2010. It also predicts sharp declines in coal production in Europe, more than offset by rising output in the US and elsewhere. Global hard coal consumption is expected to increase on average by 1.3 per cent or 50m tonnes annually to the year 2000, but by under 1 per cent (30m tonnes) a year from 2000 to 2010. This represents a total increase of 800m tonnes between 1990 and 2010 to 4.3bn tonnes. The ECE expects electric power generation - now accounting for 45 per cent of world coal demand - to grow in importance as other uses decline. Coal demand by industry, now a quarter of world consumption, is likely to suffer from stiff competition from more convenient and less polluting energy sources such as oil, natural gas and electricity. Steel, which accounts for 20 per cent of world coal demand, is also predicted to reduce consumption because of technological changes in steel-making and lower steel output. The household sector, now responsible for 10 per cent of world consumption, is expected to switch increasingly to electricity and central district heating. The ECE says the eight major coal producing countries - Australia, China, India, Poland, South Africa, Russia, Ukraine and the US - will still be producing 85 per cent of the world's coal in 20 years time. European production is forecast to drop overall by 200m tonnes, with over half the reduction taking place in eastern Europe, including the former Soviet Union. Falling European production and growing demand in other world regions will sustain satisfactory growth of some 3.6 per cent a year in world coal trade, at least until the year 2000, the ECE study says. Thereafter, import growth is expected to fall back to only 1.5 per cent annually, with total imports reaching 630m tonnes by 2010 against 390m tonnes in 1990. Four-fifths of total coal exports will continue to come from the eight biggest producers, in spite of increasing supplies of new coal exporting countries. By the year 2010, the combined coal export potential of China, Colombia, Indonesia and Venezuela might be 120m tonnes, the ECE predicts. However, Australia and the US between them will account for 60 per cent of world exports, with the US replacing Australia as the leading exporter before the end of the century. By 2010 coal exports from Europe - essentially Poland, Russia and Ukraine - may have dropped to below 5 per cent of the world total, the ECE says. Western Europe's dependence on imported coal is expected to rise from 40 per cent in 1990 to 70 per cent in 2010, and that of eastern Europe from 10 to 25 per cent, the ECE says. Most of the import demand elsewhere will come from Asia, especially Japan and South Korea. The study maintains that, despite ever more stringent environmental measures, coal will remain for many years the dominant source of electricity generation in the world and could once again become the leading source of primary energy.

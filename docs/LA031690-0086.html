			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WAITRESS' SUIT ACCUSES 2 POSH RESTAURANTS OF SEX BIAS IN HIRING  </P> <P> Two upper crust Los Angeles restaurants were served a sex discrimination  lawsuit Thursday by an experienced waitress who claims she was denied  employment because of her sex.  </P> <P> The class action suit, which seeks unspecified monetary damages, was filed by  Kellye McKinna, 29, against Citrus Restaurant and the Ma Maison Sofitel Hotel  and Restaurant.  </P> <P> McKinna, who is seeking her doctorate at UCLA in educational psychology, said  that while working for eight months at a less formal, lower-tipping restaurant  at the Westside hotel, she "repeatedly requested" a transfer to its posh Ma  Maison Restaurant.  </P> <P> However, her requests were denied, she claimed in legal papers filed in Los  Angeles Superior Court, because Ma Maison maintains "a policy whereby female  waitpersons are prohibited in the formal dining room."  </P> <P> McKinna, who has waited tables at several other eateries in Los Angeles and  Seattle while pursuing her graduate studies, said she has since quit her job at  the hotel's La Cajole restaurant and taken a part-time position as a banquet  waitress at the Four Seasons Hotel near Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> In her suit, McKinna claims she also applied for a job at the trendy Citrus in  late 1988 but was rejected there too because she is a woman.  </P> <P> "In a city where it is conceivable for a waiter to make up to $50,000 a year,"  McKinna said at a lunchtime news conference with her attorney outside Ma  Maison, "it is absolutely unfair that women of equal experience and ability  have been completely frozen out of almost all of the most expensive restaurants  at dinner.  </P> <P> "Women deserve the right to support themselves," added McKinna, who was dressed  in a waitress outfit. ". . . We should not be limited only to positions as  coffee shop waitresses."  </P> <P> Michael Carcieri, controller of Ma Maison Sofitel, acknowledged Thursday that  no waitresses work the lucrative evening shift at Ma Maison restaurant. He  added that he believed there were some "gray areas with respect to her  (McKinna's) request for a transfer" and that the hotel's "attorneys are  reviewing all of the facts." Carcieri had no further comment, referring  questions to an attorney, Dawn Kitagawa. Kitagawa had no comment.  </P> <P> Jean-Jacques Retourne, general manager of Citrus, denied Thursday that his  restaurant has a policy against employing waitresses. The Melrose Avenue  restaurant currently has one waitress who works evenings, "and it has nothing  to do with the lawsuit," Retourne said in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> The longtime Los Angeles restaurateur said the city's finest restaurants have  traditionally hired male waiters exclusively "for the simple fact that (women)  never came around asking for jobs."  </P> <P> "We get lawsuits here for the most unbelievable things," Retourne added. "The  only thing that will be gained in this case is by the silly attorney who will  get personal fame."  </P> <P> At the news conference, McKinna's attorney, Gloria Allred, served copies of the  lawsuit to reporters from a silver platter also adorned with an iris in a dark  blue vase.  </P> <P> Allred, who has previously filed sex discrimination cases on issues ranging  from clothing alteration charges to the failure of a high school student to win  a spot on a cheerleading squad because of the size of her breasts, also spoke  at the news conference.  </P> <P> 'We believe that many restaurants have hired only men because they think it  adds prestige and importance to the restaurant to only employ men at night,"  she contended. "Such practices serve only to perpetuate the false notion that  women are of no value."  </P> <P> Allred said many restaurants exclude women by relying on word-of-mouth  recruitment by male waiters or by falsely telling women that no positions are  available. She called for federal officials to launch their own investigation  of the alleged abuses.  </P></p>

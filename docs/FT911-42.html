			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: British Airways The market is inclined to think British Airways will hold its final dividend next week - and the market is probably right. BA's balance sheet can stand the strain; the Pounds 20m saved by halving the payout will be dwarfed by trading losses in the final quarter; the wrath of shareholders is hardly worth risking in the not unlikely event that cash flows prove insufficient to meet the group's ambitious capital spending plans. If the income question dominates the share price in the short term, though, the issue thereafter is how far BA can recover from the twin traumas of recession and the Gulf. The outlook at the moment is hazy, with forward bookings pointing to a 10 to 15 per cent volume downturn year-on-year over the crucial summer period. The bigger worry is the sharp drop in revenue yields as the passenger mix shifts towards cheap-fare travellers. To add to its woes, BA now faces a serious competitive threat on its transatlantic routes, with the lower cost Virgin certain to put further pressure on margins as the US carriers United and American go all out for market share. BA has probably responded as well as any international airline to the industry's crisis. In a post-Gulf world, however, the relentless growth of business travel can no longer be taken for granted; and the regulators have altered the rules.</p>

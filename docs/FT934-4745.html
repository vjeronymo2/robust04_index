			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Ladbroke hit by twin set of doubts Shares in Ladbroke fell 20 1/2 p to 151p yesterday after news that Mr Michael Hirst, head of the group's Hilton International hotel subsidiary, had sold more than half his shares and that the company would take advantage of the new foreign income dividend scheme, hitting pension fund investors. Ladbroke said last night that 'amicable discussions' had been taking place with Mr Hirst about his future with the group but that no decision had been reached. The group said Mr Peter George, who takes over as group chief executive in January, had talked to Mr Hirst about bringing in a chief executive to strengthen the management of Hilton International - Mr Hirst is cur-rently both chairman and chief executive. The company announced last Tuesday that Mr Hirst had sold 125,000 shares at 161p each on 26 November. This leaves him with 115,067 shares. He was unavailable for comment. Ladbroke said yesterday that it would take advantage of the introduction of foreign income dividend (FID) legislation when paying its final 1993 dividend in July 1994. A switch to paying FIDs will mean a significant loss in income to pension funds as FIDs do not carry the 20 per cent tax credit of normal dividends and which tax-exempt investors can reclaim. The FID scheme is an attempt to help companies that pay surplus advance corporation tax (ACT) because of a high proportion of profits from overseas. Ladbroke said it had surplus ACT of Pounds 30m. Some analysts were angry that the FID announcement appeared to be circulating during yesterday afternoon, although it was only announced through the Stock Exchange after the market had closed. Ladbroke said it had made the announcement to some journalists at about 2pm because it did not believe it was price sensitive. It had asked the exchange to make the announcement on the advice of its brokers, Smith New Court and Warburg Securities. The group said the exchange had also said it did not believe the statement was price sensitive but Ladbroke had asked for a formal announcement to be made anyway. Lex, Page 24 London SE, Page 50</p>

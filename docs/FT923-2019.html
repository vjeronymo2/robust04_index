			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: 'Inflation option' criticised MR JOHN SMITH accused the government yesterday of taking 'the inflationary option' in an attempt to undermine its claim that defeat of inflation remained at the core of its economic policy. In a letter to Mr John Major, the Labour leader referred to the prime minister's statement last week that 'the devaluer's option' would be 'a betrayal of our future.' He said: 'Since then you have allowed the pound to be devalued by 10 per cent.' In spite of yesterday's statement by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that reducing inflation was still the government's overriding priority, 'you have taken what you yourself described as the inflationary option', Mr Smith said. 'For two years you have been telling the British people that all of the pain they have suffered from the recession - soaring unemployment, bankruptcies and high interest rates - was solely designed to achieve the the 'great prize' of zero inflation.' Mr Smith said Mr Major had remained 'totally silent' since the 'catastrophic economic events' of Wednesday. 'Yesterday, you told your cabinet that the chancellor should not be seen as an air-raid shelter,' he said. 'That is exactly how you have used him during the last 48 hours.' The letter follows Labour claims that the government squandered Pounds 500m of public money as part of the failed attempt to prop up the pound. Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said that that money could have created 50,000 Youth Training places, as well as 10,000 more offers of Enterprise Allowance and set up a temporary programme creating 150,000 jobs. Leftwingers called on Labour to drop its policy of opposition to a referendum on the Maastricht treaty and grab the opportunity to defeat the government in the Commons. Mr Tony Benn said: 'Labour has been told for 13 years that whatever we do we must defeat the government. Here is an opportunity to defeat the government.' Labour faced intense pressure from within its own ranks for a referendum, he said.</p>

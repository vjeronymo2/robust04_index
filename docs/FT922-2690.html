			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Electricity Professor Littlechild, the electricity regulator, has always leaned towards a long-term view of his function. So it may be that he felt pressured by his peers into responding to the high profits of the distribution companies. No sooner had East Midlands Electricity confirmed a 41 per cent profits increase, than the regulator was indicating his concern for customers. But Offer's annual report, published in March, discussed the drawbacks of basing price controls on a forecast of inflation. Yesterday's renewed questioning of such forecasts merely increased the likelihood that the RECs' pricing regime will eventually be based on a lagging inflation indicator. That seems sensible, not least because, if inflation begins rising again, it will not be fuelled by pre-set increases in utility prices. In that situation, the government too might see some political merit in a retrospective approach. Customers would also have to accept the obverse; that lower prices will lag any fall in inflation.</p>

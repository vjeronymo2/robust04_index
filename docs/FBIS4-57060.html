			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 11 May (DPA) -- Student protests continued  today in several Caracas neighborhoods and nearby areas. The  protests initially resulted in the arrest of 65 demonstrators  and the looting and burning of a cargo truck, according to radio  reports.    Today's demonstrations, staged by high school students, took  place in the neighborhoods of Propatria, Caricuao, and Moran, in  the southern and southeastern areas of Caracas. Meanwhile, other  demonstrations were reported in the towns of Los Teques and  Valles del Tuy, near the Venezuelan capital.    According to Radio Rumbos, 15 demonstrators were arrested in  Caracas and 50 in Valles del Tuy, where a soda truck was looted  and burned.    The protesters are demanding preferential student bus fares,  which in practice means having to pay half of the regular public  transportation fares.    There were protests in Caracas yesterday, in which two  policemen were injured by stones and bottles hurled by students.  Today, in addition to policemen, members of the militarized  National Guard intervened in an attempt to stop the  demonstrations.</p>

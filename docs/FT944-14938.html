			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Incitec profits hit by Australian drought Widespread drought cut net profit of Incitec, the Australian fertiliser and chemicals group, by 7 per cent to ADollars 29.6m from ADollars 31.8m in the year to September, writes Bruce Jacques. Directors said second-half earnings were particularly hit by drought which eroded margins in the fertiliser business. But this was partially offset by expansion in the industrial chemicals business. The directors expected tight conditions to continue but have declared a special dividend of 28 cents a share to pass franking tax credits to shareholders. The ordinary dividend has been reduced to 20 cents a share from 23 cents. The result followed a 5.2 per cent sales increase to ADollars 675m. Tax provisions took ADollars 16.3m compared with ADollars 12.4m, and depreciation ADollars 22.9m against ADollars 24.8m. Interest expense took ADollars 5.4m against ADollars 6.9m.</p>

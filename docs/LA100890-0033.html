			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ARTS  </P> <P> Mapplethorpe Foundation Donates to AIDS Group: A foundation established by the  late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe has pledged a $3-million donation to the  American Foundation for AIDS research to be used over a three-year period. The  money will come primarily from the sale of his photographs, some of which were  put on trial in Cincinnati in the unusual obscenity case that ended in  acquittals Friday for the art gallery and its director. The artist died of AIDS  last year. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

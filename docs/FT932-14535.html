			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Patten says governors have legal duty to run school tests MR John Patten, education secretary, is raising the stakes in his confrontation with the teachers' unions by writing to head teachers and governors to tell them they are legally bound to implement the national curriculum tests. The move comes as Sir Ron Dearing, who today becomes chairman-designate of the Schools Curriculum and Assesment Authority, is due to start the review of the tests announced by Mr Patten two weeks ago. Tomorrow, the Appeal Court will start hearing the case brought against the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, which is boycotting the tests, by Wandsworth borough council, south London. The high court has ruled that a boycott over high workloads would be a legitimate industrial dispute. The Department for Education refused to comment on speculation that it would try to rush through a change in the law if Wandsworth's appeal were unsuccessful. Mr Patten's letters, to be sent this week to representatives of every school in England and Wales, will say the tests must go ahead. The education department said yesterday: 'The chairmen of governors are responsible for ensuring that the national curriculum is carried out, and that includes testing. He is reminding them of their legal duty.' It refused to speculate on the legal penalties governors might face. No precedents exist for enforcing governors' legal duties in this area, but they could come under pressure to discipline headteachers. Mr Patten is also considering a campaign to promote the tests among parents similar to the campaign conducted when tests for seven-year-olds were introduced two years ago. Speaking on Saturday at a conference of the pressure group Campaign for Real Education, he also repeated his threat that funds for education would be cut if the boycott goes ahead. 'How can I possibly argue the case for education expenditure if I do not have the results to deploy, evidence of improving standards, of money well spent?' Teachers' unions reacted furiously to the news. Mr Doug Mc-Avoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, which is ballotting members on a boycott, said: 'These are the actions of a man who is desperate to rescue a failed system. He clearly recognises that the teach-ers' criticisms are extremely well-founded and his insistence on going ahead is foolish. He's painted himself into a corner, and he must have the courage to come out of it.' Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general secretary, said: 'Mr Patten seems to be writing to everyone except the teachers.' Hard test for new boy, Page 8 Private functions in public education, Page 15</p>

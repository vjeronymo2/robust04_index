			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / India moves on Bombay stock probe THE Indian parliament yesterday spelt out the terms of reference of the joint parliamentary committee assigned to investigate Bombay's financial scandal. The committee's 30 members, named yesterday, must investigate the 'irregularities and fraudulent manipulations' of securities, shares and bonds; 'fix responsibility' on individuals, institutions and authorities; and identify inadequacies and failures in supervisory mechanisms. The committee, which will submit its report by the end of parliament's winter session, will also examine the role of banks, stock exchanges, financial institutions and public-sector undertakings involved in the scandal. Mr Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister, yesterday said India would continue to hold a dialogue with Pakistan, despite border skirmishes. He added that talks between the countries' top foreign affairs officials would be held between August 16 and 18.</p>

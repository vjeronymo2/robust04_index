			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alvaro Ayala from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Army has arrested guerrilla leader Francisco  Caraballo, top leader of the People's Liberation Army [EPL], who  was being sought by authorities, 10 minutes from Santa Fe de  Bogota.    Troops headed by General Norberto Adrada Cordoba arrested  top  EPL leader Francisco Caraballo. The Army mounted an  intelligence operation two years ago because they knew he had to  come to Cajiga to visit his wife and son. He arrived last night  and was arrested this morning.    [Begin recording] [Caraballo] When I became a guerrilla, the  possibilities for joining a legal political movement with the  opportunity of being a political opposition were closed.    [Unidentified reporter] Why did you murder the  surgeon-priest?    [Caraballo] I did not murder him.    [Reporter] Why did you order his murder?    [Caraballo] I did not order him killed.    [Reporter] But you never wanted peace, and you have shown  you  do not want peace.    [Caraballo] I disagree with that.    [Gen. Hernan Jose Guzman] This is a hard blow to the  guerrillas because in less than 15 days, the Army has arrested  their commander, their third person in command, and other  members of the organization. We have also arrested Genaro [not  further identified], who was the coordinator of their  activities. [end recording]    The arrest of guerrilla leader Francisco Caraballo was the  result of an intelligence operation conducted by the Colombian  Army; no reward was paid.</p>

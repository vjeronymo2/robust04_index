			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / People: Minorco: Munera resigns The resignation of Gerard Munera as chief executive and president of Minorco (USA) 'in order to pursue other opportunities and spend more time with his family' suggests to some analysts that perhaps he and Hank Slack, Minorco's president, have different ideas about the group's future in North America, writes Kenneth Gooding. It would not be the first time for Munera. He gave up as chief executive of Union Miniere in 1989 because he clashed with the then-president Herve de Carmoy about the direction the Belgian metals group should take. Just over a year later, after a brief spell with RTZ in London, he joined Minorco (USA) which had been set up to oversee the Luxembourg-based group's interests in the States. Since then Minorco, the offshore investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, has changed substantially. Slack emerged as the sole managing director (previously three shared that responsibility) and last September Minorco took control of Anglo's non-diamond interests outside South Africa - mainly unquoted investments in South America. Anglo recently has seemed to be more enthusiastic about South rather than North America. Munera's role will be taken over by Reuben Richards (above), at 64 six years older than Munera. Richards, previously a banker, joined the group in 1982 and was in charge in the gloomy days when Minorco's main subsidiary in the States, Inspiration Resources, was doing so badly it was dubbed Desperation Resources by some wags. He remains chairman of Minorco (USA). Munera, originally a French-Algerian but now a US citizen, is also leaving Minorco's main board.</p>

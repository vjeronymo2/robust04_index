			<p>BFN     [Text] Here on Mayak's "Panorama" program is a postscript  to a recent event in the top echelons of power in Russia. The  well-known politician and member of the State Duma, Sergey  Stankevich, analyzes the reasons for Sergey Shakhray's  resignation from the post of deputy prime minister.    [Begin Stankevich recording] I am convinced -- and this is  not simply because I am in the same party, I have long been  convinced -- that he is one of the most professional and  hard-working members of our political and government team. Any  departure by him from the government is undoubtedly a loss and  undoubtedly signifies a weakening of the government and,  incidentally, is a loss for Russians as well, because he acts  calmly, sensibly, circumspectly, clearly, and, as a rule, quite  effectively in so far as results can be achieved.    As far as his resignation is concerned, there is an economic  component here as well as a political and a kind of  group-personal component. Let's start with the economic one.  This year Shakhray's department was allocated quite a  considerable sum for the implementation of regional policy.  Specifically, preferential government loans worth approximately  seven trillion rubles were allocated for the regions of the  North alone, and it was Shakhray's department that was to decide  how these colossal funds were to be distributed, via which banks  they would pass, and on which programs they would be spent.  Before taking this very responsible decision, Shakhray inquired  how this had been done previously and how trillions in  government loans had been spent. I do not rule out the  possibility that Shakhray's scrupulous and over-careful approach  -- justifiably careful -- to this subject, could have made those  who are used to not expending particular concern over very  serious state loans nervous.    I would like to mention the political component. I am afraid  that the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES] has now become  the object of very jealous and malevolent attention. It looks  as though someone is trying very hard to squeeze it out of the  positions that it has occupied. Six key posts in the cabinet,  four ministerial and two deputy prime minister posts, belonged  to PRES, and, evidently, this was regarded as excessive by those  political groupings that are also laying claim to a significant  share of power. I do not rule out that it was their influence  that was brought to bear here.    Finally, as for the personal issue. Shakhray is extremely  sensitive about such aspects as professional ethics, human  dignity, and the dignity of a political and state figure. When  a minister is appointed to a ministry of which he, as deputy  prime minister is supposed to be in charge, and he is not even  consulted about the matter, that is something he could not  ignore.

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Reading list that turns new leaves MARK Twain and Ray Bradbury rub shoulders with Charlotte Bronte and Susan Hill, and Dickens and Shakespeare jostle with Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Henrik Ibsen in the National Curriculum Council's suggested English literature reading list for 16-year-olds in England and Wales. Even Philip Larkin gets a mention. One immediate effect of the list will be to boost sales for writers not yet widely read in schools, according to Penguin, the publishers owned by the Pearson Group, which also owns the Financial Times. Mr Patrick Hutchinson, Penguin's marketing and sales director, described the list as mainly 'safe and traditional'. But he added that inclusion on the list would help sales of some of the lesser-known modern authors. He said: 'When the list for primary schools came out three years ago, many schools didn't have the resources to buy all the books. Parents then rushed out to the shops and bought copies for the children, so this is going to propel authors on to shelves where they may not have been before.' Appearances on reading lists reliably increase book sales. The proposals prescribe that children between 11 and 14 (Key Stage Three) should read at least one Shakespeare play, then read another between 14 and 16 (Key Stage Four). These must come from separate categories - the histories, tragedies and comedies. Beyond this, 11-to-14-year-olds should read drama 'appropriate for their age' - one suggestion is Dylan Thomas' Under Milk Wood - while 14-to-16-year-olds have to read at least one play by an author from a list that includes Arthur Miller, J B Priestley, Oscar Wilde, Robert Bolt, Tom Stoppard, Alan Bennett and Henrik Ibsen. Requirements for poetry include more imaginative choices. At both key stages, children must read works by at least five poets, of whom at least two should have been published before 1900. The list at Key Stage Four includes a number of writers less well-exposed. In addition to Blake, Coleridge, Tennyson, Wordsworth, Keats, Shelley, Donne and Chaucer, modern poets such as Brian Patten, Derek Walcott, Sylvia Plath, Dannie Abse and Norman MacCaig are included. Modern writers who might hope for a boost from sales include Jan Mark, Rukshana Smith, Michelle Magorian, Beverly Naidoo, Anne Holm, Berlie Doherty, Joan Lingard, Katherine Paterson, Rosa Guy, Marjorie Darke and Gwyn Thomas. Teachers reacted with alarm to the amount of Shakespeare prescribed, regardless of childrens' ability. Ms Judith Rowley, an English teacher from the Morton School in Carlisle, said: 'I'm certainly not against Shakespeare, and I would expect to read one of his plays with a top set by the age of 12 or 13, but as far as the lower groups are concerned I would be doubtful about it.' She also voiced concern about the inclusion of Ibsen and Solzhenitsyn.</p>

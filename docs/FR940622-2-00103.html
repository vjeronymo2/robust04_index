			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Personal information to satisfy general legal requirements, when applicable, such as citizenship, veterans' preference, minimum and maximum age requirements, and proof of competitive status. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicant preferences, where applicable, such as work location, work schedule, type of employment (permanent or temporary).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To tell applicants what information to include in their resumes/applications, we propose to issue a flyer called Applying for a Federal Job. The flyer also alerts applicants that fraudulent statements can be punished by fine or imprisonment, job finalists will be asked to certify the accuracy of their statements, and in some instances all applicants may be required to provide this certification. (A copy of the flyer is appended to this notice.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The flyer would be widely available through OPM's field offices, agency personnel offices, State Employment Service offices, and other organizations that deal with Federal job seekers. Printed versions could be purchased through the General Services Administration or could be obtained from OPM's electronic bulletin boards without charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agencies could incorporate in their vacancy announcements the information requested in the flyer and could request any other job-related information required by the position(s) to be filled. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Disposition of incomplete applications would be subject to individual agency policy, as is currently the case. Each agency determines whether incomplete applications will be rejected, evaluated to the extent possible, or subject to follow up for additional information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Applicant Options <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Beginning January 1, 1995, applicants could choose the format of their written applications, for example, a resume, the optional application discussed in paragraph 5, or any other written application an individual chooses. Individuals may have a supply of SF 171 forms or SF 171 computer software; such applications would be acceptable if applicants chose to use them (but an agency could not require SF 171). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist applicants in preparing their resumes/applications, the proposed flyer, Applying for a Federal Job, shows the types of information agencies require for evaluating job applicants (see paragraph 3). For applicants who prefer a more structured approach, the proposed optional application form would be available, as discussed in paragraph 5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. New Optional Forms <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two new optional forms are proposed: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. ``Optional Application for Federal Employment'' is a simplified application for individuals who prefer a form. It would be particularly useful for applicants who do not have extensive job-related qualifications, such as recent graduates or applicants for entry or wage grade positions. (The form would have a short tear-off sheet with brief instructions and the Privacy Act and Public Burden Statements). This optional application contains information considered to be the minimum necessary to determine an applicant's qualifications. (The information requested parallels the contents of the flyer described in paragraph 3.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the intent of this proposal is to give applicants flexibility in preparing job applications, Federal agencies could not require all applicants to use the optional application form, except where the agency had developed a computer-compatible version of the optional application. This exception is necessary because automated systems usually can operate only with specific formats and questions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The optional application would be widely available through OPM field offices, agency personnel offices, Statement Employment Service offices, and other organizations that deal with Federal job seekers. Printed versions could be purchased through the General Services Administration or the form could be obtained without charge on a computer file from OPM's electronic bulletin boards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. ``Declaration for Federal Employment'' would be used primarily to collect information on conduct and suitability, and also on other matters, such as receipt of a government annuity. (The form would have a short tear-off sheet with brief instructions and the Privacy Act and Public Burden Statements.) Agencies would have the option of asking applicants to complete this optional form at any time during the hiring process, but it would be required of all appointees. We anticipate that, in most cases, only the final few applicants who have a good chance of receiving a job offer would complete the form. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another important purpose of the Declaration for Federal Employment would be to warn applicants of the consequences of submitting fraudulent information and to ask them to certify the accuracy of all their application materials. At the time of appointment, individuals would again be asked to sign a certification so that they could indicate any changes that occurred between the date of the initial certification and date of appointment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (This certification for appointees is a part of the existing SF 61&hyph;B, Declaration of Appointee. The SF 61&hyph;B, which also contains suitability and insurance questions, would be replaced in 1995 by the proposed Declaration for Federal Employment.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OPM has proposed a 3-year expiration date (the maximum permitted under the Paperwork Reduction Act) for both the optional application and declaration form. We also propose that the expiration date not be displayed on the forms because of the anticipated large volume that would be in circulation at any time. Samples of both forms are appended to this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

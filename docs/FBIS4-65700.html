			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Antonietta Calabro: "Berlusconi Gets To Grips </F> With Secret Services"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Intelligence service heads are  getting nervous about what decisions [Prime Minister] Berlusconi  will make. Parliamentary sources say that there will be  changes, either at the level of the secretary general of Cesis  [Executive Committee for the Intelligence and Security Services]  (a post currently held by General Giuseppe Tavormina, very close  to Andrea Manezella, the former secretary general of the Palazzo  Chigi [office of the prime minister] during the Ciampi era and a  Democratic Party of the Left [PDS] candidate for the European  elections), or at the head of Sismi [Intelligence and Military  Security Service] (a post occupied by Cesare Pucci), or at the  head of Sisde [Intelligence and Democratic Security Service]  currently run by Domenico Salazar. The favorites to take over  at Sismi are General Carlo Jean (already the military attache  under former President Francesco Cossiga) and Franco Angioni  (former commander of the Lebanon mission). Where the military  secret services are concerned, however, a candidate from within  could also have a very good chance.    Possible successors at Sisde (routed by scandal and  developments in the inquest into the fake bomb "discovered" on a  train) are Milanese police chief Achille Serra, a Northern  League favorite, and the current District Attorney of Florence,  Pierluigi Vigna. Vigna could also be the right man for Cesis,  where he would be in the running with General Pietro Sotgiu  (from the drugs squad) and General Domenico Pisani, commander of  Rome's Second Carabinieri Division. However, while there will  be some rotation of staff, informed sources say that the changes  will not be immediate. One of the reasons for this is the  extremely important G-7 summit in Naples from 6 to 8 July which  will involve the security organizations to a maximum and which  suggests it would be ill-advised to make any changes at the head  of the intelligence services for the time being. Other sources  say, on the contrary, that for this very reason the government  wants to make sure immediately that the services are headed by  totally faithful people.    The plans that Berlusconi's government has for these  departments do not stop there. Admiral Fulvio Martini's plan  for reform is picking up speed again and has also received the  approval of Ugo Pecchioli, chairman of the Parliamentary  Oversight Committee. In practice, this plan would create a  single service of around 6,000 to 7,000 men at the direct  disposal of the prime minister via an ad hoc undersecretary of  state and which would take on the role of a national security  authority. As a result, the prime minister could go over the  head of the interior and defense ministers. The secret service,  which in this plan would be a strictly professional force, would  be split into six departments, one of which would be charged  with tackling organized crime. To counterbalance the resulting  centralization, the powers of the parliamentary committee would  be increased, especially for budget control and for timely  information on the operations carried out.</p>

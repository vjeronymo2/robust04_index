			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Oils lead late surge on rise in crude prices Wall Street AFTER trading in a narrow range for most of the day, a surge of late buying, linked to higher crude oil prices, lifted US equities across the board, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was ahead 21.08 at 3,358.39. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.81 at 417.68, while the American SE composite put on 2.94 to 386.08 and the Nasdaq composite added 4.99 at 575.21. Turnover on the New York SE was a fairly substantial 195.6m shares, while advancing issues outpaced declines by 1,094 to 633. The morning's economic figures provided no surprises, a source of relief to the market, which had suffered from statistical shocks in recent economic reports. The consumer price index rose 0.3 per cent in June, confirming that inflationary pressures remained dormant in the economy, while retail sales increased by 0.5 per cent last month, slightly below forecasts and indicative of the sluggish state of consumer demand. Stock market sentiment had earlier been troubled by a rise in long-term bond yields which, if sustained, could threaten to negate some of the positive effect of the recent discount rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Share prices bounced in late trading, however, after oil issues took off in the wake of higher crude oil prices. Leading the late surge were Chevron, up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 70, Texaco, Dollars 1 higher at Dollars 64 7/8 , BP, Dollars 2 1/8 stronger at Dollars 49 1/4 , and Occidental, Dollars  1/4 ahead at Dollars 20 1/8 . Financial shares were also in demand following some good quarterly earnings reports. Merrill Lynch appreciated Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 52 3/8 on news of second-quarter profits of Dollars 227.7m, PaineWebber put on Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 22 3/8 on earnings of Dollars 45.7m and Primerica, parent of broking house Smith Barney, added Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 40 7/8 after the group reported net income of Dollars 150.5m for the April-June period. Coca-Cola receded Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 41 1/2 in turnover of 1.8m shares, although the soft drinks group reported second-quarter net income of 44 cents a share, up from 36 cents a share a year ago and in line with expectations. The selling was attributed to profit-taking by investors and dealers who had bought the stock in anticipation of good quarterly figures. Honeywell eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 65 5/8 after announcing net income of Dollars 85m for the second quarter, up 10 per cent from a year ago but boosted by one-off litigation settlement gains. Constar moved forward Dollars 1 to Dollars 21 7/8 on news that broking house Bear Stearns had upgraded its 1992 earnings forecast by 10 cents to Dollars 1.60 a share and for 1993 by a similar amount to Dollars 1.85 a share. Fabri-Centers dropped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 12 7/8 after the company warned that it would incur a loss of about 85 cents a share in the second quarter. The company immediately reported plans to reduce its workforce and cut some salaries. Canada TORONTO share prices ended higher after fairly busy trading. The TSE 300 index gained 13.9 at 3,463.2, while rises outnumbered declines by 304 to 256 after volume of 30.1m shares valued at CDollars 352m. Today's volume was boosted by a 5m-share block of Telus Corp crossed just at the close. The transportation group fell 4.18 per cent as the sub-group's most heavily weighted components, Laidlaw 'A' and 'B' shares, each fell CDollars  3/4 to CDollars 11 7/8 and CDollars 11 3/4 respectively. Laidlaw said it was not aware of any corporate developments that would account for the decline in the share prices. Overall, 11 of the 14 sectors closed higher. The gold shares index moved up 2.32 per cent as the New York spot gold price rose USDollars 1.80 to USDollars 351.05 an ounce.</p>

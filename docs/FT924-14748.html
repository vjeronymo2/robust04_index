			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Letter: Protection of software Sir, Alan Cane's interesting piece about computer software faults (Technically Speaking, October 6) suggests insurance as a route to protection. This begs the question of why insurers would be willing to make judgments about degrees of unreliability in computers that everyone else baulks at. The problem with hoping for an actuarial database to help determine premiums is that nothing in the computer world - hardware platforms, operating systems, applications programs - has a sufficiently long life for any worthwhile data to be built up. That is why those of us who advise underwriters in this area tend to use more informal indicators. These include: reviewing development and testing methodologies; looking for careful version release procedures; and preferring systems which include such features as continual verification of correct working and fail-safe arrangements. A further element is well planned contingency and recovery planning. The closest we get to actuarial data is a collection of anecdotes about system failures which we can search via full text retrieval software.

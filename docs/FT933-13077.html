			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Not only an environmental cost Sir, David Buchan's article on homegrown petrol concludes with the assertion that some EC member states are less than enthusiastic about biofuels because of their adverse environmental and industrial effects ('France samples homegrown petrol', July 15). While this is undoubtedly true, at a time of burgeoning deficits, a loss of tax revenue of up to Pounds 3bn across the Community, plus a slightly smaller sum in other agricultural support costs, may also cross their minds.

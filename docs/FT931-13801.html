			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Royal Trustco negotiating alliance following review ROYAL TRUSTCO, Canada's second-biggest trust company, is negotiating an alliance with another institution, and the Toronto Bronfman family may cede its 48 per cent indirect control. The Edper Bronfmans, related to the Montreal Bronfmans who control Seagram, won control of Royal Trustco in a spectacular takeover battle with property developer Mr Robert Campeau in 1979. Royal Bank of Canada, the country's largest bank, later confirmed it was among the institutions holding talks with Royal Trustco. RBC also said it was rethinking its credit policy after suffering from CDollars 2.05bn (USDollars 1.6bn) in loan losses for fiscal 1992. In the past two years, RT has been hit by the property collapse in Britain and the US as well as the recession in Canada. While it has insisted its core fiduciary and banking business in Canada remained sound, RT has sold major assets and has written down loan losses heavily. Mr James Miller, 61, the chartered accountant who took over as chief executive on December 1, said: 'RT prefers to seek an alliance with another large financial institution that would make a major equity investment. 'Talks are under way with a number of institutions which could result in the new investor ultimately becoming the largest shareholder of RT.' Mr Miller said the talks resulted from a complete strategic review of RT undertaken with London investment bankers, SG Warburg, and due for completion on January 31. Trilon, a holding company through which the Bronfmans control RT, last month bought in CDollars 100m of publicly-held RT preferred shares and is ready to put in CDollars 100m of new equity to demonstrate its continuing support, Mr Miller said. Mr Miller warned that more write-downs would come in the year-end results. 'A loss is projected in the final quarter, which will also include restructuring charges.'</p>

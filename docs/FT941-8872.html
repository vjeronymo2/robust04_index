			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Trencherwood returns to the black with Pounds 1.8m Trencherwood, the Newbury-based housebuilder, returned to the black in the 12 months to October 31 after three years of losses. The company continued to suffer operating losses before exceptional items in 1993, but management is confident that 1994 will be a turnround year, with significant improvements in profit margins and sales volumes. Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 1.8m, compared with losses of Pounds 21.4m, but the latest figure included a Pounds 1.9m write-back of provisions and a Pounds 1.24m profit from the sale of a subsid-iary. Turnover declined to Pounds 15.3m (Pounds 18.9m), but the cost of sales fell 30 per cent to Pounds 12.8m because of a cut in incentives to house purchasers and a fall in construction costs. The number of units sold increased by 14 per cent to 188, and Mr Richard Brooke, finance director, said the company was targeting a 25 per cent increase in unit sales during the current year. He was confident that the cost of sales would not increase during 1994 because of forward pricing for contractors and continuing overhangs in building material supplies. In addition, house prices increased by an estimated 5-6 per cent last year and Mr Brooke expected similar increases during the current year. Trencherwood went through a radical refinancing in early 1993, swapping Pounds 35m in bank debt and claims into equity. At the year end it still had net debt of Pounds 26m, despite receiving proceeds from the sale of an associate property development to J Sainsbury for an undisclosed sum. The company is continuing to sell land outside its core area of Berkshire. It disposed of Pounds 1.9m of land last year and plans to reduce further its exposure to commercial property development. During 1993 Trencherwood bought Pounds 2.3m of new land and at October 31 had a land bank comprising 6,912 plots, of which 1,500 had planning permission. Earnings per share amounted to 3.45p basic and 1.88p fully diluted, compared with losses of 83.1p. The company is not proposing a dividend.</p>

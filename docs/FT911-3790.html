			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investments - Portugal (4): Serious underlying problems - Although the economy appears to have performed remarkably well, Patrick Blum discovers . . . AT FIRST sight Portugal's economy appears to have performed remarkably well. Last year, the gross domestic product grew by 4.4 per cent, exports surged, investment was up by 8.7 per cent with direct foreign investment rising by more than 60 per cent to Dollars 3.6bn, the current account balance closed with a hardly noticeable Dollars 61m deficit, and unemployment was below 5 per cent. Only inflation, at 13.4 per cent for the year, appeared to cloud the horizon. Yet, in spite of the good news which merited praise from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European Commission, there remain serious underlying problems of which inflation - which officials seem at times to perceive as only a temporary difficulty caused by too much success - is just one. True, exports are rising, but not as much and not sufficiently fast to overcome an enduring trade deficit. Merchandise imports have grown much faster than exports. The value of imports of goods rose by 31.5 per cent from Dollars 17.6bn in 1989 to Dollars 23bn last year, while the value of exports of goods grew by a sturdy but more modest 25.2 per cent from Dollars 12.7bn in 1989 to Dollars 16.4bn. The deficit in traded goods rose by almost 35 per cent in 1990, resuming an upward trend that had been reversed in 1989. It will not be easy to overcome this imbalance, although some important manufacturing projects now under way will help in the future. But for the time being, Portuguese manufactured goods tend, with few exceptions, to be of lower quality and geared to the mass market. Inefficient production methods are compensated for by the lowest labour costs in the Community, Portugal's largest market. But that comparative advantage is being increasingly eroded as competition from other EC and non-EC producers becomes more intense, and as wages rise to come more into line with those in the rest of Europe. Mr Jose Alberto Tavares Moreira, governor of the Banco de Portugal (central bank), argues that the growth in exports demonstrates that Portuguese industry is becoming more competitive: 'In spite of the strong appreciation of the escudo we have managed to have a current account practically in surplus. This shows that there has been a considerable restructuring of the economy. There have been extensive productivity gains." That is true in some industries though the extent and significance of the restructuring is less certain. Traditional sectors such as textiles or agriculture - the two biggest areas of activity - are deeply in crisis. Repeated complaints about high interest rates - at between 21 per cent and 23 per cent for prime corporate clients for a year, or 24 per cent to 26 per cent for small companies - and recurrent calls for help from Portuguese business groups in the face of foreign competition suggest that industry remains deeply apprehensive about the future. The current account has improved with the latest figures for 1989 showing a surplus of Dollars 139m instead of the forecast deficit of Dollars 550m, and initial - likely to be revised - figures for 1990 showing a deficit of Dollars 61m compared to a forecast deficit of Dollars 1.2bn. But this was achieved not simply because exports grew - though that helped - but in large part because of higher than expected earnings from tourism, up by almost 30 per cent from Dollars 2.1bn in 1989 to Dollars 2.7bn last year, and higher emigrants remittances worth Dollars 4.2bn. For Portugal to be able to benefit fully from European integration and European economic and monetary union (EMU) inflation must be brought under control and the inflation differential between Portugal and its European partners reduced. But while inflation was brought down from its 1984 peak of nearly 30 per cent to an annual rate of 9.4 per cent in 1987, it has edged back up since then. Mr Miguel Beleza, the finance minister, appointed more than a year ago, is more cautious than his predecessor when it comes to forecasts, but his own 10.5 per cent target, later revised to 11 per cent, still fell short of the 13.4 per cent annualised average rate actually achieved - more than double the European average. This year, the government hopes to bring down inflation to a maximum 11 per cent. Mr Tavares Moreira says this is feasible though it will be difficult because of strong demand pressure. 'It is not easy to deflate an economy under these conditions,' he says. There are signs that price rises may have slowed a little with the annualised average rate in February falling 0.1 of a percentage point to 13.3 per cent, but this is still a long way from the 8 per cent which he says would be desirable to bring the escudo into the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System (EMS), a move the government would like to make as soon as possible. Another factor may now also be entering the inflation equation. In recent years, wages have lagged behind rather than led inflation, but this could be changing. An agreement last autumn between the government and some of the unions to keep wage increases to 13.5 per cent may limit rises in the state sector, but low unemployment and labour scarcity, especially in parts of the private sector, is causing strong upward pressure with pay deals this year reaching 16 per cent. Yet wages must go up if higher productivity gains are to be achieved. The government is caught between conflicting pressures. In the past, interest rates were kept high administratively as part of efforts to curb credit demand and consumption to fight inflation. Now, with moves towards market set rates, the main and enduring cause of high interest rates remains the budget deficit which represents between 6.5 per cent and 7 per cent of GDP. Government borrowing effectively sets the rates for the market. Privatisations which last year brought the government an extra income of nearly Dollars 1bn, cannot help since revenue from the sale of state-owned assets cannot be used to finance the budget. Meanwhile, high interest rates and a stable currency encourage capital inflows thereby adding to inflationary pressures. Moreover, as the economy is opened up and the financial system is liberalised it is increasingly difficult for the authorities to control capital movements. Short-term capital inflows proved especially troublesome last year having increased from Dollars 770m in 1989 to Dollars 1.8bn which represented more than one third of all capital movements in 1990. To discourage these mainly speculative capital movements the authorities tightened up foreign exchange rules and allowed greater fluctuations in the value of the escudo by ending the practice of maintaining a 'crawling peg' according to which the escudo was depreciated by 0.25 per cent a month. The immediate effect, however, was to send the escudo up rather than down. So those hoping for a depreciation of the escudo are unlikely to see their wishes satisfied. 'We have to see the exchange rate level on a long-term basis, and (on that basis) the escudo is about right at the moment,' Mr Tavares Moreira says, adding, 'there is no alternative to maintaining a very firm monetary policy'. And that means the squeeze between high real interest and exchange rates is likely to continue.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- CAPITAL MOVEMENTS NOT RELATED TO FOREIGN DEBT (DOLLARS M)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                 1987       1988       1989       1990  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Medium and long-term capital     758        938       2217       3226 Foreign                          768       1162       2505       3550 Domestic                         -10       -224       -288       -324 Short-term capital*              628       1653        770       1863 TOTAL                           1386       2591       2987       5089  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *Any bank transaction of up to one year; note - values for 1990 may be revised.

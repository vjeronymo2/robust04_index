			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [NEGA report: "Shakhray Quits"] </F>   [Text] Commenting on Sergey Shakhray's dismissal, Yakutia  President Mikhail Mikolayev stated that "whereas everything is  clear about his quitting the ministerial position, it is not  quite so clear about his quitting the position of deputy  government chairman." In his words, it often happens in Russia  that someone hands in his resignation and it is not accepted.    Mikhail Nikolayev also had some complaints about the concept  of the state's nationalities policy developed under Sergey  Shakhray's guidance and published in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA.  According to Yakutia's president, he disagrees with the  philosophy of this concept. First and foremost, Mikhail  Nikolayev stated, the reason for his disagreeing lies in that  the new Russian Federation Constitution defines the status of  the republics comprising the Russian Federation as states,  whereas Sergey Shakhray's concept reduces the level of former  autonomous entities to the level of territorial components of  the Russian Federation. "I cannot understand this," Yakutia's  president stated.    Nor is Yakutia's president happy about the fact that the  concept takes no account of the rights of the indigenous peoples  to these territories' natural resources. He thinks this is  incomprehensible because the Constitution provides for a  different arrangement for owning the natural resources of  components of the Russian Federation.    At the same time, Mikhail Nikolayev does not think Sergey  Shakhray's departure is a tragedy. In his words, "everybody  should calm down and work." "I am more worried about how to see  through the shipping season in the polar seas, how to deliver  cargoes, how to feed and clothe citizens of my republic rather  than about the change of guard in the federal government, even  in such a lofty position," Yakutia's president underlined.    Bashkortostan President Murtaza Rakhimov stated in a  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA interview that he regrets Shakhray's  resignation if only because it was Sergey Shakhray who led the  delegation during the talks between Moscow and Ufa on the  signing of a bilateral Russian- Bashkirian treaty delimiting  powers and jurisdictions. "Now I do not know who is going to  head the Russian delegation," Bashkortostan's president  underscored. He said it is not clear what is to become of the  Party of Russian Unity and Accord which, incidentally,  Bashkortostan's president backed in the December elections.</p>

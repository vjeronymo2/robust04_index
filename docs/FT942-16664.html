			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US company to develop Peruvian gas field The Maple Resources Corporation of Texas has signed a contract with PeruPetro, the Peruvian state oil company, to develop the Aguaytia natural gas field in the eastern jungle. It is the first operations contract signed under Peru's new hydrocarbon law, passed last August, and will involve Maple in an estimated investment of between USDollars 120m and USDollars 150m. In the first phase, Maple Resources will develop two nearby oil fields that now produce about 800 barrels of crude a day. Maple is also expected to take over running the Pucallpa refinery. Development of the gas fields will follow. Aguaytia has an estimated 300,000m cubic feet of recoverable gas. Construction of a processing plant, gas pipelines and local storage facilities for liquefied petroleum gas will be required. In a third stage, Aguaytia's gas will be used to generate electrical energy for the Pucallpa region from a 140MW plant.</p>

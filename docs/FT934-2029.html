			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / US output jumps for November: Clinton joins interest rate rise debate Reports of the biggest increase in US industrial production for a year yesterday added spice to a vigorous debate about the desirability of an early increase in US interest rates. The Federal Reserve said industrial production rose 0.9 per cent last month after a 0.7 per cent rise in October. The rise was broadly-based but was especially strong in interest-rate sensitive sectors such as cars and business equipment. The surge in production follows a string of buoyant economic figures, including a sharp fall in the jobless rate to 6.4 per cent last month. Many Wall Street analysts believe the Fed should respond quickly to growing evidence of accelerating economic growth by nudging short-term interest rates higher. They say the Fed should tighten policy before inflation begins to rise. Others say inflation - 2.7 per cent in the year to November - is so subdued that no increase in rates from the current level of 3 per cent will be required for many months. On Tuesday evening President Bill Clinton entered the debate, warning that it would be a 'mistake' to raise rates because there was no sign yet of a rise in inflationary pressures. He said the economy had already suffered 'a false start or two' and the priority was more jobs and higher incomes. Previous signals from the administration had been more ambiguous, with some officials apparently unconcerned by the prospect of a small rise in interest rates. The Fed's policy-making open market committee meets next week to discuss monetary policy. Yesterday's figures showed across-the-board strength of production. The largest gains were in car production, up 5.5 per cent. But output of business equipment and construction supplies rose 1.3 per cent and 1.1 per cent respectively. Overall manufacturing output was up 1 per cent with output of durable goods up 1.3 per cent. The rise in industrial output, which followed a 0.7 per cent increase in October, lifted the rate of industrial capacity utilisation to 83 per cent - a level that some economists fear could result in upward pressure on prices. This was the highest level of capacity utilisation since 1989, when inflation was rising, and compares with a long-term average of 81.9.</p>

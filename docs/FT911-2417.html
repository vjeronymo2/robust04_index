			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Lloyd's approved 'misleading' letter, court told LLOYD'S of London approved a letter containing misleading information, it was alleged in the High Court yesterday. The letter was drafted by one of the insurance market's agencies to a group of Names (members). The allegation was made during the second day of the civil case brought against the Corporation of Lloyd's by 33 Names who backed Oakeley Vaughan Underwriting Agency's syndicates between 1980 and 1982. In the case Ashmore v the Corporation of Lloyd's,the Names allege that Lloyd's failed to supervise the agency properly and that its negligence was responsible for some Pounds 5m of underwriting losses suffered by them. More than 250 Names originally backed four syndicates managed by Oakeley Vaughan. Their total losses exceed Pounds 30m. Mr Michael Lyndon-Stanford, QC, acting for 24 of the Names, said that Lloyd's failed to tell Names about the results of a 1981 inquiry into the agency. The internal inquiry began in February 1981 and examined allegations that Oakeley Vaughan syndicates were overwriting. When a syndicate overwrites, it writes more insurance than permitted according to Lloyd's regulations. Overwriting means that the insurance liabilities of Names are increased. A letter dated March 6 1981 was sent by Oakeley Vaughan to the Names on its syndicates. It said that the allegations were of a 'technical' nature. The letter had been previously approved by Lloyd's. The words 'in a market the size of Lloyd's such inquiries are not unusual' had been added. Those statements were misleading, Mr Lyndon-Stanford said. In its defence,Lloyd's says the Names were guilty of contributory negligence in not being aware, through press coverage, of what was happening at Oakeley Vaughan. Mr Lyndon-Stanford said: 'If Lloyds' attitude is that Names should inform themselves from newspapers and not with information from Lloyd's,it is not a very good reflection on Lloyds' attitude to its Names.' The allegations were made in evidence presented by Mr Lyndon-Stanford, covering developments at Oakeley Vaughan between February and May 1981. Earlier, Mr Justice Gatehouse allowed Mr Lyndon-Stanford to present evidence concerning alleged inadequate monitoring of premium income by Lloyd's,although that is not specifically stated in the writ. The hearing, expected to last three months, continues today.</p>

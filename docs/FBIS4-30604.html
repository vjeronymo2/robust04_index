			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- Japan's No. 2 opposition  party, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- Social  Democratic Party of Japan], moved a step forward Tuesday [28  June] toward rejoining the coalition which it quit in late  April, political sources said.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama held talks with leaders of  seven coalition parties Tuesday at the Diet to discuss a new  framework for a new government.    The leaders of the coalition and SDP agreed to begin studies  on policies for a new government, which the sources said needs  to be managed "democratically."    Meanwhile, the No. 1 opposition party, the Liberal  Democratic  Party (LDP), continued efforts to establish a grand coalition  with the SDP in an effort to regain the power it lost 10 months  ago.    LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori, in a meeting with SDP  Secretary General Wataru Kubo in the Diet, proposed putting up  Murayama as head of a new three-party coalition among the LDP,  SDP and new party Sakigake, an LDP splinter group.    Mori also called for an early summit between Murayama and  LDP  President Yohei Kono.    Kubo, however, did not respond immediately to the LDP's  offer  and instead told Mori that the SDP will put the priority on  talks with the ruling coalition, the sources said.</p>

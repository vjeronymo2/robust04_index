			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, has  said that the settlement of Kashmir is in the vital interests of  Pakistan and not Khalistan. Talking to newsmen informally in  Parliament House today, he regretted that the opposition leader  is attaching greater importance to Khalistan issue rather than  Kashmir. Pakistan wants a dialogue with India on all issues  provided India creates prosperous [as heard] conditions. He  said we would send another two nonpapers to India within next  few days.    To a question, the foreign minister said that if India  learns  to live like good neighbors and changes its hegemonic attitude,  there would be peace in the region.    To another question on the increase in Indian defense  budget,  the foreign minister said it was extremely unfortunate as it  will escalate the arms race in the region and create more  poverty.    Responding a question on Pakistan's resolution on human  rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir in UN Human Rights  Commission, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said it would be a test for  the level of world morality and it will expose the  double-standards of the world community.    To yet another question, the foreign minister said Pakistan  has not closed the border with Afghanistan, rather it has  reestablished it as the international border.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Following the decision to accept partial  liberalization of the Japanese rice market from 1995, the  Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry [AFFM] firmed up  its plan on 20 January to create a new emergency storage system,  designed to adjust supply and demand of rice over several years.  Unlike the current method, which includes rice in stock at the  end of the rice crop year in the supply plan of the following  year, the new system aims to flexibly adjust supply and demand,  and to deal with future rice shortages. Adjustment will be made  by combining foreign rice, which will be imported through  partial liberalization, and domestic rice. It seems that about  1.5 million tons of rice will be stored for sudden needs.  Decisions regarding the volume of rice in stock for emergency  needs, the method of operation, and other matters will be made  around this fall after discussions at an agricultural and  administrative council meeting, which will start as early as the  end of this month.    Currently, the AFFM is adjusting supply and demand of rice  through measures for reducing acreage of rice paddies. This is  a "method for maintaining the balance between demand and supply  for a single fiscal year." The ministry has been trying to  maintain about one million tons of rice in stock in preparation  for bad harvests. However, the limited effect of this system was  revealed when Japan had its record-breaking bad crop last year.  On the other hand, some people are worried that Japan will have  an excessive amount of rice because a certain volume of rice  will be imported for six years following the decision made at  last year's new multilateral trade negotiations (Uruguay Round)  to accept minimum access. Outlines of the AFFM's plan are: 1)  to store a certain amount of rice for emergency needs by  combining imported rice and domestic rice; 2) to store rice over  several years regardless of changes in volume of rice in storage  for emergency needs; and 3) to use rice for foreign aid and for  processing should the volume of rice in storage exceed a certain  level.</p>

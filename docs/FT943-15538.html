			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: ICI makes Malaysian disposal ICI is to sell its non-paint businesses in Malaysia to local managers for about Pounds 30m. The restructuring is part of ICI's strategy of concentrating on its core businesses and involves two parallel deals. ICI has a 50.1 per cent stake in the Chemical Company of Malaysia which has interests in industrial chemicals, fertilisers, agrochemicals and 50.1 per cent of ICI Paints Malaysia. ICI is selling its CCM stake to a management group for MDollars 206m (Pounds 51m). At the same time, it is paying MDollars 90m for 25.1 per cent of ICIPM, to add to a 34.9 per cent stake it owns directly. Both ICIPM and ICI's Malaysian operation are profitable, although ICI would not provide figures. The net effect is for ICI to have disposed of its non-paint businesses and increased its stake in the local paints operation from 50.1 per cent to 60 per cent. ICI's other Malaysian business, Tioxide, whose products are largely used in paints, is unaffected by the deal. Mr Iain Macfarlane, chairman of ICI's Malaysian operations, said the restructuring would allow his company and CCM to concentrate on their main business areas. 'Both groups will be able to grow their operations in a more sharply focused way.' ICI said it hoped that CCM would continue to sell ICI products. No decision had been taken on whether the roughly Pounds 30m cash generated would be repatriated or reinvested locally. The transactions are subject to approval by Malaysian regulatory authorities.</p>

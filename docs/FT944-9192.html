			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (2): Bankers breathe a little easier - The regulatory debate A year ago, the regulatory environment surrounding the derivatives business appeared fraught with danger for the banks and derivatives houses which were prospering from the surge in the market for derivative instruments. At the time, central banks and finance ministries were just beginning to come to terms with the growth of the derivatives business, and the possibility that this growth threatened the stability of the global financial system. As the inquiries into the business dug deeper, and the air thickened with warnings of impending catastrophe, Wall Street bankers trembled at the prospect of big regulatory guns being brought to bear on their market. Today, the regulatory climate has changed dramatically, and the bankers are breathing a little easier. Fears that various national and international authorities would impose strict new regulations on banks and securities firms' derivatives activities proved unfounded, and a consensus among regulators has been established. They now mostly agree that derivatives enable companies to better manage their financial risks and to lower the costs of their borrowings, and that new rules governing banks and securities firms' activities are unnecessary. Regulators believe that their attention is best focused on making sure that dealers and users of derivatives properly report, account for, and disclose the full extent of their activities, and that dealers have the capital to support their derivatives businesses and possess the appropriate systems to measure the risks they are taking. So close, in fact, have regulators in the US moved towards the industry position that derivatives play a positive role in business and finance, that they now stand side by side with the banks and securities houses against a common foe - Congress. The fear among US bankers and regulators alike is that if lawmakers introduce legislation tightening federal regulation of derivatives dealers, the market's growth could be badly undermined. As Joseph Lynyak, head of the American Bar Association's banking committee on derivatives, says: 'The question is whether they (the legislators) are going to throw the baby out with the bath water, and perceive derivatives to be such a problem that they over-regulate the business to the point where they destroy the market.' Since the summer, regulators have been telling lawmakers at a series of Congressional hearings on derivatives that present regulation of the market is adequate, and that their efforts to improve self-regulation within the derivatives business is preferable to legislation that could lead to over-regulation. There is an ironic twist to the regulators' new, more conciliatory approach to derivatives. They have become more supportive of the derivatives community at a time when it has been struggling to overcome the debilitating impact of a reversal in interest rate trends worldwide and a loss of confidence by some derivatives users following a string of well-publicised losses and lawsuits - the sort of developments which in the past might have persuaded regulators to take immediate action to rein in banks and dealer firms' activities. It was the wave of bad publicity that swamped derivatives earlier this year which emboldened Congress to tackle the market head on. Over the summer, several influential lawmakers drafted legislation granting banking and securities industry authorities broad new regulatory powers over the derivatives market. Although regulatory officials have already said they are opposed to derivatives legislation, the leaders behind the various initiatives - including Henry Gonzalez, Jim Leach and Edward Markey, all senior members of important House of Representatives' banking and finance committees - appear determined to proceed with their efforts to tighten derivatives supervision when the new Congress convenes early next year. Their ambitions, however, are greeted with scepticism within the industry, which is adamantly opposed to any kind of legislation. Of the lawmakers' plans for 1995, Robert Bench, managing partner for Price Waterhouse's regulatory advisory practice in Washington, says: 'They are expected to reintroduce legislation in the new Congress, but what's curious about it is that there does not seem to be any support for legislation beyond (a few) individuals.' While the regulatory community in the US has been opposing attempts on Capitol Hill to introduce new rules for derivatives, it has also been busy promoting better self-regulation among derivatives dealers and users by drafting recommendations for improving reporting, accounting and disclosure standards within the industry. Among the authorities that have issued recommendations along these lines, or that have begun inquiries into derivatives disclosure, are the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the Treasury's bank regulating arm), the Securities and Exchange Commission (which oversees securities firms), the Commodity Futures Trade Commission (which regulates exchange-traded derivatives), and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (which wants companies to disclose more about their derivatives holdings). Of the SEC and CFTC's investigations of derivatives, Mr Bench says: 'The degree to which the inquiries may lead to, if not necessarily legislation then some kind of defining regulation, remains to be seen.' Mr Lynyak, however, believes the regulators will continue to favour a policy of self-regulation. 'What you are going to see is probably some minor accounting changes, clearly some securities disclosure changes, and some capital requirements arising from the Basle committee.' The Basle committee of the Bank for International Settlements, meanwhile, is at the heart of international efforts to improve regulation, reporting and risk management in the derivatives business. In July, the Basle committee and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) jointly issued guide lines stressing sound internal risk management for derivatives trading by banks and securities firms, and last month the Basle committee weighed in again on the need for dealers to disclose more about the various risks inherent in their derivatives activities, and on the need for dealers to maintain up-to-date systems for measuring those risks. The Basle committee's work with IOSCO is part of a co-operative effort among international regulators to align reporting, accounting, disclosure and capital standards worldwide. Yet, establishing widely-recognised international standards is one of the toughest tasks facing the industry. Inevitably, different national regulators have different views on how to respond to growth in the derivatives market. At a recent IOSCO meeting in Tokyo, for example, clear policy differences emerged between the regulators in Japan, which want tighter supervision of the market, and those in the US and the UK, which do not want to impede international capital flows or financial markets' innovation and favour a lighter tough at the controls. Arthur Levitt, chairman of the SEC, hinted at the exasperation that the more laisser-faire oriented regulators were feeling in Tokyo when he said: 'There's greater progress being made in other countries, and I wish we could all get in the same place at the same time.'</p>

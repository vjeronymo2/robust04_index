			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Early hurricane claims to Lloyd's put at Pounds 500m LOSSES FROM Hurricane Andrew are expected to cost the Lloyd's non-marine underwriters less than Pounds 500m, a senior underwriter said yesterday. Mr George Lloyd-Roberts, chairman of the Lloyd's Non-marine Underwriters' Association, said overall insured losses on land from the hurricane, which late last month devastated parts of Florida and Louisiana, would probably amount to between Dollars 7bn (Pounds 3.55bn) and Dollars 8bn. Losses offshore, sustained as a result of damage to oil rigs, for example, will also affect Lloyd's, although marine underwriters have yet to provide estimates of potential losses. Although reinsurers are likely to pay Dollars 6bn of the loss, Lloyd's underwriters are expecting to pay no more than 15 per cent of that amount, leaving them with maximum losses of Dollars 900m. Mr Lloyd-Roberts said Lloyd's was less exposed to Hurricane Andrew than it was to Hurricane Hugo, which caused claims of more than Dollars 5bn in 1989. US insurers had bought less reinsurance after rate increases. In addition, the spiral reinsurance market, in which Lloyd's syndicates and companies reinsure each other's high-level catastrophe exposures, had collapsed. The market would be able to gauge the extent of claims from Andrew much more quickly than with Hurricane Hugo. 'We're looking at a finite situation,' Mr Lloyd-Roberts said. 'We know how much reinsurance the US companies have bought.' By September 9, London market reinsurers had paid claims of Dollars 152m. Lloyd's underwriters had paid out Dollars 72.96m. Lloyd's said yesterday it hoped that 'loss review' investigations into syndicates that were overwhelmed by claims from Hurricane Hugo and other catastrophes between 1987 and 1990 might be ready in the next few weeks. A loss review team investigating the losses of two of those syndicates - 216 and 833/834, which were managed by the Devonshire agency - issued an interim report last month. The report said that Names - the individuals whose assets support Lloyd's underwriting - on syndicate 216 had already received cash calls amounting to Pounds 56.86m for 1989 and Pounds 14.14m for 1990, while those on syndicate 833/834 had been asked to pay Pounds 21.73m in 1989 and Pounds 11.04m in 1990. Separately, the Lloyd's council has approved new regulations that will allow syndicates to make greater use of quota share reinsurance bought from outside the Lloyd's market. Syndicates will be able to underwrite up to 125 per cent of their premium income limit (the maximum amount of premiums they are allowed to underwrite) if they have re-insurance in place to cover all premiums above 100 per cent. The arrangement will allow syndicates to underwrite more business at a time of rising premium rates.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Prof. Dr. Zdravko Sancevic, Croatian </F> ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina, by Salih Zvizdic; place and  date not given: "If I Did Not Have Faith in the Alliance with  the Muslims, I Would Not Be Ambassador"]    [Text] The Croatian ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Prof. Dr. Zdravko Sancevic, says that he has an intimate  knowledge of Bosnia. Not only does he easily bandy about  historical data; more importantly, he is also completely  familiar with the people and customs there. He was born 62 years  ago in the town of Crkveni, near Teslic, in the Usore valley, to  a large family in which the father was an industrialist in the  lumber business and a Croat HSS [Croatian Peasants Party]  politician. In 1945, he and his father had to flee to Austria by  way of Bleiburg, then to Italy, and finally to the United States  and Venezuela. He ended up studying geology in the United  States, after which he was chosen to be a professor at a  university in Caracas.    After 1945, he first traveled to Croatia in 1990 at the  invitation of President Tudjman, and afterward he returned to  Venezuela where he was elected chairman of the HDZ [Croatian  Democratic Community] Coordinating Committee for Venezuela and  South America. His second trip to Croatia was in August 1992,  when he reported as a volunteer for the National Guard Corps.  Since September 1992, he has been the ambassador of the Republic  of Croatia to Bosnia-Herzegovina. He is married and has eight  children, and his family lives in Venezuela, where they all own  property and have jobs.    He tells me that the wartime conditions in  Bosnia-Herzegovina thwarted his efforts to locate the embassy in  Sarajevo back in September 1992, and in Mostar later on, so that  the Croatian Embassy was opened in Medjugorje in August 1993. He  would like to move with the embassy to Sarajevo as soon as  possible.    He comments briefly on the visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina  by the Turkish and Pakistani prime ministers, Tansu Ciller and  Benazir Bhutto.    [Sancevic] It is clear that the Islamic countries are  interested in everything that is going on in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  and that they want to see things firsthand, to talk with the top  people. These are normal contacts between countries, although in  this case the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina does not exist in the  form in which it is internationally recognized; rather, it  exists under extremely complex conditions.    [Zvizdic] How was the declaration received in  Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Sancevic] It is hard to speak on behalf of all of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, because there are three sides.    [Zvizdic] I mean representatives of the Bosnjak-Muslim  republic, which has been generally accepted as the territorial  designation for one of the three sides ever since President  Tudjman's peace initiative in Bonn.    [Sancevic] The Muslims, some of whom call themselves  Bosnjaks, have not constituted their republic because they  contend that they are the inheritors of the international rights  of all of Bosnia-Herzegovina. You see, these Muslims, or  Bosnjaks, had almost no public reaction to the Geneva  Declaration, because they too are negotiating with the Serbs. If  Izetbegovic signed an agreement with Krajisnik saying that the  Serbs can secede after two years, then things are clear,  although later there were various interpretations of that  agreement coming from the Muslim side, and even rejection of the  Serbs' right to secede. This comes as no surprise to people who  know the situation, because there are several political factions  in the Muslim ranks.    [Zvizdic] Can you identify the factions?    [Sancevic] It is no secret that the line represented by  Ganic  is absolutely opposed to anything that smells of an alliance  with the Croats. That is the Sandzak hard line.    [Zvizdic] Does that mean that it is pro-Serb?    [Sancevic] I would rather not get into that, because that  calls for lengthy elaboration, but I know that it is not  pro-Croat. On the other hand, there is the Haris Silajdzic  faction that previously demonstrated a partiality for the West,  the Croats, and Croatia. However, in recent times that faction  has become rather radicalized in a negative sense toward Croatia.    [Zvizdic] What caused that?    [Sancevic] I think that everyone in Sarajevo is surprised by  the tenacity of the defense in central Bosnia, because they  expected those Croat enclaves to fall. This was followed by  those charges of involvement by the Croatian Armed Forces [HV],  but I would rather not go into that because those are military  affairs. There is also a third faction, the mojahedin one, which  is the most radical one, although perhaps not numerically large,  but it is aggressive, violent.    [Zvizdic] Who heads up that faction?    [Sancevic] Look, with these "secret" movements and  organizations, it is hard to decidedly name the actual leader,  especially in a situation where a significant share of the  Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina do not support mojahedin  radicalism. Moreover, the majority of Islamic countries, no  matter how strange it may seem to some people, are rigorously  opposed to extremists, energetically fighting the  mojahedin-fundamentalist faction in their own states. But I  maintain that this faction exists in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and it  will impose itself on others, with more or less success.    [Zvizdic] Is there also an Alija Izetbegovic faction, or is  Izetbegovic's policy the end product of all these factions?    [Sancevic] It is clearly not an end product, but rather the  political acrobatics of accommodation, because Izetbegovic is  first with this faction, then with another, and then with a  third. That is the source of the elements of inconsistency in  his policy and of his positions in general on a number of issues  in Bosnia-Herzegovina and beyond. There have been so many times  that he has refuted his own words as a result of the momentary  power of individual factions.    [Zvizdic] What about the Muslim armed forces? Toward whom do  they lean?    [Sancevic] Everything about the armed forces is extremely  complicated for all three sides, because in some places the  Croats and Muslims are allies in the war against the Serbs, in  some places they are fighting each other, while in other places  there is Croat collusion with the Serbs but also fighting  between the Croat and Serbs. It is a rather complex situation,  with "dog eat dog" being the prevailing rule, but I still think  that Izetbegovic has strong influence over his armed forces,  although it is clear that some local commanders do not listen to  him.   <H5>    People Never See Most of the Dollars </H5>   [Zvizdic] Where are the Muslims getting arms and ammunition?    [Sancevic] Such matters belong in the military domain, but  it  is possible to say a little something. There are several sources  of arms: First, there was plenty left behind in the depots of  the former Territorial Defense; second, a significant number of  arms and ammunition factories are located on territory held by  the Muslims (Konjic, Bugojno, Travnik and Novi Travnik, Zenica,  Tuzla); third, the Croats have given the Muslims a lot of  weapons; fourth, the Muslims are buying weapons from various  sources, inside the country and beyond, because when someone has  money they can buy and acquire anything. It should not be  forgotten that the Muslim side is getting very valuable aid in  dollars from Islamic countries and other sources, and that the  people never see most of this money; rather, it remains abroad  where it is spent for war purposes.    [Zvizdic] What is your current assessment of the balance of  power among the belligerents in Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Sancevic] I would say that the Serbs, who have achieved the  most militarily, have achieved everything that they set out to  achieve, and now they would rather not be fighting, preferring a  political resolution according to their criteria. The Croats are  also for a political resolution because they have a realistic  assessment of the situation. The most absurd thing is that the  militarily weakest side, the Muslim one, wants a military  resolution, which Izetbegovic declares publicly--they want war!  That is why they need weapons, because they have the people.  Most of the Muslims' military forces are concentrated in Zenica,  15 km from Vitez, Busovaca, in other words central Bosnia. Their  people are dying, but new people are continuously arriving. Not  too much value is attached to human life there, especially among  the mojahedin, who are fighting in the belief that if they die  while fighting for a holy cause, they will live in paradise in  the hereafter.   <H5>    Croats Not Indifferent About Border </H5>   [Zvizdic] It is being said in the foreign press and in the  Sarajevo media that an alliance between the Serbs and Croats in  the war against the Muslims was agreed to in the Geneva  Declaration.    [Sancevic] Any affirmative response to that rumor would draw  into question the consistency of President Tudjman's policy,  would mean that that policy is hypocritical. And that is not  true! No one has forced me to follow President Tudjman's policy;  rather, I accept that policy as my own conviction, because I am  convinced that that policy regarding Bosnia is fully justified.  The Croats have agreed to all previous international options on  resolving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, from the Cutileiro  proposal to the Owen-Stoltenberg plan, but agreements have  faltered primarily on the issue of territory. The military  situation today is such that the Serbs have pushed the Muslims  out of eastern Bosnia, the Muslims are pushing the Croats out of  central Bosnia, so that the Croat resistance to a further loss  of territory is understandable. They cannot be indifferent to  whether their border with the Bosnjak-Muslim republic, if that  is what we call it, is at Lasva or at the upper Vrbas or at the  lower Neretva, i.e., at the sea. The Muslims are insistently  demanding an outlet on the sea, and a lot of the process has  gotten stuck on that point.   <H5>    They Do Not Want the Sea for Swimming </H5>   [Zvizdic] Do you want to say anything else about this  demarcation?    [Sancevic] President Tudjman has said all this very clearly,  and he consistently puts forward these views, from the demand  that the primary goal is to save lives and the need for Croats  in Bosnia-Herzegovina to have their own territory, such as  Herceg-Bosna, to appreciation for the need to find solutions in  ethnically mixed areas--and the Croats are almost exclusively  mixed with Muslims--that will fully respect all the rights of  the three nations. According to the peace initiative that  President Tudjman put forward in Bonn, there is also the variant  of a federation or confederation with a possible Bosnjak-Muslim  republic, in which case issues concerning an outlet on the sea  would fall away, because everyone would have the same rights.    Izetbegovic does not accept that because he wants his own  outlet on the sea, but not in order to go swimming there, but  rather for strategic reasons. Fine, an outlet on the open seas  could, if necessary, be closed in terms of the adjacent Croatian  islands, but what will happen if some stronger force comes along  and wants to use this Muslim outlet on the sea, which must be  expected in a political-strategic sense! The situation with the  Sava basin is also complex.   <H5>    Corridor and Sava Basin </H5>   [Zvizdic] The biggest problem there concerns the Serb  corridor.    [Sancevic] There are people in the Sava basin and people  from  there who are now living elsewhere who think that everything  should be as they have conceived of it in their own heads.  Others have a realistic view of the situation there, while  others still are considering some sort of compromise.  Unfortunately, under certain other partition plans the Serbs  gained a corridor across the Sava basin, which is a jugular vein  for the so-called Serb republic and so-called Krajina, because  that is how the people, food, and weapons that Belgrade is  sending to Bosnia-Herzegovina and the occupied parts of Croatia  are passing. That corridor is wide at the western end, extending  from Doboj to Derventa and beyond to the Sava in the north; it  is narrowest at Brcko, and then widens again toward Bijeljina.    Aside from the Serb towns surrounding Brcko--Pelagicevo,  Zabare, and Obudovac--which the Serbs systematically settled  with soldiers from the Salonika front back in the first  Yugoslavia, and which they reinforced in the second Yugoslavia  in order to break up the Croat-Muslim majority there, Serbs are  in the minority in this region. The Muslims are in the majority  in Brcko, and all around there are plenty of Croat and Muslim  towns leading from Majevica toward Brcko.    It appears that they are holding open the prospect of the  so-called southern route if the Sava corridor does not work out.  However, that route passes over mountains, so that it is easier  to cut off, while the Sava route is on flat land and is much  more suitable to them.    [Zvizdic] After everything that has happened and is  happening, do you believe in some future alliance between the  Muslims and Croats?    [Sancevic] I firmly believe in it, because if I did not, I  would not be here, I would not be the ambassador. I declare to  you that all of President Tudjman's peace initiatives have  included the desire for an alliance between the Croats and  Muslims, because that alliance is in the interest of Croats from  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. That is the policy of the  Croatian leadership, and I am working on it as much as I can. I  also enjoy strong support in this, among other things, from the  Croats of Muslim faith and from the Muslims who through their  political convictions and party affiliation with the Croatian  Muslim Democratic Party and the Muslim Democratic Party for  Bosnia-Herzegovina clearly show that the SDA [Party of  Democratic Action] does not have a political monopoly among  adherents of the Muslim faith. My conviction in this regard is  very clear.   <H5>    Stalling the Investigation Is Also a Crime </H5>   [Zvizdic] What is your assessment of the threat of sanctions  by the UN Security Council?    [Sancevic] Confusion has arisen here surrounding sources of  information, because all the secret services are working to pick  up something and rush to announce it to their own people without  looking at the whole story. Croatia has asked and received  permission from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government to keep its  troops on Bosnia-Herzegovina soil in territory above Dubrovnik.  As far as the allegation that HV units are in central Bosnia is  concerned, that is a tall tale, because that conclusion cannot  be drawn on the basis of the fact that HV identification cards  were found on several captured HVO [Croat Defense Council]  soldiers, while Croatia has said publicly that there are  volunteers there who previously fought in HV units.    [Zvizdic] What is your interpretation of the tragedy at the  Sarajevo market?    [Sancevic] Regardless of the results of the investigation,  the crimes must be halted. Stalling the investigation, but also  stalling an end to the killing, is nothing other than an excuse  for the immorality of those who are conducting this  investigation and everything surrounding it at a snail's pace.  This is clearly not incidental, and that too is a crime.</p>

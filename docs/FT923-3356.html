			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Barclays to fight 'phantom' claims BARCLAYS BANK, the largest of the high street clearers, yesterday vowed to fight writs served on it alleging that its customers lost money through 'phantom' cash machine withdrawals, David Barchard writes. Five banks and building societies - Barclays, Midland, TSB, Nationwide Building Society and Lloyds - are named as defendants in an action brought by Mr Denis Whalley, a Merseyside solicitor. Midland and Lloyds confirmed they had received writs from Mr Whalley. Lloyds said it paid the disputed amount in one case, even though it would have preferred to go to the banking ombudsman.</p>

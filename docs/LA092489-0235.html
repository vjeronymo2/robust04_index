			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GOMEZ SURPRISES LENDL IN BARCELONA SEMIFINALS  </P> <P> Andres Gomez of Ecuador, ranked 30th in the world, upset Ivan Lendl, 1-6, 7-6  (7-5), 9-7, Saturday in the semifinals of a $500,000 tennis tournament at  Barcelona, Spain.  </P> <P> Lendl, ranked No. 1, made several unforced errors in key games in the second  and third sets. He was favored to win the clay-court tournament, which he won  in 1981 and 1982.  </P> <P> Gomez will face Horst Skoff of Austria in today's final. Skoff advanced by  beating Argentin's Alberto Mancini, 1-6, 6-2, 6-3.  </P> <P> Skoff reached the semifinals earlier Saturday by beating countryman Thomas  Munster, 6-4, 6-3, in a match that had been delayed by rain Friday.  </P> <P> Lendl started strongly, breaking Gomez three times in the first set. But after  losing his service early in the second set, Gomez broke back to pull even at  4-4 and hung on to force a tiebreaker. Lendl squandered three break points that  would have had him serving for the match.  </P> <P> Gomez won the tiebreaker, 7-5. In the final set, Lendl lost three service  games, the last of which gave Gomez an 8-7 lead.  </P> <P> Serving for the match, Gomez quickly led, 40-0. Lendl saved two match points  before Gomez hit a cross-court winner.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Martina Navratilova advanced to the final of a $250,000 tournament  in Dallas, easily defeating third-seeded Manuela Maleeva of Bulgaria, 6-2, 6-3.  Navratilova had beaten Maleeva, 6-0, 6-0, in the U.S. Open two weeks ago.  </P> <P> "I knew it wouldn't be love and love again; she was stepping into the ball and  taking it on the rise," Navratilova said. "And she served very well. My  first-serve percentage was quite high. She has a very good return of serve, and  I was able to keep her off balance, so that felt good."  </P> <P> Navratilova will meet Monica Seles of Yugoslavia for the first time tonight in  the final. Seles, 15, beat unseeded Anne Smith of Dallas in the other  semifinal, 6-1, 6-2.  </P></p>

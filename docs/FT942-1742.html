			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / French rail workers strike A strike by French rail workers against planned job cuts badly disrupted train services yesterday, and fewer than half the trains were running in many areas of the country, according to SNCF, the state railway company. The strike, which is due to last until this morning, forced the cancellation of most of the trains on the high-speed TGV network between Paris and the southeast, SNCF said. TGV traffic between Paris and the southwest was cut in half, while service to the north was normal. Commuter services into Paris were cut in half except from the eastern suburbs, where they were only slightly disrupted. The communist-led CGT union called the 34-hour strike. Another drivers' union, the FGAAC, backed the strike to demand talks on working conditions on the Channel tunnel line.</p>

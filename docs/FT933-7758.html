			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / International Equities: Mexican soft drinks bottler plans Dollars 150m global share offer COCA-COLA FEMSA, the Mexican soft drinks bottler, is hoping to raise up to Dollars 150m from domestic and international investors with a share offering. The company is a joint venture between FEMSA, Mexico's largest beverage company, and the Coca-Cola Company, which acquired a 30 per cent equity stake in the company in April 1993 for Dollars 195m. FEMSA is reducing its stake in the venture from 70 per cent to 51 per cent by offering 19 per cent (equivalent to 82m shares) to the public. About 20 per cent of the shares (16.4m of common stock) will be offered to domestic investors, while 4.9m American depositary shares (ADSs) or 60 per cent of the stake will be offered in the US. The remaining 20 per cent or 1.64m ADSs will be offered to European investors. Each ADS represents 10 Series L shares and will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, while the Series L shares will be listed on the Mexican exchange. The indicated pricing is Dollars 17 to Dollars 19 per ADS. Bear Stearns is global co-ordinator for the offering. FEMSA had already indicated that it would separate the soft drinks division from the rest of the company once the Coca-Cola transaction was completed. Coca-Cola said yesterday it had signed a letter of intent for a joint venture Dollars 30m bottling plant in the city of Wuhan in the Hubei province of China, Reuter reports from New York.</p>

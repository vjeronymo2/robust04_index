			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Sheriff recovers to Pounds 465,000 SHERIFF HOLDINGS, the USM-quoted plant hire group, reported pre-tax profits sharply higher at Pounds 465,000, compared with Pounds 161,000, in the six months to March 31. The shares closed 11p higher at 111p. The result - achieved on turnover ahead 21 per cent at Pounds 5.7m - was achieved by strict financial control of the core business and recent acquisitions, said Mr Richard Dunn, chairman. In December, the group raised Pounds 2.85m net of new equity and this, together with strong cash generation, virtually eliminated borrowings at the half year, said Mr Dunn. Gearing at March 31 was 2 per cent, compared with 48 per cent six months earlier. The interim dividend is raised from 1p to 1.25p, payable from earnings per share of 3.5p (1.7p).</p>

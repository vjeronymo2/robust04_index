			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Nasa lost in space THE NASA scientists listening with increasing desperation for radio signals from their Mars Observer spacecraft realise that much more is at stake than the Dollars 1bn mission to study the red planet. Failure to make contact with the silent probe would be a crushing blow to future missions to Mars, which had been designed to use Observer for communications and/or for spotting promising places to land on the planet's surface. More generally, an Observer write-off, following a string of other technical and managerial disasters, would raise the most fundamental questions about the US space agency and the management of its Dollars 14bn-a-year budget. Nasa's morale has never fully recovered from the 1986 Challenger disaster. The manned shuttle programme is still plagued with technical problems. Several scientific missions, including the Hubble space telescope, are performing below par. And poor leadership has left Nasa's plans to build an orbiting space station in disarray; Congress may yet kill the project. One part of the agency is still running well, its public relations. But even a PR machine that makes the most of every opportunity - for example, trumpeting fuzzy pictures from the space telescope as breakthroughs in our understanding of the universe - cannot disguise the fact that Nasa needs radical reform. The problem is that the gung-ho Nasa of the 1960s, geared up to beat the Soviets to the moon and then the planets, has grown into an elaborate bureaucracy. Its senior managers, including several astronauts from the glory days, tend to be more interested in running multi-billion dollar mega-projects than cost-effective scientific missions. The emphasis is on technology rather than science. Radical solutions Given the reality of Washington politics, the most radical solutions are not feasible. It might make sense, for example, to remove the space science activities, such as observatories and planetary exploration, from Nasa and fold them into the National Science Foundation. Nasa would then be responsible for manned activities - the shuttle and science station - and for promoting space technology. But the agency has too many defenders, in congress and the aerospace industry, who would fight to prevent anything that looked like a break-up. So the overhaul has to take place within Nasa's current boundaries. The first requirement is to make sure that space exploration is really led by science rather than the internal agenda of Nasa managers. That means giving scientists outside the agency, particularly from universities, more say in its programmes. The practical result is likely to be a larger number of smaller, more flexible - and more imaginative - missions than Nasa is planning today. International plans Secondly, Nasa must change its mentality more quickly from a national space agency to a partner in international programmes. Progress is being made. This summer a three-way collaborative project was announced: a gamma-ray observatory called Integral that will carry a US instrument on a European satellite, to be launched by a Russian rocket in 2001. It is the first mission designed from the start to involve Nasa, western Europe and Russia. More would be welcome. The European Space Agency's science programme, known as Horizon 2000, is indeed looking increasingly attractive to some Americans as a model for Nasa. Although a dozen European nations are involved, Horizon 2000 is less bureaucratic than Nasa's big-is-best space science programme, and it is more open to outside participation. Another great advantage is that Esa projects, once approved, have far more stability of funding than similar Nasa missions, which suffer frequently in Washington's annual budget battles. If Observer remains lost in space, the lesson will not be to give up missions to Mars but to stop putting Dollars 1bn into a single interplanetary basket. Indeed the likely scientific dividends would justify sending an international fleet of spacecraft to observe all the planets in our solar system. But they need not be grandiose Nasa-style craft.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Danish tax minister resigns Mr Ole Stavad, the Danish Social Democrat minister of taxation, resigned yesterday when he accepted responsibility for a controversial rescue action for a Jutland bank in 1993. He was replaced by another Social Democrat, Mr Carsten Koch, an economist with a career in the labour movement. Mr Stavad has been under pressure to resign since his officials agreed, and he approved, a tax write-off which was demanded by a Jutland savings bank, Sparekassen Nordjylland, as the price for taking over most of the assets of Himmerlandsbanken, which serves the town of Hobro, in Mr Stavad's constituency. A recent report from a judicial inquiry confirmed that officials involved had acted illegally.</p>

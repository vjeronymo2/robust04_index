			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil surges 8 per cent Shares in Sao Paulo ended 7.9 per cent stronger after heavy trade spurred by optimism over the government's anti-inflation plan, which includes the adoption of a new currency, and strong overseas buying. The Bovespa index surged 2,127 to 29,087. Turnover came to Cr502.4bn. A broker said many foreign investors rushed to the cash market after the Bovespa futures index broke the 30,700-point resistance level. Food, retail, beverage, clothing and state blue chips led the rally. Analysts said the July 1 introduction of the new currency, the real, is expected to sharply reduce Brazil's 45 per cent monthly inflation, paving the way for a surge in consumer spending. Brokers observed that investor sentiment was also helped by reports at the weekend that Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the current economy minister and a presidential candidate, had seen an improvement in his standing in opinion polls. Salomon Brothers, in a recent commentary, noted that the possibility of a victory in the October elections by the left-wing candidate Mr Luiz Inacio da Silva could not be ruled out, but placed the possibility of a Cardoso victory at around 55 per cent.</p>

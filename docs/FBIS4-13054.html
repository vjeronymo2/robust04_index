			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi </F> Beilin, in Oman, by Ya'el Dan in Israel -- live]    [Excerpt] [Dan] Where are we catching you? Are you  finished with the first day of deliberations or are you still in  the middle of it?    [Beilin] The first day of deliberations is actually over.    [Dan] How were you impressed by the statements made at the  opening session, particularly the remarks of the Omani foreign  minister? Do you think they are important?    [Beilin] Yes, definitely. I think the Omani foreign  minister's remarks reflected how vastly interested the Gulf  countries are in the water issue. It is not just another topic  of discussion, but a critical issue to their future. They spend  a fortune on water, and they definitely want to make every  possible effort to increase their water resources and lower  desalination costs. In this respect, the conference here is  very important. Oman has been subjected to the criticism of  several Arab countries which were not thrilled about Qatar and  Oman hosting such conferences. The Omani foreign minister  defended the hosting of the conference and spoke in very  positive terms about the political process in the Middle East  and the wish to put an end to the Israeli-Arab conflict and  bring about normalization.    [Dan] Could you tell us what happened today? How much  progress did you make?    [Beilin] Today we heard statements by individual and blocs  of countries about specific projects in the region. Although we  are talking about small-scale projects, I believe these  deliberations will for the first time culminate in concrete  agreements about new projects and their financing. Oman  proposed to concentrate all worldwide information about water  desalination in Muscat, seeing that it conducted a very secret  study on the issue. I think this proposal will meet with  unanimous approval. In any case, we have already expressed our  consent.    The Palestinians raised the question of a water authority in  the context of the Oslo agreement, and we expressed our consent  to this matter as well, as long as the authority remains within  this context and the multilateral forum [sentence as heard].  The Europeans and the Americans specifically mentioned several  projects which could be executed shortly. We proposed to  discuss projects dealing with water saving and the prevention of  leaks from water mains. The general atmosphere is very positive  and everybody has remarked on the positive attitude of the  participants toward the issues raised so far. At this point,  there has not been even a trace of confrontation, contrary to  previous conferences which there fraught with very high tension.    [Dan] I would like to confirm that I understood you  correctly. Did you definitely say that Israel agreed to the  establishment of an independent Palestinian water authority? To  the best of our knowledge, Israel has so far opposed such a move.    [Beilin] Israel agreed in principle -- and this is also  stipulated in the Oslo agreement -- to the establishment of  Palestinian authorities within the framework of the Declaration  of Principles [DOP] signed on 13 September 1993. In their  statements this morning, the Palestinians asserted that their  water authority conforms with the criteria spelled out in the  DOP. The moment they clarified this, we expressed our consent  to such an authority. [passage omitted]</p>

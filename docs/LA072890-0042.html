			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COURT EXTENDS ORDER TO STOP HARASSMENT  </P> <P> A Superior Court commissioner Friday extended for three years a restraining  order that prohibits a woman from harassing Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike  Antonovich and his family.  </P> <P> Antonovich had obtained a temporary restraining order against Eileen Kristovich  on July 6 after he accused her of threatening to kill him, his sister and his  sister's family.  </P> <P> The supervisor and Kristovich met many years ago when their parents were  business partners. In the past, Antonovich complained in court papers,  Kristovich has followed him on dates, dumped red paint on his car and damaged  it with a can opener.  </P> <P> Commissioner Virginia Chernack signed papers forbidding Kristovich from  threatening Antonovich and his family, following them or calling them. She also  must not go within 100 yards of their homes, places of work or school.  </P> <P> Antonovich did not attend the court hearing in Burbank, but his sister,  Madeline Pangborn, and her two daughters did. No one testified during the  proceeding, which lasted no more than two minutes. Pangborn declined to comment  after the hearing.  </P> <P> Kristovich was admitted to a psychiatric ward at County-USC Medical Center  after allegedly making the death threat to Pangborn on July 2. She has since  been released.  </P></p>

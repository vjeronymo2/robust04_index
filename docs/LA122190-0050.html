			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAPPY SAILORS RETURN FROM DUTY IN GULF  </P> <P> After weeks in the suffocating heat of the Persian Gulf, a bit of cold rain in  San Diego Bay hardly bothered the sea-weary sailors lining the deck of the  Independence -- the biggest of four Navy ships to arrive in Southern California  Thursday from duty in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> "It could be snowing here in San Diego for all I care," said radioman Alonzo  Sims, wet and shivering in a stiff wind. "This is just the happiest day of my  life. I'm like a kid at Christmas. I'm just so glad to be home."  </P> <P> The aircraft carrier, with 5,100 sailors on board, slipped into its Coronado  berth as more than 1,500 wives, mothers, fathers and children waited in the  foul weather, clenching welcome-home banners and tissues for wiping away  raindrops and tears.  </P> <P> Up the coast in Long Beach, the weather was better for the return of the guided  missile cruiser Antietam, one of the first ships into the Persian Gulf last  August after Iraq's takeover of Kuwait. No rain awaited, just crisp cold and a  Santa Claus -- not that any of the sailors needed a reminder that they had made  it home for Christmas.  </P> <P> "This is the best Christmas there could ever be," said Chief Petty Officer Greg  Gimber, holding his 8-week-old daughter, Laken, for the first time.  </P> <P> Both ships are among the first to return to port from gulf duty. Also docking  in San Diego Thursday were the Jouett and the Reasoner, both part of battle  group Delta with the Independence.  </P> <P> The 80,000-ton Independence became the first U.S. aircraft carrier since 1974  to operate inside the Arabian Gulf when it passed through the Strait of Hormuz  on Oct. 2. It left the Middle East in November.  </P> <P> "We were looking over our shoulder all the way back," ship supply officer  Lonnie Mitchell said as he held three long-stem roses -- one each for his wife  and daughters. "We knew we were in the world's biggest hot spot. Ask anybody  here and they'll tell you we thought . . . all hell was going to break loose  with us sitting right in the middle of it."  </P> <P> Instead, the Independence crew spent many weeks languishing in the Gulf of  Oman, out of sight of land. On some days the heat made the carrier's black deck  feel like a big, iron griddle.  </P> <P> "Some days it was 114 degrees on that deck. If you touched it, it scorched your  hand," said Marine Lance Cpl. Steve Allen of Garyburg, N.C. "It got so bad,  nobody wanted to go up on deck. But every day, the Marines were out there doing  our exercises."  </P> <P> When the Independence left San Diego in June, it was for a five-month  deployment in the Indian Ocean. But the Kuwait invasion extended the tour.  After the ship finally left the gulf, time seemed to drag as it neared home.  </P> <P> "The hours go slower because you're looking forward to being home so much,"  said Ed (Dino) DiNatale. "I became a clock watcher. We all did."  </P> <P> On the Independence deck, with the carrier in sight of the San Diego skyline,  sailors began revealing their shore plans.  </P> <P> Blake Brown, 20, of Columbus, Ohio, planned to spend his leave with his  girlfriend. "We're going to check into a hotel in San Diego," Brown said.  "During the next 10 days we might see the light of day -- but I doubt it."  </P> <P> Below deck in the carrier's hangar, 50 anxious men had thoughts of babies on  their minds -- the children born during their absence. It is the ship's custom  to let them off first.  </P> <P> Russell McKamey, 31, stood anxiously in line with gifts he had bought for his  new son. A counselor told him to expect the baby to cry because he was used to  being in the arms of his mother.  </P> <P> "I don't care if he cries," McKamey said. "I'm going to hold him and squeeze  him. Then I'm going to squeeze my wife until she cries. Then I'm going to cry.  We'll all cry together."  </P> <P> When the ship docked, McKamey and the other new fathers splashed through  puddles to reach their families. A strapping man who stands taller than  6-foot-4, McKamey embraced his wife and swung her off her feet.  </P> <P> Then he placed her back on earth and gently touched her chin. But he could  manage only three words which he whispered in her ear. She smiled and hugged  him back. "I know," she said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Roxana Kopetman contributed to this story, reporting from  Long Beach.  </P></p>

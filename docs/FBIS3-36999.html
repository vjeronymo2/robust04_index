			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, 13 Feb -- Slobodan Milosevic, president of  Serbia, received Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the president  of Russia and deputy minister of foreign affairs of the Russian  Federation, today. Ways of stopping the civil war in Bosnia and  Herzegovina and achieving a political solution of the crisis  were discussed during the meeting. In this connection, the  common opinion was expressed that the defusing of the situation  in and around Sarajevo would be an important contribution to  resolving this task. This would help remove the danger of  foreign military intervention and the escalation of military  actions fraught with serious consequences for peace and  stability in the whole region. It was pointed out during the  conversation that the recent decision by NATO on the possibility  of air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions would damage the  Bosnian talks' process. Both sides stressed that a political  framework for the Bosnian settlement is the only sensible path  to peace and stability in this region and there is no  alternative to this path.    At a meeting with Russian journalists in Belgrade, Vitaliy  Churkin stressed that the main task of his new trip to the  republics of the former Yugoslavia is to prevent strikes against  the positions of the Bosnian Serbs. With this objective, he  intends in the next few days to visit Zagreb, and also the  Serbian and, possibly, Muslim parts of Sarajevo in order to  study the situation there first hand and to find out the  opinions of the UN forces command. The Russian diplomat  pointed, in particular, to the need to learn such an important  detail as the deployment of the sides' heavy artillery. NATO, he  said, is demanding the withdrawal of the Serbian artillery 20 km  from Sarajevo, but the Serbian side states it has reached an  agreement with Yasusi Akashi, the UN Secretary General's special  envoy in the former Yugoslavia, not on a withdrawal but on the  transfer of its artillery over to the control of the "blue  berets". The Serbian side says that the reason for this is that  otherwise it may be left without means of self-defense, which  may be used to their advantage by the Muslim formations who are  in larger numbers.    It is also necessary to raise the question of stepping up  the  work of the international commission to investigate the recent  tragic incident in the Sarajevan market, V. Churkin went on. It  is an unacceptable situation where everyone is outraged, but  emotions hold sway over the facts and no one knows who is  responsible for the mass deaths of innocent civilians. In his  opinion, if it can be established that it was not the Serbs who  did this, then this may affect progress in the negotiations  process, since the Muslim side would have to go back on its  extreme demands and come to an understanding.    The Russian diplomat welcomed a greater degree of  involvement  of the United States in the process of the Bosnian settlement,  because a major lever has thus appeared for putting pressure on  the Muslim side and drawing it towards peace accords. He also  advocated a realistic approach in terms of not asking too much  from the Serb side. Bosnian Serbs have already made major  concessions, agreeing first to ensure that Muslims have 30  percent, now put up to 33.3 percent of the territory of Bosnia  and Herzegovina, he said. They have no more flexibility left,  and only a new, more acceptable for all sides "geometry of the  territorial division" can be now discussed.    Asked by ITAR-TASS whether Russia possesses at present  political implements that would stop NATO from strikes against  positions of Bosnian Serbs, Vitaliy Churkin said that the West  is attempting to interpret in its own way texts of previous  resolutions of the UN Security Council on Bosnia, claiming that  NATO can act without a further discussion in the Security  Council. We believe that such a crucial step must be discussed.  In fact, the West began acting through NATO, rather than  through the UN, fearing a Russian veto. I have an impression,  however, that nobody has an interest in seeing the situation  aggravated, and a peaceful settlement will be reached, the  Russian diplomat said in conclusion.</p>

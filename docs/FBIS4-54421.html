			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 28 April (MTI) -- The Hungarian  Democratic Forum (MDF) does not wish to deceive voters, which is  why it clearly states the political forces with which it  definitely does not wish to enter into a coalition, under any  circumstances, Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross, deputy  chairman of the MDF, said on Thursday [28 April], at an election  rally held in Budapest.    Among these forces, Boross mentioned the Hungarian Socialist  Party (MSZP) in the first place, and said the Socialists  themselves had firmly ruled out the MDF a few days ago. The MDF  also does not want to enter into a coalition with an Alliance of  Free Democrats (SZDSZ) that is directed by the SZDSZ's strong  core in Budapest, and which is moving closer to its one-time  enemy, the former communists (the MSZP), Boross said.    The prime minister discussed in detail farming and industry.  He also said that debt servicing, and external circumstances  such as the collapse of the Soviet Union and its insolvency, the  global recession, and the Balkan war have held Hungary back,  falling short of results hoped for in the MDF's 1990 program.</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS 'OPINION DEFENSE' IN LIBEL CASES  </P> <P> In response to "Is It Opinion or Is It Fact?" editorial, June 23:  </P> <P> This letter is from one who seldom reads Times' editorials because of their  liberal bias and slanted opinions.  </P> <P> Your use of such inflammatory and one-sided words in this editorial as though  they were true illustrates my point: "huge setback;" "astonishing  recklessness;" "ignored the standard;" "chilling;" "chaos and contradiction."  </P> <P> It would appear that your mean position, far from a noble cry of protection of  free speech, is in reality the whine of a culprit who has with impunity defamed  the innocent with words that "imply an assertion of objective fact."  </P> <P> It is now time to be more careful, sensitive and fair.  </P> <P> LARRY L.J. THORP  </P> <P> Upland  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Gasoline Price Rises: The price of regular unleaded gasoline rose an average of  0.7 cent a gallon -- from $1.359 to $1.366 -- in the past week, the American  Automobile Assn. said. It will rise more if retailers begin passing on a new  5-cent-a-gallon tax to motorists, the association added. The federal excise tax  will go from 9 cents a gallon to 14 cents Saturday.  </P></p>

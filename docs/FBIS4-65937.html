			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jens Eckhardt: "Fear for Jobs; U.S. Central </F> Bank Signals Temporary Breather"]    [Text] After three timid quarter-percent hikes of  short-term interest rates, the U.S. Federal Reserve--as  expected--strongly raised both the federal funds rate and the  discount rate by half a percentage point, as was done the last  time five years ago. Many large banks reacted immediately by  hiking their prime rate to which most private adjustable  interest rate loans are linked. While the markets on Wall Street  celebrated the interest rate raise as the last parity change for  the time being with a strong rise in stock prices, the dollar  remained surprisingly weak.    Voices warning about a return to growing unemployment are  getting louder. Indeed, there are hardly any statistics that  justify a hike in interest rates in the United States at a time  when they are dropping in other countries, especially Germany.  Neither prices nor wages are rising unduly, the overheated  growth of the fourth quarter is already cooling off perceptibly,  and tight industrial capacities are still not in sight. Rather,  only Wall Street and the Federal Reserve heard dissonant  inflation melodies, which completely upset their elegant  interest rate and course tango of recent years. As the markets  see it, the Federal Reserve at first moved too soon with its  interest steps, and then not fast enough. It appears that with  the latest move, the Fed and security markets are again in step,  at least temporarily.    The consequences for the economy, however, cannot yet be  foreseen. In the last months, the rates for long-term fixed  mortgages rose by two full percentage points. The prime rate,  officially the standard interest rate for short-term loans to  major businesses, which today is of much greater importance as  the computation basis for adjustable interest loans, climbed  from 6 to 7.25 percent. The number of refinancings of old  mortgages recently dropped steeply, and new real estate loans  became so expensive that tens of thousands of home buyers were  forced out of the market. The predictions for construction of  new homes this year have already been corrected downward, and  there are long faces among furniture and home appliance  manufacturers.    How long the Fed will be able to pursue its course, shifted  from "stimulative" to "economy-neutral," depends on various  factors. About four-fifths of economic activities in the United  States are private, the rest are governmental. In view of the  fact that the government share, which strongly expanded in the  1980's, has been shrinking since 1991, economic development more  than ever depends on private enterprise, and hence especially on  private households. These already suffer from the continued  downsizing in many companies, and are now additionally facing  higher loan interest rates. At the moment, nobody knows how this  will further dampen employment.    Also uncomfortable is the weak reaction of the foreign  exchange markets which assessed the value of the dollar lower,  despite the opposite interest rate moves in Germany and the  United States. The threat from this side, which might force the  Fed into further interest rate hikes, has not yet been averted.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Lucas and Sagem link LUCAS Industries and Sagem, the French defence, telecommunications, electronics and motor components group, are forming a joint venture aimed at capturing 10 per cent of Europe's Pounds 900m-a-year petrol engine management systems market, John Griffiths writes. Tighter exhaust emissions controls and the development of technically more advanced car engines are seen by the partners as giving the potential for engine management systems to become one of the fastest growing automotive components sectors. Lucas also said last night it was undertaking its first motor components venture in eastern Europe, a Czech manufacturing operation which would initially produce braking systems for car maker VW-Skoda.</p>

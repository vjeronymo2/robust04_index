			<p>BFN     [Text] Grigoriy Karasin, an official representative of the  Russian Foreign Ministry, dismissed on Thursday allegations by  foreign media that Russia continues to work on the creation of  biological weapons. Such publications "are clearly aimed at  destroying mutual trust, and at aggravating relations between  the signatories of the Convention banning biological weapons,"  he said at a briefing in Moscow.    Karasin noted that Russia as legal successor of the USSR  took  all responsibility for the implementation of the 1972  Convention, including the functions of a guarantor of this  document. Under the trilateral agreements between Russia, USA  and Great Britain, mutual visits to biological facilities and  exchange of information continue between the sides.    Karasin also said that Russia is in favor of the creation of  a control mechanism for the implementation of the Convention. A  special conference on this issue will be convened in Geneva in  September.</p>

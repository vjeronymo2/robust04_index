			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Arts: Today's Television It is no surprise that Lucinda Lambton is capable of enthusing about even the M25. Her Alphabet of Britain on BBC 2 at 8.50 takes drivers off the capital's orbital route to explore some of the treasures nestling within the motorway's roar; such as an art nouveau church at Great Warley, and the Sevenoaks tunnel which inspired The Railway Children. Nigel Planer has made a good living sending up the 'luvvies' in the guise of that rotund thespian Nicholas Craig. Now he is called upon to do some real acting in a new comedy series Bonjour la Classe (BBC 1, 8.30) in which he plays an ineffectual French teacher. With workfare the talk of the moment, Cutting Edge (Channel 4, 9 pm) is timely. Journalist Sima Ray equips herself with a tiny camera and microphone and descends into the underworld of the lowest paid, taking jobs in laundries, in bars, and cleaning offices. Sex obsession gets two airings tonight. The Secret World of Sex (BBC2, 7.30) gives the downside (illegitimacy) while The Good Sex Guide (ITV, 10.40) makes out that it's jolly funny.</p>

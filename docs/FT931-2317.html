			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Re-thinking 5 per cent STERLING futures contracts fell back sharply yesterday, after the figures for UK inflation in February came out a little worse than expected, writes James Blitz. For the last two months, sterling dealers have assumed that the UK authorities would probably bring UK base rates as low as 5 per cent to stimulate the economic recovery. But yesterday's retail prices index for February, which showed a headline rise of 1.8 per cent year-on-year, raised concerns that the government might have to lean towards tightening policy to keep inflation under control. Indeed, the week has been dominated by signs that make another easing of UK monetary policy much less likely. On Tuesday, the chancellor said in his budget statement that current interest rates were consistent with the desired level of economic growth. On Thursday, a surprising fall in unemployment figures in the UK also raised speculation that another easing might be unnecessary. All these elements combined to bring down the June short sterling contract by 9 basis points to a close of 94.22 yesterday. The September contract came down 12 basis points to close at 94.36 and the December contract came down 11 basis points to close at 94.39. In other words, the markets believe that, at best, 3-month sterling will drop to 5.61 per cent this year - and this level is just about compatible with 6 per cent base rates. According to one London-based dealer, any speculation about a cut is based on perceptions that Germany will aggressively ease policy this year, and that the UK may be tempted to follow. Sterling cash reflected the tighter tone. Three-month sterling rose to 6 per cent from about 5.75 per cent first thing yesterday morning. That development took place in spite of the relatively slick removal of a Pounds 1.65bn shortage forecast by the Bank of England. German futures meanwhile reflected a delayed reaction to Thursday's decision by the Bundesbank to ease the discount rate by 50 basis points but to leave the Lombard rate unchanged. The June Euromark contract fell 4 basis points to close at 93.16 and the September contract was down 2 basis points to close at 93.90. Cash rates were steady, with call money at 8.58 per cent.</p>

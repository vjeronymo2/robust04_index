			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS DISCLOSE THEY HAD WARHEADS IN CUBA;  </P> <P> SEMINAR ON '62 MISSILE CRISIS REVEALS THAT U.S. CITIES WERE TARGETED; CASTRO  PLEA FOR ATTACK TOLD  </P> <P> The world was even closer to the brink of nuclear war during the Cuban Missile  Crisis of 1962 than has previously been thought, with warheads already on hand  in Cuba for Soviet missiles targeted at Washington, New York and other major  U.S. cities, according to fresh details of the crisis that emerged at an  unprecedented meeting of the participants here Saturday.  </P> <P> One of the potentially most surprising disclosures emerged during a lunch break  in the formal sessions. During lunch, one Soviet participant, a man described  as having "definitive" knowledge of the subject, reportedly said that two days  before the crisis peaked, Cuban leader Fidel Castro sent a desperate message to  then-Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev urging that the missiles be fired.  </P> <P> According to this account, that cable convinced Khrushchev that the  confrontation had gone too far, and he decided to agree to U.S. demands that  the missiles be withdrawn.  </P> <P> The existence of such a cabled plea from Castro could not be confirmed among  available Soviet and Cuban sources attending the meeting here. But three  conference delegates confirmed that they had heard the knowledgeable Soviet  participant give the account during a session break, and they said that the  report clearly took the American side by surprise.  </P> <P> Reporters were barred from all but the opening and closing sessions of the  extraordinary, two-day seminar, which was organized jointly by the Soviets and  officials of the Nuclear Crisis Project at Harvard University's Center for  Science and International Affairs.  </P> <P> While Washington had photographic proof that there were nuclear-capable Soviet  missiles deployed in Cuba, the American side was never sure whether nuclear  warheads to arm them were actually on the island, just 90 miles from the  nearest landfall in the United States.  </P> <P> But Sergei Khrushchev, son of the late leader and one of the conference  participants, told foreign journalists Saturday that the missiles could have  been operational in less than a few hours, if his father had given the word.  </P> <P> Khrushchev, however, quoted Gen. Dmitri A. Volkogonov, head of the Moscow  Military History Archive Institute, as telling conference participants "that  even in the tensest moments, there was no command given to put the rockets in a  state of military readiness, and the warheads were never put on the rockets."  </P> <P> The younger Khrushchev, who was an engineer in the Soviet missile program at  the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis, added that "even in the event of an  American invasion or air strike, Soviet officers in Cuba had no orders to use  the missiles." The missiles were always under full Soviet control, he said, and  Cuban officials said they were not even permitted onto the missile bases.  </P> <P> Asked about the reported cable from Castro urging his father to fire the  weapons at the United States, Khrushchev commented, "I don't know about this."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1st Meeting of Participants  </P> <P> The Moscow seminar, held at an obscure guest house of a Soviet trade union  organization, marked the first time that top American, Soviet and Cuban  officials who were actually involved in the 1962 crisis have met to discuss it.  Among some 50 participants were former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara and  former Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko.  </P> <P> Harvard's Nuclear Crisis Project hopes eventually to publish at least an edited  version of the meeting transcript, but in the meantime, most participants  refused to provided details of their talks except anonymously.  </P> <P> Based on discussions with several of them, however, the picture that emerged  from the conference is one of a vastly more complex confrontation than the  version commonly known to Americans and one in which even the U.S. participants  now say Washington played a much more equivocal role.  </P> <P> The best-known phase of the crisis began with the U.S. discovery in mid-October  of 1962 that the Soviets were building nuclear-missile launching sites in Cuba.  It became public Oct. 22, when then-President John F. Kennedy announced in a  national television address that he had imposed a naval blockade on the island  nation and pledged to do whatever was necessary to compel the withdrawal of the  missiles.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Kennedy warned, a Soviet missile launched from Cuba against any  nation in the Western Hemisphere would be considered as an attack by Moscow on  the United States and would trigger full nuclear retaliation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No-Invasion Pledge  </P> <P> The public drama continued for six tense days until, on Oct. 28, Khrushchev  agreed to remove the missiles in return for a pledge by Washington not to  invade Cuba.  </P> <P> In fact, according to information emerging from the conference here, the Soviet  decision to install the missiles in Cuba was made at least five months before  the public crisis began and followed the development of a covert U.S. plan to  try to overthrow the Castro regime.  </P> <P> Gen. Volkogonov reportedly told the conference Saturday that at the time, the  Soviet Union had only "about 20" intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of  reaching the United States from its own territory. That was a "shockingly low  number," according to one surprised American official, and only a fraction of  the total estimated at the time by the CIA.  </P> <P> It meant that the 42 intermediate-range Soviet missiles either installed or in  transit to Cuba by October would have represented more than two-thirds of  Moscow's ability to deliver a nuclear strike on American territory. The  warheads had arrived on the island by September, 1962, the Soviets were quoted  as saying.  </P> <P> The Soviets also said that because they had so few missiles at the time, it was  their nuclear policy to target "U.S. population centers and leadership cadres"  rather than military installations or troop staging areas, according to one  participant. The Cuban missiles were targeted at Washington, New York and other  major cities within their range, he added.  </P> <P> In another surprise, the Cuban delegates to the conference disclosed that  Havana had urged the Kremlin three times to make a public announcement of its  intention to install nuclear missiles in Cuba, according to one participant.  </P> <P> Kennedy, in his public announcement, stressed that the weapons had been moved  secretly onto the island, and former Kennedy Administration officials have said  since that Washington would have been hard-pressed to win world support for  blocking deployment of the missiles if it had been undertaken openly.  </P> <P> Delegates here confirmed that during the formal sessions, Cuban and Soviet  officials alike underscored their conviction that by October, 1962, a U.S.  invasion of Cuba was imminent. Cuban delegates reportedly said that they  expected 400,000 Cuban soldiers and civilians to die in such an attack.  </P> <P> American officials continue to insist that the United States had no such  intention, although McNamara conceded Saturday that he had told the seminar, "I  could understand why the Cuban and Soviet leaders at that time believed the  U.S. was intending to invade Cuba."  </P> <P> Participants quoted Alexander I. Alekseyev, who was ambassador to Cuba at the  time, as saying that Castro, who had previously been calm throughout the  crisis, became particularly agitated by Oct. 26. Fearing a U.S. air strike, he  reportedly spent that night in a bomb shelter, where he and the Soviet envoy  drafted a cable to Khrushchev warning of intelligence information that a U.S.  attack would come within days or possibly hours.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Urged Firing of Missiles  </P> <P> The reported account during lunch by the knowledgeable Soviet delegate picks up  at that point. The account affirms that Castro urged Khrushchev to fire at  least some of the missiles targeted on the United States. Luncheon witnesses  said it was unclear from the Soviet delegate's account whether Castro asked  that the missiles be launched preemptively or at the moment of a U.S. invasion.  </P> <P> Before the Moscow meeting, the Cubans were generally considered by U.S.  participants in the 1962 crisis to have been almost extraneous to its  development. They tended to see the crisis as strictly a Soviet-American  showdown over an issue of strategic advantage.  </P> <P> The Moscow conference appears to have significantly altered that perception. As  Scott Armstrong, executive director of the National Security Archive, put it  during the public, closing session of the conference: "Cuba has been put back  into the Cuban Missile Crisis in a very definite way here."  </P> <P> Jorge Risket Valdes, a member of the Politburo of Cuba's ruling Communist Party  and a leader of the Havana delegation here, proposed that a sequel to this  conference be held in Havana.  </P> <P> "We feel this would be just and make a further contribution to our  understanding," he said.  </P> <P> The participants have scheduled a final news conference for today.  </P></p>

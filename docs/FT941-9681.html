			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Lloyd's braced for failure of Pounds 900m offer to Names Lloyd's of London is resigned to almost certain failure today in its efforts to reach an out-of-court settlement to legal action involving more than 17,000 Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the insurance market. This afternoon is the deadline for loss-making Names to accept a Pounds 900m offer. Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, acknowledged yesterday: 'Unless something very dramatic happens on Monday we'll be short of the value take-up which will enable us to go unconditional with the offer.' Lloyd's has said that at least 70 per cent of the value of the offer will have to be taken up by Names if the deal is to be implemented. It is also unlikely that Lloyd's will decide to extend the deadline to give Names more time to accept the deal, in spite of an increase in the number of acceptances in the past few days, Mr Middleton said. If the offer fails, legal actions are likely to begin, starting with one by 3,000 Gooda Walker Names that is scheduled to come to court in April. Mr Middleton is hopeful that negotiations about a possible out-of-court settlement will eventually be resumed, although he emphasised that this was unlikely to happen before September or October. He said: 'I can't see this offer being revived. But that is not to say that there will not be a set of circumstances where people begin to talk.' Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker action group, stressed that his group's action would have continued irrespective of how many Names had sent in their acceptance forms. He said: 'I think we have a period of litigation which will be conducted in a very determined fashion by both sides.' Lloyd's would not play a central role in organising any future talks, which would be dependent on initiatives by Names or errors and omissions underwriters. It is understood that E&amp;O underwriters had agreed to contribute about Pounds 400m to the Pounds 900m settlement offer, with Lloyd's contributing a further Pounds 450m from its central fund - which meets claims when Names are unable to fulfil their obligations. Agents would have contributed a further Pounds 50m to the deal. Meanwhile, Mr Middleton said the market's key priorities 'must be further reforms'. At the top of the agenda are efforts to create NewCo, a reinsurance company. Will they take the money and run?, Page 13</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Successful Experiment"] </F>   [Text] To all appearances the country is no longer  threatened by miners' strikes caused by the nonpayments crisis.  The specialists from the Russian Coal and Raw Material Mutual  [sovmestnyy] Bank have found a way out of the apparent deadlock.    The first "industrial experiment" has already shown the high  degree of effectiveness of the decisions which have been found.  A financial chain linked the "Vorkutaugol" association, the  Novyy Lipetsk metallurgical combine, the Vyksa pipe welders,  and the transport workers and oil extraction workers. A  clearing accounts procedure has been developed for each  enterprise.    Nonetheless it is still too early to rejoice. The country is  in acute need of modern financial legislation.    A realistic way out of the situation is the creation of  financial and industrial groups. In the coal industry this  process has already begun. In the opinion of specialists, the  profitability of "buying and selling" operations is receding  into the past. Life has shown that the future of the economy  and its normalization belong to the producers.</p>

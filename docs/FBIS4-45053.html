			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Moulay Abderrahmane: "Terrorist Groups Fighting </F> Among Themselves: A New War Among Leaders"--first paragraph is  EL WATAN introduction]    [Text] The answer of the AIS (Islamic Salvation Army) was  not long coming; they inveighed against the GIA's [Armed Islamic  Group] latest initiative: taking over the FIS [Islamic Salvation  Front] and placing the political leadership directly under the  control of the national emir, Abou Abdallah Ahmed (Mohamed  Gousmi in civilian life). Twenty members of the GIA will be  executed in retaliation by the AIS, Baa Azzedine's communique  announced. You cannot touch the "chouyoukh" and get away with  it. Meanwhile, Benhadj is said to continue his letter-writing  activity with a letter to Zeroual.    The communique signed by Gousmi for the GIA, Redjam for the  FIS provisional executive committee, and Said Makhloufi for the  HDI [Haraket addawla al Islamiya] and the MIA [Armed Islamic  Movement] (on behalf of Abdelkader Chebouti who would have  achieved the feat of being there while being elsewhere) suffers  from authentication problems at a time that is propitious to all  manipulations.    However, there are some indications that this attempt to  unify armed groups (the pious hope of Hocine Abderrahmine,  instigator of the attack at the Houari Boumediene airport) and  the subsequent communique may be genuine.    First, the tone. It confirms, on the one hand, the approach  of the three terrorist groups, namely the rejection of any  notion of a dialogue with the government, and on the other hand  the campaign launched in mosques to clear Makhloufi of the  suspicion of being an informer, under which he had been since  the death of Djaafar el Afghani.    This almost unnatural rapprochement of Old Makhloufi and  Iranian Gousmi must have been the result of a deal.    The former pledged allegiance to the latter who, in turn,  rehabilitated the author of the "Civil Disobedience Manual" who  had been suspected of belonging to the security services. The  second indication that makes it all credible is the reference  (the first one) to suicide terrorist attacks.    Those who have an idea of Gousmi's initiatory path will see  it as a legible signature. Gousmi never concealed his Shiite  preferences, and while others were trained in Peshawar he chose  Qom for his Pasdarans and the training personnel of the Lebanese  Hezbollah, the promoter of suicide attacks. Counterterrorism  specialists established already long ago that armed group  members avoid direct confrontation with the enemy. They fire at  unarmed people, in the back, or when they are superior in  numbers, but they never face death.    In other words, this rules out suicide attacks.    That people talk about it may mean that a new strategy is  being introduced, a sort of Iranization of terrorist activities,  but it bears the mark of the former coordinator of the FIS  community office in Birkhadem.    Baa Azzedine, also known as Mustapha Abou Mohamed, probably  considered that Gousmi was blinded by his ambition. The  communique he signed shows that he had read the one issued by  Redjam, Makhloufi, and Gousmi.    How can this small community executive expect to command all  these "leaders with a prestigious past"?    Controversial as he may be, Makhloufi is still a great  figure  of Islamism. Rabah Guettaf, mentioned in the airport case, is  still a former comrade of Bouyali. Abassi and Benhadj rank  practically as prophets. Chebouti remains the only known and  recognized Islamist general. And now the Shiite from Birkhadem  claims that all these men pledged allegiance to him.    Baa Azzedine's violent speech denotes the determination of  the FIS (the FIS from before the Batna congress, that is) to  distance itself from the GIA, its mistakes and its dirty hands,  on which is wiped today the blood of all the victims, especially  the foreigners whose dead bodies keep weighing more and more in  European or American parliamentary debates. By announcing openly  that 20 GIA members were to be executed, the AIS, of which  Katibet Ennasr, its "victory squad" wrote the text and decided  on the sentence, Chebouti's eternal assistant just declared a  war that carries all the germs of barbarity. [sentence as  published]    The mention of the names of the banned-FIS chairman and  vice-chairman in this case of allegiance to the GIA not only  aroused the anger of the "victory squad" leader, but it also  poses a credibility problem. No armed faction, no matter how  bloody its record, may get the honors of the jihad unless it  clearly publishes the fact that it acts with the blessing of the  imprisoned leaders. How does one extract this blessing, and in  what form? No one knows.    We know that the first letter that Benhadj wrote from his  cell to Chebouti caused the penitentiary administration to react  and change the conditions under which the FIS leaders were  detained. Now we are told that Benhadj did it again, since he is  said to have written to the head of State. The contents, it  would seem, are far from friendly.</p>

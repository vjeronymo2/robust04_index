			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Slower manufacturing growth signalled Hints that the recent acceleration in manufacturing growth may slow slightly towards the end of the year emerged yesterday in a business survey. The Purchasing Managers' Index fell for the second consecutive month in September as the seasonally adjusted rate of growth in new manufacturing orders dropped. The index, compiled from data on stocks, output, orders, delivery times and prices, was 59.6 per cent in September, down from 59.7 per cent in August and 62.1 per cent in July. Any figure above 50 per cent indicates growth from the previous month. The results echo a recent Confederation of British Industry survey that also suggested orders may slow. With official production data due next week, these findings may add to the debate about the government's recent decision to raise base rates to 5.75 per cent. Although the CBI survey was mainly carried out before the rise in base rates, some business groups have argued that the move may hinder the pace of industrial growth. However, City economists have been predicting that the recent acceleration in production growth would slacken towards the end of the year. Manufacturing output grew 3.9 per cent in the year to July, and some economists fear that a further acceleration might create capacity problems. One example of these pressures came this week when British Steel admitted that a recent rise in demand for structural steel sections for construction work had forced it to close its export order book for these products for the rest of the year. The last time rising demand had forced such a move was during the boom in 1990, it said. These growth pressures were also reflected in the Purchasing Managers' Index, which showed that almost a third of companies faced increasing problems in meeting delivery times. The proportion of purchasing managers intending to raise prices fell fractionally during the month. Nevertheless, nearly half of the managers surveyed said they still envisaged price rises, with the chemicals, rubbers, plastics, paper and packaging industries reporting price increases. The output index continued to rise, reaching a figure of 60.8 per cent, suggesting that production continued to expand in September. However, new orders fell to 60.6 per cent, down from 64.4 per cent the previous month.</p>

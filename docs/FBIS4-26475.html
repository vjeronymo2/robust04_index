			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 23 (XINHUA) -- South Korean President  Kim Yong-sam was told by his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton today  that negotiations are underway to discuss resuming the  high-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang in Geneva  early next month.    Kim and Clinton were talking about concerted measures on  Pyongyang's nuclear issue in a telephone conversation, according  to the presidential office.    Clinton phoned Kim this morning and explained the background  of the U.S. decision to agree to a third round of high-level  talks with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).    Clinton disclosed that the DPRK has agreed not to refuel its  nuclear reactor at Yongbyon or reprocess spent fuel and has  guaranteed continuous monitoring by the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA).    The U.S. President said that he welcomes the inter-Korean  agreement to hold a summit and he is encouraged to see things  are developing rapidly to lay the groundwork for the summit.    Kim, in the meantime, said that he has praised the DPRK's  acceptance of Seoul's offer for a preliminary contact next week  for the inter-Korean summit.    He also noted that his government is pushing for the  inter-Korean summit with the "absolute support" of the people.    Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter went to Pyongyang last  week and brought back a message to Seoul that President Kim  Il-song wants to hold a summit with South Korean President Kim  Yong-sam.    Seoul immediately accepted and proposed a pre-summit  working-level contact at the truce village of Panmunjom on the  morning of June 28.    Yesterday, the DPRK notified South Korea of its acceptance  of  Seoul's proposal.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW JONES HAS 66%, SEEKS ALL OF TELERATE  </P> <P> Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., moving to consolidate its role in electronic  publishing, said today it will acquire the remainder of Telerate Inc., the  financial information service already 66% owned by the Wall Street Journal  publisher.  </P> <P> Dow Jones said it will pay $576 million, or $18 per share, for Telerate's 32  million publicly owned shares, a substantial premium over the $15.125 at  Wednesday's close.  </P> <P> But Wall Street traders placed bets that the publishing giant will eventually  have to pay even more for the rest of Telerate, and lifted its stock $5 to  $20.125.  </P> <P> Dow Jones said it is prepared to meet with Telerate to discuss the proposal,  which traders took as a signal that the company may be willing to enhance its  offer.  </P> <P> Telerate, founded two decades ago, was a pioneer in the booming business of  providing real-time financial information to banks, brokers and corporations,  using a global network of video terminals.  </P> <P> Dow Jones, also a major player in electronic news with its computer-based Dow  Jones News Retrieval, began building a stake in Telerate in recent years. It  has long been expected to buy 100% of Telerate stock at some point, although  traders were surprised at the timing.  </P> <P> At present Dow Jones owns about 66.2% of Telerate common shares. Its new bid  values all of Telerate at about $1.7 billion.  </P> <P> A Telerate spokesman said Neil Hirsch, Telerate president and chief executive  officer, had no comment on the offer.  </P> <P> While Dow Jones has a controlling interest of Telerate, traders believe  Telerate may need to compel a higher bid from its majority owner. An arbitrager  who requested anonymity said, "The directors have to demand what they consider  a fair price for the minority shareholders."  </P></p>

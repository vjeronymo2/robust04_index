			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Fraud office drops charges in third Guinness case THE SERIOUS Fraud Office yesterday dropped charges which would have formed the basis for a third Guinness trial against two men. The trial, arising out of the Pounds 2.7bn Guinness takeover of Distillers in 1986, was expected to start later this year. Charges against Mr David Mayhew, a partner of stockbroker Cazenove &amp; Co, and three charges against Mr Roger Seelig, former corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell, currently standing trial at Southwark Crown Court, London, in the second Guinness prosecution, were dismissed at a brief hearing. An official verdict of not-guilty was entered against the names of both men. Speculation has been growing that the second Guinness trial might also be about to collapse. Guinness Two, which began at Southwark Crown Court in September, involves Mr Seelig and Lord Spens, former corporate finance director at Henry Ansbacher. The SFO said it had decided not to proceed against Mr Mayhew after examining fresh evidence from his solicitors. Mrs Barbara Mills QC, the SFO director who is to be the new Director of Public Prosecutions, said: 'After careful consideration I have come to the view that the evidence in the case as a whole is no longer sufficient to satisfy the test of whether there is a realistic prospect of a conviction.' Eight men originally faced charges in what was dubbed the 'Financial Trial of the Century'. The first Guinness trial which ended in August 1990, involved Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman and chief executive, Mr Gerald Ronson, Heron Group chairman, Mr Anthony Parnes, a City stockbroker, and the then-Sir Jack Lyons, a millionaire financier who was subsequently stripped of his knighthood. Mr Saunders, Mr Ronson and Mr Parnes were all jailed, but have since been released. Mr Ronson was also fined a record Pounds 5m. Mr Lyons, who was not jailed on the grounds of ill-health, was fined Pounds 3m. Mr Mayhew is the only City defendant in the Guinness case not to have been dismissed from the position he held at the time of the takeover. Mr John Kemp-Welch, Cazenove's joint senior partner, said yesterday: 'We have always believed in his innocence.' Asked whether the Guinness affair had affected the firm's business, he added: 'It would be naive to claim it had done no damage.' However, he said that no clients had left the firm because of the case. Last night, Mr Seelig said: 'I am delighted, not only for myself but also for David Mayhew and for Cazenove who have so admirably stood by him throughout his ordeal.' Mr Seelig and Lord Spens are accused of involvement in an unlawful share-support operation, mounted by Guinness during the takeover battle for Distillers. The trial has already gone beyond its original estimated length of three months. Only 10 of the 80 potential prosecution witnesses have so far given evidence and there is serious concern over whether the trial can be completed this year. The judge is expected to address the question of whether the trial has become unmanageable when the jury returns on Monday after a week's holiday. If Guinness Two does collapse that will leave only Guinness Four outstanding. That trial, which concerns Mr Thomas Ward, a US Attorney and a non-executive director of Guinness at the time of the Distillers takeover, is due to start at the Old Bailey before Mr Justice Turner in September.</p>

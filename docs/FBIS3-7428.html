			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Thailand and Cambodia yesterday agreed in principle  to jointly develop areas which might be found by a joint  committee to overlap, said Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri  yesterday.    The committee will come under the framework of the  Thai-Cambodian Joint Committee and will begin work at the same  time as the demarcation work said a senior official.    Sqn Ldr Prasong said after an hour-long meeting with his  Cambodian counterpart, Prince Norodom Sirivut, that several  committees would be set up to cooperate on such things as  fisheries, investment, trade, and the exchange of technical  personnel and senior officials.    "We're now ready to sit down and create a legal framework.  We don't know the procedure but we'd like to solve problems in  a peaceful way through joint development cooperation, not to use  confrontation," said Prince Sirivut.    He said problems, including the Koh Kong incident and the  refugee problem, between the two countries would be solved at a  state-to-state level through the committees which would be  established as soon as possible.    "We don't think the Koh Kong incident is a real-estate  affair. We don't want local authorities to jeopardise our good  relations."    Prince Sirivut said there was a lot of contradictory  information and it was not appropriate to comment on this until  both sides had held a common investigation.    "Situations can change. I hope his excellency (Prasong) will  meet me again. We'll wait for the result."    The Thai government yesterday handed over 35 pieces of  equipment used in vocation training involving machinery,  electrical goods, electronics and steel-linkage, worth a  combined 627,060 baht. Both foreign ministers witnessed the  initial endorsement of a cooperation agreement between their  Boards of Investment [BoI].    The agreement was signed by BoI Secretary-General Sathaphon  Kawitanon and Vichit It.    The agreement, to take effect in two years, will stress  training activities, the exchange of information and investment  promotion which will lead to more serious deals between the two  countries, according to a BoI press statement. The initial  agreement will be proposed for further approval by the two  governments, it said.</p>

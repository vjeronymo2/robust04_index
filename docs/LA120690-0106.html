			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: AZUSA;  </P> <P> QUARRY'S PERMIT RENEWED  </P> <P> The Azusa Rock Co. will be able to continue rock mining at its Fish Canyon Road  quarry, the City Council decided Monday, over the objections of several  residents.  </P> <P> The council voted 3 to 2 to renew the quarry's permit, saying it has complied  with all city conditions.  </P> <P> However, the council required the company to report to the city monthly on its  efforts to restore parts of the mountain that are not being mined. The council  also required the company to install sound-absorbing barriers around its  rock-crushing equipment.  </P> <P> The council decision followed a public hearing in which several residents said  the quarry was a nuisance, creating dust in the air and scarring the  mountainside.  </P> <P> Councilman Stephen J. Alexander and Mayor Eugene F. Moses voted against the  permit. "We have a mountain and it is being destroyed," Alexander said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: DIODES INC. EARNINGS DIP 83% IN 1ST QUARTER  </P> <P> Diodes Inc., a Chatsworth-based electronic components company, said its fiscal  first-quarter profit tumbled 83% from a year earlier on a 14% decline in sales.  </P> <P> In the quarter that ended July 31, Diodes' net income fell to $17,990 from  $106,481 a year earlier. Its sales dropped to $3.20 million from $3.70 million.  </P> <P> Diodes attributed the lower results to strong competition, a "marked decline"  in demand for rectifiers and other electronic components, and the recent  weakness in the U.S. dollar against Asian currencies, which has increased the  cost of making Diodes' products overseas.  </P></p>

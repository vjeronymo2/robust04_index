			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Japanese steel mills win big coal price cuts Coking coal prices crashed in annual renegotiations completed yesterday between the Japanese Steel Mills and their Australian and Canadian suppliers. In a negotiation led by Canada's Fording Coal, which had for weeks been signalling its willingness to take a large price cut for an increased tonnage, the hard coking coal price was cut by Dollars 3.85 to Dollars 45.45 a tonne. The Fording agreement was followed immediately by BHP Australia and subsequently by seven other big Australian producers. All but one suffered tonnage cuts. In contrast, Fording is believed to have won a 200,000-tonne increase in its contract. Other coal qualities also came down in price with soft coking coal falling Dollars 3.50 and semi-soft by Dollars 3.30 to Dollars 40.35-42.35 and Dollars 36.40 a tonne respectively. The settlement is likely to lead to a rapid conclusion of the steam coal contracts between the Australian suppliers. Many Australian producers were saying yesterday that they expected the agreement to be accompanied by a strike throughout the industry. In all, eight Australian exporters have signed up at the new prices levels. BHP, Australia, Arco, MIM, Shell, KCC, South Blackwater, Clutha and a group of soft coking coal producers shipping out of Newcastle. The new price levels will push many of the Australian and Canadian operations into the red and raise questions over the future of a number of pits in New South Wales. While the Canadian producers have the compensation of a weakening currency - the Canadian dollar has fallen from 87 to 76 US cents in the last 12 months, the Australians have no such cushion, with a slight strengthening of their dollar since the start of 1992. In contrast, the mills are doubly winners with the stronger yen adding to the weaker dollar-denominated prices. Since 1991 dollar prices have fallen from Dollars 51.80 to Dollars 45.45 while yen prices have fallen Y6,841 to Y4,912. Nor will the suffering from the new settlements be restricted to Canada and Australia as, one way or another, the US exporters will have to match them, although probably at a lower level. The US industry, which has only recently returned to full working after a damaging, drawn-out strike, is in no position to match cuts of this magnitude and it is expected that pressure will come on to the railroads that carry coal to the export terminals to make a cut in their freight rates. The coal producers faced a formidable hurdle in Japan with poor financial performance at the mills, coupled with an expectation of a fall in steel production coinciding with the development of new mines in Australia and an expansion of production at existing Australian and Canadian mines. However, the overall balance of coking coal demand on international markets presents a much less gloomy prospect, with demand recovery expected in the US and almost all the other coking coal buyers in Asia, South America and Europe. For the Australians, it is particularly ironic that the settlement comes hard on the heels of the announcement that at the end of December its stocks reached a five-year low of just 8.7m tonnes. Although it is clear that the coking coal market is far from robust, the situation facing the steam coal producers is completely different. Demand is rising vigorously throughout Asia, led by the construction of import-dedicated coal plant in Japan. Almost invariably, and particularly in Japan, these utilities are highly profitable and, far from needing price cuts, are well able to pay the current year's prices. Some Japanese power companies were reported to have expressed worries that any price cuts would have implications for the security of their supply over the rest of the decade. Such worries will now be put to the test.</p>

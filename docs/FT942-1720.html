			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Addiction or taste in battle for smokers' allegiance Are US tobacco companies deliberately manipulating the amount of nicotine in cigarettes to keep the nation's 46m smokers addicted? Damning evidence presented to Congress this week seemed to suggest as much. On Tuesday, a House of Representatives sub-committee heard allegations that Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco, a US subsidiary of Britain's BAT Industries, had secretly developed a genetically engineered tobacco called Y-1 that contained more than twice the amount of nicotine found in normal tobacco plants. Mr David Kessler, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, told the committee that B&amp;W had earlier denied breeding tobacco plants for high or low nicotine levels: yet the company had several million pounds of Y-1 tobacco stored in US warehouses and had been using it in five domestic brands of cigarettes. Mr Kessler's purpose in presenting the evidence was to bolster his case for bringing cigarettes under his agency's control. Previously he has threatened to regulate cigarettes as drugs if it could be shown that manufacturers intend people to buy them to satisfy a nicotine addiction. At the hearing on Tuesday he said there was no longer any doubt that the tobacco industry was manipulating and controlling nicotine levels in its products. B&amp;W will reply to the allegations at a further hearing today, but it has already accused Mr Kessler of blowing the issue out of proportion. There was nothing secret about Y-1, it said: it was just one of a variety of domestic and foreign tobaccos used by the company to provide the unique 'recipe' of ingredients that went into each brand. In reality, the history of Y-1 is almost an irrelevance. At issue are two questions: first, whether cigarettes are addictive, and second, whether manufacturers intend them to be addictive. If the answer to both questions is yes, the FDA may be able to bring them under its jurisdiction as a drug. That manufacturers control the levels of nicotine in their cigarettes is not in doubt. In the 1940s, nicotine and tar occurred in cigarettes at more than three times today's levels, but manufacturers gradually reduced them through refinements in the processing technique to satisfy demand for smoother and lighter cigarettes. So why not eliminate nicotine altogether? Because, say manufacturers, it is an essential contributor to cigarette flavour. When nicotine levels in cigarettes fall below a certain point, smokers no longer enjoy them. So companies adjust the nicotine level and other flavour-enhancing ingredients of each particular brand by using blends of tobacco leaves. 'Y-1 was a blending tool for flavour,' B&amp;W said. Mr Walker Merriman, vice president of the Tobacco Institute, the industry's trade association, said yesterday that consumer preference was the specific reason for having a particular level of tar and nicotine in any particular cigarette. One or two US brands had almost insignificant levels of nicotine, he said, but commanded very low market share, and earlier no-nicotine brands had failed through lack of demand. Mr Kessler has recently backed off from earlier suggestions that tobacco manufacturers deliberately 'spike' their products to keep smokers addicted, but has more recently said it is sufficient to show that cigarette manufacturers have the ability to control the level of nicotine in their products and have allowed it to remain at addictive levels. The industry position is that cigarettes are not a drug as defined in the 1938 Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act because they 'do not intend to affect the structure or any function of the body'. In any event, manufacturers say, smoking cannot be addictive because more than half of US citizens today who have ever smoked have quit - more than 90 per cent of them without professional help. Mr Kessler's ultimate objective appears to be to bring the tobacco industry under his agency's control so that he can force manufacturers gradually to reduce levels of nicotine in their products and so wean smokers away from the habit. Critics say a possible risk in such a policy is that it could lead smokers to smoke more cigarettes to compensate for the loss of nicotine intake, so increasing their exposure to the carcinogenic ingredients of cigarettes without hurting industry profits. On past form, however, it will be a long time before things get this far. If the FDA moved to take control of the industry, the tobacco manufacturers would undoubtedly take the agency to court. Armed with vast resources of cash and extremely experienced lawyers, they would stand a good chance of emerging unscathed. Until now, US courts have taken the view that the hazards associated with smoking are so well known that anybody taking up the habit assumes all the risks involved. In the eyes of the courts, the industry, it seems, is blameless: it has never lost a case yet.</p>

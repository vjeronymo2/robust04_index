			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Single-market EC heads export league THE completion of Europe's single market in January this year has had a radical impact on world trade, at least from a statistical point of view. Not only does the European Community become the world's leading exporter - far outstripping the US - with exports of Dollars 565bn (Pounds 397.8bn), but world trade falls from Dollars 3,700bn to Dollars 2,800bn, as sales between EC member states become domestic trade. The disappearance of EC exporters such as Germany and France from the rankings of top traders also brings five Asian countries into the top 10 for the first time: Hong Kong is fifth, followed by China, Taiwan and Korea. Singapore is at number 10.</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls further to a seven-month low The Nikkei 225 average finished at a seven-month low after profit-taking pushed share prices down for the third consecutive day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was off 185.14 at 19,423.88, its lowest since April 4, after a day's high of 19,654.33 and low of 19,331.37. Arbitrage buying lifted equities initially, but active sales in the afternoon by foreign and individual investors depressed prices. Profit-taking by institutional investors looking to cover their foreign exchange losses on overseas bond holdings, due to the recent appreciation of the yen against the dollar, also weighed on the index. Some shares regained ground on small-lot bargain hunting towards the end of the session. Investor confidence was dented, too, by the decline in privatisation issues. Individual investors and dealers, fearing a further fall in the market, took profits in early trading. Traders expect the next support point of the Nikkei 225 to be around the 19,111.92 posted on March 31, the final day of the last business year. Volume increased to 299m shares from 210m. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 16.99 to 1,533.28, while the Nikkei 300 shed 3.09 to 280.83. Declines led rises by 867 to 124, with 170 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 2.93 at 1,262.23. Japan Tobacco fell Y16,000 to Y994,000. Investors had been nervous over the stock dropping below Y1m, regarded as a psychological support level. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone dipped Y29,000 to Y863,000 on active foreign selling, while East Japan Railways shed Y3,000 to Y475,000. Banks, which depend on unrealised gains on stockholdings to support their capital ratios, fell. Industrial Bank of Japan receded Y60 to Y2,880. Large-capital stocks were sold in busy trading. Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, lost Y4 at Y384 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries declined Y18 to Y752. In Osaka, the OSE average relinquished 218.81 at 21,465.36 in volume of 44.3m shares. Roundup Morgan Stanley Asia added its voice to those reducing the weighting of Hong Kong equities. It lowered its allocation to a still overweight 35 per cent from 40 per cent in its Asia-Pacific model portfolio. The move came less than a week after HG Asia (Singapore) also recommended investors to trim allocations in Hong Kong. Morgan Stanley upgraded Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore but cut Australia's weighting to neutral. HONG KONG finished down but off lows on late futures-led demand after dipping on news of the Morgan Stanley move. The Hang Seng index lost 10.61 at 9,405.48 after touching 9,356.92. Turnover stayed thin, at a preliminary HKDollars 2.1bn. TAIPEI rose sharply on late buying in the electronics and financial sectors, although brokers said they expected prices to consolidate ahead of local government elections on December 3. The weighted index put on 101.79 or 1.6 per cent at 6,449.99. Turnover came to TDollars 41.15bn. SEOUL edged down in volatile trading as selling of financial shares and mid-priced blue chips alternated with buying of primary blue chips. The composite index closed 0.36 off at 1,138.39, after backing down from an all-time intraday high of 1,145.01. Most preferred stocks were sharply higher after the Securities Supervisory Board told listed companies and securities houses to buy back 3 per cent of their own companies' preferred stocks by the first quarter of 1995. SINGAPORE rebounded as institutional funds returned to buy blue chip banks and properties. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 17.39 to 2,344.40 as Salomon Brothers commented that Singapore's residential property market appeared due for a downward correction but the commercial market was on track for a cyclical upturn. BOMBAY's 30-share index ended 90.21 or 2.1 per cent lower at 4,205.68 on hectic selling by domestic and foreign mutual funds. Brokers noted a lack of liquidity as mutual funds, committed to investing in the partial privatisation of seven state-owned companies, held back from making fresh investments. KUALA LUMPUR continued to be weighed down by forced selling by investors unable to meet margin calls. The composite index declined 6.45 to 1,051.51. SYDNEY was pulled higher by strength in golds. The All Ordinaries index added 15.3 at 1,982.6 and turnover was ADollars 375.3m. Resources issue CRA rose 28 cents to ADollars 18.36. WELLINGTON saw a decline in Carter Holt Harvey pressure prices overall. The NZSE-40 Capital index fell 10.46 to 2,075.17 in NZDollars 31.8m turnover.

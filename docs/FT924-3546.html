			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / International Company News: Leading executive at Generali resigns MR Fabio Fegitz, one of Generali's three managing directors, has resigned from the Italian insurance company. The surprise departure, for 'personal reasons', immediately triggered speculation about differences of opinion among top management at Italy's biggest insurer. Mr Fegitz had previously headed the company's London operations for 27 years. But some observers maintained his resignation owed more to the difficulties of re-establishing himself at a highly bureaucratic head office in Trieste than a clash over strategy. The company forecast an unchanged loss in its non-life underwriting activities this year, based on figures for the first nine months, while earnings from life insurance were set to rise. In 1991, Generali lost L112.8bn (Dollars 80.5m) in non-life underwriting and made L493.4bn on the life side. It gave no absolute figures for its nine-months results in either life or non-life business. However, it said the claims ratio on its Italian non-life business had started to improve after years of steady decline. The company attributed the change to better market conditions and more careful selection of risks. The company, which last year made net earnings of L563.9bn, made no 1992 profits forecast. But it said this year's earnings would be swollen by exchange rate factors, whereas new Italian tax measures would have a negative effect. Group premiums in the first nine months rose by 26.2 per cent to L11,330bn from L8,981bn at the end of September last year. Adjusted for exchange rates, overall premiums climbed by 13.2 per cent, with a 15.6 per cent rise in life insurance and a 11 per cent increase on the non-life side. Although investment income jumped by 29 per cent in the first nine months, Generali warned that profits from trading would be 'satisfactory' but below last year's level.</p>

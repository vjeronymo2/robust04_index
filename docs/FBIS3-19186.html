			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Chinese-American Test of </F> Strength"]    [Text] The arrival in Beijing on Friday, 11 March, of U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher was the opportunity for a  serious test of strength between the United States and China.  The authorities of the Communist regime immediately indicated  to Washington's diplomatic chief that he had no right to meddle  with the affairs of the host country.    In order to make things quite clear, shortly before Mr.  Christopher's arrival, the Shanghai police briefly detained Wang  Fuchen, the secretary of the human rights association of the  southern capital.    The difference of agreement is nothing new: Beijing has  always acted as leader of those -- mainly Asian -- countries  which more or less support the view that the subject of human  rights is only used by the West as a means of exerting pressure,  mainly for commercial ends. The debate was revived by the  possibility of an imminent reconsideration by Washington of  Beijing's attribution with most-favored-nation status.  Recently, President Clinton gave his Chinese partner until June  to demonstrate good will regarding human rights.    The novel aspect now is that this time China risks  humiliating the world's leading power for which it has generally  reserved more circumspect treatment than for many other Western  countries. Why? Without a doubt it feels emboldened by the  points it has just scored against France, which was forced to  call off its sale of aircraft to Taiwan, and against Great  Britain, which was duly informed that the reforms implemented by  Hong Kong Governor Patten will be repealed on the same day that  the colony returns to the fold.    Perhaps, above all, Beijing's attitude is symptomatic of the  form of government practiced by the high-ranking officials in  the run-up to the probable upheaval that will follow the death  of the patriarch Deng Xiaoping: Nothing must happen that calls  their absolute authority into question. Even the respectful  mode of dissent chosen by the dissidents, who sweep aside any  hypothetical removal of the regime, is not convincing the old  guard to accept the dialogue which questions their system of  order.    The Chinese leaders believe they can adopt the same attitude  in the international context. Deep down, they believe that  President Clinton, following the others, will ultimately  consider it more pressing to uphold the capitalist interests of  his country than to echo what they take to be pure  sentimentality on the part of both intellectuals and  humanitarian organizations, relayed by an influential  international press.    Consequently, the visit by Mr. Christopher would appear to  be  crucial. In fact, it will enable the Chinese to gauge U.S.  determination, and inevitably it will serve as a barometer for  other visitors, starting with Edouard Balladur, who is expected  in Beijing on 7 April.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: Uni Storebrand falls to NKr26m UNI STOREBRAND, Norway's leading private insurance company, suffered a sharp fall in profits in the first four months of the year to NKr26m (Dollars 4.17m) from NKr437m for the same period of 1991, it said yesterday. The decline is partly due to the costs of trying to create a pan-Nordic insurance conglomerate over the past seven months after buying 8 per cent of Skandia, Sweden's leading insurance company. Uni said it had lost NKr178m on the investment, including a NKr27m writedown of shares that Uni also acquired in the Danish insurance group, Baltica, as part of its pan-Nordic design. The attempt to create a Nordic insurance giant has yet to be resolved. Uni said it was holding further discussions with Skandia. On top of its problems over Skandia, Uni said its profit decline was also due to NKr123m paid out in insurance premiums for damage caused by the hurricane which hit Norway's north-west coast last January, as well as a NKr90m increase in allocations for personal injuries and a lower profit from the company's investment portfolio. But Uni said that the results laid the foundation for 'a substantial improvement later in the year.' Its life assurance company made a profit of NKr800m for the first four months, with an increase of 20 per cent in premium income for life assurance.</p>

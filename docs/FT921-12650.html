			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Procession of concessions to recession - Lonrho's 24% decline LONRHO, the international trading group, yesterday said that a number of factors had conspired to make 1991 'an extremely difficult' trading year. However, it declined to give details of how the recession on both sides of the Atlantic and the adverse currency movements on its overseas asset position had affected the pre-tax profits of its different divisions. Yet it is possible to work out where the worst results are likely to surface when Lonrho publishes its 1991 annual report on February 26, containing the divisional and geographical profit breakdowns: Motor and equipment operations, predominantly based in the UK, were the worst hit by the recession, said Mr Philip Tarsh, a director of Lonrho. VAG, the import and distribution arm of Volkswagen and Audi Motor cars in the UK, suffered from the 20 per cent fall in VAG car sales. Sales at Jack Barclay, the Rolls-Royce and Bentley distributor, were down by 26 per cent; Hotel operations within the leisure division had a difficult year, a fact highlighted by the statement of Mr Tiny Rowland, chief executive. He said: 'Across the world the Gulf war cut back both business and holiday travel and our hotels suffered a severe drop in occupancy during the year.' There has been speculation that Lonrho has been planning to sell some or all of its hotels. Mr Mike Smith, analyst with Robert Fleming Securities, says: 'A sale of all the hotels would be viewed as an act of desperation. It would be far better if the group sold off smaller businesses across the world.' In manufacturing, textiles and local newspapers traded more strongly than the engineering operations. Lonrho is understood to be planning the sale of both the Glasgow Herald and the Evening Times, which belong to the group's subsidiary Outram. The sale could fetch up to Pounds 200m, the group says; Financial services, one of the few divisions to report a fall in pre-tax profits in 1990, had another bad year. It includes the 49 per cent-owned finance associate, VAG Finance, which arranges finance for vehicle sales in the UK, a Lloyd's insurance broker and some property and investment businesses, which were all affected by the recession; Agriculture suffered from the fall in sugar, where last year the average price on the open market in London fell from Dollars 335 a tonne to Dollars 239; Mining produced the best result. Although these operations are all in Africa, which does not get top rating in the quality of earnings department, Lonrho has stakes in two top-class mining businesses. Western Platinum (73 per cent owned) is believed to be the world's lowest-cost platinum producer. This position was strengthened by the 1990 merger with Impala's Karee platinum mine, which adjoins the Westplats operations on the South African Bushveld near Rustenburg. Westplats produced 625,000 troy ounces of platinum group metals last year and is being expanded towards an annual 800,000 ounces. It has a life expectancy of 100 years. Ashanti Goldfields Corporation, in which Lonrho has a 45 per cent shareholding and has the Ghana government as its partner, is also being expanded - towards 1m ounces a year level by 1995-96. Last year gold output increased by 42 per cent to 569,452 ounces. Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team at SG Warburg Securities, estimates its operating costs are only Dollars 120 (Pounds 66.20) an ounce. He estimates that these two mining operations have been contributing a steady increase in attributable gross revenue: from Pounds 89m in the second half of the 1989-90 financial year, to Pounds 99m in the first half of the 1990-91 year and to Pounds 115m in the second half. Mr Worthington says this does not sit easily with Lonrho's statement that the fall in precious metals prices accounted for nearly half the reduction in its second-half profits. Mr Rob Davies, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, says Lonrho's statement is 'downright misleading' in this respect. He points out that if the half-years to end-September are compared - while gold's price eased back from Dollars 385 to Dollars 367 an ounce and the platinum price was certainly in a slump and down from Dollars 491 an ounce to Dollars 392 - rhodium, which accounts for perhaps half of Westplats' production, rose strongly. It was up from Dollars 2,700 to Dollars 4,500 an ounce.</p>

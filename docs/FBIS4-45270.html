The company was founded  about 30 years ago in South America and imports chemicals for  the paint and pharmaceutical industries, among others.    According to the chief of the Colombian National Police,  General Octavio Vargas Silva, many of what Holanda Colombia  considers to be legal customers are essentially dummy companies  which exist merely to lend illegal transactions a legal  appearance on paper.    The Colombian police have had their suspicions about Holanda  Colombia's services for several years. Five years ago, General  Miguel Antonio Padilla, who was chief of police at the time,  said on Netherlands television that the Netherlands chemical  industry was one of the main suppliers to the cocaine barons.    The evidence lies in the packaging, the barrels, and the  route followed, said General Padilla at the time. He did not  wish to name names because the inquiry had still not been  concluded.    Concrete steps against the Netherlands-Colombian company  were  taken on 10 March this year, when operation "Volatile" was  launched (the name was chosen because of the volatile substances  in question). The National Council for Narcotic Drugs, which  has to give its approval to companies trading in substances that  can be of use to drug dealers, withdrew the licence it had  issued to Holanda Colombia.    The police then raided the company's eight plants spread  throughout the country. In Mosquera, Medellin, Baranquilla,  Cali, Bucaramanga, Pereira, Cartagena, and Ibaque a total of  1,753 tonnes of chemicals were confiscated.    The excuse for this was the fact that the company had made a  delivery to another company that supposedly lacked the required  authorization. In a second incident, a quantity of methyl ethyl  ketone [MEK] was supposedly ordered by one company and paid for  by another.    In the meantime, claims company spokesman Takkenberg, both  incidents have been cleared up. "The authorization had indeed  been withdrawn from the first company. But when we made the  delivery in February the authorization was still valid. In the  second case, both companies did indeed possess the required  papers."    At a press conference the day after the operation, General  Octavio Vargas Silva announced that the Colombian police had  "dealt a serious blow" to this sector of the drug trade. The  police report specified the haul in kg. The list ranges from  ether and sodium to thinner and toluene.    The semifinished product coca paste, made of leaves of the  coca plant, and refined cocaine can be produced using various  chemicals.    MEK is the big favorite of the drug dealers. According to an  investigation carried out by the DEA, the American anti-drug  department, 90 percent of the cocaine encountered in the United  States contains this substance. Holanda Colombia's warehouses  contained 941,704 kilos of MEK.    However, according to H. Bolhuis, the Netherlands director  of  industrial development at Holanda Colombia, the fact that the  police throw several chemicals together shows that they are  ill-informed. The trained chemist points out that the list even  included hydrochloric acid, as if the drug trade was interested  in that.    Bolhuis works at a small, but modern factory in Mosquera, a  town where the industrial belt begins behind the colonial  square. With its concrete and angular glass dome, the factory  is of a design that one might formerly have expected more in the  Hoofddorp business park than on a sandy path in the Colombian  savannah.    The chemist fervently hopes that the entire affair can be  dealt with quickly and "amicably." The fact that the public  prosecutor has not yet charged the company and its staff members  after a period of three months, strengthens his conviction in  this respect. In Colombia, the prosecutor has 180 days to make  a decision as to whether to proceed with a legal investigation.    The company has protested to the judge at the withdrawal of  its authorization to deal in strategic substances.    The British director of Holanda Colombia, G. Bromich, adds  that 90 percent of the Colombian chemical industry is being  supplied by his company. The chemical substance MEK accounts  for a maximum of 4 percent of the company's sales, and is, he  claimed, also sold by major companies such as Exxon and Shell.    According to Bromich, the company is probably the leading  seller of filled barrels in Colombia, which is supposedly why so  many of the company's barrels had been found in cocaine  laboratories.    The police file on Holanda Colombia contains a pile of color  photographs including data and place names that provide  convincing proof of this.    The pictures are barely distinguishable. A luxurious green  forest, a cane shelter, and underneath it row upon row of green  barrels bearing the initials HC--Holanda Colombia--in white.    The pictures show improvised small-scale cocaine factories  that were closed down by the army or the police during the past  years. Nine times out of 10, Holanda Colombia barrels were found  there, sometimes brand new ones.    The barrels could be stolen, or the chemicals transferred to  the barrels, concede the Colombian experts involved in the  anti-drugs war in Bogota. However, they claim that this is just  one theory, and that "100,000 liters is too large a quantity to  be explained away like that."</p>

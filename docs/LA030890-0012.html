			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> STRING OF RACIAL INCIDENTS LED TO STUDENT WALKOUT  </P> <P> The incidents became more frequent about a year ago.  </P> <P> A mannequin of a dead black man, castrated and mutilated, was confiscated by  school officials in April after it was displayed at Hawthorne High School. A  black English teacher received a threatening note the same month after  suggesting that the department's reading list include a minority author.  </P> <P> Several months later, the leader of the predominantly white teachers union  called the black superintendent of schools a "Stepin Fetchit," referring to a  black actor in the 1930s who fawned over his white bosses.  </P> <P> The flurry of racial unrest this week in the Centinela Valley Union High School  District has been played out against a bitter backdrop of racial disharmony  that teachers, students, parents and administrators say has haunted the  district for years.  </P> <P> There is little agreement over the source of ill will. Some blame bigotry among  a handful of white teachers who dislike working under minority administrators  in a district with an 80% minority enrollment. Others say it reflects strained  race relations in society as a whole. Still others point the finger at school  district politics.  </P> <P> Regardless, most agree there were telltale signs that racial problems at  Hawthorne and Leuzinger high schools were barreling out of control long before  2,000 students took to the streets Monday to protest the resignation of popular  Hawthorne High School Principal Ken Crowe.  </P> <P> There have been 40 alleged incidents of racial harassment -- involving  administrators, teachers and students -- at the two schools during the past two  years, district Supt. McKinley Nash said in an interview Wednesday. The  incidents and other complaints cover a broad spectrum of allegations, including  claims that teachers have referred to blacks in derogatory terms and have said  they are intellectually inferior, school officials said.  </P> <P> Crowe said the harassment began the day after he was promoted to principal in  March, 1988, when a cartoon was anonymously circulated throughout the district  depicting caricatures of blacks standing around a grave identified as Hawthorne  High School. Later, Crowe said, he was approached by a teachers union  representative, who told him some faculty members were unhappy because he is  black.  </P> <P> "How long can you fight this sort of thing?" asked Crowe, who said he decided  to resign after being told that the school board planned to remove him.  </P> <P> At least two white teachers have been officially reprimanded by the district  because of racial incidents, and in three other cases teachers have had letters  of complaint placed in their personnel files, according to a brief summary of  incidents released by district officials. Cases are also pending against  several other teachers, officials said.  </P> <P> One teacher was reprimanded for describing a black job specialist "as a spy for  the superintendent," and another for using abusive language and threatening a  black security official, according to the summary. The letters of complaint  related to the use of abusive language by one teacher and harassment of  administrators by two others.  </P> <P> Last year, the school board hired an attorney and a private investigator to  look into many of the allegations.  </P> <P> "There was very clear and strong evidence that there were some older white  teachers in the school district who had a lot of resentment toward the changes  that had taken place in the school district and that they were acting out a  racially charged agenda with respect to students and staff," attorney Melanie  Lomax, who conducted the investigation, said in an interview Wednesday. "The  fact that they have a black superintendent (and other administrators) has not  gone over very well."  </P> <P> Lomax's investigation was interrupted by elections in November, which saw three  of the board's five incumbents ousted. She said she presented her findings to  the new board in January along with a warning that racial tensions were "not  going to go away" and that the board should "not let this problem fester."  </P> <P> Lomax said she further advised the board to take a strong public position  deploring discrimination and racial harassment in the district and to ask an  outside agency to conduct a districtwide investigation. "There was clearly too  much smoke for there not to be any fire," Lomax said.  </P> <P> That was not the first warning the newly elected board received. More than a  dozen parents, educators and community leaders complained about racial tensions  at a meeting in November when the three new board members were sworn in.  </P> <P> Several speakers, most of whom were black, indicated that they would fight any  effort by the new board to fire Nash or any minority administrators. During the  election, two of the successful challengers were supported by the teachers  union, which has repeatedly clashed with Nash, Crowe and other administrators.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At yesterday's regular session, following a lengthy  review, the Constitutionality Court [CC] repealed the  provisional amparo filed by Deputy Carlos Humberto Arroyave  Cerna against the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE]. In making  its decision, the CC overturned a lower court's decision to  temporarily suspend TSE Decree 2-94 of 11 April, which scheduled  nationwide district elections for congressional deputies on 14  August.    In reviewing the events, the CC contended that the  circumstances in this case neither warranted the granting of the  amparo writ nor the issuance of such a writ ex-officio, as  supported in Article 28 of the law on this matter. Therefore, a  repeal of the controversial resolution was in order. Both sides  were immediately informed of this decision, according to CC  Secretary Manuel Garcia.    In turn, the CC added, the TSE may continue preparing for  the  elections as originally scheduled.    Regarding an appeal filed by Deputy Arroyave Cerna, the CC  confirmed it must continue to go through the relevant appeals  process without posing any obstacle to the electoral process.</p>

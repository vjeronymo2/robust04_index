			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / People: BBC swaps Treasury ministers The government yesterday made appointments to the BBC's board of governors that suggest it is sticking to a status quo approach rather than making an attempt to change the make-up of the board or the role of the governors. In the role of vice-chairman, it has swapped one former Labour Treasury minister with another. Lord Cocks of Hartcliffe, a former parliamentary secretary to the Treasury and former government chief whip, takes over from Lord Barnett, former chief secretary to the Treasury, whose term of office at the BBC runs out at the end of this month. Bill Jordan, president of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union has been re-appointed for a second five year term as a BBC governor and Margaret Spurr, headmistress of Bolton School, girls' division also becomes a governor. The retiring governors are John Roberts of Merton College, Oxford, whose term expired in March, Baroness James, the novelist and Keith Oates, managing director of Marks and Spencer, whose terms run out at the end of this month. Two further governors have to be appointed to bring the board up to full strength. Lord Cocks, MP for Bristol South from 1970-1987, will receive an annual salary of Pounds 14,715 for the part-time job. The other governors get Pounds 7,360.</p>

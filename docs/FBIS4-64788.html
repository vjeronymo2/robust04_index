			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Heinz Schmitz: "Only For Cultivating the </F> Climate"]    [Text] The new Japanese prime minister, Tsutomu Hata,  visited several European capitals last week. According to an  official statement, he held talks in Bonn "in a friendly  atmosphere" and discussed with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl  relations between the two countries and international affairs.  As a routine of such talks, the Western side urges better  access to the Japanese market, and Japan promptly promises to  make huge efforts to reform the economic structures and open the  markets. This also happened in Bonn.    Under the headline "Preparation of the World Economic  Summit," which will take place in Naples in July, Kohl urged his  Japanese visitor to increase support for Russia. While Germany  has, in the past, borne the main burden, Japan has only shown a  cold shoulder in this respect. This will hardly change in  Naples. Nor will the chancellor's wish for increased commitment  of Japanese companies in eastern Germany be considered as long  as they cannot expect to get a good return on their investment.  Both governments see themselves in one boat on their way to a  permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Even though the  arguments exchanged are not new, it is sensible for the chiefs  of governments from friendly nations to meet personally at  regular intervals. Cultivating the political climate is of  importance.</p>

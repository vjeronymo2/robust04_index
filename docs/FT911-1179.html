			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Saatchi price steady on stake sale - Rights issue supporter reduces holding by 75m shares SAATCHI &amp; SAATCHI, the advertising group, yesterday saw its shares slip by just  1/2 p to 19 3/4 p when St James Place Capital, one of Lord Rothschild's funds, sold 75m shares to UBS Philips &amp; Drew, the securities house. P&amp;D then placed almost all the shares at 19 1/4 p. The placing is said to have been over-subscribed. After the disposal St James now holds 61m Saatchi shares, or 4 per cent of the overall equity, worth Pounds 12m on Saatchi's current market capitalisation of Pounds 304m. Other funds linked to Lord (Jacob) Rothschild are believed to hold additional stock. St James was involved last month in underwriting a Pounds 55m rights issue for 10p a share as part of Saatchi's recently completed emergency recapitalisation. Before the recapitalisation St James Place was the largest holder of Saatchi's Europreference shares. Under the terms of the recapitalisation those shares were exchanged for 86m ordinary shares. It then acquired an additional 50m shares as a result of the rights issue. Although St James made a profit from yesterday's transaction on its rights issue investment, it is believed to be still showing a loss on its original investment, estimated at about Pounds 35m, in the Europreference issue. St James said that it had sold the shares to ensure that Saatchi, which is its biggest single investment, accounted for no more than 5 per cent of its assets. This was the proportion of assets Saatchi represented after the original purchase of Europreference shares. Yesterday's placing came only two weeks after a group of its US investors sold 53m shares. These investors, which included ESL Partners, a Dallas-based finance house, and Mr Lawrence Tisch, the New York businessman, were also involved in underwriting the rights issue. St James and ESL Partners, which is also still a substantial Saatchi shareholder with 53m shares, have both been invited to appoint non-executive directors to the Saatchi board.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Air Force Commander General Petr Deinekin  announced that in 1994, the number of war planes is to be cut by  one third. He told Interfax on Wednesday that cuts would made  by disbanding Russian aviation units located in the former  Soviet republics. He also stated that despite the cuts, the  Russian Air Forces' combat efficiency would be retained by  equipping them with modern planes of the fourth generation. He  also noted that the Defense Ministry would no longer use  obsolete planes, whose service life has expired.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 20 May (PANA) -- Nigeria's military  government has ordered the temporary closure of the country's  multi-million dollar steel project at Ajaokuta, north-west of  Lagos. A press release from the Ministry of Power and Steel  made available to the Pan African news agency (PANA) said the  project considered the largest and most ambitious of its kind in  Africa is to be closed on Friday [20 May].    The project was to make Nigeria not only self-sufficient in  steel and its by-products but also a steel exporting country.  The management and staff of the project as well as the public  have been ordered to stay away from the project sites until  further notice.    According to the country's power and steel minister, Wole  Oyelese, the temporary closure is to facilitate the work of a  panel set up recently "following a rampage by workers". The  panel is to investigate the causes of the riot as well as  examine the grievances of the workers and views of the  management. It is also expected to "recommend a more feasible  work atmosphere for the general good of the steel complex",the  minister said. The panel joins the long list of probes set up  by military ruler Gen Sani Abacha to probe government  institutions, parastatals, and projects since he took power  seven months ago.</p>

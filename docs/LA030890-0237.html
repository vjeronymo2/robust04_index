			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CBS, TURNER NEWS LINKUP IS RUMORED;  </P> <P> MEDIA: HIGH COST OF OPERATING FOREIGN NEWS BUREAUS MAY LEAD TO JOINT OPERATIONS  FOR CNN AND CBS.  </P> <P> CBS Inc. is close to an agreement on a news linkup with its former foe Ted  Turner, the cable television magnate whose unwanted 1985 takeover bid forced  the network into a painful restructuring, industry sources say.  </P> <P> The sources say CBS will likely announce this month that it will cooperate with  Turner's Cable News Network in foreign news coverage.  </P> <P> The cooperation pact would help struggling CBS, which has had a series of  failures in its overseas news coverage. It would also save the network money in  what is a notoriously expensive area for broadcasters.  </P> <P> Moving a correspondent to cover a story overseas can easily cost several  thousand dollars a day, since it also means that a camera crew, producer and  tape editor will be sent, along with hundreds of pounds of equipment.  </P> <P> CBS News spokesman Tom Goodman had no comment on a possible CNN deal and said  no announcements were pending.  </P> <P> Steven Hayworth, director of public relations for CNN, confirmed published  reports that talks have taken place with CBS.  </P> <P> "Discussions have taken place on a number of matters, including news matters,  but I've got no comment on the proximity of an agreement or whether there is an  agreement pending," he said.  </P> <P> Exact details of the proposed linkup or any financial terms were not available.  </P> <P> Sources within CBS note that the network, consistently ranked No. 3 in both its  morning and evening newscasts, has suffered setbacks recently in coverage in  Panama, the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and South Africa.  </P> <P> With television news coverage an increasing cash drain in a bottom-line  sensitive industry, CBS has been cutting back its foreign operations.  </P> <P> In the last decade, CBS, whose reputation for quality once gave it the nickname  the "Tiffany network," has closed bureaus in Bonn, Paris, Hong Kong, Bangkok,  Beirut, Cairo and Athens.  </P> <P> ABC News, now No. 1 in the evening news ratings, has close links with the news  film service WTN, which supplies footage to broadcasters around the world,  serving as a "wire service" for networks.  </P> <P> NBC has gone even further, taking a 38% stake in Visnews, another news film  agency. NBC and Visnews now share some offices overseas.  </P></p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Virgin targets personal computers MR Richard Branson's Virgin Group is planning an assault on Britain's Pounds 3bn-a-year personal computer business. The airline-to-music group wants to take a substantial share of the market, bringing it into competition with traditional suppliers such as International Business Machines and Compaq as well as more recent entrants such as Amstrad and Elonex. The vehicle for Virgin's move is Virgin Euromagnetics, a small electronics company turning over about Pounds 12m annually which Virgin has owned for two years. It supplies computer media such as floppy diskette packs which Virgin sells in its stores. The company has designed and built an advanced machine based on the most popular microprocessor chip, the Intel 80/486. Mr John Jenkins, Virgin Euromagnetics sales and marketing manager, said a UK factory, as yet unnamed, would build PCs only for Virgin. Production rates are expected to start at around 3,000 a month. The machine is expected to cost about Pounds 1,100, and Virgin is discussing selling a package of computer plus a laser printer for about Pounds 1,250. The plan is to start acceptance testing both inside Virgin and with selected customers in the next few weeks in preparation for a grand launch at the Business Computing Show in September. The PC business in the UK is one of the most difficult in Europe, characterised by savage price cutting and fierce competition. Mr Jeremy Davies of Context, a London-based consultancy which analyses the UK PC market said: 'If the Virgin products are attractively packaged and competitively priced, then there is no reason why they should not do well.'

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Aiming to increase coverage - Richard Lapper and Alison Smith report on a new challenge The challenge facing the UK's traditional insurance industry by the emergence of new telephone-based companies was yesterday highlighted when Direct Line disclosed the extent of its recent growth in the Pounds 4bn a year home insurance market. Already 'direct writers', which sell direct to the public, using a combination of telephone sales, advertising and sophisticated computer software, control about 20 per cent of the motor insurance market, with Direct Line now established as the biggest insurer in that sector. Since launching its attack on the home market last September Direct Line has added more than 100,000 policies to its books and now counts itself among the country's top 10 home insurers. 'If growth continues at its present rate we will be the biggest home insurer in the country within two to three years,' warns Mr Peter Wood, chief executive. Other direct writers are also beginning to eye the home insurance market, at least 50 per cent of which is controlled by the large composite insurers, selling mainly through their bank and building society connections. Intensified competition in this area could spill over into other parts of the financial services sector, eroding the profits of those insurance companies which either refuse or are slow to adapt, and increasing the pressure on those building societies which are heavily dependent on commission income earned from insurance sales. The direct writers have ample leeway to compete, especially on pricing. For one thing, customers have recently become much more likely to 'shop around' for home insurance following steep price increases in the wake of wind and subsidence losses. With insurers also changing the way they underwrite, rating buildings insurance risk in line with the perceived risk of subsidence or storm, for example, some customers have faced even higher rate rises. And the commission rates in the home insurance market have traditionally been much higher than those paid to brokers in the motor market. Some banks and building societies still earn the equivalent of 30 per cent or more of the premium on sales of home policies, compared with the 10 per cent to 15 per cent commissions charged in the motor insurance market. 'The margins are so big. There is much more for us to have a go at,' says the chief executive of one direct writer. Direct Line is selective about the risks it underwrites, but still claims that it can offer nine out of 10 customers for building policies rates that are 20 per cent cheaper than those they would pay elsewhere. Analysts and other observers believe that the direct writers could begin to take market share from their competitors. 'People are looking for ways to reduce their insurance costs and getting used to the telephone. There seems to be very little reason why the home market shouldn't be penetrated in the same way as the motor market,' commented Mr Stephen Bird, analyst with Smith New Court, the securities house. Mr Mark Wood, managing director of AA Insurance, the UK's biggest chain of insurance shops, believes direct writers and a number of new telephone-based brokers will increase their share of the home insurance market. Building societies, however, are already alert to the danger of losing what some consider a significant source of income. At Chelsea Building Society, for example, it contributed more than Pounds 4m in 1993: a broadly similar figure seems about right for Derbyshire Building Society. But in protecting their business, societies are not falling over themselves to reduce their commission rates in order to compete. Mr Roger Tucker, head of mortgage services at North of England, admits that Direct Line's success has made it re-address its pricing policy, but emphasises also that the society is considering the range of facilities it provides to include, perhaps, offers such as 'money-off' vouchers. At Chelsea, Mr Geoffrey Divito says that in many areas the prices the society can offer already compare well with Direct Line, because of the direct writer's selectivity. He argues that the level of customer service is also an important factor, and talks about the advantages of dealing with an organisation which has long-standing experience of dealing with claims. Derbyshire highlights the convenience factor for customers of having mortgage and home insurance payments handled through a single organisation and with a single direct debit. Here, as in other areas of personal financial services, customer inertia may play a significant role in enabling the established organisations to hold on to much of their customer base, if increases in charges or premiums are not sufficient to shock people into shopping around. At Direct Line though, Mr Wood is confident that far reaching change is on the cards. 'There is going to be a re-engineering of the market,' he says.</p>

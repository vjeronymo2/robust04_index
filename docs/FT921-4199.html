			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Personal View: Brussels should be brave over Yugoslavia dilemma Recent events in Sarajevo have demonstrated only too sharply that Yugoslavia is far from pacified. It is still possible, even likely, that Bosnia-Herzegovina will collapse into chaos and violence, resulting in a complex territorial fragmentation along ethnic and religious lines. The analogy of Lebanon, so often cited during the Yugoslav conflict, would unfortunately be appropriate. The wider and immediate implication of any conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina is that probably it would postpone the deployment of UN peacekeeping troops in Croatia. This in turn could lead to a renewed round of fighting between Serbs and Croats. The government in the Croatian capital of Zagreb has in any case never been happy about the arrival of the UN, fearing that the Serbian enclaves could, through Serbian manipulation on the international scene, remain indefinitely outside Croatian sovereignty. The most recent opinion polls from Croatia indicate that the majority of Croats anticipate precisely such an outcome. Another war in Croatia would thus constitute not an extension of diplomacy, but its prevention. Then what? The problems do not stop there. With the exception of Slovenia, all the perplexing, threatening elements in the Yugoslav quandary are still in place: apart from the unresolved status of the Serbs of Croatia, there is the constitutional issue about the political balance between Moslems, Serbs and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina; the separatist Moslem region of Sandzak in Serbia, next to Bosnia-Herzegovina; the unruly province of Kosovo, with its 2m ethnic Albanians in Macedonia; the Serbian-Macedonian border issue; the increasingly vocal Hungarian minority in Vojvodina, northern Serbia. There are also at least a dozen more esoteric issues and two big ones: the desperate economic situation in all six Yugoslav republics, and the growing likelihood of a civil war in Serbia itself between the left and right. Even if the Croatia problem is resolved, the rest of the country will still keep the international community preoccupied for some time. Yet the international community has not even begun to address the central question in Yugoslavia: what is a minority and what is a nation? For this has been at the very heart of the manifold Yugoslav crisis. The Serbs of Croatia see themselves as a nation, not a minority. They invoked the principle of self-determination which clashed with the principle of the sovereignty of the (Croatian) state. The ethnic Albanians in Kosovo similarly argue that they are not a minority, as do the Moslems of Sandzak. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Serbs do not wish to become a minority in an independent, Moslem-dominated state. But the Moslems there have no desire to become a minority in a rump Yugoslavia. Everybody wants self-determination. But who is entitled to it? The EC, which rapidly took over the management of the conflict in Yugoslavia from the hopelessly ill-equipped Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (and now probably wishes it had not done so), deliberately steered clear of this political minefield. Last November the Republic of Serbia sent a carefully formulated question to Lord Carrington, the chairman of the EC-sponsored peace conference on Yugoslavia: 'Who can be the subject of the right to self-determination from the standpoint of international public law  -a nation or a federal unit; is the right to self-determination a subjective collective right or the right of a territory?' The question, of course, covered only Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and it was designed to advance Serbian objectives. But it was nevertheless, in the Yugoslav context, exactly the right question to ask because it begged the nation-minority definition. Lord Carrington passed on the Serbian inquiry to the arbitration commission attached to the peace conference, but the latter received an altered version of the same question: 'Does the Serbian population in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, as one of the constituent peoples of Yugoslavia, have the right to self-determination?' Mr Robert Badinter, the French chairman of the arbitration commission, considered even this far too tricky and sidestepped the whole matter by replying that the Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina were under international law entitled to protection as minorities. If everybody claims nationhood, the safest course is to declare everybody a minority. The EC, in its wisdom, went on to extend diplomatic recognition to Croatia, which only increased the resolve of the Serbs in that republic to resist the status of a minority and secede. The fact that the ceasefire held at the time of the recognition had nothing to do with the recognition itself: the ceasefire held, and still does, because Serbia knew only too well that the presence of UN troops would deny the exercise of Croatian sovereignty in the Serbian enclaves and perhaps, in the long term, detach them altogether. The whole issue of recognition was, at any rate, badly mismanaged by the EC, which eventually succumbed to German pressure, itself a result of domestic opinion driven by sentiment. How will the EC cope with a battery of unresolved problems elsewhere in Yugoslavia? Clearly, it is not interested in, and fears to pontificate on, the implications of self-determination - it is much easier to sound righteous and say that the internal frontiers of Yugoslavia are inviolable and can only be changed by agreement, not force. But force has been used, and it will probably be used again. Unwittingly, the EC has now, for example, committed itself to a status quo in Kosovo. If the Serbs of Croatia are a minority, and if the principle of the inviolability of the frontiers is to be respected, then the ethnic Albanians are also a minority and they too should stay where they are, as should the Moslems of Sandzak and all three nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This assumes, of course, that these people will be happy to observe the laws laid down by the EC. The EC did not, except in Slovenia, recognise reality. It dropped the hot potato of self-determination in favour of Tito's frontiers within Yugoslavia. It is just possible that those frontiers will be his only lasting legacy. But it does not seem likely or even desirable. If and when the EC is confronted by a renewed cycle of violence in Yugoslavia, it may wish to consider that brave decisions can also be pragmatic ones.

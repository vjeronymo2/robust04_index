			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / People (Names in the News): Dunlap: no paper tiger Albert Dunlap, turnround expert and long-time associate of Sir James Goldsmith, is anything but a paper tiger, writes Laurie Morse. A qualified paratrooper trained at the US Military Academy at West Point, Dunlap has made a career out of setting companies right, regardless of the waste laid round him in terms of jobs lost and divisions decimated. He has been described most clearly as a shark, and was once quoted in an interview as saying emotions have no place in business. His dispassionate hand is credited with pulling Lily-Tulip from the brink of collapse, and was employed by Sir James in the turnround of Diamond International and Crown-Zellerbach. He remains on the board of Sir James' General Oriental Investments, and recently returned to the US from Australia, where he was ceo of Consolidated Press Holdings. In April, Dunlap landed in the chairman's seat of Philadelphia-based Scott Paper, where he is already ripping away at the soft underbelly of its tissue paper business. When he arrived, Scott was embarking on an aggressive restructuring that would have cut 8,300 jobs over a period of two to three years. Dunlap quickly modified that plan, boosting the job cuts to 10,500 - or about one-third of Scott's worldwide total - and accelerating it so as to complete it by the end of this year. The restructuring is expected to net Scott benefits in excess of Dollars 400m.</p>

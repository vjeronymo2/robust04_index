			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Base rates cut to 4-year low of 10% THE UK government yesterday cut interest rates to their lowest level for four years in an effort to strengthen the so far fragile signs of recovery. Commercial bank base rates fell from 10.5 per cent to 10 per cent  - the first fall since September  - after the Bank of England reduced its short-term money market rates in a move widely welcomed by industry. The cut, which may help the Conservative party in tomorrow's local council elections, is expected to boost consumer confidence. It cuts the margin between borrowing rates in Britain and Germany to the lowest level for 11 years and underlines the perception among UK policy makers that Germany's anchor role within the European exchange rate mechanism may be less important than it was. The cut led to some mortgage cost reductions. Halifax Building Society, the market leader, cut its rate for new borrowers to 10.65 per cent from 10.95 per cent. The Halifax's move will shave Pounds 13.13p a month off the cost of a Pounds 60,000 endowment-linked mortgage. Other lenders will probably follow suit. They are also likely to follow Halifax's lead and not pass on the full reduction in base rates to mortgage-holders. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, said the cut was good news for the economy and that Britain was 'well placed' for recovery. The Institute of Directors said that it would be the 'best possible stimulus' for a revival. However, Sir John Banham, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, underscored widespread business unease at the high level of real interest rates  - nominal rates minus inflation. He said that, while the government's action would 'provide a useful boost to business confidence', high real interest rates were damaging prospects for many companies, particularly those in manufacturing. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, said the drop in borrowing costs was 'much needed and long overdue'. Sentiment that Britain still has some way to go before climbing out of recession in spite of the rate cut led to a subdued stock market reaction. The FT-SE 100 index closed below the day's high at 2,662.2, up 2.4. On currency markets, the pound weathered some selling pressure against a stronger D-Mark, closing in London half a pfennig down at DM2.925 and within 3 pfennigs of sterling's central DM2.95 rate in the European exchange rate mechanism. It later held steady in New York. The rate cut  - which Mr Lamont signalled last week via Bank of England money market operations  - brought UK base rates to within a quarter of a point of the comparableGerman Lombard rate of 9.75 per cent. That underlines the UK's gamble that the German Bundesbank council  - which meets tomorrow  - will refrain from increasing its rates in the next few months. Such a move could strain the pound within the ERM. However, the Treasury and the Bank are thought to have been confident enough that the pound would retain its recent strength to have found the risk worth taking. Even so, the threat that the Bundesbank may increase rates  - or at least not bring them down quickly  - in an effort to curb German inflation is expected to make the latest UK base rate cut the last for some months. As for mortgage costs, several mortgage lenders said they would follow the Halifax lead but wanted more time to digest the change. They will probably not give details until later in the week. Abbey National, Britain's second-biggest lender, said it would reduce rates by about 0.3 of a percentage point, but gave no further details. It appears that many mortgage-holders will be deprived of the full benefit of the half-point cut in base rates because many banks and building societies shaved their rates by half a point earlier this year, in anticipation of a base rate change.</p>

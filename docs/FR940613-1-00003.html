			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petitioner believes that other regulatory trends are also decreasing public access to information. OCRE states that the Technical Specification Improvement Program encourages the removal of material from the plant technical specifications and the relocation of it to internal plant documents. The petitioner included a list of recent generic letters that enable licensees to relocate material from the plant technical specifications, a public document, into other plant documents that may not be available to the public. According to the petitioner, about 36 percent of current technical specification material will be relocated to internal plant documents under this program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioner states that NRC's revised rules of practice place an even greater burden on public petitioners to provide as much documentation and factual basis for contentions as early as possible while the access of petitioners to detailed information is diminishing. The petitioner further states that if detailed information is never submitted to the NRC, and thus never becomes accessible to the public, participants in proceedings will never be able to supply a basis sufficient to support admission of contentions under the new rules of practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OCRE believes that lack of public access to information on nuclear regulation undermines public confidence in the NRC's regulatory program and is contrary to the public's statutory right to participate in the NRC regulatory process. The petitioner also states that members of the public cannot fulfill the role of participating in the NRC regulatory process, which Congress has bestowed upon them, without access to the detailed information that current NRC policies are placing beyond the public's reach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the amendment to the petition, OCRE cited two additional examples of the lack of public access to licensee-held information. The first example is NRC's proposed rule entitled ``Codes and Standards for Nuclear Power Plants; Subsection IWE and Subsection IWL'' (59 FR 979, January 7, 1994), which states that ``In order to further reduce the burden on licensees and NRC staff, the Subsection IWE and IWL portions of the ISI plan will not have to be submitted to the NRC for approval. Licensees may simply retain their initial Subsection IWE and Subsection IWL plans at the site for audit.'' The second example is NRC's final rule entitled ``Storage of Spent Fuel in NRC-Approved Storage Casks at Power Reactor Sites'' (55 FR 29161, July 18, 1990) which does not appear to require nuclear power plant users of the approved storage casks to submit their site-specific evaluations, as required by &sect;72.212(b)(2), to the NRC. This section states that ``A copy of this record must be retained until spent fuel is no longer stored under the general license issued under &sect;72.210.'' The petitioner further states that &sect;72.212(b)(10) only requires that general licensees make records available to the NRC for inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the amendment to the petition, the petitioner amended the language in its suggested &sect;9.301(b) to include persons required by the proposed rule entitled ``Certification of Gaseous Diffusion Plants,'' published on February 11, 1994 (59 FR 6792), to obtain NRC certification of gaseous diffusion plants under proposed Part 76 in the definition of ``possessor.'' OCRE requests that the NRC clarify that this proposed definition would include entities authorized to dispose of radioactive materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioner recommends a change to Part 9 to establish the public's right-to-know and to provide the public access to copies of internal plant documents, subject to the exceptions necessary to protect sensitive information. The suggested amendment would not require that licensees generate information that does not already exist in response to a request. The petitioner believes that its suggested amendment would strike a proper balance between the public's right to know and the rights of the licensees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioner's suggested amendment would include appeal procedures. If a <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  requester is not satisfied with a licensee's response to a request for information, the requester could appeal the matter to an Administrative Law Judge on the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel. According to the petitioner, this option is the most appropriate and efficient one for appeals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OCRE believes that its suggested amendment to Part 9 would impose a minimal burden on licensees and that this minor burden would be justified by the substantial increase in meaningful public participation. According to the petitioner, the proposed amendment to Part 9 would also enhance the public's confidence in the NRC's regulatory program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Suggested Amendments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petitioner requests that the NRC amend 10 CFR Part 9 by adding subpart E to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart E_Public Right of Access to Licensee-Held Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 9.300&blank;Scope of Subpart <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This subpart establishes the public's right of access to licensee-held information, subject to certain exceptions.

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Free market only rhetoric in US Sir, Harry L Freeman falls into the trap of confusing the free-market rhetoric of US politicians with what they do in practice (Letters, January 21). Mr Freeman is, for example, incorrect in saying that 'the long-standing US policy of trying to pry open' markets aims to benefit all exporters. In fact, bilateral US pressure to open east Asian markets has mainly profited American producers - as with the deal which increased Japan's beef import quotas, but primarily for US beef; or the agreement by the Taiwanese to limit rolling-stock and signalling equipment contracts for a new rapid transit line to American companies in order to buy off US pressure. As for President Clinton's pledge to enter negotiations to ensure Caribbean countries are not discriminated against as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Caribbean leaders will treat this with justified cynicism, bearing in mind that recently the US again slashed sugar import quotas, restricting competitive Caribbean sugar sales in the US to protect large, inefficient but politically powerful Florida sugar producers. Perhaps Mr Freeman also is unaware of the fact that the US has just further restricted imports of low-cost Chinese textiles, along with imports from poor countries such as Nepal, Mauritius and El Salvador. The US also maintains a huge array of import restrictions on a vast range of products extending from cars (restrictions on imports from Japan) and trucks (25 per cent tariff) to peanuts (strict import quotas to protect American farmers) and steel (import restrictions covering most imports, including those from Japan). Perhaps President Clinton should begin by prying open his own markets. Phillip Oppenheim, House of Commons, Westminster SW1A 0AA</p>

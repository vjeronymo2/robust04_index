			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD continues to recommend use of RDD surveys to test the accuracy of FMRs for areas where there is a sufficient number of Section 8 units to justify the survey cost of $12,000&hyph;$20,000. Areas with 500 or more units meet this criterion, and areas with fewer units may meet it if the actual two-bedroom FMR rent standard is significantly different than that proposed by HUD. Interested organizations concerned about FMR accuracy may wish to begin contracting for an RDD survey in the next few months to assure that the results will be available in time to be incorporated into the FY 1995 FMRs. It takes two to three months to obtain survey rent estimates after contract award. The ``PHA Guide To Conducting A Fair Market Rent Telephone Survey'' is available from HUD USER by calling 1&hyph;800&hyph;245&hyph;2691. This guide provides information on whether a PHA should consider using this approach, and it includes a draft contractor solicitation letter and a Contract Statement of Work. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> FMRs for Flood Damaged Areas in the Midwest <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the authority granted in 24 CFR part 899, the Secretary finds good cause to waive the regulatory requirements that govern requests for geographic area FMR exceptions for the flood areas that were declared Federal disaster areas. Recognizing that there are a large number of FMR areas that experienced substantial losses as a result of the floods of the past summer in the midwestern states which will have a direct effect on local rent levels, HUD is prepared to grant FMR exceptions under the following conditions. FMR exceptions up to 10 percent above the final FY 1994 FMRs may be approved for single-county FMR areas and for individual county parts of multi-county FMR areas. The flood-related FMR exceptions will be approved by the HUD field office with jurisdiction on the grounds that: (1) The affected counties qualify as disaster areas under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act; and (2) the PHA certifies that demand pressures and/or damage to the rental housing stock is so substantial that it has resulted in an increase in the prevailing rent levels. Such exceptions must be requested in writing by the responsible PHAs. The exceptions approved for this special disaster-related purpose will remain in effect until superseded by final FY 1995 FMRs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Manufactured Home Space FMRs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FMRs for manufactured home spaces are the same as those published on October 1, 1993, and are reprinted here for the convenience of the program administrators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Matters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321&hyph;4374) is unnecessary, since the Section 8 Rental Certificate program is categorically excluded from the Department's National Environmental Policy Act procedures under 24 CFR 50.20(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The undersigned, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), hereby certifies that this notice does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because FMRs do not change the rent from that which would be charged if the unit were not in the Section 8 program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order No. 12606, The Family, has determined that this notice will not have a significant impact on family formation, maintenance, or well-being. The notice amends Fair Market Rent schedules for various Section 8 assisted housing programs, and does not affect the amount of rent a family receiving rental assistance pays, which is based on a percentage of the family's income. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order No. 12611, Federalism, has determined that this notice will not involve the preemption of the State law by Federal statute or regulation and does not have Federalism implications.

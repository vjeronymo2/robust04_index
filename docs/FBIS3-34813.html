This was reported during the  meeting between French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin a short while ago in Jerusalem. Rabin  thanked the French minister for approving the European mandate  for negotiations on updating the economic agreement between the  EC and Israel. Rabin also thanked Juppe for canceling the need  for entry visas for Israelis visiting France.    Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports that Rabin and  the French foreign minister discussed developments in the peace  talks, and Mr. Juppe disclosed that France is trying to promote  the establishment of a television station in the territories.  Rabin said that Israel would agree to the establishment of a  Palestinian television station only within the context of a full  agreement with the Palestinians on Gaza-Jericho First.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: SB to co-develop arthritis treatment SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals and consumer products group, has signed an agreement to co-develop and market arthritis and cancer treatments with British Bio-technology, an unlisted biotechnology group. Under the agreement, SB will develop anti-arthritic therapies from the joint-research and enjoy exclusive marketing rights in the US and Japan, and co-development rights in Europe. British Bio-technology will develop cancer therapies arising from the joint-research. Dr George Poste, SB's chairman of research and development, has argued in the past that such collaborative basic research would become more important given its increasing cost. The two groups have already collaborated on an earlier anti-cancer product which is about to enter clinical trials. British Bio-technology, based in Oxford, is hoping to be floated later this year.</p>

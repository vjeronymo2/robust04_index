			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Poisoned apple within the magic kingdom: Euro Disney is Disney's albatross Mr Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, marked the occasion of his signing of the agreement in 1987 to open the EuroDisneyland theme park in France, by presenting Mr Jacques Chirac, then the French premier, with an original slide from a Disney cartoon - the witch handing the poisoned apple to Snow White. This choice now seems eerily appropriate as Disney starts the painstaking process of restructuring the finances of Euro Disney, which earlier this month reported a net loss of FFr5.3bn (Pounds 600m) for the year ended September. The US group must somehow coax, or bully, the 60 international banks that own Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn debt to agree to a radical refinancing. Disney last week kicked off negotiations by convening a special meeting in Paris with the banks, which are believed to include Banque Nationale de Paris, Caisse des Depots and Indosuez of France, and Merrill Lynch of the US. The banks are hurriedly assembling a steering committee (expected to be led by Indosuez or BNP) to spearhead their discussions with Disney. The banks are bracing themselves for a tense game of financial poker against Disney which, under Mr Eisner (or 'Ice Man Mike' as he is known in the Hollywood film industry) has become renowned as one of the toughest companies in the US. The crux of Euro Disney's problems is that it is crushed by its financial structure. It cannot afford to service the FFr20.3bn net debt with which it is burdened after exceeding its construction budget and the drain on cash-flow resulting from its trading difficulties. Euro Disney says it is still self-financing, but admits that it is likely to run out of money early next year. Disney has agreed to bail it out, but has stressed it will only do so for 'a limited period' to enable Euro Disney to restructure its finances 'by spring 1994'. The main aim of Disney and Euro Disney, advised respectively by Lazard in New York and SG Warburg in London, is to reduce Euro Disney's debt to a manageable level. Analysts suspect that they hope to halve the debt to around FFr10bn. This could be achieved by a combination of a debt-for-equity swap by the banks; by bringing in new equity partners on a deeply discounted basis; and a rights issue for existing shareholders. Disney's main negotiating weapon against the banks is to threaten to close EuroDisneyland unless they agree to rescue it. In theory Disney could afford to do so. Indeed it could argue that it cannot afford not to, given that Disney's share of Euro Disney's losses dragged it into the red with a net loss of Dollars 77.8m in the fourth quarter of its last financial year. Ms Margo Vignola, analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York, described Euro Disney as an 'albatross' for its US parent. If Disney did withdraw, the banks would have to write off their entire exposure of FFr20.3bn to Euro Disney. The banks are gambling that Disney, which until the present debacle was seen as one of the US's most successful companies, would be loathe to tarnish its gilded reputation by admitting defeat in Europe. They are expected to press Disney to play its part in alleviating Euro Disney's financial plight. Disney would be expected to participate fully in a rights issue but it is highly unlikely that it would agree to provide further capital. If it raised its stake above the present level of 49 per cent it would, under US accounting regulations, have to consolidate Euro Disney's debt on to its own balance sheet. However the banks could try to force Disney to reduce its income from Euro Disney. The US parent has already agreed to waive its 'management fee' of 3 per cent of Euro Disney's revenue until the company is profitable. The banks might ask Disney to cut the 'royalty fee' of 10 per cent on admissions and 5 per cent of food and merchandise sales. This fee totalled FFr262m last year. Meanwhile Disney hopes that the French government, anxious to protect the more than 10,000 jobs created at EuroDisneyland, will 'encourage' the banks to bail it out. One option would be for the Caisse des Depots, the state-controlled financial institution, to reduce the 7.8 per cent interest rate levied on its FFr4.8bn of Euro Disney's debt. In the meantime Euro Disney's finances are deteriorating, as illustrated by yesterday's 18.6 per cent fall in the share price to a new low of FFr27.20, which could depress the potential proceeds from a rights issue. As the two camps prepare for battle, the 'poisoned apple' is rotting away. World Stock Markets, Page 37</p>

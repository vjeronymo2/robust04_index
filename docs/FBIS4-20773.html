			<p>Blindly   Aped   <F P=102> 94AS0235E Madras THE HINDU in English 8 Mar 94 p 14 </F> <F P=103> 94AS0235E </F> <F P=104>  Madras THE HINDU </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Government Accused of Aping the West"] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, March 7. Opposition members in the Lok  Sabha today launched a blistering attack against the Government,  accusing it of "blindly aping the west" and being "insensitive"  to the pressing problems, including unemployment and poverty,  confronting the nation.    Participating in the resumed debate on the motion of thanks  on the President's address, Mr. Chandrajeet Yadav (JD) (Janata  Dal) charged that by indiscriminately opening its doors to  multinationals, the Congress Government had pushed the economy  on the path of destruction.    He said this had also drastically affected the public sector  and the cottage industry, with lakhs of people facing the gloomy  prospects of unemployment.    The Janata Dal member said a "sense of uncertainty"  prevailed  throughout the country. The number of persons living below the  poverty line had crossed 50 crores but little was being done to  ameliorate their condition, he said.  <H5>  `IMF Dictating Policies' </H5>   Mr. B.N. Reddy (CPI-M) (Communist Party of India-Marxist)  attacked the Government for, what he called, bartering national  interests, saying that the economic policy was being dictated by  the IMF.    The (CPI-M) member wanted the Government to come out more  firmly to tackle Pakistan's continued support and encouragement  to terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir.    Mr. A. Charles (Cong-I) made a strong defence of the  Government policies and said it was to the credit of the Prime  Minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, who had managed to retrieve the  economy which was in bad shape when the Congress(I) took over  the reins of power.    He complimented the Government for its handling of the  Hazratbal crisis which, he said, had been praised both at home  and abroad.    Mr. D.D. Khanoria (BJP) (Bharatiya Janata Party) made a  strong plea for Central assistance to Himachal Pradesh to  promote development.  <H5>  `Credibility Restored' </H5>   Dr. Ravi Mallu (Congress-I), supporting the motion, said the  Government, under the Prime Ministership of Mr. Narasimha Rao,  had restored the international credibility of the country as  well as the economy. He said the President's address covered the  various achievements of the Government and outlined the priority  area of action in the coming years.    Mr. Ramesh Chand Tomar (BJP), opposing the motion, described  the President's address as "directionless" and said the  Government should not go ahead with the implementation of the  Dunkel proposals as they would severely affect the farm  economics and farmers.    He also criticised the Mulayam Sing Government of Uttar  Pradesh, which, he said, was following casteist policies.    Mr. Tomar also attacked the economic policies of the  Government, saying that it would breed large scale unemployment.  <H5>  `Strategies Needed' </H5>   Mr. Sharad Yadav (JD) said the Government should plan long  term and short term strategies to meet the challenges facing the  nation.    He spoke of economic and social inequalities and said that  unless the nation was rid of poverty, communalism and casteism,  it could not face the threat to its integrity and solidarity.    Mr. Yadav chided the Government for not responding  adequately  and immediately to the U.S. Government's provocative statements  which had a bearing on the unity of the nation.    Mr. Haradhan Roy (CPI-M) criticised the Government's  liberalisation policy and said this would totally eliminate the  indigenous industry, whether in the public or private sector.    The status of India would be reduced to that of Hong Kong as  the internal market would be flooded with foreign goods, he  said. -- PTI</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Mining Closures: TUC hopes to take lead in protest THE general council of the Trades Union Congress will today try to place itself at the head of the protest aimed at reversing the government's pit-closure decision and link its campaign to a broader initiative to combat unemployment. Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, said the British people had 'drawn a line in the sand and said 'so far, no further''. Mr Morris and Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, are proposing a six-point programme to the TUC to include a mass demonstration next weekend, a moratorium on pit closures and a Pounds 10bn stimulus to the economy. Mr Morris suggested that some of the Pounds 10bn could be raised through a one-off 'windfall' tax on the profits of the privatised utilities. He said: 'There is a great vacuum of leadership on the economy at the moment and the TUC must try to fill that and speak for the people of Britain.' Mr Edmonds proposed a national recovery forum to discuss a short-term recovery package. 'We need a spark to re-ignite the British economy,' he said. He pointed as a model to the Pounds 20bn stimulus that the Japanese government was applying to its economy. Mr Edmonds said the government and all sides of industry should set aside their political and ideological differences to establish such a recovery programme. Mr Morris and Mr Edmonds are seeking a meeting with the senior management of the electricity generation industry and British Gas. Some union leaders believe the response of both the TUC and the Labour party to the pit closures has been inadequate. They believe there is now a real chance to force a U-turn in government policy and perhaps even to bring down the government.</p>

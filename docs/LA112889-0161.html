			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COUNTERPOINT  </P> <P> Following are excerpts from an article by Ken Davis of the Hartford Courant  exploring the views of those favoring and opposing the idea of college athletes  receiving more compensation:  </P> <P> "They (National Collegiate Athletic Assn. schools) cannot turn their eyes away  from the fact that most of the scholarship athletes come either from poor rural  families or inner-city areas," said Ernest Chambers, a Nebraska state senator  who has taken up the cause of student athletes. "To ignore that poverty and the  vulnerability of these young men is mind boggling . . . . They come to school  penniless and we keep them impoverished just to keep up the false impression of  amateurism."  </P> <P> "There's no question that athletes, especially the minority kids in football  and basketball, have this need," University of Hartford Athletic Director Don  Cook said. "To ignore it is not facing the problem. It only subjects you to all  the problems that a Barry Switzer experienced (at Oklahoma) -- although I'm  sure with him that's just the tip of the iceberg . . . . We've got to face the  reality of it. Obviously, the student athlete is not being treated properly."  </P></p>

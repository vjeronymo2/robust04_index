			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Short Bros lifts operating profit despite sales fall SHORT BROTHERS, the Belfast-based aircraft and missiles manufacturer, yesterday reported a Pounds 5m rise in operating profits to over Pounds 21m for the year ending January 31. However, general recession in the aerospace industry took its toll on sales which fell by Pounds 11m to just over Pounds 381m. Short, Norther Ireland's largest private employer, was bought by Bombadier, the Canadian transport group, in October 1989. A Pounds 200m equipment and plant modernisation programme is under way, with Pounds 134m spent to date. Mr Laurent Beaudoin, chairman, said the business environment in both aerospace and defence was likely to 'remain difficult' for at least the next 12 months. He added: 'A programme of cutbacks by Short's major customers and reductions in defence budgets have left us with no option but to reduce the Short's workforce significantly.' Job numbers fell from 9,892 to 8,797 at January 31 and so far this year there have been a further 645 redundancies.</p>

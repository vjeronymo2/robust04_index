			<p>BFN     [Text] Sudanese Foreign Minister Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih  has declared that the government supports Yemeni unity, and  calls for an end to fighting between brothers to preserve the  gains and resources of the brotherly Yemeni people. He pointed  out the need for dialogue to preserve Yemeni unity. In an  interview with AL-SUDAN AL-HADITH, published today, Dr.  Abu-Salih added that Sudan is endeavoring to achieve Arab and  Islamic solidarity and transcend differences, while directing  its attention against designs aimed at destroying Arab unity.  He explained that Sudan had taken some earnest steps in this  respect, through dialogue and adherence to initiatives directed  at improving relations among Arab states, the Gulf Cooperation  Council and the Arab Maghreb states. The foreign minister  declared that a number of western states have begun to make  contacts with Sudan to restore their previous relations. He  pointed to the change in relations with the U.S. Government  after the visit of Madeline Albright. He added that those  changes came as a result of the realization by those states of  Sudan's firm stands toward respecting the sovereignty of states,  and noninterference in their internal affairs.</p>

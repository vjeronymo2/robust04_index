			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian project 'is dead, but won't lie down' - Bernard Simon explains reluctance to mothball the troubled Hibernia development ANY INVESTOR interested in a cheap but potentially troublesome stake in Canada's most ambitious energy project should get in touch with the government in Ottawa. A warm and generous welcome is assured. The authorities have been scouring the international oil industry for someone to take up to 25 per cent of the Hibernia field, now under construction off the south-east coast of Newfoundland. The stake became available last summer when Gulf Canada Resources decided to walk away from Hibernia to concentrate on projects in western Canada with faster and more certain returns. Despite an array of financial incentives, the response from other investors has so far been less than enthusiastic. Those wooed have ranged from the big US oil companies to Mitsubishi of Japan and Finland's Neste Oy. Texaco showed some interest but then backed away, citing prohibitive insurance costs. Latest reports suggest that Arkansas-based Murphy Oil may buy a small shareholding. Should no one step forward to take the full 25 per cent (as seems probable), the project is likely to survive only if the government itself becomes a shareholder. The Ottawa government thus faces the unpleasant choice between pulling the plug on a high-profile mega-project or pumping even more taxpayers' money into a commercially and technologically risky venture. Hibernia seemed a viable proposition when it was first discovered in 1979 during the days of soaring oil prices. More recently however, the CDollars 5.2bn (Pounds 2.65bn) project has been propelled more by the politics of regional development than by sound commercial judgment. Handsome government incentives, including CDollars 1bn in grants and CDollars 1.7bn in loan guarantees, lured a four-member consortium led by Mobil Oil Canada to start developing the field in 1990. Even with these subsidies however, the partners require an oil price of between USDollars 18 and Dollars 21 a barrel (at 1990 prices) to earn a reasonable return from Hibernia's expected output of 110,000 barrels a day. World oil prices are at present hovering around Dollars 18 a barrel. Gulf's financial contributions come to an end this week when total spending on Hibernia passes the CDollars 1bn mark. The Calgary-based company has sunk about CDollars 200m into the project in the past three years and still faces a write-down of up to CDollars 300m on its investment. The company failed to find a buyer for its stake and after an exhaustive study, it urged the government and the remaining three partners - Mobil, Chevron and Petro-Canada - to mothball Hibernia. But the others chose to press ahead, although construction work was slowed down, delaying initial production from 1996 to 1997. The advantages of Hibernia for Mobil and Petro-Canada include deductibility of future outlays from their rising tax liabilities. Furthermore, the Geological Survey of Canada estimates that the Hibernia field contains only about 15 per cent of reserves in the area. Mr Jim Doak, analyst at First Marathon Securities in Toronto, says the remaining partners may have an eye on future participation in other fields, such as Avalon and Terra Nova. Avalon's reserves are thought to be substantially higher than Hibernia's 685m barrels. Terra Nova is smaller, but could probably be exploited from a floating production platform rather than the costly and risky concrete gravity-base system being built for Hibernia. The pressure to stick with Hibernia is most intense on the government. Not only is a general election looming later this year, but the offshore development is at present one of the few generators of economic activity in Newfoundland. The province's economy has shrunk by more than 3 per cent in the past two years, largely as a result of a moratorium on cod fishing designed to replenish depleted stocks in the North Atlantic. The government estimates that cancellation of the Hibernia project would push the province's real domestic product down by 3 per cent between 1992 and 1996. According to the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council, Hibernia 'is almost indispensable to the provincial economy'. At a time when unemployment in Newfoundland is running at almost 22 per cent, Hibernia has created about 1,100 jobs, mainly related to construction of the concrete production platform. Not everyone is convinced however, that Hibernia is the best way of securing the province's long-term prosperity. Mr Wade Locke, an economics professor at Memorial University in St John's, is convinced that Newfoundland could have generated more economic activity simply by investing the CDollars 1bn government grant in the bond market and spending the interest on job-creation schemes. Much of the engineering and construction work for Hibernia is taking place outside Newfoundland, mainly in Paris and Montreal. Mr Locke also questions whether technology used for Hibernia's concrete gravity base or the site where the production platform is being assembled will be of much use for future oilfields off the east coast. Whatever the economic arguments in favour of killing the project, Hibernia has built up so much momentum that it would take a brave politician to try to stop it now. In response to an editorial titled 'Hibernia Death Watch' in the Globe and Mail newspaper last week, Mr John Crosbie, fisheries minister and Newfoundland's most vociferous supporter in the government, declared that 'she's dead, but she won't lie down'. Mr Crosbie asserted bluntly that 'one of this century's great frontier projects will go forward despite the difficulties and obstacles'.</p>

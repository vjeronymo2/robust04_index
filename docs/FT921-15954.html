			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Exam scheme for 14-year-olds to be tested in June SECONDARY SCHOOLS in England and Wales are to be invited to join the pilot scheme for new national examinations in mathematics and science devised for 14-year-olds, Mr Tim Eggar, education minister, announced yesterday. The exams will become compulsory for all 14-year-olds from next year as part of the government's drive to raise educational standards through the national curriculum. Pupils entered for the national exams under the pilot scheme will sit three one-hour written papers each in mathematics and science in June. Papers in English and technology will be added when the exams become compulsory next year, with papers in history and geography to be added in 1994. Described by Mr Eggar as 'academically rigorous and easy to administer', the exams are mainly timed, written tests. They will be taken simultaneously by all pupils under controlled conditions in their schools. Marking is to be done by teachers in the school, subject to audit by the examination groups responsible for setting the GCSE examinations. Results will be available to parents and the government hopes that schools will publicise them. But since participation is voluntary, publication of results is not mandatory. The response from the teaching unions was hostile. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said that the tests were 'ill-conceived'. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers advised his 120,000 members not to volunteer for supervising the tests without cast-iron guarantees of extra resources. Schools in England need at least Pounds 3.5bn to deal with building and repair work, Mr Derek Fatchett, Labour's schools spokesman, said yesterday. The Department of Education said an increase of 15 per cent in capital allocations for local authorities next year to more than Pounds 700m showed the strength of the government's commitment.

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Real life upsets the cosy world of EC machinations: The work of the conferences on political and monetary union risks being overtaken by events INCONVENIENTLY for Eurocrats, time refuses to stand still while the European Community redesigns itself. The Community's two inter-governmental conferences (IGCs) on political and monetary union, which in nearly four months have produced some tentative compromises but no firm deals, risk being buffeted by events in the real world - Chancellor Helmut Kohl's domestic political setbacks, the prospect of a British general election, and, from the outside, the banging of more applicants on the Community's door. Eastern Europe's expectations of what the EC can and should do for it continue to gallop ahead of the reality of what the Community is offering. Before the ink was dry on economic co-operation agreements, eastern Europe was clamouring for fully-fledged political association and free trade accords. Last week, Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, bent under the pressure and proposed 'affiliate' membership for countries craving the political security of belonging to the Community before being able to meet the economic test of membership. The IGCs were studiously ignoring the implications of the Community growing to 24 members, the Commissioner complained. Mr Andriessen's idea that countries could select certain EC activities in which to participate as full members may speed membership bids from European Free Trade Association (Efta) countries. Just when Efta's frustration is reaching breaking point at being offered only a voice on the key EC legislation - that would form the core of the planned European Economic Area (EEA) - up pops someone in Brussels with a scheme to give them a vote. Talks are being held today between senior officials and next month between ministers to save the EEA negotiations; but if they fail, Sweden may not be the only Efta country this summer to follow Austria in applying to join the EC club. In fact, the IGC on political union has now agreed on a kind of variable ers. This divides Community activities into three: Standard policies (still largely economic) set by the standard machinery of the Council/Parliament legislating on Commission proposals. Common foreign and security policy with a relatively small role for the Commission and almost none for the Parliament. A purely inter-governmental area of co-operation on police and judicial issues such as drugs, crime and immigration. For all, actual and potential members alike, the most sensitive aspect is defence, on which there are now three competing drafts. The Luxembourg presidency proposes that defence matters 'can' be wholly or partly dealt with by the Western European Union (WEU) with a review in 1996; the Netherlands, backed by the UK, proposes that all defence matters 'will' be treated by WEU; and France wants some EC involvement, at summit level, in defence from the outset and the 1996 review to create a common EC defence policy. This internal debate will divide outsiders. East Europeans, frustrated by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's refusal to offer them any formal association, may want to see a common EC defence policy that one day might cover them, while neutral Efta countries hope no such policy will emerge. Another indicator of how supranational the Community may become is the degree to which the European Parliament is given a say in EC law-making equal to that enjoyed by the Council of Ministers. Luxembourg proposes giving MEPs, whose present amending powers depend crucially on Commission support, a right of 'co-decision' on a new category of framework laws. This goes too far for countries such as Britain and Denmark, but has been strongly attacked by the Parliament which (along with Germany) wants co-decision across the board and by the Commission which sees its brokering role in legislation disappearing. The Luxembourg plan calls for a 'conciliation committee' between the Parliament and Council - akin to the Capitol Hill 'conferences' that resolve deadlocks between the two houses of the US Congress - with the Commission shut out. In comparison to the feverish discussions on political union, the IGC on economic and monetary union (Emu) has been more akin to a leisurely academic seminar. Perhaps because of this, the heat has been taken out of the crucial transition question for the UK government: how to sign an Emu treaty without committing itself to a timetable to join in a single currency? There now seems to be near-consensus on two negative principles, according to one IGC negotiator, in which no country could be compelled by the others into Emu, and no country could defy others in insisting on joining Emu. Were it not, therefore, for approaching UK election fever, Prime Minister John Major's government could feel comfortable. This is, however, a side-show for the other 11 countries which are still arguing about what economic discipline is needed to bolster a monetary union, and what powers the planned European central bank should have before it starts running a single currency. Germany has so far played it tough. Will it soften with the weakening fortunes of the D-mark and Mr Kohl? Or will the Chancellor feel he cannot risk further trouble at home by making European compromises? Many in Brussels fear the latter may prove true.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii) Discuss the appropriateness of a summer program to address the identified needs/problems and to achieve the specified objectives. This should include discussion of long-term effects (i.e., safe houses established during the summer will continue to operate during the school year; vacant lots or abandoned playgrounds will be restored to community use; neighborhood volunteers will continue activities initiated during the summer; etc.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Participants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Programs must provide quality service opportunities and living allowances (stipends) for between 20 and 150 Summer of Safety participants. The $1000 post-service benefit, which may be used only for higher educational purposes, including loan repayment, or certain types of vocational training, will be administered by the Corporation through the National Service Trust Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants must be at least 17 years old, and demonstrate leadership potential. Programs should seek to enroll participants from diverse racial, economic, and educational backgrounds (including entering and current college students, recent graduates, and youth not attending college), and include residents from the community where the program will be conducted. Participant selection decisions are made solely by the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Programs should be willing to enroll participants from other parts of the country not simply from the host community. Grant funds may be used for transportation costs for eligible participants. The Corporation may provide names and addresses of potential participants to programs. In addition, programs may be contacted by potential participants who are recruited nationally. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The physical safety of participants must be of paramount concern, and programs that do not take appropriate measures to protect the safety of participants will not be approved. (See Section 2c, Service Activities, for further information). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, proposals must include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A description of plans to recruit, screen, select, and assign a qualified and diverse pool of participants, including individuals from the community served, to carry out the agreed-upon service activities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A description of the training that will be provided to participants to ensure successful involvement in the summer program; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A discussion of how the entire summer experience for participants orientation, training, service activity, etc._will develop useful skills, teach them about public safety, promote active citizenship, and strengthen their commitment to service; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) A description of policies and practices designed to assure the safety of participants while carrying out service activities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) A description of plans to provide appropriate child care for certain program participants. Preliminary guidance may be found in the Corporation's proposed regulations (See Appendix 5); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These plans may be revised prior to final grant approval, as a result of requirements in these areas that will be set forth in the Corporation's final regulations; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) A description of arrangements that will be made to provide appropriate program and participant liability coverage; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) A description of arrangements that will be made to cover on-the-job injuries to participants, such as linkage with the State Workers' Compensation Program or other appropriate accident and injury policies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Service Activities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Summer of Safety projects must have the clear purpose of strengthening the ability of the community to respond to problems of crime, violence and fear through service. Projects must include at least 8 weeks and 381 hours of full-time service activity for participants, including the period of orientation and training. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ideal Summer of Safety service program will develop a range of service activities that depends on the community's needs and the resources the various members of the partnership bring to the overall initiative. For example, some activities may involve direct work with police officers or community groups to solve specific crime problems; others may involve work with victim assistance programs, including efforts to help special groups such as victims of family violence or seniors. Still others might involve providing training in crime prevention or conflict resolution to parents and children. An approach to developing a program and examples of possible service activities may be found in Appendix 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants will be assigned to specific service activities determined by the program based on the needs identified within the community and the skill level of participants. Teams of participants can readily be trained and assigned to take on a number of distinct activities as part of a broad community effort. Individual assignments to appropriate activities are also acceptable. Appropriate training and effective supervision of participant service activity are important to project success. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, successful proposals will: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Describe the specific service activities that will be conducted by the program during the summer; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Identify the number of stipended participants and unstipended volunteers who will serve in each of the identified activities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Discuss the background, skills or other factors related to assigning participants to the various service activities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Describe the specific training which will be necessary to enable participants to carry out respective service assignments; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: KIO bid to sell Ebro stake runs into difficulties A BID by the Kuwait Investment Office to sell its controlling stake in the profitable domestic food company Ebro ran into difficulties yesterday when Mr Javier de la Rosa, the KIO's former chief Spanish executive, threatened to block the deal. Mr de la Rosa, who owns 12 per cent of Ebro and is at the centre of a lawsuit over the KIO's troubled investment in Spain, issued a writ claiming he hadthe right to buy the 36 per cent stake in Ebro. Grupo Torras, the KIO's Spanish holding company which applied for receivership last month claiming debts of Dollars 1.5bn and losses of Dollars 4bn, has awarded the mandate to sell its Ebro stake to Credit Suisse First Boston and hopes to realise more than Dollars 340m from its disposal. A spokesman for Mr de la Rosa said the Barcelona-based financier had obtained a written agreement from Torras in April last year for a first option on its stake in the food company. Mr de la Rosa, who was the architect of the Ebro stake, severed his links with the KIO in May last year when new management took over at the KIO's London's headquarters and at Torras. Torras said: 'de la Rosa's writ cannot be considered legal.' According to Torras, Mr de la Rosa's right over the stake was agreed between him and Mr Jorge Nunez, then Torras's managing director. The agreement came days before both men severed links with the KIO, Torras claimed. Last Friday, Torras initiated criminal proceedings against Mr de la Rosa and six other former Torras and KIO executives, including Mr Nunez, alleging that they had committed financial irregularities which had involved Torras in losses of more than Dollars 860m. Most of Torras's shareholding in Ebro is pledged to creditor banks as collateral for outstanding loans. The main creditors, Bank of America, Chase Manhattan, Sumitomo and Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, will have to wait for three to four for Credit Suisse to conduct due diligence of Torras's stake in Ebro. The Torras equity is worth about Dollars 200m at market prices because Ebro's share value has been penalised by Torras's difficulties as well as the market depression. Independent analysts put the value of a controlling stake in Ebro at close to twice that amount. It is not clear whether the Spanish government will allow Ebro to be acquired by a non-Spanish company. The company, the biggest food group in Spain, controls 54 per cent of the domestic sugar market and is held to be Europe's leading rice producer.</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Chambers warn against complacency despite recovery signs FRESH evidence that Britain is slowly climbing out of recession came from economic survey results yesterday. Yet there were also indications of increasing insolvencies among manufacturing companies, prompting the British Chambers of Commerce to warn the government against complacency. 'Insolvency levels are still too high,' said Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, which yesterday published the latest quarterly insolvency figures on behalf of the Department of Trade and Industry. 'The government should not be too complacent,' added Mr Brown. 'There has to be concern over the persistent shrinkage of the UK's manufacturing base.' A total of 5,195 companies collapsed in April, May and June, a reduction of 8.9 per cent on the 5,705 insolvencies recorded in the first quarter and a recent peak of 6,999 in the third quarter of last year, the BCC figures show. Sectors such as metals, engineering, textiles and clothing are suffering disproportionately. A total of 1,149 manufacturing companies failed in the first quarter of this year - the last date for which more detailed sectoral figures are available - compared with 1,420 in last year's fourth quarter. Mr Brown said many capital-intensive companies were suffering as a result of low levels of investment in recent years. The number of individuals who went bankrupt fell sharply by 15.3 per cent between the first two quarters of this year - from 10,233 to 8,663. The latter figure, however, was only 1.9 per cent below that for the corresponding period last year. Mr Brown said falling levels of insolvencies were good for business, employee and consumer confidence. He said: 'This has got be good news. If fewer people are being made bankrupt this has got to have a knock-on effect.' He added: 'This third consecutive quarterly fall in the number of corporate insolvencies provides further evidence that recovery is under way.' A survey by Trade Indemnity, the trade credit insurance company, also provided evidence of recovery. The number of companies working at less than 50 per cent capacity fell to 27 per cent of the sample of more than 500 companies, compared with 31 per cent in the first quarter. The proportion working 'flat out' rose to 16 per cent from 10 per cent. During the first three months of this year payments to companies were on average 24 days late, compared with 25 and 26 days respectively in the two previous quarters. Exporters face much longer delays in receiving payment. The number of companies being paid on time shrank from 19 per cent of Trade Indemnity's sample in the first quarter to 9 per cent in the second quarter. The company said: 'Constant vigilance on export debtors is still essential while recessionary conditions persist in Europe and Japan.'</p>

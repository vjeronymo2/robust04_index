			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USTR invites submissions from interested parties concerning foreign government procurement practices that should be considered in developing the annual report. Pursuant to section 305(d)(5) of the Trade Agreements Act, submissions are sought from any interested parties in the United States and in countries that are signatories to the Agreement, as well as in other foreign countries whose products or services are acquired in significant amounts by the United States Government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each submission should provide, in order, the following general information: (1) The party submitting the information; (2) the foreign country or countries that are the subject of the submission and the entities of each subject country's government whose practices are being identified, and (3) the U.S. products or services that are affected by the non-compliance or discrimination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each submission should provide, in order, the following specific information on non-compliance with the Agreement or discrimination: (1) The circumstances under which discrimination has occurred, including information regarding the date and nature of procurement(s) where discrimination was encountered; (2) policies or practices which are deemed to be discriminatory (where possible, include copies of discriminatory laws, policies or regulations), and (3) the extent to which noncompliance with the Code or discrimination has impeded the ability of U.S. suppliers to participate in procurements on terms comparable to those available to suppliers of the country in question when they are seeking to sell goods or services to the United States Government. Wherever possible, submissions should address the extent to which countries identified: (i) Use sole-sourcing or otherwise noncompetitive procedures for procurements that could have been conducted using competitive procedures; (ii) conduct what normally would have been one procurement as two or more procurements, in order to decrease the anticipated contact value below the Agreement's value threshold or to make the procurement less attractive to U.S. businesses; (iii) announce procurement opportunities without adequate time for U.S. businesses to submit bids, and (iv) employ specifications in such a way as to limit the ability of U.S. suppliers to participate in procurements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, each submission should: (1) Identify requirements of the Agreement which are not being observed by the country identified or describe how the country identified has maintained a significant and persistent pattern or practice of discrimination in government procurement of non-Code-Covered goods; (2) identify the specific impact of the discriminatory policy or practice on United States businesses (including an estimate of the value of market opportunities lost and, if any, the cost of preparing bids which are rejected during the course of a procurement evaluation for discriminatory reasons), and (3) describe the extent to which the products or services of the country identified are acquired in significant amounts by the United States Government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Frederick L.

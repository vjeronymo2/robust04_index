			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Management: Who inherits the crown? - Executive misfortune at Disney highlights the need for a succession plan Last month Jeffrey Katzenberg, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, was almost mauled by a lion. Katzenberg appeared shaken but unhurt after the lion - brought on stage at a video retailers show in Los Angeles to celebrate Disney's extremely successful animated film 'The Lion King' - grabbed his leg and refused to let go. Yet it could have been a nasty incident. If anything had happened to Katzenberg, it would have been the third piece of serious misfortune to strike Disney's top management in almost as many months. In April, Disney's president and chief operating officer, Frank Wells, was killed in a helicopter accident. Then, in mid-July, chairman Michael Eisner was rushed to hospital for quadruple heart bypass surgery. The loss of Wells was regarded by analysts and shareholders as a big blow for Disney. He was Eisner's right-hand man and played a critical role in the day-to-day running of the company. Almost four months after Wells' death, Disney has yet to replace him, a fact that only made news of 52-year-old Eisner's emergency heart surgery especially troubling to shareholders. After the surgery, doctors were hopeful about the prognosis for the Disney chairman, who is expected back at work full-time by the middle of this month. Yet their optimism could not stop Wall Street from speculating about how badly Eisner's incapacitation had affected the company. Although Disney insists it has been business as usual since Eisner's emergency operation, the company was naturally caught off guard by the developments. Some companies make preparations for the unexpected death or serious illness of senior managers, particularly chairmen or chief executives. But how many are likely to be prepared for the loss of their two most senior officers in such a short space of time? Ernie Glickman, managing partner of Harbridge House, a US consulting firm owned by Coopers &amp; Lybrand which works with clients on succession planning, says that although the chances of losing two top executives are very slim - assuming they are not foolish enough to travel together - companies should be prepared for the worst. 'You can't assume that just one tragedy will happen. You've got to have succession plans in place right down the management hierarchy,' he says. But many companies, even if they have some form of succession planning, rarely take it to the very top. One of the main reasons is that if chief executives have a successor in mind they prefer to keep the name to themselves, except where the number two is clearly being groomed for the top job. If they publicly announce their choice, they run the risk of alienating the other senior executives who might have considered themselves candidates for the succession. One way around that problem, says Glickman, is for chief executives to let only their boards of directors, or board chairmen, know of their plans. 'Good leaders say: 'I've got to make sure my chairman of the board clearly knows, if anything should happen to me, who should step in and run the company.'' But, he says, most chief executives do not follow this common-sense policy, because they cannot envisage life at the company without them. 'The egos of CEOs can get in the way of principles of good leadership,' says Glickman. Management consultants admit that the reluctance of chief executives to prepare for a smooth transition of power is understandable. Although one of top management's main responsibilities should be to plan for succession at every level of the company, few bosses wish to think about when they themselves may have to surrender power, willingly or unwillingly. A recent survey by the New York executive recruitment firm Korn/Ferry International found that among 348 large companies, only 34 per cent of chief executives had identified their successors either publicly or privately. Mortimer Feinberg, head of BFS Psychological Associates, a New York consulting firm which specialises in executive selection and succession, says that even if senior executives are sometimes forced to stop and consider succession issues, they soon drop the subject as quickly as they can. 'The CEO does not want to talk about it . . . because it's like taking out a life insurance policy.' At companies where a chairman or a chief executive is an especially dominant figure, succession issues can be particularly troublesome in the event of an incapacitating illness or death. At Time Warner in late 1992, the death of the entertainment group's chairman and founder, Steve Ross, was immediately followed by an internal clash among senior management. That clash led to a significant shake-up of Time Warner's board - even though the chief executive, Gerald Levin, had been hand-picked by the ailing Ross as his successor long before. Here, the void left by the departure of the charismatic Ross created special problems for Time Warner - in particular, how to end the long-standing conflict within the group between top executives from Time Inc and Warner Communications, the two companies which merged in 1990. Ultimately, Levin, a former Time executive, chose to settle the matter by engineering board changes which led to the departure of eight directors, including key members of the Warner camp. The succession process at Time Warner might have been smoother if the company had spread the management load from the start. Terry Fergus, a partner at KPMG Peat Marwick in New York, says that, increasingly, big US companies are sharing the burden of management at the top among more key executives, partly to ensure that there is a team in place to keep things going if anyone dies or is taken seriously ill. 'More companies are going with an office of the chairman, or an office of the president  - where there are three or four people actually running the company.' Many management consultants go further, recommending that the process of succession planning be institutionalised. 'You make it part of the culture that you're always reviewing succession planning twice a year,' says Feinberg. But few companies follow this policy, he says. 'Most just pay lip-service to it.' If most succession planning is aimed at handling sudden death or resignation, serious and prolonged illness can cause problems which are almost as severe. The advice of most management experts in the event of serious illness at the top is for companies to acknowledge the difficulties presented by the situation as quickly as possible; to let shareholders, Wall Street and the media know of the problem and to take action to ensure the illness does not interfere with the smooth running of the company. Two contrasting examples of how well US companies deal with illness at the top were provided recently by Tenneco, the industrial conglomerate, and TLC Beatrice, the foods group. Tenneco faced the sudden prospect of change in January 1993, when its chairman, Michael Walsh, was diagnosed as suffering from brain cancer. At the time, Walsh was in the middle of completing a dramatic overhaul of the company, so his health was critical to Tenneco's future. Although the immediate announcement of his illness unsettled investors sufficiently to slice 5 per cent off the company's share price in a single day, Walsh was praised for quickly informing his company and its shareholders of his predicament. Fortunately Tenneco had a strong number two in Dana Mead, who had been chosen in 1992 as an eventual successor to Walsh. Mead was promoted to chief executive when Walsh stepped down because of his health last February, and when he died in May the transition was a smooth one. In contrast, when the chairman of TLC Beatrice, Reginald Lewis, was diagnosed as suffering from brain cancer in late 1992, he chose to keep the information to himself. His death in January 1993 was a shock to all but a few of his most intimate advisers. Although Lewis had set up a special management team to handle the transition of power when he was diagnosed as having cancer, the first year after his death was a difficult one for Beatrice. Its financial position deteriorated, and Lewis's chosen successor - his half-brother Jean Fugett - eventually resigned in January 1994, creating uncertainty about the company's future. As for Walt Disney, it appears to be coping well for now, but doubts remain about how it will be affected over the longer term. As John Tinker, analyst at the New York broking firm Furman Selz, says of Eisner's illness: 'Short-term it's not an issue. It's a very strong company. A lot of the management team has been in place for a decade and some a lot longer. I don't think it affects them now. Longer-term, it becomes more of an issue. I would expect the company to rejiggle its management structure a little bit. They are going through a rate of unbelievably rapid change, and big strategic decisions have to be made.' Among those decisions is whether Disney should buy a US television network. Just before Eisner was taken ill, Disney was reported to be considering either buying, or forging a partnership with, CBS, the broadcast television group. Since Eisner's surgery, most observers believe such considerations have been put on hold. The Disney chairman's illness created problems in another way - it immediately focused attention on the vacancy in the spot previously occupied by Wells. To some observers, Eisner's decision not to appoint a new president and chief operating officer quickly was surprising, particularly because in Katzenberg the company seemed to possess an obvious successor to Wells. Since Eisner's surgery, Hollywood has been full of speculation that the ambitious Katzenberg might leave Disney if he is not offered the number two job soon. For a company which has prided itself for years on its stable management, the speculation is unsettling. It will not die down until Disney appoints a new president, a decision which cannot be made until Eisner recovers from his surgery. The decision, however, may never be taken. Eisner may stick to the original interim plan of leaving the post of president vacant - late last month, a Disney spokesman questioned whether the company really needed both a chairman and a president. Given Disney's impressive management record, it is a valid question. But with a chairman recovering from quadruple bypass heart surgery, the succession issue will not go away in a hurry.</p>

Choegyal, member of the Chinese delegation to the 50th  session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva, said that  the Chinese Government regards the equality and solidarity of  all nationalities and the practising of regional national  autonomy as basic principles in dealing with minority  nationalities issue.    He briefed the participants on China's minority  nationalities  policy, saying, "the adherence to the equality of all  nationalities is a basic principle stipulateed in China's  Constitution."    "In China, all nationalities, irrespective of their  differences in population size, level of social and economic  development, customs and practices, religious beliefs and  languages, enjoy equal status and equal rights," he said.    As China is a country with 56 nationalities, he said, the  Chinese Government always pays great attention to the  strengthening of solidarity and harmony among them.    "The government has always been careful with the protection  of the rights and the interests of minority nationalities," he  said. "In dealing with such issues, the views of the  nationalities concerned are extensively solicited and full  consultations conducted."    "The government also adopts laws as well as concrete  measures  in order to guarantee participation by minority nationalities in  the management of state and local affairs in various aspects of  social life," he added.    In addition, as certain gaps still exist in economic and  social development between areas inhabited by minority  nationalities and those inhabited by the Han nationality due to  historical, natural and geographical factors, "the Chinese  Government has always emphasized the importance of providing  necessary financial, human and material assistance to them," he  said.    Meanwhile, the Chinese Government always grants them  preferential policies in formulating programs for national  economic development. It also requires and encourages the  better-developed areas to help them, he added.    The Chinese delegate also stressed that regional national  autonomy is an important aspect of the political system provided  by the Constitution.    "The system has played an important role in protecting the  rights of the minority nationalities and in promoting the  development of these areas," he said.    The Chinese delegate pointed out that China's minority  nationalities policy has proved to be successful in the past 40  years.</p>

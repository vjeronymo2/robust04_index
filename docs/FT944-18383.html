			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Arts: Outbreak of symbolism in Leeds 'Trovatore' - Opera Not for Leeds a French grand opera of the kind acted out in Paris. While the Bastille made the loss of its music director a drama on an international scale, Opera North's general director slipped away quietly. Ian Ritchie had barely had time to settle in before his departure was being announced for a new job in Scotland without any reasons given - a case of British understatement. What this will mean for the company is not yet clear. Whatever Ritchie had time to plan, it will not have been enough to stamp any personal mark on Opera North's repertoire or house production style. His name is still listed in the programme, but only for a few more weeks. The job advertisement has already been placed for his successor, who will take over with at least one of the company's assets securely in place: the 1994/5 season looks typically adventurous. Amid a variety of obscure operas, Verdi's Il trovatore might look the odd one out, but for a company with the limited resources of Opera North it is as much a challenge as any. Finding a cast of four singers who can deliver Verdi's vocal parts to the standards that audiences now expect from recordings is difficult enough for international opera-houses, let alone a regional company with empty coffers. Having a theatre the size of the Grand at Leeds makes life easier, but the quartet that Opera North has assembled for this new production passes muster, and often more. Edmund Barham has been making his way solidly up through the central tenor roles of the repertoire and Manrico marks a new rung on his ascent, stylishly phrased in the aria, clarion strong in the following cabaletta (high B's rather than C's, if I am not mistaken). His is not an Italian voice, but then nor were the others. Katerina Kudriavchenko has a backwardly-placed soprano, which lacks open, Italianate colours, but her Leonora offered a decent compromise between the lyrical and dramatic sides of role. Ettore Kim's baritone is tightly-controlled with a fast vibrato, at its best when the Conte di Luna was being strong and forthright. None of them found much time for acting - a luxury in this opera at the best of times, though one might have expected Opera North, with its reputation for integrated dramatic performances, to reassess the priorities. Sally Burgess's post-Freudian Azucena, wrestling with the demons in her conscience, came nearest to a newly thought-out portrayal. Her mezzo's centre of gravity lies a little high for the part, but has searing top notes as compensation. Clive Bayley related Ferrando's narration vividly. At the expense of some unidiomatic literalness in his reading of the score (Leonora's soaring lines at the end of Part 2 neatly-clipped, with no sense of grandeur) Paul Daniel gave Verdi his essential demon-driven urgency. Brilliant wind sounds pierced the orchestral ensemble, just as melodramatic shafts of lighting periodically burst forth from Inga Levant's gloomy production. Night and fire - two of the opera's main motifs - were never far away. Indeed, the production suffered a nasty outbreak of symbolism early on: swords of vengeance staked in the ground, a harp for the troubadour, a huge photo of two infant brothers which Azucena hauled around the stage. Later it contented itself with supplying a potent background of a community savagely at war with itself - or was that also meant to be symbolic of a company that seems to be in the wars backstage itself at the moment? At the Grand Theatre, Leeds, until October 14; then Sheffield, Nottingham and Manchester</p>

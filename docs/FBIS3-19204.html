Over the weekend Lower Austria's Governor Erwin  Proell demanded that the IAEA [International Atomic Energy  Agency] check whether Western safety standards can be achieved  at least at a rudimentary level during the expansion of the  nuclear power plant. In addition, Proell called for a referendum  on nuclear power in the Czech Republic.    On Sunday [13 March] Johannes Hawlik, environment spokesman  of the Viennese section of the Austrian People's Party, called  for an antinuclear policy including an antinuclear coordinator  in the chancellor's office the establishement of a 1-billion  schilling Eastern Ecological Fund to promote alternative  energies and higher energy efficiency.    Peter Marizzi, federal manager of the Social Democratic  Party  of Austria, said that in the future the Austrian people will  think twice whether they should buy products of the U.S. company  Westinghouse, which reequips Temelin with safety technology on  the basis of Eximbank financing.    The Global 2000 environmentalist organization is taking hope  from a letter by Democratic Congressman John D. Dingell, dated  10 March 1994, to Eximbank President Kenneth Brody. In this  letter Dingell, chairman of the Oversight and Investigations  Subcommittee of the House of Representatives, requests all  relevant documents for a "review" of the Eximbank guarantees for  Temelin by 25 March. Global 2000 doubts that the Eximbank even  has the requested documents.</p>

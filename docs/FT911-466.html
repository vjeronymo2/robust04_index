			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: The jewellery that packs a punch - The creativity of the younger designers LONG ago, when our mothers were young, the only jewellery to be seen out in was real jewellery. Those were the days when all life's great rites of passage - the 18th birthday, the engagement, the marriage, the first child, the anniversaries - were marked by judicious visits to the family jeweller to find suitable offerings with which to celebrate the day. It wasn't until the 1920s, when Coco Chanel imbued her loops of artificial 'pearls' with a chic beyond price, that costume jewellery began to take off. While the design of the conventional 'haut jouallerie' remained static, relying on the inherent value of the materials and the size of the stones to do the selling, costume jewellery took off, appealing to those for whom design was more important than worth. While costume jewellery flourished, there were other tastes that needed satisfying, and in the 1960s it became clear that the role of jewellery was changing. Chanel had intuitively sensed that the days when jewellery was primarily a means of displaying wealth and power were over, and cleverly tapped the desire for some highly fashionable, modish women to cock a snook at accepted values with her outrageous fakes, but there was now a role for jewellery with high artistic content. Jewellery didn't need to convey wealth or status; it could be an outlet for serious creative talent. We began to see a blossoming of talent among young designers whose work was genuinely creative, even innovative, part art, part craft, part technical skill. Whereas much high street jewellery used to be churned out by manufacturers content to produce designs that machines could handle, the artist jeweller was much more concerned with the excitements of genuine innovation than with the intrinsic worth of the materials used. Young designers began to turn to semi-precious stones, to materials like wood and stone, rubber and paper, excited by new shapes and forms. The Goldsmiths' Company, sensing that things were changing fast, began to foster exhibitions in which the work of young jewellers could be seen and bought. The work was often astonishing value for money - young designers working from home or small workshops, usually ill-informed on matters of time sheets and overheads, sold wonderfully creative, innovative work for very low sums. Over the years, the Goldsmiths' Company's annual touring exhibitions and the host of art/craft galleries that sprang up all over the country have done a great deal both to find a market for the artists' work and to introduce the public to these new and sometimes intriguing jewellery forms. Galleries such as Electrum, in London's South Molton Street, were the pioneers of this movement, providing a platform for the most creative and avant-garde talents. Today, jewellers like Gerda Flockinger, Jane Allen, Karl Bartosik and Wendy Ramshaw have international reputations and have opened the eyes of many to the potential excitement of truly innovative jewellery. The establishment jewellers, too, have had to adapt to changing times. Modern-minded jewellers have needed to create affordable lines for the growing legion of working women. At Tiffany's, Rosa Monckton says they always have a line of jewellery that the working woman can buy when she feels she deserves a reward. 'When she gets promoted or lands a new job, she will spend anything up to about Pounds 1,000 on a piece by Paloma Picasso or an Elsa Peretti to add a spark to her designer suit.' At Garrard and Mappin &amp; Webb, they began to notice that the call for tiaras and diamond pendants was no longer pressing enough to sustain a modern business. They have introduced lines that might tempt a woman out window-shopping or a chap who wants to woo but doesn't have a trust fund to back him. As more women than ever are going out to work, the demand for real jewellery that packs something of a fashionable punch has grown - they need pieces that can take through from the school-run first thing in the morning, to the boardroom meeting and on to dinner in a restaurant. Even the grandest of grand Bond Street names have found the last few months tough going, and there is an increasing realisation that though the very rich will always be with us (and at Boucheron, interestingly, they have found that sales of the very high-priced items have suffered less than sales lower down the scale), there may well not be enough of them to keep them in the style to which they have grown accustomed. Changing times need changing attitudes, and the challenge for the big jewellers is to make sure that the women who feels in need of a little 'retail therapy' chooses to find it with them rather than in among the designer jackets. Not only does she now have the confidence to buy her jewellery for herself rather than waiting for her lover or her husband to do it for her, but she makes a much more demanding buyer - value alone is not enough to bring the credit cards out, what she wants is something that speaks of her discerning taste, her wit, her chic as well.</p>

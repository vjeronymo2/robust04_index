			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: New York Not for the first time, the US bond market is starting the week like a paralysed rabbit caught in the glare of a car's headlamps. The onrush of the next Federal Reserve tightening transfixed the market last Friday: the April employment report, with its strong gains in job numbers, wiped more than two points off the price of the 30-year Treasury bond, driving the yield to over 7.5 per cent. With the Fed choosing not to act last Friday, the market has been left grappling with the likely timing of the next interest rate increase. This will happen today, in the view of some on Wall Street, or at the latest on Tuesday of next week, when the Federal Open Market Committee holds its next meeting to discuss interest rate policy. By the time the committee meets, it will also have the latest retail sales data and producer and consumer price figures at its disposal. The April producer price index, due to be announced this Thursday, is expected to be up by 0.1 to 0.2 per cent, after a rise of 0.2 per cent in March, while the consumer price index is expected to rise by 0.3 per cent, as in each of the previous two months. Retail sales in April are expected to have risen by 0.3 to 0.4 per cent, moderating slightly from the levels of the previous two months.</p>

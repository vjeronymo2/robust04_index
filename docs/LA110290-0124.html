			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MCMARTIN PROSECUTOR ATTENDED THE SCHOOL  </P> <P> One of the two prosecutors in the retrial of the McMartin Pre-School  molestation case attended the nursery as a child, a fact the district  attorney's office did not disclose until Thursday, three months after the case  ended in a mistrial.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty.  </P> <P> Pam Ferrero attended the preschool for a brief time in the late 1950s, before  chief McMartin defendant Raymond Buckey was born, said Sandi Gibbons, a  spokeswoman for Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner.  </P> <P> Buckey's defense attorney, Danny Davis, said it was quite likely that some of  the teachers and former teachers cross-examined by Ferrero at the retrial were  her teachers at the Manhattan Beach nursery.  </P> <P> Gibbons said her office had known before the retrial that Ferrero had attended  the now-razed preschool, but felt that Ferrero's attendance there had no  relevance to her role as co-prosecutor and therefore did not disclose it.  </P></p>

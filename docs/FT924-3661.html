			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / UK draws up new plan to break EC deadlock BRITAIN is preparing new proposals aimed at breaking the deadlock on the European Community budget which hangs over the EC summit in Edinburgh this week. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is hoping that a more generous approach will win the support of Spain, which is threatening to block progress on the budget in an attempt to secure more 'cohesion' funds for poorer EC members, including Greece, Ireland, and Portugal. Spain's tough tactics are being compared in London with the pursuit of a budget rebate in the early 1980s by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister. UK officials are guardedly optimistic that a deal can be struck, probably by using the structural funds budget, the contingency fund, or both. Yesterday, Sir Leon Brittan, the European competition commissioner, said on BBC television that a deal on future financing could be reached if Britain kept its rebate but agreed to increase its proposal for the EC budget 'by a small amount'. He also said an agreement by Britain that the new European central bank should be based in Bonn would help to secure 'Britain's objectives in all other respects'. Another problem is how to meet Danish demands for exemptions from parts of the Maastricht treaty, including a deal allowing it to opt-out of a single European currency, a putative European army and European citizenship as defined in the treaty. EC foreign ministers meet in Brussels tomorrow to discuss a UK paper although no agreement is expected. Without a deal on the Danish question, British officials fear relations between EC leaders could be damaged so badly that the summit could not be salvaged. Conversely, a Danish solution would increase the chances of success on other pressing issues, notably future financing for the EC and subsidiarity. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, a UK foreign office minister, appeared pessimistic about the task at Edinburgh - perhaps deliberately so as to lower expectations. On London Weekend Television, he said EC members were 'a long way apart' on the question of future financing, while finding agreement on subsidiarity and enlargement would be a 'very difficult exercise indeed'. A British paper on the Danish issue has been criticised by Danish opposition parties, as well as five Christian Democratic leaders in Europe, including Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl. They have called for revisions in the text. These difficulties are viewed in London as inevitable but not insuperable. Britain, which chairs the rota-ting EC presidency, has worked closely with the European Council secretariat on the proposed text. It is described as an international agreement binding by law which falls short of re-opening the Maastricht treaty or requiring re-ratification by states. An EC ambassador described the document as 'tougher than expected'; other diplomats gave it a cautious welcome because it damped suspicions that the UK intended to take Denmark's side. British officials noted that the official Christian Democrat declaration in Brussels last week was less specific in its criticism of the UK text, restating old demands that the Maastricht treaty not be renegotiated. One idea floated by Mr Garel-Jones to resolve the Danish problem is to revise the Maastricht treaty at the next European inter-governmental conference in 1996 - so Denmark does not have to say it would 'never' accept the final stages of monetary union. 'The Maastricht treaty will then end. It will be modified,' Mr Garel-Jones said.

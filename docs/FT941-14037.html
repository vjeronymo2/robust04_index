			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Record annual trade surplus leaves economists disappointed Japan's trade surplus rose to a record Dollars 120.4bn (Pounds 81.3bn) in 1993, 15.5 per cent higher than forecast and up 13.6 per cent on 1992. The 1993 figure exceeded the previous record of Dollars 106.63bn, achieved the year before. The finance ministry statistics will provide the US with further ammunition in its efforts to press Japan into stimulating the economy and opening Japanese markets to imports. Japanese exports to the US during December exceeded American imports by Dollars 5.4bn, a rise of 17.3 per cent. The surplus, described by economists as surprising and disappointing, was up from Dollars 11.2bn to Dollars 12.9bn. Japanese exports in the month were Dollars 32.7bn, while imports were Dollars 19.8bn. Mr James Vestal, BZW's chief economist in Japan, said currency movements had distorted the figures. In yen terms, exports had declined and imports increased. Meanwhile, the gravity of Japan's recession was underlined by figures on money supply, up only 1.5 per cent in December compared with the same month last year. The data, published by the Bank of Japan, were in line with expectations. A broader measure of liquidity, which includes postal savings, government bonds and investment trusts, increased 2.9 per cent in December compared with 12 months previously. 'This shows the economy is still bumping along the bottom. Public bank lending has increased 12 per cent, but this represents only a fifth of all lending. Private bank lending to individuals and small businesses is up only 0.5 per cent,' said Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo. 'The question is whether private banking is subdued because of lack of demand, or because of a credit squeeze by the banks. I believe it's mainly the demand side. Once private bank lending picks up, we'll know the economy is heading for recovery.'</p>

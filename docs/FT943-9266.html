			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Estate agents see fall in house sales House sales last month fell by almost a 10th compared with July last year, says a survey of more than 4,000 estate agency offices handling about a half of all sales. The survey by the Ombudsman for Corporate Estate Agents provides further evidence of the slowdown in the housing market which has occurred since early spring. It said potential purchasers were concerned about possible rises in interest rates. Sales were also 12.1 per cent lower than June this year.</p>

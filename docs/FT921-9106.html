			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Burton Burton may have an impressive line-up of non-executives these days, but its boardroom problems are as intractable and expensive as ever. In looking to Debenhams for yet another chief executive, the group is hoping to make better use of talent within its only consistently successful retailing chain. A profound shake-up of its other stores is an urgent requirement, but that was equally the case a year or two ago. Until it finally happens, Burton's shares will doubtless remain as unfashionable as some of its clothes.</p>

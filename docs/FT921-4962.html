			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Zinc prices fell away from three-month highs on the LME on profit taking following news that the force majeure at Peru's Cajarmarquilla refinery is to be lifted next week. The market had entered an area of stiff historic resistance between Dollars 1,220 and Dollars 1,230 a tonne for three-month metal, which closed at Dollars 1209, up Dollars 11 on the day. In addition to recent production stoppages, the market is being supported by tightness of May delivery metal, dealers said. Three-month aluminium repeatedly failed to erode resistance at Dollars 1,320 a tonne and closed at the day's lows on merchant selling and long liquidation. Another rise in LME warehouse stocks is likely today following fresh arrivals of metal in Europe from the CIS. Nickel was mostly higher on short covering following Wednesday's bounce from important support at the eight-week low of Dollars 7,400 a tonne. Nymex platinum futures were higher at midday after a buying spree by locals triggered some buy-stop orders. New York arabica coffee prices were lower at midsession but May was holding above support at 68.20 cents per lb. Dealers said the market was continuing to monitor discussions about price support measures among producers in advance of ICO talks next month. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar yesterday  announced that President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada will travel  to Colombia on 14 June to attend the Fourth Ibero-American  Summit, which is to be held in Cartagena.    This will be the first time Sanchez de Lozada will attend  this forum, at which 23 presidents and chiefs of state from the  continent and Spain meet every year. The summit will last two  days.    This year the main subject of the summit will be regional  trade and democracy. The first meeting was held in Guadalajara,  Mexico. Four years ago Bolivia was represented by Jaime Paz  Zamora, who was president at that time.    Aranibar also announced that Bolivia will send a  representative to an international meeting to be held next week  within the framework of the OAS annual forum, where countries of  the continent will assess the progress made in the struggle  against drug trafficking and the cooperation between countries  to face this crime.</p>

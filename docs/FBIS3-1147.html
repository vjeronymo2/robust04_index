			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh by </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Koffigoh] I have just tendered my resignation and  that of the crisis government to the president of the Republic.  You know that the mission assigned by the Sovereign National  Conference to the transitional prime minister is essentially to  lead the country to democracy. Between the end of 1992 and the  beginning of 1993, you know that civil peace and the very  existence of the nation as an entity was seriously threatened.  It became necessary to initiate greater consultations than in  the past between the head of state and the prime minister in  order to save our country. This has been done and a crisis  government was formed on the basis of seven fundamental  principles to [words indistinct] which I had negotiated at the  time and which was accepted by the head of state.    The essential mission of the crisis government does not  differ at all from that of the transitional government. It is  the same thing; that is, to govern the country until the  installation of democratic institutions. Today we are on the  eve of the first meeting of the new National Assembly, and I  thought my mission and that of the government had ended. It is  henceforth up to the head of state who has the reigns of power  to continue his consultations to form a new government.    Of course, I am satisfied since Togo is entering into the  community of the world's democratic nations. I am very  satisfied with this. Of course, these results were achieved  without having gone through great pains. We went through  various ups and downs, including bloody events, and this is my  only point of regret; we do not have the power to bring the dead  back to life, those people whom our divisions and dissensions  killed. But concerning our performance report, we will  remember, if not this evening then in the days ahead, some of  the highlights of this transition which has been a long one.  This birth of our democracy has been long, but, thank God, the  Togolese democracy has been born all the same.    [Correspondent] Considering your experience, what advise do  you give to your successor?    [Koffigoh] I told you before it is not up to the outgoing  prime minister to define the criteria for his successor. So,  for the moment, I will limit myself to this.    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]    [Koffigoh] But I say that Togo is a nation which must get  consolidated as a nation and which has to assert itself in the  regional, subregional, and the international context as well as  among countries belonging to the United Nations. Togolese have  real problems that go beyond our petty squabbles and political  triteness and these problems must be resolved. The best way to  solve them is that each time difficulties arise ...[pauses]  there is no country in the world that does not go through  problems. But those who can contribute should be able to hold  consultations to find the best solutions. If this spirit guides  our country's march towards the future, I think we have a good  chance to emerge victorious. But if we should continue to fight  among ourselves while we forget the people, then, of course, we  will have the same difficulties in the future. I think I have  been clear enough.

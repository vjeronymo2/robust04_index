			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Eurotunnel ordered to pay more: Contractors win FFr750m a month towards disputed cost overruns EUROTUNNEL, the Anglo-French Channel tunnel operator, was ordered yesterday to pay contractors building the project FFr750m (Pounds 77m) per month towards disputed cost overruns, starting from the end of April. The order, which would treble Eurotunnel's present progress payments to contractors, was made by an independent arbitration panel, set up six months ago to help settle the dispute over contractors' demands for FFr14bn (at today's prices) of extra payments for design changes. Eurotunnel said it would review the decision to see which parts it could accept, and was preparing an appeal for arbitration at the international chamber of commerce in Brussels. The ruling was seen by analysts as a clear vindication of the claims by Transmanche Link (TML), the consortium of five UK and five French construction companies building the tunnel. Eurotunnel's share price fell by 33p to 405p in London, and by FFr3.10 to FFr40.20 in Paris. The increase in overall costs, from FFr48bn to more than FFr80bn since 1987, is due to extra safety requirements, higher specifications for greater-than-expected traffic forecasts and other design changes. The tunnel is now due to open in autumn next year, instead of in June as planned. Eurotunnel blames the contractors for the delay. Eurotunnel's decision to appeal is unlikely to cause an immediate cash crisis for the project, since TML has enough cash in hand to keep working until May or June. The arbitration panel said Eurotunnel must pay TML an extra FFr500m per month for an indefinite period, on top of the FFr250m monthly payments it now makes for work in progress and those cost overruns on which the partners have managed to agree. Eurotunnel noted that the panel confirmed the validity of its contract with TML and said it would establish by the end of next month that there was no legal basis 'arbitrarily to demand that Eurotunnel should treble its payments'. Claims for cost increases 'will be negotiated, valued and paid once substantiated under the contract', Eurotunnel added. Members of the banking syndicate which put up Pounds 6.8bn in financing for the Eurotunnel project yesterday said it was too early to say how it would be affected by the ruling. Mr Colin Comery, who represents National Westminster on the syndicate, said: 'It is a very complex ruling, and it will take a long time for our technical advisers to evaluate it'.</p>

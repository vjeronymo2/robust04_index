But  this is not true. The explanation is simple -- two years ago,  large organizations, such as the Communist Party of Belarus, the  Slavic Assembly "White Russia," the Foundation of the  Servicemen's Social Protection, and some others, decided to  merge. As was reported at the time, the purpose of that move  was to coordinate efforts intended to consolidate society. That  unification went practically unnoticed for its opponents, who  were then reveling in their victories in the battle for  "restoration" [previous word in Belarusian]. The title  "Belarusian Popular Movement" was certainly selected as an  opposition to the Popular Front, which monopolized the right to  speak on behalf of the people.    Soon, other organizations joined the NDB. The movement  gained in strength, while the Popular Front clearly  disintegrated, letting go an increasing number of "factions"  that joined small parties. The Popular Front's fate also befell  other so called democratic organizations -- the United  Democratic Party of Belarus, the Belarusian Christian Democratic  Association, DDRB [Movement for Democratic Reforms in Belarus]  -- debilitated as a result of internal strife.    At present, the NDB is undoubtedly the largest and most  influential political bloc. Our correspondent met with its  leader, Sergey Gaydukevich.    [Gukovskiy] Behind the resignation of Stanislav Shushkevich,  many see the efforts of the NDB...    [Gaydukevich] This is not exactly true. There were a lot  more votes against the legislative speaker than the NDB actually  had (three factions -- "union," communists, and veterans). At  the same time, I am not going to diminish the role of our  organization, which consistently spoke for Shushkevich's  resignation.    [Gukovskiy] What was it that you did not like about him?    [Gaydukevich] He made no resolute decisions over the past  half a year.    I would not like to speak about him as a person. However, as  a politician, he proved very weak, dependent, and hesitant. He  has not managed to establish his position on many issues -- the  collective security treaty, economic integration with Russia,  the ruble zone, or any other key issues. His haphazard policies  led the parliament's operations to a deadlock. His continued  service in office would have exacerbated the situation, creating  more animosity among factions, groupings, etc. [passage omitted]    [Gukovskiy] You accuse the former legislative speaker of  seeking an illusory accord, vague directions, unclear positions.  However, the present head of the legislature, right after his  election to the post, declared that the previous course of  Belarus will be continued and that he would seek support without  giving preference to any grouping.    [Gaydukevich] Nevertheless, the difference between  Shushkevich and Hryb is profound. The latter has clearly and  unequivocally stated that he is for close relations with Russia  -- Shushkevich just timidly mentioned the need to maintain links  with it -- for the ruble zone, expanding economic ties, the  collective security treaty. He said that he supported the  course of the Belarusian Government. In other words, the man  determined his position and spoke out on it immediately after  his election.    In all his time as legislative speaker, Shushkevich never  did  anything like that. Nobody could understand him. At times, he  declared that he is a strong supporter of close ties with  Russia, and at other times, in an interview or during a  conversation with some oppositionist, he would make assurances  that he is a staunch advocate of Belarusian independence. When  the collective security issue was debated, Stanislav Shushkevich  gave plenty of interviews that did not help, however, to flesh  out his true opinions. It was not by coincidence that even part  of the opposition voted against him. Toward the end of his  term, he lost support of not only the legislative majority but  also that of the opposition. The most regrettable thing is that  the people did not get a chance to know what kind of Belarus  Shushkevich wanted to see.    Like Gorbachev, Shushkevich attempted to sit on several  chairs at a time. A seasoned card player, he wanted to play  with everyone. But every game is played by its own rules and a  clearly specified number of players.    If Shushkevich had had political convictions, he would have  certainly found allies in parliament. It takes some talent to  find no support in a legislature swarming with numerous factions!    [Gukovskiy] Do you think Shushkevich will return to big  politics, as is predicted by many political observers, including  Russian ones?    [Gaydukevich] Never. That is the "Gorbachev-2" case. There  were many predictions after the resignation of the first, and  the last, Soviet president. Unfortunately, you will get nowhere  in politics without a clear program and position.    [Gukovskiy] The NDB, the largest legislative grouping, did  not propose him as a candidate for president. Why? It was your  best chance to come to power, which the Marxists said is the  chief purpose of political struggle.    [Gaydukevich] We had our candidates, but they declined their  nominations. As for the struggle for power, we remain faithful  to the fundamental idea of our movement -- consolidation. We  were aware of the fact that a speaker from the NDB would have  triggered a real explosion, which would be very divisive and  distracting for the parliament. After discussing Hryb's  candidacy, we came to a conclusion: This is the man who in this  situation suits everyone. He does not want confrontation but is  able to ensure efficient operations of our legislative body.  [passage omitted]    [Gukovskiy] What do you think about the opposition's  proposal  to form a coalition government before calling early elections?    [Gaydukevich] We are against it. The opposition proposed to  dissolve the Supreme Council and give power to a narrow group of  like-minded politicians. The opposition's purpose is clear,  which is to take advantage of the present state of confusion.  Just look at what demands were trotted out by the Popular Front  and the Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly [BDSG]. In their  opinion, the coalition government should consist of only the  people who support their ideas. That is absurd! This would  immediately put the parties standing for, say, bilingualism or  collective security out the equation. In other words, the  largest political forces, including the NDB, are automatically  removed from the political scene.    [Gukovskiy] Did NDB representatives meet with Mechyslaw Hryb  after he was elected Supreme Soviet chairman?    [Gaydukevich] No, they did not. I believe that the  initiative to meet should come from Mechyslaw Ivanovich himself.  We have made our move by sending him a telegram with  congratulations on his new appointment. Hryb and Kebich made a  good declaration calling for contacts with all political forces.  All forces! The former speaker has never even thought about  it. He kept saying "accord" [preceding word in Belarusian], but  as far as I can remember, he met only with the BDSG and the  United Democratic Party of Belarus.    [Gukovskiy] You say that early elections are necessary.  When do you think they should be called? Are you sure that  they will take place at all?    [Gaydukevich] I think they will actually take place. The  Supreme Soviet made a relevant decision on this. When?  Summertime is the time of vacations; it cannot be in March or  early April, according to the law, which requires a two-month  waiting period. They cannot be held in April and May, as people  will be busy with the sowing campaign. The most convenient time  would be early fall.    [Gukovskiy] You have repeatedly said that the NDB stands for  closer union with Russia. Just like in Belarus, a variety of  political force are active in that country, including in the  highest echelons of power. With which of them are you seeking a  union?    [Gaydukevich] I have always said: Politicians come and go,  but the people remain. We will cooperate with all those who  stand for the unity of the Slavic peoples. I would rather not  be in position to name specific parties or individuals. Our  position may clear after meetings with representatives of the  entire political spectrum of Russia, which we are planning to  hold as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / RUC to counter terrorist funding THE ROYAL Ulster Constabulary is to plough more resources into investigating the financing of terrorism in Northern Ireland. In his annual report, Sir Hugh Annesley, the Chief Constable, said that, while significant progress had been made, he intended to assign additional manpower to the force's Anti-Racketeering Unit. Republican and loyalist paramilitary rackets raise millions of pounds each year for terrorist campaigns. The RUC have already closed dozens of Ulster drinking clubs, regarded as fronts for paramilitary organisation. Officers have also seized thousands of videotapes suspected of being used to raise funds through illegal copying operations. In the report, released yesterday, Sir Hugh said the 94 people killed in the past year as a result of terrorism was the highest number for a decade. He said republican and loyalist gangs had demonstrated that they could match each other in 'hate, blind bigotry and sectarian savagery'. Sir Hugh said the recruiting of young people into terrorist organisations remained a difficulty. In the past five years, over 200 people under the age of 17 had appeared in court.</p>

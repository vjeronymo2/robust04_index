			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Svetlana Gamova: "Opposition Calls Moldavia's </F> New Government Pro-Moscow"]    [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] -- Some 3 percent of the  Republic's budget has annually been spent on 6,000 state  officials. Moldavia's [Moldova's] Agrarian Democratic Party,  which forms the government, considered it costly for the small  state to have 20 ministries and 10 state departments with overly  inflated staffs. The state apparatus is being cut by 40 percent.    Two departments have been crossed off the list, including  the  department dealing with the functioning of the state language --  the only one of its kind in the CIS.    For the People's Front opposition this means that it is  totally excluded from state structures. Andrei Sangheli is  still prime minister. He enjoys prestige among the population  of the Left Bank and the south of the Republic, and is also well  received in Russian Government offices.    The 16 confirmed ministers include only one "interloper" --  Vasile Iovv [surname as transliterated], former trade  representative in Russia, who made it on the Socialist Party  lists. The other ministers are either members of the Agrarian  Party or have sworn loyalty to it.    Foreign Minister Mihai Popov, a graduate of the Diplomatic  Academy, worked in the former USSR Embassy in Bucharest. He was  recently ambassador to Belgium. The nationalist newspaper TSARA  [name as transliterated] saw the appointment of the new head of  the foreign policy department as Moscow's doing and KGB  intrigue, forecasting a switch from the Moldavian Foreign  Ministry's former "European orientation" to a patently  pro-Moscow orientation. It is being said in parliamentary  lobbies that the new minister is Parliament Speaker Petru  Lucinschi's minion; Lucinschi knows him from working with him  for several years.    The People's Front, considering the new membership of the  government to be pro-Moscow, refused to take part in the ballot,  but that had no effect on the result: The list of Cabinet  members was passed, and with the current disposition of forces  (20 opposition votes to 84) it is quite possible to predict the  same outcome for parliamentary decisions in the future.</p>

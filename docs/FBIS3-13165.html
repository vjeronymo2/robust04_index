The postponement was sought by Pakistan. Reports  say that Islamabad is under pressure from some Islamic  Conference Organization -- ICO -- countries, notably Iran, to  withdraw the resolution. As the commission took up voting on  Pakistan's resolution early during the day, the chairman  informed the house that Pakistani and Iranian delegations have  sought postponement of the vote.</p>

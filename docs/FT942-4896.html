			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Finnish bank reduces losses Losses at Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, narrowed sharply to FM275m (Dollars 50m) from FM626m in the first four months, as it benefited from reduced credit losses, new business and lower interest rates. However, it said it expected a full-year deficit of up to FM1bn before returning to the black next year. Last year, the bank made a FM2.66bn loss, in its third consecutive year in the red. The recent improvement was attributed mainly to the drop in credit losses, from FM933m to FM537m. This would have been much higher had the bank not anticipated continuing problems by establishing a FM900m general provision at the end of last year. It used all but FM300m of the facility in the first four months. Non-performing assets also showed a downward trend, falling to FM6.8bn at the end of April from FM7.5bn at the start of the year. Income from financial operations rose to FM769m from FM666m. Deposit and lending activity increased, following the bank's acquisition of Savings Bank of Finland businesses, while lower interest rates cut the costs of funding non-performing loans. Non-interest income fell 18 per cent to FM752m. Last year's figure was helped by sales of forest land and property. Expenses rose 1 per cent to FM1.14bn. Mr Pertti Voutilainen, chief executive, said credit losses would weigh heavily on the Finnish banking sector in 1994 and 1995, despite an improving economy and falling sector bankruptcies.</p>

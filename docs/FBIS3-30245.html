			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Deputies Did Not Approve Amendment on </F> Signposts; Meeting of Parliament Will Continue Next Week"]    [Excerpts] Bratislava--The 26th meeting of the National  Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] continued yesterday with  the discussion of amendments to the law on the official language  and the law on the territorial and administrative division of  the Slovak Republic, which are known as the Law on Signposts.  Although a government-sponsored bill on orders, a document on  European coproduction in film-making, and an amendment to the  law on financing political parties and movements from the state  budget were also on the agenda, most of the day was taken up by  the debate on the Law on Signposts. In spite of that, the law  did not pass. The bill on orders met, for the time being, with  the same fate.    In the debate on the legislative norm on signposts, Deputy  Jan Pivoluska, Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS],  proposed that an ethnic minority's minimum representation in a  community required for the installation of signposts in the  minority's language be raised from 20 percent [as recommended in  the government bill] to 50 percent. Erno Rozsa, Coexistence, on  the other hand, proposed that 10 percent of ethnic minority  members in a community should be sufficient for the community to  be designated also in their language.    Miroslav Gandi, HZDS, ended his contribution with an appeal  for the unification of deputies representing Slovak political  parties against the demands of the Hungarian coalition.  Ladislav Pittner, Christian Democratic Movement, stressed in  the debate that one cannot fight irridentism by suppressing the  rights of ethnic minorities and that ethnic minorities must be  accommodated in line with European conventions. Igor Gazdik  endorsed the Hungarian coalition's proposal on behalf of the  Club of Independent Deputies.    Roman Hofbauer, minister of transportation, communications,  and public works, discussed linguistic aspects and how the names  of communities came about.  <H5>  Deputies Rejected Everything </H5>   Most changes proposed in the [parliamentary committees'  rapporteurs'] joint report and during the debate by individual  deputies did not pass. The deputies also turned down the  comprehensive proposal tabled by the Hungarian Christian  Democratic Movement-Coexistence coalition, changing substantial  portions of the law. Of the 134 parliamentarians present, 52  voted for the proposal of the Hungarian coalition, 65 against,  and 17 abstained. The proposal that communities should be able  to have names in the language of ethnic minorities on the basis  of a decision by the local council, or on the basis of a local  referendum, did not pass, either; it was short of three votes.  During the final vote on the amendments, 132 deputies reported  their presence. The law was not approved because only 64  deputies voted in its favor, while 35 voted against and 33  abstained. [passage omitted]    The 26th NRSR meeting will continue next Wednesday [2  February].</p>

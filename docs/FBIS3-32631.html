			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Program for the Mediterranean] </F>   [Text] It has been reported that the Cuban Government  could, next Tuesday, officially convene a conference of Cubans  living abroad and in Cuba. These sources indicate that the  meeting is planned for the end of April -- a meeting between  members of the Cuban community living abroad and common citizens  -- to discuss topics that are of interest to both sides in an  effort to broaden current exchanges.    Representatives from the powerful Cuban-North American  community will attend the meeting between Cubans, in addition to  representatives from other Cuban communities living in Latin  America, Europe, and other areas.    Meanwhile, ultraconservative sectors excluded from this  meeting are doing everything in their power to stop it. To this  end, they are using everything from threats against the  participants to a intensive defamation propaganda campaign  against the meeting.    In fact for the past 48 hours, radio stations broadcasting  to  Cuba from U.S. territory as well as television stations  broadcasting from the United States which are received in  Havana, have transmitted false reports, like the alleged closure  of the U.S. Interests Office in Havana, to cause unrest among  the people who go there everyday to wait for visas, which the  U.S. State Department hands out sparingly as a way to encourage  illegal departures.    This week, Radio Rebede reported from outside the U.S.  Interests Office on the irritation of the people who wait in  long lines for a visa they very seldom receive.</p>

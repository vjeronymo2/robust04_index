			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINE WITH A PHONY PEDIGREE PROMPTS FEDERAL INVESTIGATION  </P> <P> The wine bore the proud label of 1986 Montrachet from Domaine de la  Romanee-Conti, one of the world's rarest and -- at $350 a bottle -- most  expensive vintages. About five cases, more than $20,000 worth, were sold to a  Japanese buyer by a Southern California wine dealer.  </P> <P> But the deal went sour after the wine's pedigree proved phony, and the sale has  prompted a federal investigation.  </P> <P> Jack Daniels of Wilson-Daniels Ltd. in St. Helena, Calif., official importer of  Domaine de la Romanee-Conti wines, said the bogus wine carried a label saying,  "Appellation Romanee-Conti Controlee," a designation that may appear only on  red wine. But the Montrachet is white.  </P> <P> That detail aside, the label was a respectable fraud, said Daniels, who  examined a faxed copy of it. "If you just glanced at it," he said, "it looked  real."  </P> <P> Daniels said he was told that the buyer's money was refunded after he  complained about the label.  </P> <P> Deepening the mystery, Daniels added, the buyer said he shipped the wine back  to the merchant, but it "disappeared somewhere between Japan and Los Angeles."  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, a branch of the  Treasury Department, confirmed the probe but would identify neither buyer nor  seller.  </P></p>

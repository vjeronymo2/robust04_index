			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Major intervenes over market-testing delays MR WILLIAM Waldegrave, the public service minister, has called in Mr John Major to speed up the much-vaunted programme of bringing private-sector competition to government activities. Mr Waldegrave has been unable alone to push the initiative for-ward, and has been forced to call on the prime minister to remind departments of the initiative's importance. Mr Major will give fresh impetus to the market-testing initiative by telling Whitehall departments which have slipped severely behind schedule that they must treat it as a priority. Up to a dozen departments are expected to receive the Downing Street order to make better progress. They include the Home Office, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of Trade and Industry. News of Mr Major's intervention came as Labour highlighted embarrassing delays in the programme for market testing. Ms Majorie Mowlam, Labour's public service spokeswoman, said government information showed that four mainstream departments had failed to complete a single market-testing exercise since November. The four departments - the DTI, the Department for Education, the Scottish Office and the Department of Transport - are due to have completed market-testing more than Pounds 130m of Civil Service activities by the end of September. Concern that this year's programme has fallen so far behind schedule has raised questions over its extension. Mr Waldegrave has been planning to extend competition in an ambitious range of areas from the late autumn. Contracts already put out to tender include some core Whitehall work such as the Treasury's economic forecasting and data collection as well as support work including information technology consultancy, and legal and estate management services. Some senior civil servants are said to claim responsibility for delaying progress in contracting-out, but the most serious factor is confusion over the impact of regulations designed to protect the rights of workers in takeovers and mergers. The Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) 1981 regulations guarantee the jobs and pay of the existing workforce in many cases when work is contracted out. As the regulations implement the European Community Acquired Rights Directive they cannot be removed by UK legislation. In a letter leaked earlier this year, Mr Michael Bichard, the chief executive of the Benefits Agency, complained that the Cabinet Office had failed to answer key questions over the issue. There has also been some criticism from within Downing Street that Sir Peter Levene, head of the efficiency unit, has not dealt with the difficulty more decisively. Ms Mowlam said that the stalling of the programme amounted to a 'de facto moratorium caused by departmental confusion and uncertainty, and William Waldegrave's lack of political clout'.</p>

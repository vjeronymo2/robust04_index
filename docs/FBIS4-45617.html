			<p>BFN     [Text] Kushiro, Hokkaido, May 20 KYODO -- Police sent  papers to the prosecutors office Friday [20 May] on two men  suspected of illegally dealing in the Asian arowana, an  endangered species of tropical fish.    Police said that tropical fish shop proprietor Yoshitaka  Udagawa, 31, purchased an arowana from another tropical fish  shop owner in Tokyo in June 1992.    The carnivorous fish, for which some tropical fish  enthusiasts in Japan will pay hundreds of thousands of yen each,  is protected under the Convention on International Trade in  Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or the so-called  Washington Convention,    Police said Udagawa failed to fulfill a legal requirement to  register the arowana purchase with the Environment Agency within  30 days.    He subsequently compounded his troubles with the law by  selling the unregistered arowana in July 1993 to a man in  Kushiro, Hokkaido, without informing the agency of the  transaction.    Masato Sasaki, 38, the Arowana's new owner, similarly failed  to comply with legal requirements when he purchased the arowana  from Udagawa and resold it to a tropical fish shop in Obihiro.    Representatives of Traffic Japan, which monitors the illegal  wildlife trade, said two separate cases of illegal trade of  arowana in Japan were exposed in November and a third case in  February.</p>

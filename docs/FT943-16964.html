			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Plaster model Whether companies can restore profit margins to the levels of the late 1980s is a recurring question for the UK equity market. Yesterday's full-year figures from BPB give reason for optimism. While plasterboard prices are still 25 per cent below the peak - and are unlikely to rise much from here - the company's drive for efficiency has started to show results. Operating margins widened from 7 per cent to almost 12 per cent last year, with more to come as capacity utilisation improves. Another two or three points of margin combined with gently rising turnover would more than justify the current rating of the shares. In many respects, plasterboard is a special case. Unlike petrochemicals or steel, recession has dramatically thinned the ranks of manufacturers. Competition among the three dominant European companies is hardly cut-throat and selling prices are already well above the trough reached in the early months of 1992. What Pilkington would give for a similar recovery in glass prices. Plasterboard is a growth product thanks to changing construction methods, so the remaining overhang of capacity is less of a worry than in other industries. BPB has also made an unusually bold move into continental Europe, which now accounts for more than half of turnover. Companies which have all their eggs in Mr Kenneth Clarke's basket may face the future with less confidence. Even allowing for such caveats, though, yesterday's figures serve as a reminder of how geared to recovery many UK industrial companies have become.</p>

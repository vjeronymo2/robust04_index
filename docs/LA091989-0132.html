			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE / TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA FIRM TEST-MARKETS PHONE ANSWERING MACHINES FOR HOTEL ROOMS  </P> <P> As if telephone answering machines in the office and home weren't enough, now a  Santa Ana firm thinks hotel guests should have them in their rooms as well.  </P> <P> EECO Computer, which makes computerized hotel management systems, has added a  new feature to its system that enables hotel guests to use their room telephone  as a personal answering machine.  </P> <P> EECO is touting the feature as a way for hotel guests to avoid the aggravations  of having to check with the front desk for messages.  </P> <P> "When there is human intervention in a message system, there is a tremendous  opportunity for error," said Gerald N. Soma, EECO's vice president of  marketing. "Messages are lost, or sometimes there is something that is lost in  translation."  </P> <P> Soma said the answering system also guarantees that a guest's messages remain  private. "That's a serious issue with a lot of business people," he said. "The  information being transmitted might be of a confidential business nature."  </P> <P> EECO is test-marketing the hotel answering system at hotels in Toronto and  Boston.  </P> <P> With the system, each hotel telephone serves as a personal answering machine  for the guest. Guests record their outgoing messages, callers leave their  messages, and the guests can retrieve the messages when they return to their  rooms. Guests can also retrieve their messages from remote locations.  </P> <P> EECO will initially focus its marketing efforts on large, full-service hotels,  Soma said. He declined to specify how much the system would cost to install in  an average-size hotel. Compiled by David Olmos, Times staff writer  </P></p>

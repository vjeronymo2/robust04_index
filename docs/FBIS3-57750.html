			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Nikita Yermakov and Konstantin </F> Pribytkov]    [Text] Davos January 31 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin held a series of meetings with  representatives of political and business circles of Western  countries during his two-day visit to the Swiss resort city of  Davos to attend the World Economic Forum.    Chernomyrdin met with Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt,  Swiss federal adviser Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, OPEC Secretary  General Subroto, EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development] directors and managers of a number of major  commercials banks.    "We have attained our goal at the talks -- there was a  thorough and professional discussion of problems and  difficulties faced by Russia," Valentin Sergeyev, head of the  press service of the Russian Government, told ITAR-TASS. "There  is no question of reforms or no reforms on today's agenda. We  are for reforms, but the question is how they should be carried  out, who should help us and by what means the reforms should be  fulfilled," Sergeyev said.    "The forum in Davos was beneficial for all, including the  West and Russia, for the general comprehension of problems we  are facing today and which might arise tomorrow," Sergeyev said.  He pointed out that in the opinion of the Russian delegation,  this time the talks were not merely a discussion in character,  which shows that a new stage in the comprehension of Russia's  problems has begun. "It was not the question of what to do but  rather how this should be done that was at issue," Sergeyev said.    "Our cooperation with the West is not merely a declaration,  but quite a concrete matter. Earlier, we discussed aid, whereas  today, we are speaking about mutually advantageous cooperation,  while the word "aid" sounds like nonsense. Today, we are not  merely discussing investments, but rather ways in which Russian  goods, but not only raw materials, can enter the world market.  In short, the Davos forum has risen to a qualitatively new  level in its businesslike atmosphere, approaches and expected  results," Sergeyev said.</p>

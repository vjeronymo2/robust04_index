			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PORTUGAL, NEW HUB OF SMUGGLING INTO EUROPE, STEPS UP DRUG ENFORCEMENT ACTION  </P> <P> Downstairs from an austere police office, a heavily guarded storeroom contains  enough confiscated drugs to pay for a Miami condominium.  </P> <P> The office is that of Jose Nunes Goncalves Carvalho, director of the Portuguese  Judicial Police drug squad, which is waging war on smuggling. Portugal, at the  southwestern tip of Europe, is becoming a main point of entry for South  American drug shipments, and authorities here are determined to wipe out the  trade.  </P> <P> Cooperation with the United States and other concerned countries has been  improved. Border controls are tighter and hundreds of specialized police are  working on tip-offs from around the world.  </P> <P> "It's an all-out fight," said Carvalho.  </P> <P> No one knows for sure how much contraband slips through, but he and his men are  clearly seeing results.  </P> <P> Last year, police seized 1,745 pounds of cocaine and 130 pounds of heroin --  more than twice what was intercepted in 1988. Arrests of consumer-traffickers  were nearly doubled, to 2,534.  </P> <P> Earlier in July, police seized 460 pounds of South American cocaine.  </P> <P> "They are taking the drug problem very seriously," one Western diplomat said of  the Portuguese crackdown.  </P> <P> In the storeroom below Carvalho's office, the aroma of hashish fills the air.  Police aide Anselmo Semedo Louro pointed to piles of captured drugs waiting to  be burned. "This is just the tip of the iceberg," he said.  </P> <P> Sacks of leaves and white powder are stacked next to false-bottomed suitcases  and plastic bags of cocaine.  </P> <P> Drug authorities say that overproduction in South America and falling prices in  the United States have forced smugglers into new markets, particularly in  Europe.  </P> <P> Its sea and air links across the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea make  Portugal a convenient transit point to cities such as Frankfurt, Milan or  Zurich.  </P> <P> Cocaine often comes into Lisbon on direct flights from Brazil or from  Venezuela, which has a large Portuguese community.  </P> <P> Bigger quantities frequently come in containers on cargo shipments. Some drugs  are carried in small boats, which use Portugal's mid-Atlantic Azores islands as  a stopping point, Western diplomats say.  </P> <P> Not all that comes in goes out, however. More and more cocaine is being  consumed in Portugal, and rising local demand for Asian heroin is alarming  authorities.  </P> <P> Estimates of Portugal's addict population range from 5,000 to 100,000 -- of 10  million total -- but everyone agrees that the numbers are going up.  </P> <P> With Latin American economies in tatters and the Portuguese among the poorest  people in Western Europe, there is no shortage of people willing to risk  drug-trafficking to earn money, police said.  </P> <P> For instance, they said, a courier can earn $2,000 (about half the annual per  capita income in Portugal) and a get a free plane ride for making just one  trip.  </P> <P> Authorities have stepped up surveillance at airports, ports and frontiers, and  now require visitors from Colombia, Peru and Bolivia to carry visas.  </P> <P> Portugal is also working closely with U.S. agents and the international police  organization, Interpol, and has signed accords with West Germany, Morocco,  Britain and Spain. Other deals, including one with Brazil, are in the offing.  </P> <P> "There have been cases where the Portuguese authorities have helped enormously,  and it has been made known to the British authorities that drugs were being  taken to Britain," British Home Secretary David Waddington said recently in  Lisbon.  </P> <P> "As a result of the cooperation between our two countries, important finds of  drugs and arrests have taken place."  </P> <P> One Western diplomat also acknowledged Portugal's efforts, but said that  further work could be done. Law enforcement, in particular, he said, was  hindered by the involvement of many agencies that did not always coordinate  their actions.  </P> <P> "Catching the stuff at the port of entry is very hit-and-miss," the diplomat  said.  </P></p>

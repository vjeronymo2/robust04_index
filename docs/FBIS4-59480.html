			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 14 May (MENA) -- In a ceremony attended by  Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat and member of the Palestinian National Authority  Council, held at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo the United States  presented $5 million to support the Palestinian police force.    This was announced by a U.S. diplomatic source. The aid  shows U.S. support for the Middle East peace process and  represents an installment of the $500 million that the United  States pledged to extend over five years to back the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, the source said.    The source noted that the United States earlier provided 200  vehicles to the Palestinian authority.    The source explained that the $5 million will be used to  finance commodities and services in the first stage, such as  raising salaries; moving police units into Gaza and Jericho;  securing temporary lodging; and purchasing food, fuel, and  clothing. The money cannot be used for military purposes, the  source said.    The source said the U.S. grant is part of the U.S.  Administration's extraordinary efforts to support and facilitate  the deployment of the Palestinian police force so that a secure  and stable climate can be created for the continued  implementation of the agreement on Palestinian self-rule in  Jericho and Gaza as signed in Cairo on 4 May.    Concluding the statement, the source said that the United  States hopes its contribution will encourage the other donor  states to speed up their vital support for peace in the region.</p>

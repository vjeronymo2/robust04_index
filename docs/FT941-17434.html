			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region sees new records set in eight centres Roundup Eight markets saw new highs. Tokyo, Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand were closed. HONG KONG advanced 1.7 per cent, taking the Hang Seng index through the 12,000-point level to another record close as buy orders from overseas institutions continued to pour in. The index climbed 198.10 to 12,086.49. Continuing strong US demand was particularly evident, helping to expand turnover to a heavy HKDollars 9.22bn from Friday's HKDollars 7.36bn. On the futures market the January index contract ended with a sizeable premium to the physical market at 12,315, up 355 points. Bank of East Asia, which will be among the first of the major banks to announce its profits, climbed HKDollars 4.50 to HKDollars 57.50. Liu Chong Hing was up HKDollars 2.20 at HKDollars 18.20 on expectations that it will spin off its banking arm. Sino Land jumped 80 cents to HKDollars 12.90 in active morning trade and Tsim Sha Tsui Properties gained 70 cents at HKDollars 10.80 before they were both suspended pending an announcement. SINGAPORE saw strong retail demand, on expectations of more gains in coming weeks, which took the Straits Times Industrial index up 15.85 to a peak 2,441.53. Profit-taking was overwhelmed by a flood of new money. However, Rothmans Industries plunged SDollars 1.20, or 11.9 per cent, to SDollars 9.70 when the stock resumed trading after the announcement that plans for a regional holding company were vetoed by its Malaysian associate. KUALA LUMPUR registered further institutional and speculative buying and the composite index advanced 13.53 to a record 1,288.86. Rothmans fell MDollars 4.60, or 17.7 per cent, to MDollars 21.40 after the merger proposal's rejection. SEOUL saw buy orders which boosted financials and recent laggards such as construction and low-priced counters, taking the composite index 13.14 higher to a peak of 879.32. Blue chips were held back, however, by news that the Korea Securities Market Stabilisation Fund planned to liquidate Won800bn of stocks later this month. MANILA hit a new high as demand for blue chips kept the market up amid profit-taking in other issues. The Composite index added 75.43 at 3,271.51. JAKARTA edged ahead to a record close, the official index firming 0.88 to 589.65. KARACHI, powered by strong demand for financials, polyesters and pharmaceuticals, saw the KSE 100 index rise 7.89 to finish at a high of 2,178.09. BOMBAY's 30-share index moved ahead 119.80, or 3.6 per cent, to a peak of 3,465.86 amid increased foreign buying on hopes for improved economic and political stability in the coming year.</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE NEW: GREETING YARDS  </P> <P> The front-yard card -- the suburban mega-message -- is taking root on local  lawns.  </P> <P> Grass Greetings in Reseda rents 4-foot-square four-color personalized cards in  the shape of either a stork (for showers and just-borns), Father Time (for  thirtysomething birthdays) or a party animal (a cheerful bear). Grass Greetings  rents about seven to eight a week, "and the number is increasing rapidly," says  Jan Tringale, who owns and manages the 1 1/2-year-old firm with her husband.  </P> <P> The cards are most popular with people between 25 and 40, and the card that's  rented most is the stork, Tringale says. She and her husband make the cards out  of fiberglass and other weatherproof materials, and rent them from $19.95 a  day, Monday through Thursday, to $104.74 for seven days. The price includes  delivery, pickup and a diploma-size delivery certificate.  </P> <P> Grass Greetings grew from Tringale's Midwest roots: She used to make big  greeting cards for special events, such as graduation, and an aunt suggested  that she try to market them.  </P> <P> The year-old Rent-A-Stork in Woodland Hills -- part of a national franchise --  leases from two to seven 4 1/2-foot wooden storks a week, for $37 for five  days. The personalized bundles, with such information as the child's name or  weight, say "It's a Girl" or "It's a Boy." A $20 one-day standing stork is  available for baby showers.  </P> <P> When Jan Crivier of Canoga Park came home from the hospital with her first baby  girl -- after three sons -- a Rent-A-Stork, arranged by her husband, Rick,  greeted her on the front lawn. "My husband thought it would be better than  flowers. All the neighbors saw the pink bundle and came by, knowing how  thrilled we'd be," Jan says.  </P></p>

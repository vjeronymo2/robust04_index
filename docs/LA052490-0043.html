			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> STUDY SAYS ANTI-BIAS PLANS FAIL TO AID STUDENTS;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS: THE L.A. DISTRICT IS CRITICIZED FOR FAILING TO IMPROVE OPPORTUNITIES  FOR PUPILS, ESPECIALLY BLACKS AND LATINOS.  </P> <P> Despite more than a dozen years of court-ordered attempts to alleviate the harm  of racial segregation, the Los Angeles Unified School District has failed to  improve achievement and opportunities for many of its students -- especially  blacks and Latinos, according to a district report.  </P> <P> Youngsters who must take long school bus rides to other communities because of  overcrowding in their neighborhood schools have suffered the most -- sometimes  scoring only half as high on achievement tests as their classmates who live  close to campus.  </P> <P> "Many students are still shackled by the harms of racial isolation -- low  academic achievement and limited post-secondary opportunities. Black and  Hispanic students are especially afflicted by these harms," the district's  annual integration report concluded.  </P> <P> Although the district annually scrutinizes its various programs aimed at  mitigating the effects of racial segregation, Monday's special Board of  Education hearing marked the first time it has aired the findings in public.  </P> <P> Board members, preparing to make decisions on next year's integration budget,  took no action on the report, but they discussed it for several hours.  </P> <P> Board President Jackie Goldberg -- who has pushed for public hearings on the  integration report since her election seven years ago -- said she was "dismayed  but not surprised" by the findings.  </P> <P> "We have made some progress in some important areas," Goldberg said, "but one  of the major important harms of segregation is low achievement. And we have not  done nearly enough to close the gap between kids from middle-income families  and those from low-income families. And in Los Angeles, there is a lot of  correlation between race and income level."  </P> <P> The report studied students in 229 schools participating in various  desegregation programs in grades four. five, seven, eight, 10, 11 and 12 last  school year. It looked at a variety of factors -- including standardized test  scores, parental involvement, ethnic background, whether students attended  schools with minority enrollments of 70% or more, whether they were bused,  their post-graduation plans, the attitudes of their teachers and  administrators, and the students' self-esteem.  </P> <P> The study also compared how various groups did in different school settings and  found that students in the district's popular "magnet" program of specialized  schools fared the best. That is not surprising because the poorest students  rarely apply for the magnet programs.  </P> <P> The district buses nearly 25,000 students daily from crowded neighborhood  schools -- many in low-income areas with big influxes of recent immigrants --  to less congested campuses, often in suburban, middle-class communities. Those  students often fare poorly, the report showed.  </P> <P> For example, fourth-grade reading scores on the Comprehensive Test of Basic  Skills showed that the bused students earned a mean percentile score of 28,  while students who lived near the school scored 58. In math, the bused students  scored 32; the neighborhood youngsters, 66.  </P> <P> The report also found that bused students had many disadvantages, ranging from  late arrival of records from their home area schools to not enough bilingual  teachers at their new schools.  </P> <P> Reading vocabulary scores for all grades taking the same test varied markedly  by ethnic group. Thirty-eight percent of American Indians scored in the "very  low" range, as did 28% of Asians, 48% of blacks, and 55% of Latinos. Only 17%  of whites scored in the lowest range. The test-takers included students with  limited English skills.  </P> <P> The report also found that black students at lower-achieving schools had the  lowest expectations for their own achievement.  </P> <P> One of the bright spots in the report were positive findings in schools with  parent participation projects and in low-income schools that offered  language-arts-oriented preschool programs to 4-year-olds. Those students went  on to do significantly better in elementary school than their counterparts.  </P> <P> The district spent $354 million on desegregation programs this year, with the  bulk of the funds paying for bus transportation and reducing class sizes, all  part of the integration plan worked out with the courts over several years.  </P> <P> Goldberg said the report and Monday's hearing were aimed at helping the  financially troubled district figure out the best return on its desegregation  dollar.  </P> <P> "For those things that are not working, we must make changes," she said. "It is  not enough any longer to just wring our hands and say we are dismayed. We have  to try some new things. There is no guarantee the new things will work, but we  have got to try."  </P></p>

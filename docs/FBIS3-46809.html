			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Traitor's New Year </F> Gibberish"]    [Text] The crow, cawing twelve times, can only utter caw,  so the saying goes. This means that one who is a bad man by  nature can only say bad things. This was the case with the  puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam when he made a so-called New Year's  address. In making silly gibberish, he raved that the new year  should be made a year for eliminating still-remaining  irregularities and corruption and making a new, clean society.  In other words, he intends to continue with the reform game.  This is really dumbfounding.    Since traitor Kim Yong-sam came to power wearing a mask of a  civilian regime, the wind of reform has blown frantically in  South Korea for nearly a year. However, the result has been  horrible. To conduct a real reform in the colonial fascist  South Korean society, they should realize that the people aspire  for independence and democratization in the first place. To  eliminate corruption and irregularities, they should take  practical measures to preclude illegal amassment of wealth in  the first place. They should distinguish themselves clearly  from their preceding military fascist regimes, and rectify the  wrongs of the past.    However, the puppet clique, instead of implementing a reform  aimed at freeing itself from the domination of a foreign force,  left South Korea totally under the domination of a foreign  force. Furthermore, the puppet clique raved that the foreign  force should dominate the Korean peninsula after the  reunification, as well. Since it came to power, the puppet  clique has kept intact the fascist evil laws, such as the  National Security Law, and the suppressive organizations, such  as the Agency for National Security Planning, the police, and  the prosecutor's office. Further strengthening their function  and authority, the puppet clique is stepping up the degree of  suppression on the people.    The Kim Yong-sam clique, which had raved about departing  from  his preceding dictatorial regimes, pardoned the murderers of  Kwangju, babbling that it could not jeopardize the future simply  because it had a bad sentiment of the past event. While raving  that it would root out irregularities, it purged its rival  forces and was bent on strengthening its basis for power.    The aftermath of the implementation of the real-name  financial transaction system, which the Kim Yong-sam clique  claimed to be the reform of reforms, brought about further  bankruptcy and a decline in the economy. Agriculture ended up  with a bad crop, the worst in 80 years, shrinking the rice  harvest by over 10 million sacks compared with the volume  originally anticipated.    The stern reality of South Korea for nearly a one-year  period, last year, clearly showed that the reform, which the Kim  Yong-sam puppet clique publicized so loudly, was not reform for  the better but reform for the worse. The falsity of the  so-called reform has been exposed thoroughly. There is nothing  the workers, the peasants, and the popular masses gained from  it. Nevertheless, traitor Kim Yong-sam made a gibberish about  reform again. This is a deception and mockery of the South  Korean people once again.    More intolerable is the fact that he, in a so-called New  Year's address, criticized us, saying that the suspicion of the  North's nuclear weapons development should be resolved.    As has been reported, in the recent contact, the DPRK and  the  United States removed a series of (?obstacles), which had  brought the DPRK-U.S. talks into a stalemate, displaying the  spirit of understanding and cooperation toward each other, thus  bringing forth a breakthrough for the progress of the talks. At  a time like this, traitor Kim Yong-sam made a presumptuous  blunder of criticizing us. This reveals his vicious scheme to  step up the slanderous maneuvers to harm the fellow countrymen  in the new year under the pretext of the suspicion of our  fictitious nuclear program.    He raved about the suspicion of our nuclear program as soon  as the new year began, out of fear that the U.S. promise to  maintain the international cooperation system it gave him during  his junket to the United States last November in return for the  total opening of the South Korean rice market may come to  naught. It is presumptuous and indiscreet of him, the puppet  clique without any real power or voice, to babble about the  issue that is to be resolved between the DPRK and the United  States.    Delivering a so-called New Year's address, he was not able  to  say anything new but repeated the old tune. This is far from  surprising. Traitor Kim Yong-sam is a completely ignorant man  without any independent opinion or political philosophy, a  politico in whose belly there is only the greed for power, and a  dirty man.    The South Korean people are well aware that no matter what  traitor Kim Yong-sam raves about doing something in the new  year, they have nothing to expect from it. They, therefore, are  determined to fight against the clique to the end. The Kim  Yong-sam clique, the flunkeyist traitor who turned against the  country and the nation, will not be able to escape from the  stern judgment of history and the people.</p>

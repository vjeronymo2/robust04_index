			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Swiss No to closer ties leaves Efta picking up the pieces THE resounding Swiss No to the European Economic Area, the free trade zone linking the EC's 12 members with the seven countries of the European Free Trade Association, has left Efta facing every which way. The association, which holds its regular autumn meeting in Geneva today and tomorrow, has the task of sorting out how the EEA can be realised without Switzerland, and agreeing a common approach to the European Community. In the longer term the Swiss decision has injected more uncertainty into the debate over Efta's long-term future and its relationship with third countries, especially in central and eastern Europe. The EEA, which was due to come into force on January 1, is certain to be delayed by a few months - or more, if Swiss withdrawal entails renegotiation of the accord's terms. Switzerland, as Efta's richest member, was due to pay the most - SFr350m (Pounds 160.5m) over five years - into an Efta cohesion fund for the benefit of poorer EC regions. Simply deducting the Swiss contribution could provoke demands by Spain and other southern European states for a compensating concession elsewhere in the EEA agreement. To maintain the fund would mean higher contributions by Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, the remaining members, assuming Liechtenstein follows Switzerland in voting No this weekend. Alternatively, Switzerland could pay its contribution anyway, in the hope of persuading the EC to look kindly on individual bilateral deals that will ease Swiss trade with the EEA area. Mr Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, the Swiss trade and economy minister, will come under pressure at the meeting to indicate Swiss intentions. Embarrassingly, Switzerland is due to assume the rotating Efta presidency for the first half of 1993. There could also be problems in financing the new competition body and court of justice Efta is setting up to administer its side of the EEA treaty, which will double Efta's annual budget to about SFr100m. The Swiss government has not yet made up its mind whether to press ahead with its application to join the EC - alongside Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden. However, the most likely prospect two or three years from now is for a shrunken Efta comprising Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein, with only Iceland in need of Efta's EEA superstructure. That is unless they invite central and eastern European countries to join them. These nations could see Efta as a convenient vehicle for EEA entry and a means to accelerate eventual EC membership. Efta has set up links of varying closeness with several states in the region, largely paralleling accords these countries have with the EC. Efta ministers will today sign agreements on free trade in industrial and processed agricultural goods with Poland and Romania and a declaration of co-operation with Albania. The association's free trade accord with the Czech and Slovak Republics came into force in July.</p>

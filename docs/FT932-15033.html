			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Strong quarter at PaineWebber PAINEWEBBER, the US securities house, announced another strong set of quarterly earnings yesterday, although increased taxes left net income for the first three months of the year lower than a year ago at Dollars 70.9m against Dollars 74.3m. The higher tax rate aside, PaineWebber reported record net revenues of Dollars 696.8m, up 6 per cent on 1992 and the highest in the firm's 114-year history. Earnings per share of Dollars 1.26, fully diluted, were also a record. The PaineWebber results ensure that the securities industry, buoyed by large interest in equities from individual investors and heavy demand for underwriting services from corporations, is on course for its third consecutive year of record earnings. Analysts estimated that Wall Street firms would earn more than Dollars 2bn between them in the first quarter alone. Revenues from all of PaineWebber's main business segments were higher than a year ago, mirroring the performance of Merrill Lynch, another big Wall Street securities house, which reported record profits on Tuesday. Earnings from brokerage commissions rose 5 per cent to Dollars 242m, while revenues from principal transactions and investment banking rose slightly, to Dollars 203.7m and Dollars 100.6m, respectively. The fastest-growing business, was asset management, where earnings jumped 17 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 73.3m as mutual fund assets rose 24 per cent and total assets under management climbed to about Dollars 37.5bn. Interest revenues advanced 9 per cent to Dollars 289.5m. Within the different business segments, Mr Donald Marron, PaineWebber's chairman, singled out the performance of the institutional sales and trading business, which reported 13 per cent growth in revenues, led by client-driven fixed income and equity sales. Retail sales and marketing, part of the firm's traditional securities brokerage business, also fared especially well, said Mr Marron. About 250 new brokers were added to the workforce during the quarter, taking the total to 5,150. PaineWebber's expenses climbed almost 7 per cent to Dollars 580.5m in the quarter, mostly because of higher performance-related employee compensation. The company's shares rose Dollars  1/2 in early trading on Wall Street, the highest level the stock has been in the past year, but closed unchanged on the day at Dollars 27 1/4.</p>

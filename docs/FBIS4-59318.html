			<p>BFN     [Text] A military source today made the following statement:    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. In  continuation of their treacherous, criminal acts and in a  hysterical act that can be carried out only by cowardly people  who bear a grudge against the people and the homeland, the gang  of rebellion and secession after midnight yesterday fired two  long-range Scud missiles against civilian installations and  residential quarters in the Governorate of Sanaa.    One of the missiles fell in the early hours today on one of  the populated quarters in the city of Sanaa. Its explosion  destroyed four houses. As a result, 23 people were martyred and  30 others sustained various injuries. Seven other houses were  destroyed. An entire family was martyred in this criminal,  sinful incident.    The source condemned this cowardly act that targeted the  life  of citizens and innocent women and children.    The source said these acts of revenge, practiced by the  secessionist clique in the [Yemeni] Socialist Party, reflect the  extent of the inveterate grudge in the hearts of this clique  against the sons of our people. These acts reflect the bitter  defeat tasted by this clique.    The source said these criminal acts will only increase our  people's cohesion and resolve to score a great success for unity  and Constitutional legitimacy.</p>

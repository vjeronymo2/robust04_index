			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEVERLY HILLS HIGH  </P> <P> Your article on the Beverly Hills Board of Education's real estate proposal  (Metro, March 10) was a sad illustration of carefully worked hype and media  subordination of the real issue, the quality of academic education at our high  school. I'm a student at Beverly and I've begun reading, in detail, into the  proposal. I must say, your lack of attention to significant facts and disregard  for background has served to make this whole thing a "political football" in  our district.  </P> <P> The proposal was drawn up by a committee to provide several options to lease  (not to sell, as your article implied) portions of school property to increase  school funds. Proposition 13 did much to hurt our school district's monetary  base, and the process of achieving consensus on necessary funding reform has  been a difficult one.  </P> <P> I have watched the quality of high school education in this state deteriorate.  I don't want to see that happen here. People need to get their values straight.  The proposal provides ideas, genuine innovations drawn up by a concerned and  voluntary committee, to counter financial wavering and to improve the quality  of education in this district.  </P> <P> Mayor Robert Tannenbaum and others would do well to open their eyes and to  examine the reality of Proposition 13 and the reality of the cuts facing our  district. I am a senior here and I'll be leaving soon. However, I've gained  valuable insights attending high school here and in the final analysis, I write  this letter because education is an issue of "this nation's future" and it's  worth writing a letter to The Times about it.  </P> <P> PETER L. THOTTAM  </P> <P> Associated Student Body President  </P> <P> Beverly Hills High School  </P></p>

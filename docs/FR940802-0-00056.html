EPA expects this investment to accelerate the development and implementation of advanced, high-efficiency production processes, which in turn are expected to provide global warming benefits and larger fossil fuel energy savings than can be provided by existing ethanol production facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Impact on Farm Economy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> According to comments submitted by USDA, the renewable oxygenate program is expected to increase farm incomes by increasing demand for farm products and creating a market for agricultural waste products. Based on USDA estimates, the renewable oxygenate program will increase corn prices by approximately 4.0&hyph;6.7 cents per bushel when fully implemented. Based on average annual corn production of 8.7 billion bushels, such a price increase would increase farm income by approximately $348&hyph;583 million. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  However, USDA projects a decrease in farm deficiency payments as a result of the increase in corn prices of $220&hyph;369 million, so the net increase in farm income would be $128&hyph;214 million per year. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The reader is referred to the RIA for a more detailed discussion of this estimate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> According to information provided by John W. McClelland of USDA, ``Memorandum for Richard Wilson, Director, Office of Mobile Sources, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,'' June 20, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> According to information provided by John W. McClelland of USDA, ``Memorandum for Richard Wilson, Director, Office of Mobile Sources, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,'' June 20, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To the extent that this increase in farm incomes results from higher prices for corn and other crops, some of the farm income benefits may be lost as feed costs for livestock producers increase. However, it is unlikely that price increases will account for the entire increase in farm incomes. Utilization of agricultural waste products and increased crop production are also expected to increase farm incomes without increasing the price per bushel for corn and other ethanol feedstocks. Hence the impact of the renewable oxygenate program is expected to have a net beneficial effect on the farm economy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Impact on Natural Gas, Methanol, and MTBE Sectors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA recognizes that the renewable oxygenate program may affect the growth prospects for the natural gas, methanol, and MTBE sectors. To the extent that today's rule leads to larger market shares for ethanol and other renewable oxygenates than otherwise would occur, the market share for nonrenewable oxygenates would be smaller than otherwise would occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEN. MONTOYA AND POLITICS  </P> <P> Anyone who passes final judgment on former state Sen. Joseph Montoya after his  conviction should also look at the way he has pursued issues involving the poor  people of his district. The image is in stark contrast to the one generated in  the legal proceedings.  </P> <P> In our case, his efforts have been pivotal in a matter involving nearly 200  low-income apartment tenants who reside alongside the San Bernardino Freeway.  We have long been waging a battle to get Caltrans to erect a freeway wall in  front of our complex for both environmental and safety reasons. For months the  transportation agency turned a deaf ear to our pleas.  </P> <P> When our tenants association first approached Sen. Montoya for help last  November, he was then preoccupied with the preparation of his legal defense for  his trial that was to start only a few weeks later. It would have been  understandable if he had chosen not to give us his time.  </P> <P> Not only did he send a field representative to our press conference, but he  also arranged to have Caltrans conduct long-sought noise testing. The upcoming  results, which could lead to the wall, would not have been possible without his  assistance. He never asked for anything in return.  </P> <P> The ultimate evaluation of Montoya's integrity should lie in how well he has  represented those in his district who do not have a strong voice. Based on that  criterion, I have more respect for Montoya than other lawmakers elsewhere who  make it a regular practice to ignore the poor on vital issues of statewide  concern.  </P> <P> MICHAEL J. ROTSTAN  </P> <P> Alhambra  </P></p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Arts: Lufthansa Baroque Festival - Music The eighth Festival of Baroque Music sponsored by Lufthansa has run its course. A mark of success is that the London musical calendar now seems inconceivable without this annual summer enterprise at St James's Church, Piccadilly: a hole in it was perceived and has been filled (as the long queues outside St James's for tickets regularly proclaimed). New explorations into the vast continent of Early Music (the 'baroque' in the umbrella-title being only a loose generic appellation) are constantly mapped out, new performers to lead those explorations constantly introduced. The church just off Piccadilly may have its inconveniences as a festival home - bus and car brakes and police sirens forcing upon the listener sudden intrusions of 'real' time and place - but the pleasures of the church itself, the facilities it offers (including an agreeable cafe and a blessedly cool church garden for strolling), and the imaginatively planned events it houses, outweigh them. Two instances on this year's schedule: on Wednesday the Lufthansa Festival provided the British debut of the Quatuor Mosaiques in a programme of Haydn and Mozart string quartets. This group has already become known to record-collectors; on a first encounter, last summer at the Grange de Meslay Festival in Tours, I joined the ranks of its most passionate admirers. Formed by the French cellist Christophe Coin and three Austrian colleagues, it brings 'period' practice - sparing use of vibrato, unpressured tempos, flexible phrasing - to bear on the Classical quartet repertory. In this case, though, claims of authenticity should be argued much harder for the corporate musicianship of the players than purely for their stylistic traits. The Mosaiques are one of the most blessedly chamber-like of modern chamber-music groups. There is no forcing. The exchange of performance ideas is intimate and exhilarating. The music speaks. The accounts of Haydn (Op. 20 no. 1 followed by the two 'torso' movements known as Op. 103) forged an ideal combination of calm wit, spontaneous expressive impulse, and lyrical freshness. In the Mozart 'Dissonance' Quartet after the interval, the players penetrated realms of erotic tension in the music that are generally left entirely untouched. The Quatuor Mosaiques will no doubt be back in London soon (their regular presence in the programmes of the soon-to-be-reopened Wigmore Hall is a foregone conclusion). My other festival experience, the joint Hilliard Ensemble and Concerto Palatino account of the Cavalli Vespers the previous Wednesday, afforded a discovery of rather more marginal significance. Cavalli, known for his operas but in his day no less important as a Venice church-composer, left behind a volume of Musiche sacre (1656) out of which these Vespers were assembled by the Concerto Palatino directors, Bruce Dickey and Charles Toet. Though originally the various Vespers-related items might well have been performed as they were on this occasion, consecutively, an 'opus' called the Cavalli Vespers is in effect a late-20th-century editorial supposition. The strongest argument against it was that - particularly with the unavoidable comparison of Monteverdi's Vespers in mind - the quantity of music proved too great for its strength and intensity of character. There were many delights in the individual movements: dancing rhythms, enchanting vocal and instrumental combinations, the captivating humanity of invention that marks all Cavalli's music. The performers gave delight (particularly the soft, suave tones of the Concerto Palatino cornetts and of the Dutch bass Harry van der Kamp, a Hilliard guest). Yet to my mind the sum of the parts added little except for a vague feeling of overlong-ness and, indeed, too-much-ness.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Osamu Kido, managing director, the Federation of </F> Welfare Annuity Funds: "Stop the Indiscriminate Restriction of  Corporate Annuity Funds"]    [Text] 1. Because of the aging of the population, the  amount of assets in corporate pension funds has grown steadily,  exceeding 50 trillion yen. This sizable amount is attracting  attention from those who are involved in this market.    2. There are only two sources of funds for corporate  pension plans: contributions and earnings from investment.  Because of the aging of population, pension funds will have to  rely more on investment earnings in the future.    3. To increase investment revenues in the long run, it  becomes necessary to achieve optimal allocation of assets,  according to the degree of acceptable risk for each pension  fund. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a system of risk  management for each pension fund and to eliminate or ease  regulations on investment imposed on both investment companies  and pension funds.  <H5>  Reaching the "Mature" Stage by 2010 Because of Increased </H5> Payments of Pension Benefits    There has been a rapid expansion in the total amount of  assets in corporate pension funds, which supplement income for  salaried employees after their retirement. As of the end of the  fiscal year 1992, the amount stood at more than 47 trillion yen  (32 trillion yen of which was in welfare annuity funds, and 15  trillion yen in funds approved for special tax treatments),  showing a robust increase of more than 10 percent per year. It  was the third largest, following 317 trillion yen in the United  States and 52 trillion yen in England. According to Nomura  Research Institute, the amount is expected to exceed 100  trillion yen by the year 2000.    Especially noteworthy is the growth of welfare annuity  funds.  As of the end of February 1994 there were 1,804 funds with 12  million participants, representing about a one-third of salaried  employees at private companies. These funds provide good  security -- they distribute portion of the nation's welfare  annuities and are required to pay out more than 30 percent of  the amount of this distribution. In comparison to other pension  plans, they are also attractive -- they receive preferential tax  treatments; contributions to the funds up to a certain level are  not subject to taxation. These are probably the reasons that the  corporations have enthusiastically adopted these funds.    Assets in the pension funds are invested in stocks and bonds  in the financial market through trust banks and life insurance  companies to generate revenues. Therefore, people involved in  the market have a strong interest in pension funds assets that  will continue to grow in the future.    Eighty-seven percent of the pension funds assets that are  managed by trust banks are invested in stocks and bonds; 44  percent in the case of those that are managed by life insurance  companies (as of the end of the fiscal year 1992). As trust  banks and life insurance companies share this market by two to  one, approximately 70 percent plus of the pension assets are  invested in stocks and bonds.    Beginning in the fiscal year 1990, portion of the assets in  the welfare annuity funds can be managed by investment advisory  firms. Also, the Federation of Welfare Annuity Funds can manage  the assets with some restrictions. Therefore, much larger  portion of pension assets will likely be invested in stocks and  bonds in the future.    An important mission for those involved in pension funds is  to invest in the financial market as profitably as possible  pension assets that are entrusted to them by corporations and  participants and thereby to ensure future payments of pension  benefits. But, as explained in detail in the following, the  problem is that the current system of investment is not adequate  to carry out this mission.    There are only two sources of revenues for welfare annuity  funds to pay pension benefits: contributions from corporations  and participants, and earnings from investing the contributions.    In light of the austere condition where corporations are  carrying out restructuring of their operations, it seems  difficult to raise the amount of contributions. As  pension-related costs are estimated to be about 10 percent of  total wages, raising them further will not be accepted readily.    On the other hand, a 1-percent increase in the rate of  return on investment is in general enough to offset more than a  20-percent reduction in the amount of contributions. Therefore,  proper investment will generate a significant amount of assets.    As corporate pension funds have become widespread, some of  them began to reach the "mature stage," where the amount of  annual payments of pension benefits equals that of annual  contributions. Most of the funds are expected to reach this  mature stage by the year 2010, and thus the time is getting  short for making enough profits from investment.  <H5>  Problems in the System That Lacks Market Principles </H5>   In April 1992 a Committee of Professionals was established  within the Committee of Assets Management at the Federation of  Welfare Annuity Funds. Its objective was to examine problems in  assets management, including restrictions on investment, and to  find solutions to these problems. Committee members included  Shigeki Sakakibara, professor of management at Kobe University,  and five other academics who are knowledgeable of pension assets  and computations. After a year of study, they compiled and  issued a report entitled "On Revising Restrictions on Investment  of Pension Assets."    The members of the committee and those involved in pension  funds at that time expressed their candid opinions: "We were  able to recognize how important market principles are in  managing pension assets in the securities market, and in what  respects the series of current restrictions on investment are in  contradiction to these market principles."    They also agreed on another point: "To meet the trust of  participants and beneficiaries of some 1,800 pension funds, it  is important for pension funds managers to understand the market  principles and to carry out their job responsibilities prudently  and honestly, considering different levels of acceptable risks  for different funds."    In other words, they reached a conclusion that there is no  other way than to establish a prudent-men's rule (fiduciary  responsibility) as in the ERISA (Employee Retirement Income  Security Act) in the United States. This means establishment of  a system of risk management by pension funds. In addition to  making basic investment policies (regarding acceptable risks and  so on), it is necessary to create a comprehensive manual,  covering how to select institutions that manage pension funds  and how to evaluate investment performances.    Reactions from various circles against the report by the  Committee of Professionals were not limited to favorable ones  such as "What they say sounds reasonable in light of the current  condition." Some opinions were critical: "Restrictions on  investment are still necessary to ensure the safety of pension  assets," and "to eliminate restrictions on investment, pension  funds themselves must streamline their operations first." To  these opinions, we responded as follows:    First, to ensure sound investment and to protect pension  benefits of beneficiaries, investment activities through trust  banks and life insurance companies have been restricted since  the inception of the pension system, using same ratios as  current allocation of pension assets (i.e., more than 50 percent  of assets are to be reserved to guarantee the principal, and  less than 30 percent to be invested in domestic stocks), except  for assets denominated in foreign currencies, according to the  notice from chief of the Banking Bureau of the Ministry of  Finance and per enforcement regulations of the Insurance  Business Act. However, as almost 30 years have passed since the  inception of this system, it is not clear how much safety these  restrictions provide to the pension assets.    Also, investment through investment advisory firms that were  allowed to enter the pension market in 1990 is subject to  fund-by-fund restrictions (i.e., more than 50 percent of assets  are to be reserved to guarantee the principal, less than 30  percent to be invested in domestic stocks, and less than 30  percent to be invested in assets denominated in foreign  currencies) as well as a duplicate restriction requiring more  than 50 percent of assets to be reserved to guarantee the  principal. Here, it is unclear why the duplicate restriction is  imposed. These restrictions also deviate from the special  rulings that came about as a result of the Japan-U.S. talks on  monetary policies in 1991, easing restrictions on foreign  investment advisory firms by allowing them to reserve more than  30 percent of assets to guarantee the principal.    As an example of advantages of the restrictions, we often  hear the following opinion: "Owing to restrictions on  investment, valuation losses of pension assets were only about  10 percent even when the stock market hit the bottom after the  collapse of the bubble economy." We want to respond to this by  saying, "This does not provide evidence that restrictions on  investment contribute to risk management of each individual  fund. In light of the acceptable risks, profits could have been  made if pension assets were allocated more to stocks than the  regulated ratio (30 percent) dictated. Therefore, they  [restrictions on investment] are actually robbing income  opportunities from the funds."    The biggest drawback of investment restrictions is that they  are weakening the sense of responsibility by both funds and  investment firms over risk management. For example, let's assume  that a fund at a high stage of maturity allocated its assets to  stocks up to the upper limit of the regulated ratio when it  should have reduced the amount of such investment in stocks. As  a result, the fund may incur valuation losses due to declining  stock prices, and pension financing that has already become  tight due to the advanced stage of maturity may deteriorate  further.    In August 1993 the Federation of Welfare Annuity Funds asked  some of the major financial institutions to which it entrusts  management of its pension assets how they thought of  restrictions according to types of investment institutions. All  of the eight trust banks and eight life insurance companies that  were questioned replied, "Regulations are needed at least until  pension funds themselves streamline their risk management  systems."    In contrast, all of the 16 investment advisory firms that  entered the market in April 1990 and three foreign-owned trust  banks replied differently: "Regulations should be eliminated as  soon as possible." The difference in opinions seems to show that  regulations are business-related issues of these investment  institutions, rather than safety issues for pension assets.    Those involved in pension funds strongly hope for earliest  possible elimination of investment regulations so that pension  funds with established risk management systems can select  investment institutions on their own according to their own  investment policies.    The objective in managing pension assets is to maximize  profits under the level of risk acceptable to each individual  fund so that pension liabilities will continue to be met in the  future. The acceptable level of risk varies, depending on the  stage of maturity of each individual fund as well as the  employer's ability to contribute to the fund, that is, the  profitability of the business. Therefore, it is not something to  be regulated.  <H5>  Application of Regulations According to Funds Ability </H5>   However, it was necessary to reconfirm a consensus for  pension funds in dealing with the issue at present. This point  was resolved in early December 1993 when the Committee on Assets  Management reached a decision: "For the time being, we maintain  investment regulations at the funds level, with exception of  those funds that have an ability to manage risks and a high  level of risk tolerance."    Those of us who are involved in pension funds understand  that  to demand easing of regulations, it is imperative for us to  establish a system of risk management (prudent-men's rule) on  pension funds. To this end, we are preparing an investment  manual in our department and are planning to distribute it to  all pension funds at the beginning of the fiscal year 1994.</p>

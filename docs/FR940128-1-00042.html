			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Private sources of water, particularly surface waters or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water from shallow wells, may be subject to microbiological,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical, or radiological contamination attributable to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source itself or to surface contamination at the well head or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intake. Private sources are also frequently untreated or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimally treated (Refs. 69, p. 15; and 70). Where the processor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uses a private source of water, it will need to take steps to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that the water is of a safe and sanitary quality. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> steps may include retaining a copy of the initial local health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority well design approval and copies of the local health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority fecal coliform test results; obtaining and maintaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> copies of private coliform test results; performing and recording  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periodic inspections of the sanitary condition of the well head  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or source intake; and performing and monitoring appropriate water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment procedures, including filtration, sedimentation, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chlorination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The type and frequency of controls exercised by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor should be based upon the type of source water and its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> historic safety and sanitary quality. Consequently, the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is proposing to require, in &sect;123.10(c)(3), that such controls be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed and documented at such frequency as necessary to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control. In &sect;123.10(a)(2), as a means of ensuring that potable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water does not become contaminated, the agency is proposing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that the processor ensure that there are no cross  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connections between the potable water system and any nonpotable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems. Nonpotable systems include waste water and sewage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cross connections, which include situations that allow for back  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> siphonage into a potable system from a nonpotable system under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative pressure conditions, can result in the chemical or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microbiological contamination of the potable water system (Refs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 64; 65, pp. 50 and 51; 68, 71, and 72). For example, if a hose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from a potable water system is left in a thawing tank with water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and frozen fish, and if negative pressure occurs that draws water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the tank back through the hose to the potable water system,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both the potable water line and the water source itself, i.e.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the municipal or private water system, can become contaminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Cross connections can best be controlled by performing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periodic inspections of the potable and nonpotable systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These inspections should be performed at least every time that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is a change in the plumbing of the systems and with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient additional frequency to ensure that unintentional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cross connections do not develop. Consequently, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.10(c)(3), the agency is proposing to require that such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections be performed and documented at such frequency as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to ensure control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  FDA is proposing in &sect;123.10(a)(3) to require that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor ensure that all food-contact surfaces are designed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constructed, and maintained in a manner that minimizes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential for chemical and microbiological contamination of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product. Utensils and equipment can be vehicles for microbial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contamination of both the raw and finished products. Utensils,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, and other food-contact surfaces that are made of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrosive material or wood, or that contain breaks, pits, cuts,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or grooves, may harbor pathogenic microorganisms that can migrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the product and contaminate it. These kinds of surfaces are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult to clean, with the pores and crevices shielding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microorganisms from the action of cleaning and sanitizing agents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Refs. 65, pp. 20, 36&hyph;48; 72, pp. 166 and 167; and 73).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

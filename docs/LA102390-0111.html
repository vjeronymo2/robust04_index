			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LORAL TO SELL 49% STAKE IN FORD DIVISION;  </P> <P> AEROSPACE: THE $182-MILLION DEAL WITH THREE EUROPEAN FIRMS WOULD CREATE ONE OF  THE WORLD'S LARGEST COMMERCIAL SATELLITE BUSINESSES.  </P> <P> Loral Corp. said Monday that it plans to sell a 49% interest in its newly  acquired satellite division of Newport Beach-based Ford Aerospace Corp. to  three European firms for $182 million.  </P> <P> Loral, a New York-based defense electronics concern, will sell the minority  interest in the Palo Alto-based Space Systems division to Aerospatiale Societe  Nationale Industrielle of France, Alcatel NV of Belgium and Selenia Spazio SPA  of Italy.  </P> <P> The sale is the second major asset of Ford Aerospace to be partially or fully  divested by Loral before it completes its $715-million acquisition of the  aerospace and defense company. The sale is expected to close sometime this  week, said Elizabeth Allen, a Loral spokeswoman.  </P> <P> The deal with the European firms would create one of the world's largest  commercial satellite businesses, with combined satellite operations revenue of  $1.3 billion between the partners, challenging Hughes Aircraft Co. and General  Electric Corp.  </P> <P> Despite some analysts' expectations that Loral will sell the Newport  Beach-based Aeronutronic division, Allen said the company has no plans to sell  any other Ford Aerospace divisions. In September, Loral sold Ford's BDM  International defense consulting subsidiary to the Carlyle Group, a Washington  investment group, for $130 million.  </P> <P> After agreeing to buy Ford Aerospace in July, Loral Chairman Bernard Schwartz  promised that he would not break up the operations of Ford Aerospace piecemeal.  </P> <P> But with the sale of BDM and the satellite operations, Schwartz said the  company decided after examining the businesses that the sale of the units would  be exceptions to that promise.  </P></p>

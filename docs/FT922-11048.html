			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (18): A hunter of business gems - Profile of George Bonar IN SPITE of its problems Poland still has its fans who insist that, while not always easy, the country well merits closer attention. Mr George Bonar, a Polish-born Canadian entrepreneur who is chairman, president and chief executive officer of International UNP Holdings Ltd, a Toronto-based, Polish investment fund with CDollars 9.5m capital and an impressive list of blue-chip international financial shareholders, is one of its keenest fans. Over the past few months he has examined around 250 medium-sized Polish companies. Out of a preliminary short list of 50 he has selected 15 for 'due diligence' examination. His board has also recently approved taking a controlling stake in the first two companies. 'It is our policy to take a stake of over 50 per cent so we control the shareholders' meeting and the supervisory board and can change the management if we like.' But, Mr Bonar adds: 'If we didn't like Polish management we would not have come this far.' Significantly, the first two acquisitions are companies producing basic consumer goods which are also dominant in their industry - a common characteristic of enterprises under the highly monopolistic communist system. IBIS in Bydgoszcz, for example, the first of UNP's acquisitions is Poland's largest bakery equipment maker while Biawar is the largest producer of water heaters. To those who despair that Poland's several thousand state-owned manufacturing companies can ever be turned into modern, profitable, capitalist enterprises, Mr Bonar, from first-hand experience retorts: 'I think there are gems among those middle-sized companies with up to 1,000 employees and sales up to Dollars 8-10m.' Convinced that many of these companies are capable of producing the 35 per cent return on capital which justifies such a venture capital approach Mr Bonar adds: 'There are several hundred of these companies and we are going out to find them. They will be the micro-economic success stories of the future.' For Mr Bonar, Poland is going through the sort of historic transition which opened up such profitable opportunities for post-war investors in Germany, Japan, Korea and Taiwan. With a highly-skilled and literate labour force, and a relatively low wage structure, the infusion of capital, technology and management skills will make almost any business highly competitive, he adds.</p>

			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: KRAVAT A 31ST STALWART; 'DESIGNING WOMEN' HOT  </P> <P> HAPPY NEW YEAR to Jerry Kravat, who is an important part of the process. You  can see him on the 31st, televised doing his "New Year's Eve at the Waldorf"  thing with his orchestra, where he has conducted for the last eight years.  Kravat was the natural successor to the late, great Guy Lombardo.  </P> <P> On the last night of 1989, you'll also be able to hear Kravat bands in The  Grand Bay, the Grand Hyatt, the Plaza Athenee, the Hudson River Club, the Mark,  the Marriott Marquis, the Pierre, the Plaza and at Tavern on the Green, the  spiffyest cafe for the holidays in all of New York.  </P> <P> LOVED THE Christmas card from the "Designing Women" cast which sent greetings  "from SOUTHERN California." (This show is very much set in the South, in  Atlanta, in case you've been under a rock and have never had the joy of seeing  it.)  </P> <P> The four DWs -- Annie Potts, Delta Burke, Dixie Carter, Jean Smart -- are being  joined by Dolly Parton for their New Year's Day special hour episode called  "The First Day of the Last Decade of the Entire Twentieth Century."  </P> <P> Writer Linda Bloodworth-Thomason put this episode together in only five days,  from first word on paper to the final framing shot by her director hubby, Harry  Thomason. The script was written on a Sunday, read by the cast on a Monday, and  all costumes and sets were built over two days. Dolly Parton's stint as a  "Guardian Movie Star" to the character Charlene should be a hoot. Another guest  star will be actress Beah Richards who plays a 102-year-old woman representing  the 20th Century.  </P> <P> "Designing Women" has been asked by the Museum of Broadcasting to participate  in its 7th Annual TV Festival in Los Angeles in March. The Festival will also  salute Danny Thomas and Sheldon Leonard, the "Colgate Comedy Hour," "Mary  Hartman, Mary Hartman," "Cheers" and CNN with Ted Turner. The L.A. County  Museum of Art's 600-seat theater has been sold out for weeks.  </P> <P> WHEN THE marvelous British actress Glynis Johns was only 19, she was the  youngest ever to play the role of Peter Pan in London. So the other day,  Glynis, now appearing with Rex Harrison and Stewart Granger in the romantic  Broadway play "The Circle," was thrilled to pieces to welcome backstage Mary  Martin. (Mary is America's own definitive Peter Pan from the musical version.)  </P> <P> A trio of octogenarians were in to see "The Circle" over the holidays --  Katharine Hepburn . . . Claudette Colbert . . . Helen Hayes. Mary Martin  couldn't come in with those ladies; she's only a septuagenarian.  </P> <P> DON'T MISS Money magazine's article on how current beliefs and myths about the  black middle class are way out in left field. The editors say the Bush  Administration misrepresents reality by describing the BMC as healthy and  growing, when -- in reality -- this group is "fragile and shrinking" under  continuing assaults of racial discrimination.  </P> <P> GUESS WHERE Broadway baby Mandy Patinkin will be Saturday night? The guy who  set the Great White Way on its ear with his controversial one-man show earlier  this year is going to repeat at the Concord Hotel in the Catskills. It marks  Mandy's debut there.  </P> <P> AS THE year winds down, here's a salute to the Malcolm Forbes column "Fact and  Comment" which I turn to first each month in Forbes magazine. I liked Malcolm's  upbeat assurance as to "What Sort of Year Will 1990 Be?" He says, "Not as tough  as it now seems it might be."  </P></p>

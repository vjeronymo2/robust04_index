The meeting  called on cadres and masses in suburban areas and various trades  of the municipality to further explore new ways for promoting  reform, opening up, and economic development in the suburban  areas of the extra large municipality from a higher plane with a  more positive attitude, a broader vista, greater courage, and  more solid measures in order to raise agricultural production,  rural work, and the entire rural economy to a new level.    Wu Bangguo, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC  Central  Committee and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee,  gave an important speech at the meeting. Wu Bangguo first fully  affirmed the achievements of the people in Shanghai's suburban  areas, their basic experience, and the work of cadres. He said:  Rural work in Shanghai's suburban areas registered good progress  last year. The broad masses of cadres and people in the  suburban areas have seriously studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics,  emancipated their minds, adhered to the ideology of seeking  truth from facts, and promoted a sustained, fast, and healthy  development of the economy in Shanghai's suburban areas. The  rural economy in Shanghai's suburban areas has become an  important component part of economic development in the entire  municipality and has also become an important part of Shanghai's  economic growth. The achievements of rural work are the results  of the hard work of the broad masses of cadres and people in the  suburban areas and of support by various trades in Shanghai. On  behalf of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, I wish to take  this opportunity to extend my cordial regards and express my  heartfelt gratitude to the broad masses of cadres and people in  the suburban areas who have worked laboriously.    Wu Bangguo pointed out: To maintain social stability, we  must promote economic development and attach importance to the  "Shopping Basket" Project. In light of new problems that  emerged in the "Shopping Basket" Project, we must carry out  reform, develop production bases, improve the marketing system,  and enforce macro control to ensure the supply of supplementary  food products for the municipality. We should enrich the  market, promote statiblity in society, and improve the people's  living conditions.    Wu Bangguo emphatically pointed out: In the new year, we  should seize the opportunity to deepen reform, further open up,  promote development, ensure stability, raise agricultural  production and rural work to a new level, and maintain a good  trend of economic development in Shanghai's suburban areas. All  trades and professions in society should show concern for and  support agriculture and take the initiative to serve economic  development in rural areas. We should firmly adhere to the  policy of "grasping the two links and attaching equal importance  to both." In line with the actual situation of rural work, we  should strengthen the construction of party organizations at  various levels in rural areas, pay attention to fostering an  advanced culture and ideology, and build an honest government.  We should show concern for the living conditions of the masses  and unite with the broad masses of people in rural areas to  jointly build a new socialist countryside.    Mayor Huang Ju also gave an important speech at the meeting.  After fully affirming the great achievements in various work  made by cadres and people in rural areas during 1993, Huang Ju  pointed out the general guiding principle for this year's rural  work. He said: We should fully implement the guidelines of the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the  Central Rural Conference, and the Second Plenary Meeting of the  Sixth Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee; seize the opportunity to  deepen reform, further open up, promote development, maintain  stability; and strive to keep a good trend of sustained, fast,  and healthy development of the rural economy. In promoting the  development of the rural economy, we should give prominence to  "one service and three coordinated actions." In other words, we  should serve the "Shopping Basket" Project for Shanghai's urban  residents and take coordinated actions with Shanghai's major  industries, with Shanghai's large markets, and with Shanghai's  foreign trade departments.       Huang Ju emphatically pointed out: This year's rural work  has four main tasks: First, we should effectively strengthen  agricultural work and firmly grasp the construction of the "two  greens," namely promoting the production of green vegetables and  planting trees. Second, we should further deepen reform, open  up, and strive to achieve a new breakthrough in our work.  Third, we should seriously draw up a blueprint for developing  suburban areas and promoting the urbanization of rural areas  step by step. Fourth, we should strive to raise peasants'  income on the basis of developing the economy and protect  peasants' enthusiasm for production.    Huang Ju said: We should stress promoting the production of  green vegetables, achieve a breakthrough in developing vegetable  gardens, and attach importance to greening projects to improve  the ecology and environment in urban and rural areas. Those are  major tasks to be firmly grasped in the next few years in  Shanghai. We should spend three years to further raise the  level of the "Shopping Basket" Project and establish a sound  engineering system for it. We should explore new ways for  developing the "Shopping Basket" Project to suit the needs of  the internationalized metropolis [guo ji hua da du shi 0948 7139  0553 1129 6757 1579] in the 1990's and the next century. We  should protect the production bases for vegetables and other  supplementary food products according to the 10-15 year plan,  form a new management system for production and marketing, and  implement various measures for developing the "Shopping Basket"  Project in a solid manner.    This year, we should achieve the goal of greening an average  of 1.4 square meters per person in the afforestation project and  the total area of forest cover should reach 15 percent. We  should plant trees on "four sides" [house side, village side,  roadside and water side] in rural areas, strengthen the  construction of forest belts along sea dikes, and develop flower  gardens. In this way, we will be able to form a beautiful  environment in all the suburban areas where "there are flowers  in spring, shade from trees in summer, fruits in autumn, and  green trees in winter."    Huang Ju called for raising the standard of development in  the suburban areas this year and accelerating the urbanization  of the countryside. He said: In making plans for various  districts and areas, we should not limit the development plan  within each county, but should coordinate with the overall  strategic plan for Shanghai's development. We should make great  efforts to improve infrastructure construction with special  emphasis on road construction. Various counties should  concentrate their financial power on building one or two main  highways first; construct water, electric power and gas and  other facilities; and strive to complete a relatively sound road  network within the next two to three years.    Huang Hu also pointed out: Industry in the suburban areas  has great vitality in Shanghai's economic development, and so we  should concentrate our efforts and financial power on promoting  industrial development in the suburban areas. Each county  should start with the construction of a key industrial zone, and  take on the new road of cooperation between counties, districts,  and bureaus. We should give full play to our combined strength  and strive to set up a number of enterprise groups with special  characteristics. Meanwhile, we should seriously sum up  experiences and actively promote the establishment of  "Sino-foreign" joint ventures with funds from the agricultural  and industrial sectors and foreign companies. In this way, we  can raise the level, scale, and efficiency of village and town  enterprises.    In conclusion, Huang Ju emphatically pointed out: Stability  in agricultural production and rural areas is the foundation for  stability in the entire society. The development of  agricultural production and rural areas is an important part of  Shanghai's overall society. Governments at various levels and  other units should all consider the work of developing the rural  economy and increasing the peasants' income as a starting point  and standpoint. We should mobilize the whole municipality,  promote cooperation, and raise the economic and social  development in rural areas to a new level.    Yesterday's meeting was presided over by Wang Liping, deputy  secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, and Vice  Mayor Meng Jianzhu, respectively. Vice Mayor Xie Lijuan  attended the meeting. Head of Minhang District Huang Furong and  head of Qingpu County Li Jinsheng introduced their experiences  in developing the rural economy at the meeting. Vice Mayor Meng  Jianzhu disseminated the guidelines of the national conference  on "Shopping Basket" Project and the production of grain,  cotton, and edible oil.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: SA pulp and paper maker down 38% SAPPI, South Africa's largest pulp and paper manufacturer, reported a 38 per cent drop to R374.7m (Dollars 138m) in net earnings in the year ended February, 1991. This follows a 44 per cent decline in the first six months, at R182.6m down from R326.8m. That result was affected by a series of labour and production difficulties and weaker prices for its products. The latest results saw turnover drop 2 per cent to R2.67bn from R2.73bn. Mr Eugene von As, managing director, said: 'World markets were against us, with steadily declining selling prices in international markets, and a depressed market at home.' He added: 'And we had to contend with a full year of a stronger rand and high interest rates.' A feature of the year was the establishment of Sappi Europe following the acquisition of five paper mills in the UK and the acquisition of the Hong Kong based Speciality Pulp Trading (SPT). The latter holds contracts to distribute all Sappi's non-rand denominated sales. Mr von As said the turnover contribution of Sappi's offshore associates was about an additional R1bn. Mr von As said Sappi Europe, the launching pad for the group's planned growth into the European market, hoped to consolidate its position both organically and by acquisition. Looking ahead, he predicted a modest increase in earnings in the current 12 months. He said world markets in paper and pulp remained soft with dollar prices for the main grades currently 19 per cent below levels a year ago. Earnings per share for last year fell to 402 cents from 650 cents. Sappi is maintaining its dividend at 200 cents a share.</p>

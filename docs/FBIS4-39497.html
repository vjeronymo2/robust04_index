			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ukrainian Army should stay aloof from politics,  according to Ukrainian President and Supreme Commander of Armed  Forces Leonid Kravchuk. "Political feuds should not touch the  Army," he told a conference of chief executives devoted to army  issues in Kiev today.    "According to the requirements of the times, the armed  forces  and the state machinery must be permanently ready to defend  Ukraine, its sovereignty and territorial integrity," Kravchuk  said. He pointed out that the Army's main goal was to maintain  the country's ability to defend itself and maintain the  inviolability of its borders.    The Ukrainian Defense Ministry press service told  INTERFAX-Ukraine that the conference had been attended by the  leaders of government, Defense Ministry and the military complex.    The conference touched on a wide range of issues embraced by  the single goal to achieve a qualitative change in the  management of the Ukrainian armed forces.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- A sticker with the  Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] name, initials and emblem will be  affixed to the bottom of national and regional ballot papers,  the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] said on Tuesday [19  April]. IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler told a press  conference in Johannesburg the procedure was flawed but all  parties had agreed to it in Pretoria on Tuesday.    The stickers will be affixed at individual polling stations  before the ballot papers are brought to the issuing desk and  handed to voters. Mr Justice Kriegler said the IEC had awarded  the contract for printing the stickers to one firm after  considering four possibilities.    IFP candidate lists would be vetted no later than Friday and  published no later than the weekend, he said.    Mr Justice Kriegler said the procedure was flawed because  parties did not appear in alphabetical order. The IFP [Inkatha  Freedom Party] stickers, which also showed a colour picture of  IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi, would look different because  they were printed on a white background. The ballot paper was  marked.    If the IFP sticker crossed the line of the political party  above it, the ballot paper would be spoilt, he said.    Mr Justice Kriegler could not say if this system would  increase the number of spoilt votes, but said the complicated  process left room for human error.    The stickers would not necessarily increase the number of  election result disputes, he said. Each party had accepted the  system and Mr Justice Kriegler believed this agreement would  lessen the prospect of such disputes.    He congratulated the government, the African National  Congress and the IFP on their agreement. It would make the  IEC's talk of declaring the elections free and fair "infinitely  easier" because all major political role players took part, he  said.    The IFP's participation would reduce violence caused by  political frustration and resistance to the electoral process in  Natal, Mr Justice Kriegler predicted.    He would not disclose whose idea the stickers was. "It may  even have been mine. I think it was," he joked, saying the idea  had been thrown around on Saturday when he and the IEC chief  director met the three political parties.    IEC Commissioner Ben van der Ross said a team had already  been sent to kwaZulu/Natal to investigate setting up an  addi4ional 700 voting stations. Security at the stations was a  concern and talks were being held with security forces in the  area.</p>

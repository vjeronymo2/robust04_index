"A particularly large number of inhabitants of Moldova and  Ukraine are now in pursuit of ill-gotten gains from this,"  Customhouse Chief A. Lyulin said. "Narcotic substances have  simply been flooding in from there. Judge for yourselves:  Whereas in the whole of last year we discovered 574 kg, this  year we discovered 560 kg in January alone! And we are among  the leading Russian customhouses in terms of drugs seizures..."    The figures, of course, are not gratifying. They transport  narcotics even in railcar hatches and coal bunkers.    The customs officials' haul was the biggest yet: 360 kgs of  poppy haulms was seized from gypsies on the Chisinau-Moscow  train. They naturally disowned the goods and pretended to be  illiterate to avoid reading or signing the seizure warrant.    But the customs officials were particularly taken aback by  the fact that this dreadful product was being transported to the  capital by a woman with 14 children. Brandishing her  heroine-mother papers, she expressed loud indignation at the  confiscation.    "How can you sell a substance which will kill babies and  future mothers?"--a young customs official asked her.    "What business of mine are other people's kids?" she spat  out.</p>

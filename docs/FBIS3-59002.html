Please bring  along all the military clothes and equipment that you received."  These weeks and months, all over Austria, tens of thousands of  militia soldiers will receive similar call-up orders. He who  has a company commander who is generous with information may  learn from an accompanying letter that this is a measure within  the framework of restructuring the Federal Army and that the  exercise will be held in civilian clothes. This is necessary  because some men will turn in their military clothes. No  further details are mentioned.    The largest organizational reform of the Federal Army in 20  years is taking place almost without people noticing.  "Heeresgliederung (HG) neu" ["New Army Structure"] is the  catchword, and it will lead to a reduction of the real  mobilizing strength from 240,000 to 120,000 men. The new  definition of tasks provides for disaster relief, assistance  operations (Burgenland), and border protection operations  (Slovenia 1991). A limited defensive action is regarded as less  probable, although manageable.    In the future, potential threats are to be warded off at the  border. For this purpose, a 15,000-men reaction force should be  available by 1995, two-thirds of which will consist of  professional soldiers. How much the new army structure focuses  on operations is also reflected in the fact that there is no  longer a differentiation between organization for peace and for  operations.    The new structure provides for three corps, each consisting  of one command battalion, one telecommunications battalion, one  engineering battalion, and one reconnaissance battalion.  Moreover, there are artillery, medical, and supply units at  regiment strength. The 3d Corps (Lower and Upper Austria) has  one extra regiment of engineers and the three Army brigades of  armored infantrymen.    In the sphere of the military command of Carinthia, Styria,  and Burgenland, two brigades of infantrymen each -- each with  4,000 men -- and several units of guards and blocking troops  will be set up. In the remaining six military commands, only  brigades of infantrymen and guards and blocking troops will be  established.    With the establishment of the new army structure, almost all  area-bound units (such as blocking battalions) have been  dissolved. Only the personnel of the fixed installations retain  their assignments. The futures of militia soldiers of dissolved  units will depend on their qualifications, their abilities, and  the personnel needs of the new units. What is certain is that  all militia soldiers who have reached the new 35-year age limit  will be discharged. Those who are younger and have not yet  served all compulsory 60 days of exercises have to continue  service until the age of 35, unless they are no longer needed  because there are enough men or because of insufficient  qualifications.    The establishment of the new 120,000-man task organization  will be concluded by the middle of 1995. "The conversion is  going really well as far as the militia are concerned,"  Brigadier Friedrich Hessel, head of the General Staff Department  in the Defense Ministry said. All troops receive Field Uniform  75 and Automatic Rifle 77. The old uniforms and the 58-rifle  will no longer be used.    The restructuring process will take somewhat longer in the  area of training units. "Service regulations and ossified  structures will cause delays," Hessel said. The  Landwehrstammregimenter (LWSR) (infantry parent regiments),  which were needed in the past as recruit schools for the militia  army, have ceased to exist at the beginning of the year. In  Lower Austria, for example, the LWSR 32 (Korneuburg) and 33  (Mautern) will become Motorized Infantry Regiment 3. The  facilities will be kept.    Basically, one can say that each unit will train its own  recruits. He who starts his basic military service at Motorized  Infantry Regiment 8 in Salzburg, will be used as a militia  soldier within the framework of Motorized Infantry Brigade 8.    Even in the restructured army, somewhat more than half of  those doing basic military service will serve eight months in a  row. Then they will be assigned to a task organization for a  few years without, however, having to participate in any  exercises. Those who used to serve six months will now have to  do seven months, with the last 30 days mainly being dedicated to  operational exercises. Then the remaining 30 days will have to  be served in two-year intervals in the form of six-day exercises.    Social hardship -- that is to say the dismissal of  professional soldiers -- should be avoided whenever possible,  although some officers and noncommissioned officers might be  forced to commute to other facilities. "A soldier has to be  that flexible," Brigadier Hessel said.</p>

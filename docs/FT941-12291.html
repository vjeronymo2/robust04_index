			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Postel in mezzanine finance move Postel, the UK's largest pension fund manager, is for the first time to provide private companies with mezzanine finance in a move that signals that higher proportions of debt are likely to begin creeping back into the financing of management buy-outs. Through the BT and Post Office Pension Schemes, Postel is buying 20 per cent of Intermediate Capital Group, one of the few groups still providing mezzanine finance, a form of capital that is riskier and higher yielding than bank debt but is not generally classed as equity. Many of the institutions that entered the market in the late 1980s and lost substantial sums on deals like the buy-outs of Isosceles and Magnet, have recently withdrawn. One of the main reasons these deals failed was that buyers were able to inflate the price they could offer by taking on what proved to be unmanageable amounts of debt. Postel has also given ICG Pounds 50m to invest alongside its own funds in the European mezzanine market. Together with a Pounds 10m injection from another 'major UK insurance company', ICG says it will have over Pounds 250m to invest over the next three to four years. Last month Postel folded most of its investments in private companies into a joint venture with Granville, the private investment bank, signalling a withdrawal from direct management of assets in this sector. Postel's moves are seen as confirmation that demand for mezzanine finance is likely to increase as management buy-out teams and their financiers seek to raise gearing and therefore, the prices paid to acquire their companies. Increased demand is also expected from companies seeking development funds that the banks will not supply. Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, Postel chief executive, said a material proportion of what the group allocated to unquoted investments was being put in the mezzanine market because 'there is a gap in the funds available to unlisted companies between bank borrowings and equity funds from venture capital investors'. Mr Ross Goobey said Postel was 'attracted by the high yield and more reliable return that this form of unquoted investment is able to offer.' Postel is understood to be buying 20 per cent of ICG, mainly from Westpac Banking, the Australian group, for substantially more than the Pounds 9m value of the stake when the group was set up in 1989. Mr Tom Bartlam, managing director of ICG, said mezzanine finance could increase gearing and therefore helped management buy-out teams pay higher prices. But he did not think there would be a return to the highly leveraged buy-outs of the late 1980s.</p>

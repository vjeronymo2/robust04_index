			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Yi Sok-ku from Tokyo] </F>   [Text] Quoting a ROK Defense Ministry source, Japan's  YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported on 8 February that the ROK and the  United States have decided to begin the Team Spirit joint  military exercise on 22 March, which will last 10 days, if North  Korea does not accept nuclear inspections by 21 February when  the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governor's  meeting is to be held.    YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported that this year's Team Spirit  exercise will be sharply reduced in its scope compared to last  year, but that it will be faced with a more tense situation due  to North Korea's nuclear issue.    YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported that the ROK and the United States  decided that 40,000 troops -- one-third of last year's 120,000  troops that were fully mobilized for the exercise -- will take  part in this year's exercise. It also reported that the two  countries are examining the possibility of not deploying combat  forces from the U.S. continent, but holding the exercise with  the U.S. troops stationed in the ROK and the ROK Armed Forces.    However, THE WASHINGTON POST reported that the U.S. Defense  Department is preparing for the possible order to deploy to the  ROK approximately 1,000 U.S. soldiers on active duty and reserve  forces by 22 February for the possible holding of the Team  Spirit exercise.    YOMIURI SHIMBUN added that the ROK and the United States  decided that they will stop the exercise if North Korea  expresses its will to accept nuclear inspections even if the  Team Spirit exercise has begun.</p>

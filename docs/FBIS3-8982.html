			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Bojan Veselinovic report on the 16 March extraordinary </F> session of the State Chamber]    [Excerpts] [Begin recording] [Veselinovic] Among those  invited to attend today's extraordinary session about the  Slovene public debt and the relations with a consortium of  commercial banks, parliamentary Chairman Herman Rigelnik listed  government ministers, the director of the Agency for the  Rehabilitation of Banks, and the director of the Slovene Social  Accounting Service. Beside Marjan Podobnik, who spoke in the  name of the proposers of the extraordinary session, Finance  Minister Mitja Gaspari, National Bank of Slovenia Governor Dr.  France Arhar, and Janko Dezelak from the Agency for  Rehabilitation of Banks, have spoken so far. Let us take is a  step at a time:    Marjan Podobnik said that it is imperative to identify all  forms of incurring debts to find out what we are obliged to pay  and what not. Podobnik expressed belief that our negotiations  do not observe the provisions of the Constitutional Law, that is  to say, they only observe it partially, while they neglect the  division of assets, that is to say, the property of former  Yugoslavia. Here he demanded:    [Podobnik] To establish the identity of each credit  separately, namely, who incurred what credit, who spent it for  what purpose, and who is the true debtor.    [Veselinovic] In the continuation, he, among other things,  criticized the government for not sending an original contract  about reprogramming debts from the end of the eighties to the  deputies. Podobnik also said that he was not opposed to the  model of financial rehabilitation of banks, but objected to  fictitious debts and their doubling. He also said that a  foreign auditing house has audited the Ljubljana Bank, however,  with a remark that it could not carry out the audit in  compliance with international standards. [passage omitted]    Regarding Podobnik's question about the actual height of the  public debt first, Finance Minister Gaspari, in an expose that  followed, said that the well-known estimate [6.5 billion German  marks] is based on the data available by the end of 1993.  Regarding the trade in debts, that is to say, the early purchase  of debts, he said that the legislation in old Yugoslavia at that  time allowed this and that this is a legitimate practice  internationally, however, the creditors are not interested in  this trade. The key issue for them is who has taken out the  debt.    Gaspari said that the government is not opposed to  Podobnik's  proposal for the revision of the credit agreements that led to  the public debt. Regarding the share of the entire old Yugoslav  debt that Slovenia should repay to the commercial banks, Gaspari  said that the good 16 percent that we managed to agree in the  negotiations with the International Monetary Fund is an example  to all other debtors, because:    [Gaspari] The decision of the International Monetary Fund  that became a law in Slovenia is the first international action  that recognized Slovenia as a successor to the former  Yugoslavia. How? Simply, because Slovenia in that document  split the share of the former Yugoslavia in the active and  passive part of the balance sheet of the International Monetary  Fund. That is why it was such an important precedent. Slovenia  is also using it now, as it has also been approved by the  Badinter Commission, which is not a negligible institution  within the Geneva talks.    [Veselinovic] [Passage omitted] According to Gaspari, the  views of the proposers of the session resemble the views of the  negotiators from the rest of the former Yugoslavia. Namely,  there is no guarantee that we will manage to get a better  position in the succession negotiations than we enjoy now that  we have decided to break free completely from the finance system  of the former Yugoslavia.    Governor France Arhar, too, said that this decision was  without an alternative:    [Arhar] What is the alternative to the negotiations with the  creditors? The alternative to the negotiations with the  creditors is negotiations with the debtors.    [Veselinov] Those of you who oppose the negotiations, Arhar  concluded, should bear in mind that according to the credit  agreements everything but mines and defense systems qualifies  for confiscation.    Janko Dezelak, in the name of the Agency for the  Rehabilitation of Banks, said that incrimination of the  state-assumed debts of weak companies is an expression of the  lack of knowledge about these problems.    A debate of the deputies, which will be partially closed to  the public, is envisaged to take place after the expose by Janez  Kopac. The parliament is currently in recess. [end recording]</p>

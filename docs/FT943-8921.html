			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Search for Guppy fraud proceeds The government has appointed Mr John Alexander, chairman of the corporate recovery section at accountants Pannell Kerr Forster, to search for money under the control of Mr Darius Guppy. Mr Guppy was jailed for five years and fined Pounds 539,000 in March last year after being convicted of a Pounds 1.8m insurance fraud. With Mr Benedict Marsh, he arranged a bogus gems theft in a New York hotel, then claimed Pounds 1.8m from Lloyd's, the London insurance market, to cover the loss to their company, Inca Gemstones. Mr Guppy's fine was later reduced to Pounds 227,000 and he was ordered to reveal where the money was. He said he had entrusted it to an unnamed party and had lost contact. Mr Marsh has repaid Pounds 561,000 to Lloyd's.</p>

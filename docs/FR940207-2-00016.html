			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Following completion of construction, approximately 70 of the total 200 acres would be allowed to revert to preconstruction conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Avoca proposes to use a 100-foot-wide construction right-of-way for its gas, water, and brine pipelines. Avoca's permanent rights-of-way for the pipelines outside the site property would vary from 25 to 50 feet wide, depending on the number of pipelines in the easement: 25 feet wide for single pipelines and 50 feet wide for multiple pipelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The EA Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''. The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By this Notice of Intent, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues it will address in the EA. All comments received are taken into account during the preparation of the EA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EA will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed project under these general headings:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Geology and soils;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Water resources, fisheries, and wetlands;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Vegetation and wildlife;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Endangered and threatened species;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Land use;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Cultural resources;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Air quality and noise;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Hazardous waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our independent analysis of the issues will be in the EA. Depending on the comments received during the scoping process, the EA may be published and mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for this proceeding. A comment period will be allotted for review if the EA is published. We will consider all comments on the EA before we recommend that the Commission approve or not approve the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Currently Identified Environmental Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have already identified several environmental issues that we think deserve attention based on a preliminary review of the proposed facilities and the information provided by Avoca. Keep in mind that this is a preliminary list. The list of issues will be added to, subtracted from, or changed based on your comments and our analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The list of environmental issues:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Avoca would drill a total of 19 new wells in Steuben County, New York: 10 solution-mined cavern, 3 water source, and 6 brine disposal wells. These facilities have a potential for groundwater and surface impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Whether the structural geology of the area is sufficient to contain solution-mined caverns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Avoca proposes to use 2,000,000 gallons of water per day for the solution-mining process during the first 2 years of operation at the Avoca Gas Storage Field. This may have an impact on groundwater availability. Testing of wells in the local aquifers indicate that the water supply recharges up to 14,600,000 gallons of water per day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Avoca's pipelines would cross two perennial streams: Neils Creek and Cotton Creek. Both of these creeks are high-quality trout streams, classified as trout-spawning grounds by New York.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Avoca's brine disposal pipelines would cross 16 wetlands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Avoca would construct a new compressor station and pumping facility. The nearest noise-sensitive area to Avoca's new compressor station and pumping facility is 2,400 feet to the northeast. There is the potential for air and noise quality impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Possible impact on federally listed threatened or endangered species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Possible impact on cultural resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> You can make a difference by sending a letter addressing your specific comments or concerns about the project. You should focus on the potential environmental effects of the proposal, alternatives to the proposal (including alternative routes), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments, the more useful they will be.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are received and properly recorded:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / The Group of Seven Summit: Major achieves most objectives Mr John Major, the British prime minister, left Naples yesterday buoyed by summit successes on jobs, institutional reform and debt restructuring but regretting the G7 leaders' timidity on trade liberalisation. No one in the British camp was describing Mr Major's performance as a triumph. But officials said he had achieved most of his summit objectives. Mr Major will tell MPs today the summit refused to accept the US agenda for broad trade liberalisation in spite of strong British support for 'further and faster' progress towards free trade in areas such as services. But he will also have several successes to report: The summit agreed to British proposals for a reduction in the stock of debt owed by developing countries to the Paris Club of creditor nations. The agreement provides for debt write-offs of 66 per cent for most debtor countries and up to 80 for the worst hit. The leaders adopted a broadly deregulatory plan for job creation which reflects many of the British government's concerns about over-regulation and inflexible labour markets. President Yeltsin's presence at the political session yesterday followed strong British pressure for greater Russian participation in the summit. Mr Major said he raised the issue at last year's G7 summit in Tokyo and discussed it with President Yeltsin during his February visit to Moscow. The summit called on Iran to stop supporting terrorist movements after British appeals for action to stop the flow of funds from Tehran to the Provisional IRA. Talks in the margins of the conference made progress towards identifying an acceptable candidate for successor to Mr Jacques Delors as European Commission president. Mr Major discussed the issue with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, current EU Council president.</p>

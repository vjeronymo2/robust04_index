			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Fine-tuning in the overseas risk business  -A new chief at the Overseas Private Investment Corp IN a corner behind the door to Ms Ruth Harkin's office sits a pile of framed maps of the world, which the new head of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation has not yet had time to hang. 'My personal imprint on the office so far is the paperwork on my desk,' she says, several months after her June 2 swearing in. In April President Bill Clinton launched Opic on its most challenging venture to date: providing loans, loan guarantees and risk insurance to US companies going in to the former Soviet Union, as part of the administration's Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.05bn) Russian aid package. Opic hopes to convert Dollars 40m of government funds into more than Dollars 1bn in loan guarantees, new loans and equity projects in Russia over the next two years. Like his Republican predecessor, the new president sees Opic as a foreign policy tool. Especially in the current cash-strapped era it is easier to encourage business to go abroad and contribute to development efforts than to make direct appropriations of foreign aid. In 1992 the 22-year-old agency received its first congressional appropriation. Since then it has done something almost unheard of in the halls of government: return the money. This year, Ms Harkin says, she will give back about Dollars 17m to Congress. The agency's main mission is to provide insurance against currency problems, political violence and expropriations to companies seeking to invest abroad. It functions much like a private insurer collecting fees from the organisations it insures. Opic also offers financial services such as direct loans to businesses and fee-earning advisory services. The agency has attracted a degree of controversy, with labour unions arguing it is encouraging 'runaway plants' that cost US jobs. During the 1992 election campaign the Clinton camp lambasted Opic, along with the Agency for International Development, for encouraging manufacturers to relocate their plants in Central America. But business believes it has found a champion in Ms Harkin, according to Mr Willard Workman, vice-president of the US Chamber of Commerce. The business community feels the Department of Labour is resistant to foreign investment because of the consequent job losses at home. 'We think that's a specious argument because there are going to be some jobs created in Guatemala, but there are also going to be jobs created here to oversee that investment,' says Mr Workman. However, labour, which is not such a natural ally for Opic, has expressed hope that Ms Harkin will be more sensitive to job-loss issues, in that her husband, democratic Senator Tom Harkin, has always been a strong union supporter. Ms Harkin said she would not encourage companies to take plants abroad, but she takes a business-oriented approach to whether moving a factory costs American jobs. Factories moving abroad can still create jobs at home, she says, because 'you are utilising the local workforce, but at the same time you are bringing over American equipment, which means American jobs.' The battle over the North American Free Trade Agreement has served to heighten sensitivities about Opic policies, with labour and environmental groups scrutinising US trade policy more closely than before. 'Given the heated debate about Nafta there is a change in the nature of the debate that was not there in the past,' says Dr Robert Lawrence, a professor of economics at Harvard University. Thus far, however, Ms Harkin has earned cautious support from factions which are fighting tooth and nail over the agreement. One of the agency's newest initiatives is an environmental growth fund that Opic will use to encourage US 'envirotech' companies to help clean pollution abroad - a project which Ms Harkin sees as the agency's biggest departure from the Bush era. Overall, Ms Harkin believes her role is to fine-tune rather than overhaul the agency, which she describes as 'a jewel in terms of its efficiency and the calibre of its employees'. It is a job quite different from that confronting the head of the troubled Agency for International Development, a job Ms Harkin went after but did not get. 'The intrigue at AID was on a totally different level,' she said. 'Many people have told me that I am very fortunate (not to be at AID) and I believe them.'</p>

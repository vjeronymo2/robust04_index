			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Publishers told to play by the book MR Terry Maher, chairman of Pentos, which runs the Dillons bookshop chain, has written to UK publishers urging them to drop support for the net book agreement. He argued that a recent judgment from European Court of First Instance rendered the agreement 'unlawful' in the UK and that the chances of modifying it to reflect the court's concerns about its restrictive implications were 'remote'. 'In our view the PA (the Publishers' Association) and its members should no longer expend further time and substantial amounts of your money to salvage arrangements which are anti-competitive, anachronistic and incompatible with Community law,' he wrote. The Publishers' Association has argued that the court's ruling is narrow and solely applies to interstate trade.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Overseas rise limits Body Shop's decline BODY SHOP International, which last month issued its first profit warning and saw its share price fall by 41 per cent, yesterday spelt out the reasons for the sharp decline in its UK performance. Trading profit in the UK slid 42 per cent to Pounds 3.7m in the six months to August 31, making up 39 per cent of the Pounds 9.56m total, down from Pounds 10.5m. This was the first time UK profits had fallen behind those made overseas. Mr Gordon Roddick, chairman, said the row with one of the biggest UK franchisees with six shops in the south of England had cost about Pounds 400,000 in lost profit. By the end of this week all six would be replaced by company-owned shops. The relocation of Cos-tec, a cosmetics making subsidiary, had cost about Pounds 500,000. Other profit reductions were caused by franchisees delaying Christmas orders and by the transfer of shops from company ownership to franchisees. Domestic turnover fell from Pounds 36.9m to Pounds 35m, in spite of 15 shop openings, taking the total to 219. Sales had dropped off from the middle of June, said Mr Roddick, and had remained volatile. The UK setback led to a 10 per cent fall in group pre-tax profit from Pounds 9.15m to Pounds 8.26m, in line with the September 16 warning. Group sales advanced 6 per cent to Pounds 67.2m (Pounds 63.2m). Overseas trading profit grew 28 per cent to Pounds 5.1m, excluding the US where there was an eightfold improvement to Pounds 800,000 and the 100th store was opened. The US had been organised into four regions each under the equivalent of a head franchisee. The number of shops outside the UK grew from 517 to 590. In Asia, including Japan where there will be 10 shops by the end of the year, sales rose 54 per cent. Continental Europe grew by 35 per cent. After capital spending of Pounds 10.7m, net debt rose from Pounds 32m at the year-end to about Pounds 41.5m, for gearing of a little more than 50 per cent. The main item was the Pounds 6m purchase of industrial property rights from Constantine &amp; Weir, a supplier. Total capital spending this year was expected to fall from Pounds 18m to Pounds 12m. Earnings per share slipped to 2.9p (3p). The interim dividend is held at 0.68p. See Lex</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / International Company News: Cavendish shareholders say yes to Li Ka-shing A 17-MONTH quest by Mr Li Ka-shing's Hutchison Whampoa to take full control of Cavendish International ended yesterday when the company's shareholders approved a HK5.50-a-share offer. An extraordinary general meeting voted 96 per cent in favour of the offer which valued Cavendish at HKDollars 16bn (USDollars 2.07bn) and required an outlay of HKDollars 5.8bn by Hutchison for the 36.63 per cent of the company it did not already own. Hutchison first bid for Cavendish in February last year. But, in a rare upset for Mr Li, shareholders rejected the then offer of HKDollars 4.10 a share. Cavendish was formed in 1987 to act as a holding company for some of Mr Li's property and energy interests. Aside from property, it owns a third of Hongkong Electric and 24.5 per cent of Husky Oil of Canada. Although the current offer was still well below Cavendish's net asset value of around HKDollars 6.40 a share, the strength of the Hong Kong stock market allied to Cavendish's under-performance left investors little option but to take the money and run.</p>

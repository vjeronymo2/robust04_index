			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Government backs down on pension trustees The government is backing down from proposals to force employers to allow pension scheme members to elect representatives to boards of trustees. The Department of Social Security proposed in a white paper this summer that employers should hold ballots of pension scheme members on whether they wanted to appoint a third of the trustees. The government proposed that schemes would be allowed not to have trustees appointed by members only when a majority of members did not want them. The right of scheme members to appoint some of the trustees is considered an important factor in alerting regulators to possible wrongdoing or underfunding in pension schemes. At a Confederation of British Industry conference on pension reform, Mr William Hague, social security minister, said the government had received 178 responses to its proposals on member trustees. Mr Hague said: 'Two points were expressed quite clearly by many respondents. Firstly, that requiring a referendum in every scheme, even when members may be perfectly content with the arrangements, is a cumbersome and costly process. 'A majority of respondents proposed that the process for allowing members to decide if they wish to nominate trustees should be triggered only when a proportion of members express dissatisfaction with current scheme arrangements.' Mr Hague added: 'We will implement our reforms with this in mind.' Both the CBI and the National Association of Pension Funds, the occupational pensions trade group, had urged the government to ease its requirements for balloting. The association, which has 1,200 members from the largest schemes, says 60 per cent of its members have member trustees and there is little point interfering with schemes which are working well. Mr Ron Amy, association chairman, said: 'We welcome the fact that the government have taken our views on board.' Mr Hague reiterated the government's intention to put in place a minimum solvency requirement, which employers' groups say will increase the cost of running pension schemes. This will require schemes to have assets equal to at least 90 per cent of the 'cash equivalent' value of buying out each member's accrued benefits. Mr Hague said that to avoid schemes suddenly falling below the minimum solvency floor in the event of a sudden collapse in stock prices, pension funds would be able to use an average of equity prices over a period. The pension funds association has urged that for these valuations equity prices should be averaged over six months.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Research has shown that passive exposure to tobacco smoke damages endothelial cells and increases the number of circulating anuclear carcasses of endothelial cells [Ex. 4&hyph;80]. ETS appears to alter cardiac cellular metabolism in such a way that renders the myocyte less capable of producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Reduced oxidative phosphorylation in cardiac mitochondrial fractions taken from rabbits exposed to ETS has been demonstrated [Ex. 4&hyph;130]. Studies have indicated that the reduction in mitochondrial respiration secondary to ETS exposure is likely due to decreased cytochrome oxidase activity [Exs. 4&hyph;130, 4&hyph;131].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nicotine, a component of tobacco smoke, has been shown in in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> vitro  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> studies, to inhibit the release of prostacyclin, through inhibition of cyclooxygenase, from the rings of rabbit or rat aorta. Nicotine could also affect platelets by releasing catecholamines which lead to increased thromboxane A2 [Ex. 4&hyph;25]. Passive smoke also increases blood viscosity and hematocrit due to relative hypoxia induced by chronic carbon monoxide exposure [Ex. 4&hyph;25]. Nicotine, contained in cigarette smoke can lead to catecholamine release, which enhances platelet adhesiveness and decreases the ventricular fibrillation threshold. This threshold is also affected by carbon monoxide levels [Exs. 4&hyph;25, 4&hyph;196]. Cigarette smoke also increases the lipolysis that increases levels of plasma free fatty acids, which result in enhanced synthesis of LDL [Ex. 4&hyph;234].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In conclusion, there are multiple pathways by which ETS may damage the heart. ETS exposure has been demonstrated to both increase myocardial oxygen demand and decrease myocardial oxygen supply. If oxygen demand exceeds supply for a long enough period of time, then myocardial cell injury or even cell death can occur. In addition, ETS exposure may cause platelets to become less sensitive to the anti-clotting regulatory substances in the blood and therefore increase the tendency of the blood to clot. An increased tendency for the blood to clot may lead to an increased susceptibility to heart attacks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ETS exposure may also contribute to the chronic formation of arterial wall plaques which are implicated in the event of an acute myocardial infarction. The two mechanisms described by which ETS exposure may stimulate plaque formation are endothelial cell injury and increased platelet activation. Different people will have different abilities to deal with the increased stress on the heart and the increased tendency of the blood to clot as a result of ETS exposure. For example, a young, otherwise healthy individual may be able to tolerate short-term ETS exposure without apparent difficulty, although asymptomatic arterial wall injury may occur which can contribute to cardiac injury in the future. However, an older person with pre-existing coronary artery disease and therefore minimum cardiac reserve may not be able to tolerate short-term ETS exposure, due to the increased stress on the heart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Reproductive Effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Data on the reproductive effects due to the exposure of nonsmoking pregnant women to ETS has been presented in many studies [Exs. 3&hyph;438, 4&hyph;92, 4&hyph;132, 4&hyph;174, 4&hyph;208, 4&hyph;273, 4&hyph;285, 4&hyph;287, 4&hyph;299]. This is important since many nonsmoking women continue to work throughout their pregnancies. Pregnant women working in indoor environments without tobacco smoking restrictions, as in restaurants, comprise one of the most heavily ETS-exposed groups [Exs. 4&hyph;151, 4&hyph;287].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Low birthweight has also been shown to be associated with paternal smoking, implying passive exposure to tobacco smoke by the nonsmoking mother [Exs. 4&hyph;92, 4&hyph;273]. Passive exposure to tobacco smoke is estimated to double the risk of low birthweight in a full-term baby [Ex. 4&hyph;208]. Nonsmoking pregnant women who are exposed to ETS have been reported to deliver neonates that range 24 to 120 grams lighter in weight than those babies delivered by nonexposed pregnant women [Exs. 4&hyph;132, 4&hyph;174, 4&hyph;208, 4&hyph;273]. This relationship between passive smoking and low birthweight remains statistically significant even after accounting for mother's age, parity, social class, sex of baby, and alcohol consumption. This effect is more apparent in neonates born to actively smoking women who deliver babies that weigh, on average, 200 grams less than those of nonsmoking women [Ex. 4&hyph;101]. The reduction in birthweight is clinically significant at the low end of the birthweight distribution. These infants have higher perinatal mortality [Ex. 4&hyph;239].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other reproductive effects that have been ascribed to maternal ETS exposure include miscarriage, an increase in congenital abnormalities [Exs. 4&hyph;239, 4&hyph;299], and numerous other physiological effects [Ex. 4&hyph;297]. It was reported that these effects may be part of a general immunosuppressive condition associated with the occurrence of low birthweight [Ex. 4&hyph;299]. This effect may predispose the baby to respiratory tract infections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The effects of environmental smoke exposure on the fetus may have long-term sequelae into childhood and adulthood [Exs. 4&hyph;53, 4&hyph;181, 4&hyph;213, 4&hyph;225, 4&hyph;239, 4&hyph;51, 4&hyph;297]. There is limited evidence which suggests that growth retardation observed in the fetus is reflected in the growing child as reductions in lung development [3&hyph;438]. This is especially relevant if that child continues to be exposed to ETS throughout childhood and into adulthood [Exs. 4&hyph;177, 4&hyph;297]. Prenatal exposure to ETS and exposure to ETS as a child may also increase an individual's cancer risk, perhaps by a factor of two (2) [Exs. 4&hyph;65, 4&hyph;164, 4&hyph;252].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Experimental research on the adverse reproductive effects associated with ETS exposure in animals is limited. However, one study [Ex. 4&hyph;6] demonstrated such effects. Sciatic nerve tissue taken from the offspring of ETS-exposed female mice revealed definite toxic effects on the neonatal tissue [Ex. 4&hyph;6]. Pregnant female mice (C57BL/KsJ) were exposed to low-tar cigarette smoke in a special smoking chamber. Cigarette smoke was blown into the chamber for 4 minutes, 5 times daily, except on weekends when this was done 3 times daily. At 18 days of gestation, blood samples were taken and carbon monoxide levels were measured. Ultrastructural abnormalities of fetal tissue revealed swollen mitochondria with distorted cristae, some indication of deformed mitochondria, darkened nuclei with condensations of nuclear material, lamellar bodies, granules and myelin bodies similar to those found in human toxicity studies. The blood samples from pregnant mice revealed a mean carbon monoxide saturation in the hemoglobin of 9% which is equivalent to that found in humans who actively smoke 10&hyph;20 cigarettes per day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6.

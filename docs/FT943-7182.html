			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / US to expand Cuban refugee camps: Thousands to be detained at Guantanamo naval base - Havana offers talks The US announced yesterday it would house tens of thousands of Cuban refugees indefinitely at its Guantanamo Bay naval base, where the refugee camps are to be expanded to cope with the continuing exodus. The Clinton administration, under growing pressure from the tide of refugees in spite of last week's policy switch to bar them from entering the US, was yesterday offered talks on the issue without preconditions by Cuba. Mr Roberto Robaina, Cuba's foreign minister, said on a visit to Chile that his government was willing to talk to Washington, but would not accept a dialogue 'in which one side presides and the other listens'. The US said it would welcome resumption of working-level talks on migration, but had no plans for broader high-level talks until Cuba demonstrated a commitment to political and economic reforms. Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said camps at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, which presently hold 23,000 refugees from both Cuba and Haiti, would be expanded tohouse up to 40,000 people by the end of next week. 'We are preparing to maintain that (detention) base indefinitely if necessary until such time as the people can be repatriated to Cuba,' Mr Perry said. US officials refused to say explicitly that they would hold refugees until the Castro regime fell, but said they would be detained until they could be repatriated to Cuba - which US law currently presently forbids. The US coastguard rescued 1,159 Cubans by mid-afternoon yesterday after 3,253 were picked up on Tuesday, another record for one day. Mr Perry said that of the 9,000 refugees picked up in recent weeks, 2,000 were already held at Guantanamo Bay and the other 7,000 were on their way there. The administration again warned Cubans not to attempt the dangerous crossing, with a stern reminder that those picked up at sea and taken to Guantanamo would never get into the US. 'Do not risk your lives,' said Ms Janet Reno, attorney-general. 'You will not be processed for admission to the US.' Ms Reno urged those wanting to leave to pursue legal emigration by taking advantage of the 28,000 visas reserved for them annually in Cuba. Mr Perry also said that, contrary to some reports, he had 'no evidence' of Cubans congregating on the country's border with the US base at Guantanamo. If Cuba allowed this to happen, the US 'would regard this as being an unfriendly act (and) take appropriate actions', he said. Although the administration hopes to see a drop in numbers of refugees over the next week as its policy change hits home, the State Department is negotiating to set up third-country safe havens in the region. Mr Peter Tarnoff, deputy secretary of state, confirmed that the US expects to conclude arrangements with the Turks and Caicos Islands - a British dependency - as well as Surinam and Panama. Mr Tarnoff rejected the idea of discussions with Cuba's leader-ship. Earlier yesterday, Mr Fernando Remirez de Estenoz Barciela, Cuba's ambassador to the United Nations, said his country was prepared to discuss the refugee problem, but only as part of broader negotiations.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, May 24, (AFP) -- A United Nations special  coordinator charged with the reconstruction of war-torn Sarajevo  put the prospective repair bill at $532 million Tuesday [24 May].    William Eagleton believes the money should cover a two-phase  programme to rebuild the drinking water and public transport  networks, restore electricity and gas supplies and rebuild  hospitals and schools.    The first phase will cover a six-month period, and foresees  using around half the total fund to deal with schemes classified  as urgent. Restoring drinking water to the Bosnian capital  alone is set to cost $57 million. In the transport sector, some  $23 million have been earmarked for repairing Sarajevo airport.    Phase two is scheduled to last for up to two years.    Eagleton unveiled the scheme at the opening of a Vienna  conference called by UN special envoy to ex-Yugoslavia Yasushi  Akashi. The basis of the rebuilding plan was agreed by the UN  Security Council in March in line with an accord stipulating the  withdrawal of Serbian heavy arms from the city's environs.    Akashi reminded conferees from 31 countries the UN  Protection  Force [UNPROFOR] had already created an interim coordination  body in early March to address the question of Sarajevo's  reconstruction.    He explained Eagleton's plan had been worked out following  close cooperation on the ground with Bosnian authorities.    The head of the Bosnian delegation in Vienna, Hasan  Muratovic, reminded those present of the extent of the war  damage in Bosnia- Herzegovina as a whole, but especially in  Sarajevo. He stressed the importance of reestablishing  transport links between Sarajevo and the Adriatic coast, part of  which Serb forces continue to block.    Muratovic appealed to the UN Security Council to give  unconditional guarantees of free passage between the capital and  the coast.    A second conference, in New York, is due to monitor the  scheme' progress later this year.</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Tour de Force: A restaurant owned by champion cyclist Greg LeMond and some  partners opened Tuesday in Edina, Minn. LeMond, a three-time winner of the Tour  de France, is a partner in the Tour de France restaurant being run by Scott Kee  and his wife, Lisa, who said Monday: "When Greg and (his wife) Kathy are in  Europe, they go to all the best restaurants."  </P> <P> LeMond lives in nearby Wayzata part of the year.  </P> <P> Purse Talk: Queen Elizabeth II does more with her purse than carry grooming  items, according to Raymond Fullager, a longtime royalty watcher. He told a  Charlotte, N.C., audience that the queen uses her purse to communicate 23  signals to her staff, such as moving it from her right arm to her left to  indicate that she is bored and needs to be rescued.  </P> <P> Baker Break: In the midst of his recent hopscotching around the world,  Secretary of State James Baker on Monday took his wife, Susan, to Maison  Blanche in Washington, D.C., for dinner to celebrate their 17th wedding  anniversary. He had his usual steak tartare; she had salmon. But duty calls. He  leaves today for Turkey and Belgium.  </P> <P> Color Them Happy: Though the company that makes Crayola crayons on Tuesday  retired six colors to the protests of some, everybody went home happy. Company  spokesman Brad Drexler said the demonstrators at the Easton, Pa., ceremony were  friendly. "Where else can you bring in protesters and give them cake and  crayons?" Another spokesman invited them to "come and see your favorite colors  whenever you need to."  </P></p>

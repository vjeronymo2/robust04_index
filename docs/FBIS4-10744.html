			<p>BFN     [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrived this  morning at our main airport. During a news conference, he said  he has not brought any concrete proposals or deals for the  Paraguayan Government or Foreign Ministry. Basically he wants  to learn details of the Mercosur [Common Market of the South],  and to talk about his country's economic reality.    Robaina arrived in the company of four ambassadors and  several journalists. He was met by Lincoln Alfieri, the Foreign  Ministry vice director of protocol; Senator Carlos Alberto  Gonzalez, president of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee;  Senator Victor Sanchez Villagra, president of the Revolutionary  Febrerista Party (PRF); and Ananias Maidana, secretary general  of the Paraguayan Communist Party.    Robaina indicated that he has not brought a list of deals,  that he is visiting "to allow the Paraguayan Foreign Ministry to  explain to me the interest that has made me tour the Mercosur  countries." [sentence as published]    He then commented on what he believes our Foreign Ministry  might find of interest -- in other words, to what extent Cuba is  implementing a foreign policy in which Latin America is a  priority, as attested by the fact that very shortly the  countries of the continent will hold an Iberoamerican summit  where opinions will be heard and where Cuba will be discussed.    The Cuban foreign minister stated that Cuba has a new image  and that its government wants this image to be made known to the  countries of the region within the framework of the diplomatic  offensive that is embodied in this visit to several countries,  including Argentina, Uruguay, and Peru.    He indicated that today Cuba is a ready and attractive  market  for foreign investment, and is an open market. He indicated  that Cuba can offer highly technical development, pharmaceutical  and medical industries, and proposals for sports, scientific,  educational, and cultural sectors.    Robaina maintains that he wants to polish Cuba's image and  project its new economic reality.    The foreign minister said that although there are no  diplomatic links with Paraguay, there have always been contacts  and dialogue in various American forums.    The Cuban minister will carry out a series of activities  that  include meetings with the top political leaders of the  traditional parties and with businessmen.</p>

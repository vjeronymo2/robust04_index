			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER FILE: THIS KNOW-IT-ALL PROGRAM OFFERS ORDER FROM CHAOS  </P> <P> The trouble with having so many choices among word processing, spreadsheet and  database programs is that you end up with a wide variety of incompatible  software.  </P> <P> It's bad enough if you work alone and only have to contend with your own  collection of text and data files created with different programs. But if you  work in offices where competing brands of software are in use, the result can  be chaos.  </P> <P> One solution is yet another program: Outside In, at $99, from Systems  Compatibility Corp. of Chicago. It runs on PC-compatible computers.  </P> <P> The sole purpose of Outside In is to act as a translator, letting you insert  text into word processing files directly from 33 different kinds of word  processing file formats, three Macintosh word processing programs, 12 PC  spreadsheet programs and eight PC database programs.  </P> <P> Word processing files are complicated. Not only must they store the words in  the document, they must also store the position of the page margins, tab stops,  special character attributes such as boldface, underlines and italics, type  styles and sizes, and often much more. Not surprisingly, most word processing  publishers do all that differently than their competitors. As a result, their  files are not compatible with each other.  </P> <P> Of course, spreadsheet and database files are totally different from text  files, so, unless they were designed by the manufacturer as part of an  integrated system of programs, such as in Microsoft Works or Ashton-Tate's  Framework, it is tough to bring such data into a text document.  </P> <P> When it transfers text from one word processing program to another, Outside In  preserves the tab settings and the character attributes of bold, underline and  italic type. And for spreadsheet and database files, it transfers the data in a  tabular structure, as it appears in a typical spreadsheet.  </P> <P> A common need in business reports is the inclusion of numbers stored in a  spreadsheet file. Without Outside In or integrated software that enables such  transfers, you would have to plan ahead and prepare special "print files" of  the portions of the spreadsheets you wished to incorporate in your document. It  is not hard to do, but you can't do it while you are in the middle of the  document where you want it to appear.  </P> <P> Outside In makes the task much easier and gives you some options you would not  otherwise have.  </P> <P> The program is memory-resident, requiring about 70 kilobytes of your computer's  operating memory. You must load it into memory before beginning to use your  word processing software.  </P> <P> Once loaded, you call Outside In from within the word processing document when  you reach the spot where you would like to insert material. Pressing Control  and I simultaneously does it.  </P> <P> Then, following a menu of choices across the bottom of your screen, you tell  Outside In which directory to search for the spreadsheet file. It will display  the file names for you. As you move the cursor highlight down the list of  names, you will see the top of each file in an adjacent window.  </P> <P> Outside In automatically recognizes what program created the file and displays  it just as it would look in the program. When the right one appears on the  screen, tab over to that window and scroll side to side or up and down through  the file to find the section you want. Then mark it with special keystrokes and  press Insert to have the marked section copied into your word processing  document. The original, of course, remains undisturbed.  </P> <P> A particularly nice feature of Outside In is its ability to select  non-contiguous sections of the spreadsheet for transfer. You could, for  instance, just copy the labels along the left column of the spreadsheet and the  summary data from a column farther to the right. You can even mark and copy a  patchwork of data from every other row and every other column or any variation  on that theme.  </P> <P> The material you move into your word processing document will take on the  margins and tab settings of that document, so be careful not to move in  material too wide to fit. And take care with tab settings if you want numbers  to line up.  </P> <P> Database material is treated as if stored in a table, like a spreadsheet. If  you have special entry or report forms for your data, they will not be  recognized. The non-contiguous selection process works the same as for  spreadsheets.  </P> <P> Databases recognized are dBASE, Data Ease, dBXL, Enable, FoxBase, Framework,  Works and SmartWare II.  </P> <P> When you choose text created by other word processing programs, the rules are a  little different. You must select contiguous text. If you want non-contiguous  text, you must go back to the source file as many times as necessary to  retrieve the separate segments. It's easy to keep going back for more, however,  because Outside In takes you back to the last place you were in the last file  you copied from each time you call it into use.  </P> <P> The list of word processing programs supported is printed on the back of the  package.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> OUTSIDE IN  </P> <P> A $99 file merging utility.  </P> <P> Features: Merge text and data into popular word processing documents from 33  word processors, 12 spreadsheets and eight databases. Copy non-contiguous  spreadsheet and database segments.  </P> <P> Requirements: IBM PC or compatible with at least 70 kilobytes of spare memory  beyond that required by your word processing software.  </P> <P> Publisher: Systems Compatibility Corp., 401 N.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondents Li Anding (2621 1344 1353) and Wu Ming </F> (0702 2494)]    [Text] Beijing, 9 Mar (XINHUA) -- Zhou Jue, spokesman for  the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress  [NPC], held the first news briefing at the Great Hall of the  People today during which time he briefed approximately 1,000  Chinese and foreign correspondents on the Second Session of the  Eighth NPC scheduled to open tomorrow.    Zhou Jue first welcomed the Chinese and foreign  correspondents to cover the session. He stated: Although the  current session is a regular meeting, it is very important. It  is being held during an important period when our country is  proceeding on all fronts in reforming its economic structure  with breakthroughs in key areas, and when it is accelerating the  pace of establishing a socialist market economic system.    In response to a question on how to quicken legislative work  and promote the operation of the market economic system, Zhou  Jue answered: As empowered by the Constitution, the NPC and its  Standing Committee have always made legislative work, especially  economic-related legislative work, a priority. Since the First  Session of the Eighth NPC, the NPC and its Standing Committee  have enacted 21 laws, of which 12 concern the establishment of a  socialist market economic system.    Zhou Jue added: During its eighth term, the NPC will fully  implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee;  will quicken the legislative process; and will endeavor to  complete the better part of the legal framework for the  socialist market economy under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and on the basis of the Constitution. Moreover,  it will basically improve the legal systems in other areas.  These are important and glorious tasks.    A correspondent asked: Legislative work is now being  accelerated, but some departments have failed to strictly  enforce the law. How will the NPC tighten supervision in this  regard?    Zhou Jue replied: Supervising law enforcement and government  work is an important duty entrusted to the NPC and its Standing  Committee by the Constitution. Over the past year, the eighth  NPC Standing Committee exercised close supervision over law  enforcement and government work, bearing in mind the state's  priority tasks and the issues of concern to the people. The NPC  Standing Committee sent 10 inspection teams to 15 provinces,  autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the  central government to assess work in comprehensively improving  public order and in punishing those who produced and sold  counterfeit and substandard commodities. The NPC's special  committees also sent 27 inspection teams to assess progress in  implementing 15 laws.    Zhou Jue stated: The NPC Standing Committee also heard  reports by relevant departments of the State Council and by the  Supreme People's Procuratorate [SPP] on banking, foreign trade,  education, the promotion of a clean and honest government, and  civil aviation work. While listening to work reports by the SPP  and relevant departments, the NPC Standing Committee affirmed  and supported the work done by various government departments  and the SPP in investigating major cases of importance and in  fighting corruption. After having heard a report on civil  aviation work, the NPC Standing Committee required departments  of the Civil Aviation Administration to earnestly strengthen  control, to improve the quality of their personnel and services,  and to improve civil aviation work as quickly as possible.    Zhou Jue added: In the future, the NPC and its Standing  Committee will continue to strengthen supervision over and  examination of law enforcement and government work so as to  exercise in a better manner the authority vested in them by the  Constitution.    A correspondent asked: What significance does the  promulgation of the "Law on the Protection of Investments by  Taiwan Compatriots" have on expanding cross-Strait economic  exchanges and trade?    Zhou Jue replied: The Sixth Meeting of the Eighth NPC  Standing Committee just examined and approved the "Law on the  Protection of Investments by Taiwan Compatriots." Cross-Strait  economic relations and trade have now become even closer, and  investments by Taiwanese businessmen on the mainland have  increased by a large margin. However, "three direct links" have  not been established yet. Under the circumstances, it is  necessary to formulate a law on the protection of investments by  Taiwan compatriots in order to provide adequate legal protection  for their investments on the mainland.    Zhou Jue stated: The main contents of the law on the  protection of investments by Taiwan compatriots include the  personal safety of Taiwan compatriots who have invested in the  mainland, and the protection of their investments and their  investment returns; the protection of Taiwan-invested  enterprises from being requisitioned; the need to adopt  compensational measures to protect their legitimate rights and  interests in case such requisitions are necessitated on account  of public interests according to law; and the  government-stipulated preferential treatment to which Taiwan  investors are entitled.    Zhou Jue stressed: The formulation of the law fully shows a  high degree of importance attached by us to Taiwan compatriots'  investment-related rights and interests. It also shows our  sincerity for developing cross-Strait economic contacts and  trade. He expressed the belief that the law will surely be  welcomed by the broad masses of Taiwan compatriots, and will  play a very important role in promoting cross-Strait economic  exchanges, trade, and cooperation.    A correspondent asked whether Taiwan has suggested that an  "agreement on the protection of investments" be signed, and does  this have anything to do with the "Law on the Protection of  Investments by Taiwan Compatriots."    Zhou Jue answered: Investments on the mainland by Taiwan  compatriots are a special kind of domestic investment.  Therefore, investments by Taiwanese compatriots can only be  protected by a domestic law. Taiwan is an inseparable part of  Chinese territory. Relations between the central government and  Taiwan are relations between a central government and a  locality. It is out of the question that the two sides may sign  any "agreement." Speaking about Hong Kong, Zhou Jue stated:  It is entirely because of the uncooperative attitude taken by  the British in sabotaging the talks that such talks between the  Chinese and British Governments regarding arrangements for  elections in Hong Kong in 1994/1995 have broken down. The  responsibility is entirely on the British. In accordance with  the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Chinese Government will  resume the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July  1997. Therefore, the three-tier political structure for Hong  Kong will be terminated with the end of British rule. Beginning  1 July 1997, the political framework of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region will be formed according to the decision  of the NPC and the relevant stipulations of the Basic Law.    Zhou Jue reiterated that Hong Kong will soon return to the  embrace of the motherland. No force whatsoever can stop this.  The Chinese Government and people have full confidence and  ability to resume the exercise of China's sovereignty over Hong  Kong on time; to implement the principle of "one country, two  systems"; and to carry out the Basic Law in order to realize a  smooth transition and to maintain long-term prosperity and  stability in Hong Kong.    Asked about whether Deng Xiaoping will attend tomorrow's  session, Zhou Jue said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping is the chief  architect of China's reform, opening up, and socialist  modernization drive; as well as the founder of the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, which is the  Marxism in contemporary China. He enjoys the love and esteem of  the Chinese people of all nationalities. You will know whether  he will attend the session when it opens tomorrow.</p>

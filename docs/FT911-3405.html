			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (5): Wealthy uncle becomes less indulgent - The economy, Kerin Hope says it will be hard to avoid a revenue shortfall WHEN A Greek is in dire financial straits, he remembers his barba stin Koroni - a wealthy uncle in a distant town. Twice in the past six years, the government has done much the same thing, seeking assistance from Brussels in the form of an emergency balance of payments loan. But the European Community, which granted Greece an Ecu2.2bn (Dollars 2.7bn) loan in February, is much less indulgent than it used to be. Stringent conditions were attached before the first tranche of Ecu1bn was paid. If Greece is to participate in the next phase of European monetary union, it must meet ambitious targets for reducing a chronically high inflation rate and public sector borrowing requirement in the next three years. Mr Efthymios Christodoulou, the economy minister, says: 'It's a basic choice. Either you follow the other 11 (EC members) and make an effort to submit to painful measures, or you stay on the periphery and see what happens.' To ensure the drachma can enter the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EMS by the end of 1993, inflation must come down to 9.5 per cent that year, from 22.8 per cent in 1990. This year's target is 17.5 per cent. Central administration borrowing, which totalled 13.1 per cent of GNP last year, is expected to shrink to 10.5 per cent this year and reach a minimal 1.5 per cent in 1993. The current account deficit must be limited to 3 per cent of GNP, compared with an average of over 4 per cent for the past two years. Other conditions call for the kind of reforms that Greek economic analysts have advocated for years but governments were always reluctant to apply because of the political cost. They include a 10 per cent cut in civil service staffing levels by 1993, a broadening of the tax base to include more farmers and an effective crackdown on tax evasion by restructuring revenue collection. Such strict conditionality is the result of the former socialist government's failure to keep the terms of an Ecu1.5bn Community loan in the mid-1980s. Structural reform was largely ignored but the government managed to cut the PSBR from 18 to 13 per cent of GDP and bring inflation down from 22 to 12 per cent before yielding to pressure for substantial wage increases. These, together with an extravagant campaign to find public sector jobs for socialist supporters in the run-up to the June 1989 election, quickly dissipated the gains from two years of tight austerity. Crucial economic decisions were postponed during almost a year of political stalemate before the conservatives' narrow election victory last spring. Now the government cannot afford any delay at all in implementing reforms if it wants to benefit from a recovery forecast for 1993. By that time, another election will be imminent. One encouraging sign has been union willingness to accept pay rises well below the inflation rate, following the abolition of automatic index-linking of wages at the end of 1990. This year public sector employees will receive nominal increases of 8 per cent. In the private sector, a landmark agreement was struck that seems to guarantee smooth labour relations for the next two years. The unions agreed to a basic 12 per cent increase for this year and 9 per cent in 1992, when inflation of 14 per cent is forecast. In fact, inflation could drop below 17 per cent this year. 'Underlying inflation, especially labour costs, is below the consumer price index, and this year's target was set when the outlook for oil prices was much gloomier,' said one analyst. Growth this year will be restricted to less than 1 per cent, but even that would be an improvement. Revised estimates for 1990 show negative growth of minus 0.4 per cent, largely as a result of a sharp drop in agricultural production after a disastrous drought. The main challenge for the government is to meet its budget targets for curbing public sector expenditure and increasing revenues. There has been little sign so far that the deficit-plagued public sector enterprises have reined in spending, though a new scheme requiring them to submit monthly accounts to the Economy Ministry should impose more discipline. About 35 per cent of budget revenues are already earmarked for serving the public debt. Even if the stabilisation programme meets all its targets, overall debt will still total more than 90 per cent of GDP in 1993. On the revenue side, the Finance Ministry is confident of maintaining last year's growth in tax income of more than 30 per cent. But tax evasion deprived the government of Dr350bn in revenues last year (Dollars 1.9bn), equivalent to about 3 per cent of GDP. Mr Yiannis Palaiocrassas, the finance minister, says: 'Much of the present evil in the tax system stems from apparently contradictory provisions and regulations that make it hard to determine when an enterprise is outside the law. But it's true there is a lot of corruption everywhere.' The black economy, estimated at 30-40 per cent of GDP, is under attack. Buoyed by the success of its raids on night clubs and restaurants, the ministry is setting up a 'tax commando unit' to frighten more proprietors into producing correct receipts on their newly installed cash registers. But the new income tax structure will not come into effect until 1993. In the meantime, tax returns will be systematically cross-checked this year for the first time. It is becoming increasingly clear that the government is unlikely to collect the expected income from its privatisation programme. The Industrial Reconstruction Organisation was expected to sell about 20 companies under its control this year. Due to lack of interest from buyers, it seems that all but half a dozen may have to be liquidated instead. Another important potential source of revenue, sales of land bonds redeemable as building plots, is lagging behind schedule. If, as seems likely, they are not introduced until late in the year, it will be hard to avoid a revenue shortfall.</p>

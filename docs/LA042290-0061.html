			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 4 HURT WHEN VEHICLES HIT CATTLE ON FREEWAY  </P> <P> Five cattle wandered onto the Golden State Freeway in Castaic late Friday night  and were struck and killed by two vehicles in collisions that injured four  people and tied up traffic for more than two hours, authorities said.  </P> <P> The accident occurred at 11:57 p.m. when a pickup traveling south struck at  least one of the animals and went over a guardrail and down a 200-foot  embankment, said Los Angeles County Fire Department Capt. Mike Carrick.  </P> <P> The driver of the truck, Derrick Ward, 33, of Pacifica, and a passenger, Joseph  Roque, 46, of San Francisco, were taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital  in Santa Clarita.  </P> <P> Roque suffered two broken legs along with head and chest injuries and was in  satisfactory condition Saturday. Ward was admitted for observation for a  possible bruised heart, a hospital spokesman said.  </P> <P> A search and rescue team from the Sheriff's Department pulled the two men from  the embankment, Carrick said.  </P> <P> Another car struck the cattle and two occupants were treated for minor  injuries, authorities said.  </P> <P> While the freeway was being cleared, traffic was backed up on the southbound  lanes for two to three miles, Carrick said. At one point, only one lane was  open while Caltrans and county animal control workers removed the five animal  carcasses. All lanes were reopened shortly after 2 a.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> "In that particular area there are a number of cattle that are fenced in the  range," Carrick said. "Apparently they escaped."  </P> <P> Carrick said injuries from the accident could have been much worse.  </P></p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Rate rumours revive JUST when you thought it was safe, the rumour mill starts grinding again. The UK markets were in turmoil yesterday, looking for an interest rate cut behind every statistic. Sterling's foray into the narrow band of the European exchange rate mechanism against the D-Mark, for the first time in several months, and its strength against the German currency were seen as prime opportunities for the authorities to make that long-anticipated move. However, economists were less enthusiastic, saying the government was unlikely to cut rates so far in advance of the general election, which is widely forecast for April 9. The pound was still sitting on the bottom of the ERM grid, and the risk was too great. The most likely date for a rate reduction was still the Budget on March 10. Econo-mists were more optimistic on the level of rate cuts, however. They suggested that there could be room for a  1/2 point cut at Budget time - boosting the chances of a Conservative victory in the general election - and a further   1/2 point reduction after the poll. The Bank of England kept the markets guessing about the immediate course of interest rates, with no action to stem the forecast Pounds 550m shortage in its early morning operations. However, when it operated, it did so with a flourish. Virtually all of the shortfall was eliminated by noon, with the purchase of Pounds 450m in band one bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. The final Pounds 100m was taken out early in the afternoon, also through band one bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Late assistance added an extra Pounds 70m, which 'opened the floodgates' for paper that had still been scarce at the time, said one dealer. The forecast shortage was comprised largely of treasury bills and maturing assistance. The Bank's generous actions pushed overnight rates as low as 7 per cent towards the end of the day, although they recovered to close at 10 9/16 - 7/16 per cent. The key three months interbank rate eased  1/16 of a point to 10 5/16 - 3/16 per cent, while one month money was also easier at 10 1/2 - 7/16 per cent. In Germany, call money was steady at 9.55/65 per cent, a fraction under the Bundesbank's 9.75 per cent Lombard rate. Traders were expecting the Bundesbank to keep liquidity tight. Funds in the US averaged 4 per cent, the presumed Federal Reserve target.</p>

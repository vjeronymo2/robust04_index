			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Lyudmila Aleksandrova and </F> Lyudmila Yermakova]    [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- More than one hundred leaders  of sport, youth, child, tourist, and women's organisations of  Russia took place in the third stage of the Social Concord  Agreement signing ceremony, which took place in the Kremlin  today.    Signatures were previously attached to the agreement by the  heads of Russia's executive and legislative branches of  government, leaders of political parties and public  organisations, and heads of industrial, business and financial  associations.    Speaking during the signing ceremony, Chairman of the State  Duma Ivan Rybkin expressed profound satisfaction with the  progress of the signing procedure. "There were so many  organisations wishing to sign the document," he noted, "that it  was impossible to have them all sign the agreement  simultaneously." Rybkin said this was "a very reassuring  symptom".    Comparing the present Russian society with a very sick  person, Rybkin said that this spring marked the beginning of  changes and new tendencies, which will undoubtedly improve the  national climate. He noted that substantial changes had  occurred in the country after the December 12, 1993, elections.  The Duma chairman believes that the Russian society today  realises that nobody has any right to lay claim to political  monopoly or, even more so, to undivided donimation. "If we want  civil peace in Russia, we are simply `doomed' to concord," he  noted.    Rybkin said that the formation of a bloc of political  forces,  capable of adopting serious and balanced decisions, was among  the results of the current social changes in the country. He  pin- pointed the president, the Federal Assembly and the Russian  Government as the key figures of the current political process.  "The most influential public forces," he stressed, "are  definitely striving for civil peace and concord."    Rybkin described the Social Concord Agreement as another  step  towards strengthening Russia's statehood. He believes the  document's special importance lies in the fact that its  signatories have pledged to act jointly in order to eliminate  the reasons leading to possible manifestations of mass  dissatisfaction. "The agreement," he stressed, "envisages  methods to eliminate conflicts among various political forces."    Noting that the Social Concord Agreement was not a panacea,  Rybkin said that it was in the interests of concord not to  dramatise the prevailing situation, but to use all the possible  ways to improve it.    "Today's signing of the agreement by youth, sport, women's  and charity organisations," head of the presidential  administration Sergey Filatov said, "shows that not only  politicised sections of our society are eager for concord."  Interviewed by ITAR-TASS, he stressed that today's signing  ceremony had confirmed that all the sections of the Russian  society "solidarise with those who are working for concord."  Filatov said that new groups of organisations were ready to sign  the agreement. The next stage of the signing ceremony will be  held in the Kremlin on May 19. Representatives of the artistic  and scientific intelligentsia want to sign the document. They  will be followed by an "industrial group" -- heads of large  enterprises and concerns. A similar initiative is being  displayed in the regions.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Wang warns that restated results may lead to loss WANG Laboratories, the US computer group, is to restate its financial results for the fiscal year that ended on June 30 to reflect additional restructuring charges resulting from its bankruptcy filing. The charges could be 'substantial and result in a sizeable loss for the prior fiscal year,' Wang said. In August, Wang filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code. Yesterday, in a letter to customers, Mr Richard Miller, chairman and chief executive, said that since the bankruptcy filing cash-flows had been satisfactory. The company's cash balances were steadily building and exceeding the company's forecast, he added. 'We are continuing to talk with lenders about financing, but our strong cash balances have enabled us so far to finance our needs internally,' Mr Miller said. Most of Wang's suppliers are extending credit to the company, he added. By the end of this month Wang will have reduced its workforce to about 11,000 from 13,000 , Mr Miller said. Most of the reductions to date have been in the US. Some job cuts have been delayed to comply with local employment regulations, Wang said. However, the company plans further reductions of about 3,000 worldwide. 'As our business stabilises after the shock of the Chapter 11 filing, we will complete our business plan which will become the basis for our plan of reorganisation,' Mr Miller said. 'It is still too early to know how long that process will take', he added.</p>

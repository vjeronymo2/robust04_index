			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg Feb 21 SAPA -- Malawi's President  Kamuzu Banda is reported to be critically ill, possibly from  complications following brain surgery in South Africa late last  year. Official government spokesmen could not be reached for  comment on a report carried in an independent newspaper in  Blantyre.    The NEW EXPRESS said a group of women scheduled to meet with  Dr. Banda had been prevented from seeing the president when they  arrived at the presidential Sanjika Palace last week. The  newspaper quoted members of the delegation as saying they had  been barred from meeting the president because he was in poor  health.    The National Consultative Council, which also sought a  meeting with the Malawi leader, also failed to secure an  appointment.    A Western diplomat reached for comment by telephone from  Johannesburg said rumours had been circulating the country about  Dr Banda's illness, but he added he could not confirm the news  report.    In an apparent bid to scotch the reports, Health and Foreign  Minister Heatherwick Ntaba last week told the official media the  president was in good health.    Dr Banda, believed to be in his 90s, underwent surgey to  remove excess fluid from his brain last October. After a break  during which the Presidential Council ran the country, he  resumed leadership, but he appointed new ministers to control  several ministries that had been in his hands for about three  decades.</p>

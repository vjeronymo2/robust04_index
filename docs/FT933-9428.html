			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Letter: Right step to convergence Sir, The six MIT economists who called for an early burial of the EMS (Personal View, July 29), bolstered their argument by a dramatic analogy to the policies of the 1930s. They equated 'hanging on to the D-Mark' in 1993 with 'hanging on to gold' in 1931. There are, however, many lessons in economic policy to be drawn from the Great Depression. Surely one of them is that competitive national devaluations are not an effective path to full employment. What Europe needs is not to bury the EMS, but to restructure it and restore its efficacy as a system that encourages policy convergence. The August 1 agreement to widen the bands could prove to be the first step. Georges de Menil, professor of economics, DELTA, 48 Bd Jourdan, 75014 Paris</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 16. If a Fund implements any amendment to any of its 12b&hyph;1 Plans (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements any amendment to a Shareholder Servicing Plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by Target Class shares subject to the plan, existing Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target Class shares unless the holders of the Purchase Class shares, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The Trustees of the Trust shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to Target Class shares as they existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class shares. If deemed advisable by the Trustees of the Trust to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material respects except that New Purchase Class shares will convert into New Target Class shares. New Target Class shares or New Purchase Class shares may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the Trustees of the Trust reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 5 above, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Target Class shares or New Purchase Class shares shall be borne solely by the Manager and the Distributor. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Target Class shares plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. The Shareholder Servicing Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

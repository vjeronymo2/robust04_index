			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: CGT for a shareholder A PRIVATE company was sold for cash in 1987. Capital gains tax was assessed on the two minority shareholders and settled immediately. But the Revenue has not settled with the majority shareholder, its argument being that it disputes the 1982 value of the shares. Having already agreed a value with the minority shareholders, is it entitled to treat the majority shareholder differently? Yes. An agreement between one taxpayer and his or her inspector is not binding in relation to someone else. It could be, for example, that the amount of tax at stake in the case of the minority shareholders was small enough for the inspector to decide that it was not worth spending time arguing over the precise value at March 31 1982. Some inspectors are more pragmatic than others. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet IR120; You and the Inland Revenue. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

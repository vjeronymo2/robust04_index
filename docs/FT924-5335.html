			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / CBI predicts fall in factory output MANUFACTURING output is expected to deteriorate sharply over the next four months in spite of a small improvement in total order books this month, the Confederation of British Industry reports today. The gloomy prospects in the CBI's latest monthly survey of manufacturing trends coincide with its latest forecasts for the whole economy. Those point to a slow recovery starting in the spring of next year. Growth for the year as a whole will average only 0.7 per cent. Output will accelerate to an average annual growth rate of 2.3 per cent in 1994 thanks to an improvement in UK competitiveness and a recovery in world markets, but this will not be strong enough to dent the rise in unemployment. The CBI forecasts that unemployment will rise to 3.1m by the end of next year. Inflation will gradually pick up, but with the recovery still modest, the underlying rate will remain within the chancellor's target of 1 per cent to 4 per cent by the end of 1994. House prices will stabilise over the next two years. The November monthly trends survey, which questioned 1,421 companies shortly before the Autumn Statement earlier this month, shows that total order books improved slightly this month compared with October. But only 8 per cent of companies considered their books to be above normal against 58 per cent which said they were below normal. The outlook for exports was not encouraging. In spite of the recent devaluation of sterling, making UK goods cheaper, export orders deteriorated this month. Half the companies surveyed described export order books as below normal against only 11 per cent that said they were above normal. That was the worst result, apart from January's, since 1983. The CBI says it is too early for the devaluation to have had its full impact on exports, and says the drop in orders also reflects weaker European economies. The CBI has made only small changes to its forecasts for the economy since August, even though monetary policy has eased considerably since then as a result of the UK's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism. The CBI says the stimulating impact of recent base-rate cuts has been offset by weaker-than-expected domestic demand. That leaves the forecasts broadly unchanged. The organisation expects base rates to drop to 6 per cent early next year, and to remain at that level until the second half of 1994.</p>

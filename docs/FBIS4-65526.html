			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with LA REPUBBLICA editor Eugenio Scalfari: </F> "Fascism Is Not the Danger"]    [Text] Italian democracy could be endangered, not by the  presence of neofascist ministers in Silvio Berlusconi's  right-wing government, but by the social tensions that its  policies could arouse, Mr Berlusconi's arch-opponent warned  yesterday. Eugenio Scalfari, the distinguished editor of the  left-wing daily LA REPUBBLICA, who had long spearheaded the  battle against the old political regime before the corruption  scandals sealed its fate, was contemplating its successor: a  government led by Mr Berlusconi in person and including the  federalist Northern League and the heirs of fascism.    Dr Scalfari, like many influential Italians, is not as  alarmed as people abroad about the presence of ministers from  the extreme right-wing National Alliance in the cabinet. On the  one hand, he said in an interview with THE INDEPENDENT, "they  have never repudiated their continuity with fascism, their  historical and cultural continuity, and particularly their  derivation from the Republic of Salo" -- the puppet government  headed by the dictator Benito Mussolini, which ran Nazi-occupied  northern Italy from 1943 to 1945 and fought the Italian  partians. That was "the worst kind of fascism," he said.    On the other hand, however, "I nust honestly say that they  are no longer fascists now, because fascism is unthinkable in  Italy today. They are exponents of the most right-wing right in  Italy, the Italian extreme right." At the same time there was a  "danger of contagion, in Germany and also in France. We are  only too aware that Italy has once already been the start of a  European contagion."    In Italy they "are not a danger to democracy," Dr Scalfari  said. He worried, however, about their future policies -- their  attitude to immigrants and the Catholic Church. He recalled  that Mussolini, in order to gain respectability, negotiated a  concordat with the church which made Italy subject to church  laws against, for instance, divorce and abortion, for many  years, in order to win its support for his regime.    Dr Scalfari was particularly worried about the government's  Reaganite laissez-faire economic ideas. The recent sackings of  many tens of thousands of workers had been tolerated because at  that point the government in charge was more or less  centre-left. "The sackings which will take place from this  moment on will be seen as a class conflict," he warned.    "This government which the stock exchange and and the  financial markets like so much...the stock exchange does not  realise that it can do practically nothing that it wants and  hopes for, because if it did, there would be riots in the  streets."    Such things, he said, "could put democracy at risk. I am not  afraid of fascism. But they could provoke social tensions so  bitter that they could create a situation of risk."    If social or regional egoism took the upper hand and social  solidarity disappeared, "then a danger of a dictatorship could  emerge."    Another fear was that the Northern League's federalism,  particularly its fiscal federalism, could effectively mean the  end of the Italian state. "A certain degree of federalism, with  certain limits, would be right," he said. But he was highly  sceptical of the League's proposals that taxes be collected by  local governments -- and mostly spent where they originated,  with only a very limited amount to be passed on to the national  government for defence, justice and a few other "services."    "It would be like the European Community -- we pay our taxes  to our national governments and they pay their contributions to  the Community. If that happened in Italy," he said flatly,  "there would not be a state any more."    He shared the fear of the italian president, Oscar Luigi  Scalfaro, that Italy might then break up. "I am afraid it could  happen."    The League's ideas, he went on, "would leave the southern  regions, the poorer ones, with no more (financial) means." If  this aim really was achieved, and if the rich regions kept their  money, "the south would turn into dynamite."    Dr Scalfari had been a fierce opponent of Silvio Berlusconi  long before the latter entered politics, and now has no  confidence whatever in the formula devised by the media mogul --  owner, among many other things, of half the nation's television  networks and a huge publishing empire -- to allay concern of a  conflict of interests while he is in office.    Mr Berlusconi's appointment of "three wise men" to study and  propose improvements to Italy's anticartel laws was irrelevant,  he said. For a start, "they were nominated by the person they  are supposed to supervise." One of them was a member of Mr  Berlusconi's team of lawyers.    For instance, he said, Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest company  pays  the state about 7 billion lire (2.9 million pounds) a year for  the use of its television frequencies. The state broadcasting  corporation RAI used to pay 170 billion lire a year. Recently,  because the RAI is in severe financial difficulties, it was  reduced to 40 billion. ``Faced with a situation like that, any  serious government would say `either we bring the RAI down to 7  billion or Fininvest up to 40 billion.'    ``Here there is a conflict of interest between Berlusconi  the  prime minister and Berlusconi the owner of Fininvest. If  Berlusconi doesn't do anything and leaves the situation as it  is, this is a conflict of interest. The three wise men don't  have the task of studying problems like this, they have to  improve the anticartel laws. But what do anticartel laws have  to do with a situation like this?''    In election broadcasts, Mr Berlusconi, when asked about his  lack of experience in politics, remarked dismissively that while  building up his vast empire he had faced far more difficult  tasks than those confronting any prime minister. Dr Scalfari  believes he has another thing coming.    "Running a government is nothing like running a company if  you are in a democratic state. You can run a company because  you are the boss, but then a company is not a democracy."    One might be able to govern well in a dictatorship, but in a  democracy one has an obligation to take into account many other  views and concerns.    The new government, he concluded, would be in some ways  better than the last government of the old political order, but  in other ways it would be worse. Better, because the old ones  were corrupt and had basically commandeered the state for their  own ends. Worse, because while the old leaders had parties with  long political traditions and ideals behind them, "these have  nothing -- just fascism, small northern businessmen and the  Fininvest company."</p>

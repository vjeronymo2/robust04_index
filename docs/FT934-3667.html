			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Moslem parliament attacks schools' record Moslems underperform in English and Welsh state schools, the self-styled Moslem Parliament of Great Britain said yesterday. Using the government's school performance tables for GCSE exams, published last month, it said Moslem children were in schools which 'have some of the worst results nationally and locally'. The group said the government's decision to reduce the weight given to ethnicity in the formula used to distribute grants to local education authorities, announced last week, would diminish investment for schools in Moslem areas. It alleged discrimination against Moslems in the school system, and said the figures had been hidden by 'the general myth that Asian children are doing well in education'.</p>

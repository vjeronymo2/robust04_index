			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'WAR LOBBY' URGES MILITARY SOLUTION;  </P> <P> HAWKS: ADVOCATES SEE A NECESSITY TO EITHER REMOVE HUSSEIN OR DESTROY IRAQ'S WAR  MACHINE.  </P> <P> As the Bush Administration backs away from talk of war with Iraq and emphasizes  a long-term campaign of economic sanctions and international isolation, a vocal  "war lobby" has emerged to press for more bellicose policies.  </P> <P> Bush and his top aides now argue, at least publicly, that the United States  should concentrate on using sanctions and diplomacy to prod Iraq into leaving  Kuwait. Once that has been accomplished, the United States would then need to  establish a new international security structure for long-term containment of  Saddam Hussein's military power, officials say.  </P> <P> But advocates of military action against Iraq argue that such a lengthy  commitment of U.S. power to the Persian Gulf cannot sustain public support at  home or political support in the Arab world. They point out that even the  mention of such a long-term security structure by Secretary of State James A.  Baker III last week was enough to set off a sharp negative reaction in Arab  capitals.  </P> <P> Also, they argue, Hussein represents such a threat that containment is not a  sufficient response. Instead, they say, the United States must either remove  Hussein or destroy Iraq's military machine -- steps that would almost certainly  involve the use of military power.  </P> <P> For now, the question remains "an intellectual debate," as one senior  Administration official sympathetic with the war lobby put it, because the  United States does not yet have the forces in place to launch an offensive  action against Iraq even if Bush decided he wanted to do so.  </P> <P> "Events have not reached a point where we're forced to choose," the official  said. But relatively soon, as heavier U.S. equipment begins to arrive in Saudi  Arabia, that picture will change, the official said -- and both the pro-war  argument and its advocates are likely to be heard with renewed strength.  </P> <P> The war lobby has both a domestic and a foreign component.  </P> <P> Domestically, Indiana Sen. Richard G. Lugar, the most influential Republican  member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has been the leading  congressional voice in favor of a military policy against Iraq.  </P> <P> Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Lugar argued that a policy relying solely on a  continued buildup of U.S. forces in the region is "probably insufficient"  because it would "leave us in the sands of Saudi Arabia indefinitely" watching  Hussein and his quest for nuclear weapons while waiting for hostilities to  break out.  </P> <P> American policy "has to lead to a sizable change in Iraq's military forces," he  said, "or I think we are in an untenable position." At least some military  officials are known to support Lugar's view, fearing that the public would not  support keeping U.S. forces in the Middle East for a long time.  </P> <P> "We ought not to rush in until we have our affairs in order," Lugar said,  adding that he did not believe sufficient troops for an attack would be in  place until October. But "there comes an optimum time," he said, when Iraq is  weakened by sanctions and U.S. forces are ready. Once that point is reached,  according to Lugar, "the aggression has to be repelled along with the force  that caused it."  </P> <P> Lugar, joined by several other influential members of Congress, had dinner with  Bush late in August at which he outlined his views to the President. "The  consensus of the group was that even if one agreed with my 'final mission'  statement, it should not be something we should be enunciating at this time,"  Lugar said.  </P> <P> Although Lugar is the only prominent member of Congress to publicly advocate a  military course, he has been joined by many prominent members of Washington's  policy- and opinion-making Establishment.  </P> <P> Such individuals, although they hold no formal government post, can often be  highly influential in shaping government policy, either because of longstanding  personal ties with current officials or because they help rally public support  for an option that an Administration might be reluctant to advocate in public.  </P> <P> The "war lobby" first publicly appeared in Washington late in August when a  spate of articles appeared on newspaper opinion pages and in influential  magazines insisting that Bush should take a stronger stand in favor of  eliminating Iraq's military potential. At about the same time, Lugar made his  first public statements about the need for military power to remove Hussein.  </P> <P> That campaign began at the same time that senior Administration officials  privately started telling reporters that Bush had decided, at least for now, to  leave aside the military option and concentrate on diplomacy and economic  sanctions as a way of ending the crisis.  </P> <P> Among those leading the war campaign, one group is made up of former government  officials and private-sector policy experts whose main concern has been to halt  the spread of nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> Individuals in a second, larger and more influential group share a long history  of support for Israel, which has long seen Iraq as a major threat that it  wishes to eliminate.  </P> <P> Among the more publicly prominent members of that group are columnist William  Safire, former Reagan Administration defense official Richard N. Perle and  Martin Peretz, editor of New Republic magazine, all of whom have publicly  campaigned for the Administration to adopt elimination of Hussein as its  ultimate policy option.  </P> <P> Although former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger has not explicitly  advocated war against Iraq, a mid-August article he wrote analyzing the threat  posed by Hussein was widely seen as giving support to the pro-war side.  </P> <P> The advocates of a war policy also have been bolstered by analysts from the  Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a think tank with close ties to the  American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the capital's leading pro-Israel  lobbying organization. Washington Institute experts on the region are  frequently quoted in television, radio and newspaper stories about the gulf  standoff, although their organization's pro-Israel orientation is seldom cited.  </P> <P> Overseas, in addition to officials from Israel, some from Egypt, Saudi Arabia  and the exiled government of Kuwait have quietly -- behind the scenes --  advocated U.S. military action. Some British officials have also voiced pro-war  views to reporters, usually anonymously, although the official British position  supports the Administration's more gradual approach.  </P> <P> Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has been the most public of the Middle Eastern  leaders in supporting a policy whose implementation could well lead to war.  </P> <P> Last Saturday, while Baker was in Cairo, Mubarak said that the gulf would be  unstable so long as Iraq possessed chemical weapons and continued to seek  nuclear arms. The Egyptian president suggested that only a military defeat of  Iraq could ensure peace.  </P> <P> Administration officials said that throughout the crisis, Middle Eastern  governments that favor war have tried to influence American opinion by serving  as sources for news reports suggesting that international sanctions against  Iraq are being violated. The stories, some of which Administration officials  insist have been exaggerated, could be designed to influence U.S. public  opinion by convincing people that the non-military options will be ineffective,  the officials say.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Maura Reynolds contributed to this story.  </P></p>

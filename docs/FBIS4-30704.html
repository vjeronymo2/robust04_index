			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "PNG's Drift Towards Disaster"] </F>   [Text] More and more, Papua New Guinea seems to be  drifting towards disaster.    The Wingti Government's expansionist budget strategy, based  on the expectation of an oil and mining boom, has left the  country with almost no foreign reserves.    The mini-Budget, brought down in March by the new Finance  Minister, Mr Masket Iangalio was supposed to start bringing the  Government's finances back under control by cutting the 1994  deficit from 7 per cent to just under 5 per cent of GDP. It  accepted the reality of depressed oil prices, cutting spending  and increasing taxes.    However, like last November's Budget, the mini-Budge was  based on absurdly optimistic estimates of the cost of the war in  Bougainville. Mr Iangalio's spending cuts have been almost  completely offset by additional, unplanned spending in the  province.    Economists are now expecting a budget deficit of between 5  and 6 per cent of GDP. It will be the third year in a row that  the deficit has exceeded 5 per cent of GDP.    Rising oil and mineral prices should come to PNG's aid over  the next few years. However, the PNG Government seems  determined to do all in its power to deter new mining investment.    The Minister for Mining and Petroleum, Mr John Kaputin, has  just announced a moratorium on new mining projects while he  sorts out a new mining policy.    This follows a series of damaging controversies in which the  Government has acquired a 15 per cent equity in the Porgera  mine, delayed the Lihir project by making contradictory  agreements on ownership, and changed the mining laws to deprive  CRA [expansion not known] of its Mt Kare tenement. At the same  time, BHP [Broken Hill Proprietary] has been the subject of a $4  billion suit over pollution from its Ok Tedi mine.    Mr Iangalio immediately contradicted Mr Kaputin's  announcement of the moratorium. However, that just seems to  confirm that the administration of PNG's mining policy will  continue to be erratically driven by short-term political  considerations.    And these problems overlay the long-standing structure  problems of the PNG economy: urban wages that are five to six  times higher than the country can afford; an oversized public  sector; an overvalued exchange rate; a largely-neglected  agricultural sector; and one of the lowest levels of spending on  infrastructure in the Third World.    Despite the country's extraordinary mineral wealth and  generous aid from Australia, the quality of life of the great  majority of Papua New Guineans who live in the countryside is  below that of comparable developing countries. Education  standards are very low, with adult literacy and school  participation rates below comparable developing countries.  Health services are also inadequate in the country areas.  Infant and maternal-mortality rates art very high. Life  expectancy is five years below the average for middle-income  countries.    The result has been the large-scale migration of people to  the towns and a breakdown in law and order.    In an effort to keep people on the land, the Government has  introduced price support schemes for the major export crops --  coffee, cocoa, palm oil, and copra. These schemes, which made  an important contribution to the blow-out of spending last year,  are highly inefficient because they encourage production of  crops when farmers should be cutting back. They also put the  Budget at considerable risk.    The question is what will it take to persuade PNG's leaders  to adopt more responsible economic policies.    One option is to leave the country to the tender mercies of  the IMF. However, there's no guarantee that PNG's leaders would  learn from the experience.    What is certain, however, is that Australia will always be  under international pressure to bail out PNG. It will be seen  by everyone as our special responsibility.    Perhaps Australia can do more to avert disaster now. Its aid  to PNG is largely determined by treaty, although it may still  have some leverage.    Australia is switching from general budget assistance to  program aid, which gives Canberra more say in the way the money  is spent. This year, just over a quarter of our aid to PNG will  be program aid. By 1996-97, the proportion of program aid will  be up to 52 per cent.    What happens after that is a matter for negotiation although  the broad agreement is that all aid will be program aid by about  the end of the decade. Australia can be more or less generous,  depending on the behaviour of the PNG Government.    While that may not seem to offer much leverage over Port  Moresby's notoriously myopic politicians, it gives Australian  ministers an opportunity to comment on the state of PNG economic  management and potentially influence the bureaucracy, public  opinion and the markets. It may strengthen the hand of those in  the PNG Cabinet, like Mr Iangalio, who are trying to achieve  reform.    We will get no thanks for the intervention, but we might  save  Papua New Guinea from a period of self-inflicted misery.</p>

Chien said it was South African, not Lesotho's, news media  which first reported that the southern African country has  decided to sever its diplomatic ties with the ROC.    "We have ordered our embassy in South Africa to check the  source of the report," Chien said.    The South African Broadcasting Corporation reported Thursday  that Lesotho has becided to cut its diplomatic ties with the ROC  because two ROC citizens had attempted to bribe two Lesotho  cabinet ministers.    "The report was unfounded," Chien noted.    "We extended financial aid to Lesotho last year when the  nation was hard hit by drought," Chien explained. "Such aid  should not be interpreted as bribe," he added.</p>

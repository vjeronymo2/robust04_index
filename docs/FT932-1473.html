			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Dollar, interest rate hopes lift bourses THE HIGHER dollar and interest rate hopes gave bourses a modicum of lift, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT retained the late gains it saw on Monday, the DAX index closing 8.16 higher at 1,698.08 in turnover up from DM6.3bn to DM7.2bn. The stronger dollar was advanced as one reason, the other being hopes of a key interest rate cut in nine days' time. As on Monday, share prices seemed to be prepared to act on the first theory, but not on the second. Banks were subdued, but the export-sensitive automotive industry stayed strong. BMW rose another DM6.50 to DM501.50, the tyremaker, Continental, rose DM8.50 to DM218 and the truckmaker and engineer, MAN, was DM8.80 better at DM283. Mr Harry Jaarsma of Dresdner in Frankfurt said that MAN had been depressed, that there had been news of improved tax treatment for the haulage industry, and that the latest figures for truck production and sales showed minor indications that the sector was improving. There were stories that another bank had recommended Conti. In chemicals, Hoechst outperformed with a gain of DM5.80 at DM253.80. The market thought that Rhone Poulenc's sale of 35 per cent in Roussel Uclaf would give Hoechst more effect control of the pharmaceuticals and bioscience company. PARIS posted its third consecutive gain ahead of today's end of the June account, the CAC 40 index closing 6.11 higher at 1,935.28. Turnover was active at FFr3.6bn, up from FFr2.65bn on Monday. The gains followed Monday's quarter-point interest rate cut by the Bank of France. Interest rate-sensitive stocks responded with Suez up FFr5.50 to FFr307.90 and Paribas FFr8.50 better at FFr404.50. Meanwhile, the rise in the dollar continued to lift cyclicals with Saint Gobain FFr8.70 higher at FFr491, and Peugeot FFr10 higher at FFr540 in advance of today's agm. MILAN made a positive start before investors were given pause by news that the government had called a confidence vote for later in the week. Trading quickly picked up again on the view that Prime Minister Carlo Azeglion Ciampi's two month old administration was not at risk. The strength of the lira, together with hopes of lower rates in Europe, provided some impetus as the Comit index rose 2.28 to 527.98. Fiat stayed at the centre of attention, on renewed speculation about an international accord or asset sale. The shares shed L99 to fix at L6,091 before picking up to L6,200 on the kerb as Mr Umberto Agnelli, the vice chairman, denied that negotiations were under way to sell Toro Assicurazioni, or La Rinascente. Ferruzzi continued under pressure, losing L49.40 or 8.2 per cent to L551.60. Montedison, seen by analysts as better placed to ride out the debt crisis, slipped L20 to fix at L874, before L855 after hours. ZURICH finished ahead, but off the day's highs, with prices supported by a lack of sellers, firmer bonds and the positive trend in other European bourses. The SMI index rose 5.6 to a second consecutive all-time high of 2,335.0. In a firmer chemicals sector, Sandoz bearers rose SFr35 to SFr3,350n on news that a US study had concluded that one of the group's schizophrenia drugs significantly cut the time that chronically ill patients needed to remain in hospital. AMSTERDAM overcame technical problems which halted trading for more than two hours and the CBS Tendency index rose 0.80 to 111.00 in response to the firmer dollar and the outlook for lower interest rates. Unilever added Fl 3.00 to Fl 204.50 in continued response to a series of upbeat investor presentations last week. MADRID talked of interest rate cuts as the general index rose 1.26 to 264.92. Utilities gained most from the speculation, Sevillana rising Pta11 to Pta501. STOCKHOLM was enlivened by strong foreign-led demand for Ericcson although the Affarsvarlden general index closed unchanged at 1,075.8. Ericcson B shares rose SKr10 to a record SKr332 as the group continued its series of new order announcements with news of a mobile network for Japan. ATHENS extended this month's gains, the general index rising 6.85 to 776.03.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- June 22                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                 Open      10.30     11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1198.81    1198.75   1199.40    1199.04 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1254.17    1253.32   1254.62    1254.71  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                13.00      14.00     15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1199.08    1198.48   1199.32    1198.69 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1254.61    1254.66   1255.16    1253.34  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jun 21    Jun 18    Jun 17    Jun 16    June 15  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1193.31   1186.72   1182.69   1181.17   1173.17 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1250.44   1242.58   1238.06   1236.97   1229.86  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1199.91; 200 - 1255.91 Low/day: 100 - 1197.86 200 - 1251.65.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTER STICKS TO LOW PROFILE IN SENATE TOUR  </P> <P> Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter renewed his low-profile tour of Senate  offices today, even ducking a reporter's question about exiled New York Yankee  owner George Steinbrenner.  </P> <P> While chatting briefly with journalists outside one senator's office, the New  Hampshire judge was asked, "Any kind words for George Steinbrenner?"  </P> <P> After laughing heartily, Souter resolutely skirted controversy yet again. "I  wouldn't touch anything that hot," he replied.  </P> <P> Most of the questions thrown at Souter focused on Monday's release by People  for the American Way, a liberal group that supports abortion rights, of a 1976  brief in which the New Hampshire attorney general's office referred to abortion  as "the killing of unborn children."  </P> <P> Souter, who was the state attorney general at the time, did not write the  brief. And the lawyer who did said today, "I don't recall him looking at the  language, talking to me about the argument or approving any line of argument."  </P> <P> Today, Souter declined to comment on the brief. Asked if he thought it would  play a role in his confirmation hearings, set to begin Sept. 13 before the  Senate Judiciary Committee, he answered, "You'll have to tell me."  </P> <P> Senators on both sides of the issue say Souter will be asked about abortion  during the hearings.  </P> <P> Souter paid courtesy visits today to four senators -- Republican Charles E.  Grassley of Iowa and Democrats Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, Timothy E. Wirth of  Colorado and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York.  </P></p>

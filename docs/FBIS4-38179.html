			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has proposed  incorporating Israel into NATO's Partnership for Peace in  Europe. The proposal, included in a report Peres presented to  the Knesset on his ministry's activities, says that the  expansion of Israel's diplomatic ties includes joining  organizations in which it has not held membership to date.    Peres raised the proposal in a conversation with U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Washington about a  month ago, when he proposed that Israel, Jordan, and Egypt join  the Partnership for Peace and form a dialogue with NATO on joint  security problems as a start toward future regional security  cooperation. [passage omitted]    A different Peres proposal was to include Israel in the CSCE  and to establish a dialogue on security in the Mediterranean  basin and on economic cooperation. The Foreign Ministry began  contacts with the CSCE secretariat in Vienna, and according to  the report presented to the Knesset, the Israeli initiative was  welcomed by the organization's secretary general.    Foreign Ministry sources said yesterday that the proposal  for  inclusion in European security organizations were brought up as  a basis for the new security regime Israel is proposing be set  up in the Middle East. Peres had proposed that it be based on  the existing European mechanisms initially, with a separate  regional framework being set up later.    According to the sources, the Foreign Ministry top echelons  now prefer to immediately set up a regional framework to be  called the "Middle East CSCE," which would have three "baskets":  security, economic cooperation, and human relations.    Peres proposed that the multilateral talks be used as the  basis for setting up the organization, which would serve as a  nucleus for a new system of relations between Middle East  countries in the era of peace.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Home Savings Plans Layoffs: Los Angeles-based Home Savings of America, the  nation's biggest thrift, said it will lay off some managers and support staff  as a belt-tightening measure. The move is in response to the federal bailout  plan, which requires thrifts to pay higher deposit insurance premiums.  Spokeswoman Mary Trigg would not disclose how many of the company's 12,000  workers would be cut. But she said no employees at Home Savings' 365 branches  and 106 mortgage lending offices would be affected.  </P></p>

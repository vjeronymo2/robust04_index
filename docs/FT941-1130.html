			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Nat Express rises to Pounds 9.3m - Airport contributes Pounds 2.2m with further acquisitions being considered National Express Group, the coach operator, reported a 36 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the 1993 year following a maiden contribution from East Midlands Airport, its new subsidiary. The Leicestershire airport, acquired for Pounds 27.1m last July, contributed Pounds 2.2m to pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.3m (Pounds 6.8m). Turnover rose from Pounds 120.6m to Pounds 139m. Increased revenue from airline passengers helped to offset falling demand among travellers for long-distance coach services, where turnover fell from Pounds 95.1m to Pounds 92m in the face of strong comp-etition from British Rail. Mr Ray McEnhill, chief executive, admitted the figures had been weakened by uncompetitive pricing which led to a 6.6 per cent decline passenger journeys. He claimed, however, that ticket sales were now picking up following fare cuts on cross-country routes, service improvements and a management shake-up. The shake-up was dominated by the departure of Mr Keith Taylor, who resigned as managing director of the coach business last November after only a year in the job. Mr McEnhill said the problems had largely been solved and the company had committed Pounds 3m to upgrade services, improve coach stations and introduce mechanised ticketing. Despite the difficulties, the express coach division benefited from contributions by new acquisitions, including Scottish Citylink and Eurolines, the Dutch coach operator, and improved results from both European Coach Travel and Airport Coach Services. The group also emphasised its determination to develop its airport business, and Mr McEnhill said it was hoping to buy other regional hubs. Earnings per share were 16.7p (16.8p). The group is proposing its first final dividend since its December 1992 flotation with a 5p payment, taking the total for the year to 7.5p. COMMENT A recent valuation of its East Midlands offshoot, which valued the site at Pounds 55.1m, whetted the group's appetite for the airport business. With its balance sheet thus strengthened, the group has looked at five other airports and is expected to end 1994 with another one in its portfolio. With coach services likely to recover following fare reductions and a full year contribution from airport operations, this year's profits should reach Pounds 11m. On a forward multiple of 14.5, that makes the shares an attractive long-term prospect.</p>

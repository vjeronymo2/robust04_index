			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Democrats win desert bill victory: Final scramble in US Congress US Democrats won one last victory in the closing hours of the congressional session on Saturday morning when they broke a Republican-led filibuster and passed a bill to protect 6m acres of southern Californian desert. The bill has become a pawn in Senator Dianne Feinstein's campaign to hold on to her Senate seat against a well-financed attack from Republican Congressman Michael Huffington, who has poured millions of dollars from his family oil fortune into the election. Senator Feinstein, who sponsored the desert protection bill, fought off the delaying tactics of Republican senators who had tried to deny her this campaign trophy. In the last hours before members went home to campaign for the November 8 mid-term elections, Congress also passed a budget for the Securities and Exchange Commission which has had to shut down many of its operations since the registration fee on which it depends for much of its income expired on September 30. It also agreed to a bill requiring telephone companies to install new software that will make it easier for government law enforcement agencies to eavesdrop on telephone and computer communications. But other measures sought by the administration and the Democratic leadership, such as a safe drinking water law and legislation to set up a museum of African American history in Washington, failed to make it through Congress before the session ended. They joined a graveyard filled with the corpses of President Bill Clinton's efforts to pass laws on healthcare, welfare, telecommunications, toxic waste, campaign finance and lobbying. Also, both chambers of Congress have had to agree to return at the end of next month for a rare post-election session to vote on legislation enacting the trade liberalisation measures achieved by the Uruguay Round of negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Californian desert bill was the 28th to face a Republican filibuster in this Congress session, an unprecedented use of delaying tactics which have generally been deployed only on big issues such as the 1960s civil rights legislation. Senators no longer have to talk non-stop to sustain a filibuster and can prevent a bill from coming to a vote unless its supporters can muster 60 of the Senate's 100 members to vote for an end to debate. Democratic leaders were hard at work arranging charter flights to get senators who had already left for campaign events back to Washington in time for Saturday's vote. Senator Joseph Lieberman, an orthodox Jew, moved into a hotel near the Capitol so he could take part in the vote without travelling by car on the sabbath. Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, who cast the decisive vote, had to make a last-minute dash to the Senate floor after the door of her garage jammed. If the Democrats were able to savour a final victory on the Californian desert bill, their prospects in the November 8 election, when all of the House and 35 of the Senate seats are in contention, still look bleak. Mr Clinton today begins a series of campaign trips with a visit to New Jersey, where Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg faces a strong Republican challenge, and flies tomorrow to Michigan to campaign for Congressman Bob Carr, who is trying to hold the seat vacated by retiring Democratic Senator Donald Riegle.</p>

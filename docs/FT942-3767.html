			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / US university moves to cut grade expectations: Students may fail again From the autumn of 1995, a student at Stanford University in California may actually fail a course for the first time in 24 years. The faculty senate at Stanford, consistently ranked one of the top five universities in the US, voted this month to reinstate the grade Fail, though it will be called, euphemistically, 'NP' (not pass). Failing marks were eliminated in the late 1960s in the belief that they discouraged students from academic experimentation. Stanford also voted that transcripts, which record course-by-course academic performance, should more accurately reflect students' academic history. Previously, students could drop a course up to the day before the final exam and repeat a course as many times as they wanted, without this being recorded on their transcripts. Stanford is the latest battleground in the war against 'grade inflation', the term coined to describe the noticeable rise in the average grades being given out at colleges and universities across the US over the last 30 years. The phenomenon, which has left some experts asking if degrees and transcripts are worth more than the paper they are printed on, has received widespread attention in academic circles and has even been mocked in the popular cartoon strip Doonesbury. Anyone who thought Doonesbury's creator Garry Trudeau was exaggerating need look no further than Stanford, where the mean grade is A minus and 93 per cent of the grades given out are As or Bs. 'Most of your prestigious universities have grade inflation,' says Mr Martin Anderson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford. 'When you get to the point where Stanford is, I call that hyperinflation or phoney grades.' Mr Anderson believes even the best universities have become 'diploma mills' churning out devalued degrees that tell little about actual academic achievement. He warns all prospective employers and graduate schools to look at more than transcripts and grade point averages in assessing potential. Mr Thurston Smith, Harvard's associate registrar, disagrees. He contends high admission standards at top schools such as his mean any graduate will be bright and have enormous potential. Even so, Mr Smith admits average grades at Harvard have been creeping up for the past 20 years. 'We've done some studies on it and we know it is happening here,' Mr Smith says. 'We don't have A-plus at Harvard so we may have to add it. We need a grade higher than A' It is a rare college that has escaped the phenomenon. Two of the best that have, according to Mr Anderson, are the science-oriented Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Chicago, where Mr John Boyer, dean of the college, says the average grade is B-minus. While Mr Smith says grade inflation affects all academic disciplines equally, Mr John Wakeman-Linn, a former economics professor now at the International Monetary Fund, found in a study that it is worse in the humanities and social sciences, where grading is more subjective. Mr Wakeman-Linn says the promise of higher grades in these subjects is luring students away from the so-called 'hard sciences' such as physics and maths. The roots of grade inflation are complex. Some experts believe it began as an attempt by professors in the late 1960s to keep more students in college and out of the Vietnam war. Others blame a general relaxing of conventional academic standards in the late 1960s and early 1970s or university budgeting that allocated money to departments based on their enrolments, encouraging professors to inflate their grades to attract more students and thus resources.</p>

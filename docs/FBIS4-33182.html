			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 1 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Brazilian diplomatic  sources informed EFE that the Cuban Government has sold Brazil a  package of more than 50 pharmaceutical products -- to be  delivered by the end of June -- for $30 million.    As part of an accord signed earlier this year, the agreement  has three purposes: 1) to amortize the Cuban debt with official  Brazilian entities, 2) to make a cash payment, and 3) to  purchase Brazilian products. According to sources, the first  delivery of medicines was completed in mid-May.    Via this transaction, Brazil hopes to receive approximately  $3 million to cover the debts, the greater part of which are  lines of credit from official banks for exporting products from  Brazil to Cuba. Brazilian imports from Cuba traditionally  include about 25 products, including soybeans, poultry, engines,  tires, and polyethylene.    Cuba began delaying paying its Brazilian debt in 1989 during  the process  process that brought about the disappearance of the Soviet  Union, which had been Cuba's leading trading partner and top  supplier of commodities and spare parts.    In 1933, Brazilian exports to Cuba reached $9 million and  imports from Cuba $21 million. To reactivate trade with Brazil,  Cuban officials have offered $300 million in products, mainly  medicines.</p>

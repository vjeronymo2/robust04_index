			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Terence White] </F>   [Text] Kabul, June 21 (AFP) -- Kabul peace talks between  rival faction leaders President Borhanoddin Rabbani and Prime  Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar have stalled for the second  successive day over the issue of ex-communists, official sources  said Tuesday [21 June].    Delegations from the two sides were supposed to meet early  Tuesday at the west Kabul headquarters of the Shiite Hezb-e  Wahdat faction, but a spokesman there told AFP Hekmatyar had  insisted on the attendance of representatives of his  ex-communist ally, Uzbek General 'Abdol Rashid Dostam.    "Rabbani's people refuse to sit down with any one from  Dostam," said the Wahdat official. Dostam was allied to Rabbani  until January this year, when he launched a failed coup attempt  against the president, supported by Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami  faction. Inconclusive fighting has raged in Kabul for nearly  six months since.    Jalil Shams, the deputy foreign minister and special peace  mediator, went Tuesday to Hekmatyars's Chahar Asiab headquarters  outside Kabul to try and persuade the prime minister to change  his stance over Dostam, the Wahdat official said. But, the  Wahdat official said that to ignore the Junbish party of Dostam  was "to kill any chance for a successful solution" to the  problems in Afghanistan. "Junbish is a real power in  Afghanistan and must be included in peace talks," he said.    The hoped-for Kabul talks between Rabbani and Hekmatyar are  described as a "preliminary" session to a larger conference  proposed by Sham's peace mission in the western provincial  capital Herat, to which all faction leaders -- except Dostam --  have been invited. The idea of the Herat conference is to set  up an interim government to run the country after the end of  June, when Hekmatyar and others expect Rabbani's presidency to  end. But Rabbani's followers steadfastly refuse to admit that  the president must resign at the end of June.    At the Intercontinental Hotel Tuesday Rabbani attended a  special conference of supporters who insisted the president only  hand over power to a national assembly or Loya Jirga.    "We demand the president remain in power until the convening  of a grand national assembly," declared Ahmad Hashmi, chief of  the Islamic Brotherhood and Reconciliation Front. "Only by this  way can we avoid a power vacuum," Hashmi said.    "Leaving the country without a president, even for one day,  is total madness," said another speaker.    Rabbani himself, in a half-hour speech, ignored the subject  of his resignation but declared his support for the Herat talks  on the condition that all factions were represented.    However, the president stressed that the faction leaders  should not monopolise power but allow the Afghan people to  decide their future -- presumably a call for an immediate  national assembly without a preliminary interim government as  proposed by the Herat peace commission.</p>

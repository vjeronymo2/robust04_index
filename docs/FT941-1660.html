			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Arts: At home with the Hollywood family - Cinema OSCARS '94 SISTER ACT 2 (PG) Bill Duke BEETHOVEN'S 2nd (U) Rod Daniel DAENS (15) Stijn Coninx A lightbulb thought occurred to me on Tuesday morning, as I consumed two pieces of toast and a cup of tea in the company of Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and Holly Hunter. Europe first watches the Oscars over breakfast and surely sees this spree in truer light than any other population on the planet. It is not about art or entertainment or even industry. It is about family: with implications for western civilisation that we shall come to shortly. The world's most high-visibility exercise in self-congratulation has all the innocence, though lit to blinding wattage, of a family gathered round the morning cornflakes tearing open Junior's school report, Daddy's letter of promotion and Mummy's pregnancy-test result. And this family - the Hollywoods At Home - has another common family trait: keep-out exclusiveness trying to turn itself into come-in warmth. I think I twigged to this during Master Spielberg's acceptance speech. Holding high his first ever statuette, the bearded wonderperson said something about 'the six million people who can't be watching this tonight.' For one nanosecond, it was as if Tinseltown really thought that the world - not just all its countries, but all its lost generations - might be curable by this annual riot of messianic togetherness: in which each year, around Resurrection-time on the Christian calendar, a whole lot of industry parents, children, uncles, aunts and cousins troop along, each bearing his or her emotive constituency of thanks and good causes. Can you leave your handkerchief untouched at so much good will? Master Hanks, winning for Philadelphia and possibly auditioning for Philadelphia 2, spoke up tearfully for Aids victims. Master Spielberg said it for the absent friends of Jewish history. Auntie Holly (Hunter) loquaciously represented the world's mutes, winning Best Actress for her wordless role in The Piano. And Grandpa Paul Newman was presented with a lifetime good causes award, gaining a special statuette for giving away Dollars 80 million dollars' revenue from salad dressing. Each member of the Hollywood clan had prepared his or her party-piece for the underprivileged, as the atmosphere got more Dickensian by the minute. In this orgy of PC and goodwill, there were only two persons slightly letting the side down. One was hostess Whoopi Goldberg, who aimed a mocking quip at her own multiple-threat ethnicity (black, Jewish . . . ) plus humanitarian record (see Sister Act 2 below). The other was Uncle Tommy Lee Jones, who in protesting that he was not really bald might have been seen as reinforcing prejudice against the trichologically challenged. Never mind: the evening's mixture of good causes and family feeling was clinched by Miss Anna Paquin (aged 11), winning Best Supporting Actress for The Piano. I confess I stopped right in mid-toast-chew for this one. The diminutive thespian behaved just like your own little Laura/Megan/Tracy going up to get her acting prize on Founder's Day. She advanced to the platform, opened her mouth and no words came out. She stood there making gasping motions like a distressed guppy; though on a second viewing it started to look a little rehearsed. Perhaps she had been deputed to deliver the 'mute' speech that Auntie Holly, who as Best Actress had to say something and say it good, could not get away with. It is sometimes said that the Oscars are decrepit, demode, de-everything else you can think of. But I suspect that they are on the up and up: that given time they will take over the western world's Ideal Family franchise, now that our own dear dynasty has been shot down by the tabloids and its own self-destruct instincts. With Hollywood fast becoming the only dependable royalty, Oscar night itself is becoming everything the Queen's Christmas speech used to be or to try to be. It gives us a glimpse of the world as a giant mutual-help family. Woe betide, if it has not already betid, anyone who brings cynicism to the gathering. And lest you think I am fully armed with irony, let me say that this viewer too shed a tear during Hanks's speech. There are times when the line between real goodness and showbiz goodness becomes terrifyingly blurred and we all get sucked in. The game of Hollywood Happy Families, incorporating Hollywood One-Worldism, does not stop at Oscar night. Sequelitis is a variation on the same phenomenon. Look, if you can bear to, at Sister Act 2 and Beethoven's 2nd. In the first Miss Goldberg is back in nun's habit, pouring good deeds over a closure-threatened San Francisco high school. Can she teach the brats to warble rock spirituals and win the all-state singing competition? That way the school will stay open, causing Mother Superior Maggie Smith to weep into her wimple and wicked school administrator James Coburn to gnash Dollars 5000 worth of Beverly Hills bridgework. The film (awful) is upstaged by the publicity hand-out, even in the area of good deeds. Miss Goldberg in her biog is cited for her 'tireless humanitarian efforts on behalf of children, the homeless, human rights, substance abuse and the battle against Aids.' Goodness. And on top of that she has twice been required to act out, in the Sister Act films, a very parable of Oscar night itself. For Las Vegas showgirl undergoing short-lease metamorphosis as convent sister, read the population of Tinseltown turning each Easter into a pan-global spiritual support system. That sequels themselves are manifestations of a deep-rooted family instinct  -they used, you recall, to be called 'Son Of Such-and-Such' - is basic psycho-cultural diagnosis. What is more reassuring to Movieland's patriarchs and matriarchs than the patter of tiny spin-offs around the house? Beethoven's 2nd gives us not just an addition to this movie family but a two-family storyline within itself. One is human: Charles Grodin and his two-up-two-down nuclear foursome living in springcleaned suburbia. The other is canine: Beethoven the St Bernard and his new love and their litter of ooh-aah pups. It is, be warned, frightful stuff. The press show audience was notably silent, some parts of it being in deep shock, others in deep sleep. This is a 'comedy' with no laughs and ladlefuls of sentimentality. But in Familyland you must take the syrupy-smooth with the exhilaratingly rough. When togetherness does not come out fighting it tends just to sit there, wearing a gooey smile in the sun and getting stickier and stickier. We all deserve one non-Hollywood experience this week, but we wish it had not been Daens. As Belgian films about the late-19th century Flemish trade union movement go, this one portentously dawdles. One 'Up the workers' set-piece follows another, with the street fights scored for inspirational music (out of Hoffa by FIST) being marginally preferable to the love-across-the-barricades romance between Marxist boy and Christian Democrat girl (out of Elvira Madigan by The Ballad Of Joe Hill). Stijn Coninx directs. Jan Declair steals a few scenes as the eponymous agitator-priest, resembling Gene Wilder ventriloquised by Ian Paisley.</p>

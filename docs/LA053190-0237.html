			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ISRAELI OFFICER ACCUSED OF TRAINING COLOMBIAN CIVILIANS  </P> <P> A court today charged a high-ranking reserve officer and a company he heads  with illegally providing military expertise and equipment to a group of  civilians in Colombia.  </P> <P> The defendant, Lt. Col. Yair Klein, is also wanted in Colombia for allegedly  helping to train fighters for cocaine cartels.  </P> <P> The case involving Klein and his Hod Hahanit, or "spearhead" company, has  prompted wide debate in Israel over the practice of retired military officers  working as mercenaries overseas.  </P> <P> Klein's company is defined in the charges as an organization that trains and  builds counterterrorist fighting squads.  </P> <P> The four-page charge sheet makes no mention of the Colombian charges that Klein  was involved in training assassination teams for the Medellin drug cartel.  Klein has vigorously denied such allegations.  </P></p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / International Company News: Alcatel may keep CEAC stake Alcatel Alsthom, the French industrial group, may remain a minority shareholder in CEAC, the French battery manufacturer, in spite of last week's announcement that Fiat of Italy intends to sell its majority stake in the company to Exide Corporation, the US batteries group. The Italian automotive and industrial group, which owns 62 per cent of CEAC, has decided to sell to Exide rather than step up competition against the US group, which is increasing its presence in Europe. But Alcatel, which owns almost all the remaining CEAC shares, said on Friday that it had not yet decided whether to sell its stake to the US company. Alcatel also controls extensive industrial battery operations worldwide through its Saft subsidiary. CEAC has a turnover of L1,191bn (Dollars 778m), mainly in the automotive battery business, and has been valued at Dollars 535m, Fiat said. Fiat, which took control of CEAC in 1991, said the sale should be finalised within the next few months, after approval by the relevant authorities. Earlier this year, Exide bought Big Batteries, the UK's largest private battery manufacturer, and launched a bid for control of Tudor, the Spanish battery maker. Fiat has also decided to buy a 17 per cent stake in the Canadian company Meridian Technologies, which is the world leader in the manufacture of pressed magnesium components. The Italian company's metal products subsidiary, Teksid, will acquire the stake and will be able to nominate two directors to the eight-strong board of the Canadian company, Fiat said.</p>

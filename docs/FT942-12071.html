			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Miti angered by US view of trade practices Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has responded angrily to a US report which criticised Japanese trade practices as ambiguous, lacking in objectivity and in many ways based on faulty or questionable analysis. 'We cannot understand clearly what is the standard of their judgment,' said Mr Sozaburo Okamatsu, the trade ministry's vice-minister for international affairs, in response to the 1994 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers published at the end of March. Because Super 301 was revived by the US, the 1994 report, unlike previous NTE reports, becomes part of the process of invoking the Super 301 trade bill which allows the US to unilaterally retaliate against countries it judges to be unfair trading partners. In a formal written response presented to the US embassy in Tokyo yesterday, the trade ministry notes that Super 301 goes 'against the letter and spirit of the Gatt and the Uruguay Round accords.' Having said that, many assertions made in the NTE report lack theoretical or factual basis, Miti says. For example, the report's assertion that Japan's large and persistent (current account) surpluses indicate an imbalanced approach to trade in Japan and have depressed production and employment in many of Japan's trading partners cannot be supported by the facts, the trade ministry points out. Miti said that Japan's surpluses are not proof of closed markets, but instead indicate an imbalance of savings and investment. Countries such as Hong Kong and Singapore, which clearly have low trade barriers, also have trade surpluses, it noted. In addition, Japan's low average tariff rate on manufactured and mining products - at 2.2 per cent, compared with 5.4 per cent for the US and 5.7 per cent for the EU - and its low number of items subject to import quotas, belie the assertion in the USTR's report that Japan is significantly less open to imports and foreign direct investment than other countries, Miti said. To cut Japan's surpluses it is necessary to raise investment in Japan and change the balance of savings and investment, Miti noted.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese trade  delegation left here today for Morocco to sign the overall  agreements of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    Gu Yongjiang, Chinese vice-minister of foreign trade and  economic cooperation (MOFTEC), will attend the Marrakech Trade  Summit scheduled to run from next Tuesday to Friday, when 118  ministers of countries participating in the Uruguay Round will  sign the final act embodying the results of the multilateral  trade negotiations and the agreement establishing the World  Trade Organization.    Long Yongtu, assistant MOFTEC minister and secretary-general  of the Chinese delegation to Marrakech, said before his  departure that the coming summit is a major event in the current  international trade community.    He said that China, although not yet having GATT membership  restored, participated in the Uruguay Round of negotiations  since September 1986 and is qualified to sign the package of  documents concluded by the Uruguay Round of talks.    Long said that after the Uruguay Round documents go into  effect, a new World Trade Organization (WTO) will be  established, replacing the existing GATT as the leading world  trade body.    Therefore, he said, China insists that its eight-year  negotiations with GATT members for re-entry into the  international trade body be concluded before the wto comes into  being so that the country can be one of its original members.    "China's signing of the documents means it has met  fundamental requirements to become a founding member of the new  world trade organization," the assistant minister said.    He added that China, as a big country and a major world  trade  partner, deserves WTO membership.    Long said that the Chinese Government will continue to make  joint efforts with other GATT members for an early restoration  of China's GATT membership on the principle of balance between  rights and obligations.</p>

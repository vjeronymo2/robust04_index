			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Yevgeniy Primakov, director of the  counterintelligence service of the Russian Federation, is on a  short visit to Bratislava. [passage omitted]    President Michal Kovac received Yevgeniy Primakov in the  afternoon. He briefed the Russian guest about the fact that the  Slovak intelligence service has concluded an agreement with the  counterintelligence service of the Russian Federation. The  agreement concerns above all the exchange of employees in charge  of contacts between the two services. The Slovak intelligence  service keeps similar contacts with other intelligence services.    Presidential spokesman Anton Bodis told us that during talks  the view was voiced that our cooperation will not be used  against third countries.    After the talks we asked Yevgeniy Primakov to comment on the  latest information concerning the fact that Russian spying  activities had been uncovered in the United States.    [Begin Primakov recording in Russian, fading to Slovak  translation] On this subject I can only say that I heard this  information only after my arrival here. I have no knowledge of  those names, I have never heard them, so it is obvious that I  cannot tell you anything before my return to Moscow. [end  recording]</p>

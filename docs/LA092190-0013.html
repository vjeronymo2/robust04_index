			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EXPOS WIN TWO, COMPLETE SWEEP OF METS  </P> <P> A doubleheader at home? What better time to close in on a division leader.  </P> <P> That's what the New York Mets thought of their doubleheader Thursday against  the Montreal Expos, but now they find themselves farther behind the first-place  Pittsburgh Pirates than they have been in more than a week, with the streaking  Expos on their heels in the National League East race.  </P> <P> Expo rookie Chris Nabholz pitched a one-hitter for his first major league  shutout and Montreal beat New York, 2-0, to complete the doubleheader sweep at  Shea Stadium and drop the Mets 2 1/2 games behind the Pirates.  </P> <P> Montreal scored both its runs in the fourth inning off Sid Fernandez, on Tim  Wallach's broken-bat RBI single and Marquis Grissom's sacrifice fly. Fernandez  gave up only two hits in six innings, losing for the sixth time in his last  seven decisions.  </P> <P> In the opener, the Expos rallied for four runs in the eighth inning against  Frank Viola and reliever John Franco, winning, 6-4.  </P> <P> Dave Magadan, Darryl Strawberry, Kevin McReynolds and Gregg Jefferies, the  Mets' No. 3 through 6 hitters in the order, had two hits in 20 at-bats in the  doubleheader.  </P> <P> The Expos, who swept the three-game series at New York, have won six  consecutive games and trail the Pirates by 4 1/2.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh beat the Chicago Cubs, 11-2. The Pirates' magic number s 11.  </P> <P> "We've come back before, but now time is just running out," Magadan said of the  Mets. "Now we have to win on the road."  </P> <P> New York plays 10 of its last 13 games on the road at Chicago, Montreal and  Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Nabholz (6-0) did not allow a hit for 5 2/3 innings until Tommy Herr singled to  right field. The left-hander walked three and struck out six.  </P> <P> Said Expo Manager Buck Rodgers: "We have to pass the Mets before thinking about  first place. I just hope the schedule doesn't run out on us."  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 11, Chicago 2 -- Andy Van Slyke hit two home runs and drove in three  runs and Barry Bonds hit a two-run homer, leading the Pirates at Chicago.  </P> <P> Van Slyke homered in the first inning off loser Randy Kramer and hit a two-run  homer, his 17th, off Mitch Williams in a three-run sixth. Van Slyke walked in  his other three appearances.  </P> <P> Bonds hit his 32nd homer in the eighth inning after Van Slyke had walked. It  was the most home runs by a Pirate since Willie Stargell hit 32 in 1979.  </P> <P> Winner Bob Walk allowed only one hit before the Cubs scored a run in the fifth  inning, and needed relief in the sixth after Ryne Sandberg hit his National  League-leading 37th home run.  </P> <P> San Francisco 5, Atlanta 3 -- Pinch-hitter Mike Laga hit a tie-breaking two-run  homer in the sixth inning at Atlanta to give Eric Gunderson his first major  league victory.  </P> <P> The victory was only the second in seven games for San Francisco, which began  play in third place in the National League East, 7 1/2 games behind  division-leading Cincinnati.  </P> <P> Laga, batting for Gunderson, hit his second home run of the season off John  Smoltz after a one-out single by Jose Uribe.  </P> <P> St. Louis 5, Philadelphia 4 -- Rookie Ray Lankford's pinch single capped a  three-run ninth inning that gave the Cardinals a victory at St. Louis.  </P> <P> St. Louis, which snapped a four-game losing streak, was held to two runs and  four hits over eight innings by Terry Mulholland, but Todd Zeile started the  ninth with a double, bringing on reliever Roger McDowell.  </P> <P> Zeile held second on Rex Hudler's infield hit and took third when Pedro  Guerrero hit into a double play. Felix Jose's infield hit made it 4-3 and,  after Jose stole second, Denny Walling, pinch hitting for winning pitcher Mike  Perez, singled off third baseman Charlie Hayes' glove to tie the game.  </P> <P> Ozzie Smith's double sent pinch-runner Dave Collins to third before Lankford's  single gave Perez his first major league victory.  </P></p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Civil servants to ballot on strikes over pay reforms MIDDLE-RANKING civil servants are to ballot on strike action in protest over the government's attempt to reform Civil Service pay. Delegates at the annual conference of the 110,000-strong NUCPS Civil Service union yesterday voted against an offer worth 4.5 per cent on the pay bill. The offer is in line with the government's attempt to strengthen the link between pay and performance and to decentralise negotiations for all 550,000 civil servants. The proposals mean they would lose their traditional right to annual earnings increments. The decision to renegotiate the existing pay agreements was announced last July by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. It followed publication of the Citizen's Charter stressing the role of performance-related pay as an incentive for improving the quality of public services. So far the Treasury has calculated what it says are final offers for just two groups affecting 300,000 civil servants with settlement dates of April 1. The CPSA union, which represents clerical grades, is recommending that its members accept a basic offer of 4.25 per cent with an extra 0.5 per cent in performance-related pay. The NUCPS is opposed to its similar offer because it says that the 4.1 per cent basic increase, with 0.4 per cent in performance-related pay, breaches the spirit of the existing formula that ties settlements to private-sector deals. Under the formula, this year's offer should be at least 4.5 per cent but civil servants who are not eligible for performance-related pay are being offered only 4.1 per cent. The NUCPS also opposes the break-up of national pay bargaining and the principle of performance-related pay, which it says is divisive and open to abuse. Three other groups - senior managers, scientists and professionals and Inland Revenue staff - have settlement dates of August 1 and are still in negotiations. The result of the NUCPS ballot will not be announced until June 12, two weeks after the current agreement lapses on May 29. The government may simply impose the offer without waiting for the result and might then also abandon the link with private-sector pay, under which pay settlements must fall within the middle half of private-sector deals concluded in the previous year. Local government white-collar workers yesterday rejected a 3.6 per cent pay offer. Further talks covering the 740,000 group are planned for May 27.</p>

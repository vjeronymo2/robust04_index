			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: British Gas The market was largely unimpressed by yesterday's feisty reminder from Sir James McKinnon that he is not about to let British Gas alone. But the regulator was also threatening that the fundamental differences between the two sides may yet develop from mere niggling into a full-blown monopoly reference. Even by its previous standards, Ofgas's challenge on domestic gas prices was an aggressive and not fully merited swipe. Gas can fairly argue that when it froze prices ahead of the election, it was working on a much more cloudy inflation outlook. But that does not help its case while the two sides are not talking. The threat is not that a price cut would be devastating for Gas's profits. More worrying for investors is that the burden of regulatory changes is starting to slow the company down. This could expose a strategic problem. Gas has been trying to counteract domestic pressure by building an exploration division and a global supply company. These businesses are supposed to account for 60 per cent of profits by the end of the decade, but already the weak oil price augurs badly. If that approach looks like failing, the long-term progression of Gas's dividend will be in doubt. The market might find that prospect rather more unnerving than yesterday's sabre-rattling.</p>

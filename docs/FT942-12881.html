			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Trading in the London futures market took its cues from the US where the release of some confidence data enlivened an otherwise lacklustre day, writes Peter John. A strong performance by the US equity and bond markets on Monday night sparked off an early rise in London which took the FT-SE futures contract for June to a high of 3,146. Then the contract traded within an oppressive 19-point range for the rest of the morning and early afternoon attracting minimal interest. When dealing began in New York, the release of US consumer confidence figures reactivated concerns that the Federal Reserve might tighten interest rates and acted like a bucket of cold water on Treasury, bund and gilt prices. As a result, the Liffe contract slipped back sharply to trade at a discount of about 8 points to cash and some 12 points below the current estimated fair value. However, the nervousness proved overdone and in the last half hour of trading June re-established itself, and closed 9 above cash at at 3,134 with turnover very thin at just over 10,000 lots. Traded options volume of 27,793 lots was up on Monday's desultory level. Guinness saw 2,678 lots changing hands but the volume principally represented rolling over of contracts from May to August.</p>

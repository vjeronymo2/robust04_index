			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Squabble puts back Japan's spending plan IMPLEMENTATION of Japan's supplementary budget - seen as critical to the government's emergency programme to prevent the economy falling into recession - was further delayed yesterday by the political power struggle set off by the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin bribery scandal. The start of debate over the supplementary budget, which is crucial to implementing a Y10,700bn (Pounds 54bn) emergency economic package announced in August, will be delayed until next week at the earliest, according to members of the Japanese parliament. The delay is due to the ruling Liberal Democratic party's (LDP) failure to agree with the main opposition parties over a timetable for the supplementary budget to be discussed by the Japanese parliament's powerful budget committee. The Diet convened on October 30 for a 40-day extra-ordinary session to pass the budget, which is needed to implement large-scale public works spending. Ministry of Finance officials warned that prolonged delay could seriously undermine confidence. But they said there were no plans for interim measures to help support stock market and business confidence. The opposition parties, led by the Social Democratic party, are demanding that 10 LDP leaders give sworn testimony to the Diet over their alleged involvement in the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin affair. The opposition parties will be keen not to risk being blamed for holding up passage of the budget. But they are insisting LDP leaders should give sworn testimony to the Diet. The LDP has proposed that unsworn testimony should be given to the parliament's ethics committee. The likelihood that the Diet will hear evidence over the scandal means it will continue to create political uncertainty at a time when the Japanese economy is on the verge of recession. The scandal has sparked a power struggle at the top of the LDP after a public outcry forced the resignation of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the former head of the largest LDP faction. Mr Kanemaru admitted he accepted a Y500m illegal donation from the company. However, in the past week pressure has been mounting on other LDP leaders, particularly Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister and titular head of the largest LDP faction to clarify his role in the affair. Last week Tokyo prosecutors pursuing a breach of trust case against former Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin executives read depositions in court which alleged several other LDP leaders were involved in dealings with the company which was linked to organised crime syndicates and right-wing nationalist groups. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister and LDP president, yesterday played down suggestions that the party might take libel action against the prosecutors for reading the controversial depositions given by politicians of the far right.</p>

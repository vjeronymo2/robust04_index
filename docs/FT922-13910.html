			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: NationsBank provisions 'high' NATIONSBANK said it expected its loan loss provision for all of 1992 to be be in the range of Dollars 750m to Dollars 900m, AP-DJ reports from Atlanta. Mr Kenneth Lewis, president of NationsBank, told an Atlanta business group that the loan loss provision would be 'heavier in the first half of the year and trending down in the later quarters'. He added that the company expected that its loan loss provision and charge-offs would decline materially in 1992, compared with the year ago, but will 'remain abnormally high'. Analysts project NationsBank will earn Dollars 4 to Dollars 4.10 per share in 1992, up from Dollars 0.76 in 1991 when the North Carolina-based company had huge extraordinary expenses from acquiring C&amp;S/Sovran as well as enduring weakness in loan quality. Mr Lewis said NationsBank had already reduced 3,000 job positions out of the total 9,000 it plans to eliminate over the next two years. He said NationsBank is negotiating to sell two portfolios of real estate with a combined total of Dollars 850m, and that the company should know 'this quarter' whether those deals will happen. Mr Lewis declined to give an outlook for the first quarter, but indicated that there would be 'further significant (securities) gains' in the quarter as the company continues to restructure the average maturity of its portfolio downward. The company expected a decline in non-performing asset levels in 1992, but the economy and asset-disposition efforts would determine the degree of the decline.</p>

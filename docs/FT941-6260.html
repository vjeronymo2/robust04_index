			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Spanish cement group earnings up by 58% Valenciana de Cementos, the leading Spanish cement producer which is controlled by Cemex of Mexico, defied an overall decline in the cement market last year and increased group after-tax profits by 58 per cent to Pta5.61bn (Dollars 40.1m). Part of the increase came from the inclusion of the last three months' figures from Sanson, another cement producer brought into Valenciana last year. Both companies, formerly controlled by the Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto) banking group, were bought by Cemex in 1992. Net operating profit for the group rose more than fourfold to Pta7.69bn, mainly due to improved production processes and cost-cutting, as well as price increases. The group's sales, excluding those of Sanson, were 5.7 per cent down at Pta48.07bn but the decline was less than half the estimated overall decline in cement sales during the year. Including the Sanson figures, turnover was Pta50.94bn, which was 4.3 per cent more than for 1992. Valenciana, which represents about a third of Cemex's business worldwide, said it expected a slight recovery in the market this year.</p>

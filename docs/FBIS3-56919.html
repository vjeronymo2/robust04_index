			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Members of the Lithuanian Seimas [parliament]  Committee for Citizens' Rights and Ethnic Minorities have issued  a statement concerning last week's letter from 72 Polish Sejm  deputies addressed to the Polish president, Sejm speaker, prime  minister, and foreign minister. The letter details the  conditions which allow the signing of the Lithuanian-Polish  interstate treaty.    "We are greatly surprised by the authors' proposal for the  Polish Government to resolve such issues which are the  prerogative of our domestic policy, and which we have solved  since the very restoration of our independence," reads the  statement by Lithuanian lawmakers. "This demonstrates that the  authors of the letter are not well informed about the current  situation of ethnic minorities, including the Polish one,  residing in Lithuania. Experts from international organizations  have concluded that the rights of ethnic minorities and their  possibilities to preserve their ethnic identity meet the  requirements of international conventions."    "We express hope that the statement by a group of Polish  Sejm  members will not become an obstacle to signing a  Lithuania-Polish interstate agreement and declaration in the  near future," concludes the statement.</p>

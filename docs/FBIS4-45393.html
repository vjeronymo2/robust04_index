The EU commissioner in charge of justice and internal  affairs, Padraig Flynn, said "drug addiction and trafficking  present a major threat for Europe's citizens." He said the  problems called for a "coordinated reaction by the Union and its  member states."    The action plan presented by Flynn suggests better use could  be made of the Netherlands-based Europol to achieve police,  customs and legal cooperation to fight drug trafficking.    The plan also suggests greater cooperation with third  countries either in the framework of existing international  agreements or by negotiating specific agreements.</p>

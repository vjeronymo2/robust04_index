			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KING'S VILLAGES PARTNER DISCLAIMS RACIAL BIASES  </P> <P> Your article (Times, Feb. 1) on the discussion at the Pasadena Board of  Directors' meeting concerning King's Villages was fairly covered by reporter  Vicki Torres.  </P> <P> I only wish to correct the possible impression that we are favoring Latino  families for occupancy. The balance of my remarks not printed in the article  stated that "when vacancies occur we take qualified applicants meeting the HUD  regulations right off the waiting list, and this has resulted in maybe 40  Latino families gaining occupancy."  </P> <P> No attempt has been made to give preference to any particular racial group.  </P> <P> ROBERT HIRSCH  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P> <P> Partner, King's Villages  </P></p>

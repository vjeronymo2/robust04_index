			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / 'Stop Czech arms sales to Syria' - Shamir MR Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, yesterday called on Czechoslovakia to halt arms sales to Syria and to other Middle Eastern countries hostile to Israel. Prague says it cannot afford to stop selling arms until substitute industries are in place. Mr Marian Calfa, the Czechoslovak prime minister, caused a stir in Israel over the weekend when he admitted during a visit to Jerusalem that Prague was negotiating the sale of Czech-built Soviet tanks to Syria, Israel's chief military foe. In Prague, the newspaper Rude Pravo reported that the government was considering selling about 100 new T-72 tanks to Syria and some old T-55 tanks to Iran. Last Friday, the US urged Czechoslovakia, a prime supplier of heavy arms to the Middle East while it was under communist rule, not to proceed with the sales. Mr Calfa said his government would rather not sell arms, but could not afford to give them up, because the Slovakia region relied heavily on the industry for employment. About 80,000 people work in arms production in the region, where unemployment is already rising and the government fears separatist unrest. Mr Calfa, who yesterday addressed a meeting of the World Jewish Congress, turned the argument into an appeal for aid to help convert arms production into civilian production. 'Czechoslovakia is not interested in producing tanks. But we don't want to break the economy of a region. Conversion requires enormous capital. We need assistance. I'm here to ask Israel and the World Jewish Congress for help,' he said. In talks yesterday, Mr Calfa told Mr Shamir that Czechoslovakia had 'learned the lessons of the Gulf war' and did not intend that its arms should be used against Israel. But Mr Shamir said a decision should be taken not to sell arms to Syria and elsewhere before the transition to civilian production had been completed.</p>

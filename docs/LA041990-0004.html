			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> PANEL RULES NEPOTISM RULES WERE BROKEN;  </P> <P> CIVIL SERVICE: THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IS FOUND TO HAVE VIOLATED COUNTY  GUIDELINES BY ALLOWING A DIVISION HEAD TO KEEP HIS NEW WIFE ON HIS STAFF.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Civil Service Commission, after reviewing summaries of  complaints from about 20 workers, concluded Wednesday that Dist. Atty. Michael  D. Bradbury has violated county nepotism rules by allowing a division head to  keep his new wife on staff.  </P> <P> The commission, on a 4-0 vote, also recommended that the County Board of  Supervisors transfer ombudsman Margaret Escobar Trom out of the Child Support  Division run by her husband of six months, C. Stanley Trom.  </P> <P> At the request of Bradbury's lawyer, commission Chairman Robert Embry abstained  from voting. Embry said that he had not prejudged the issue but that his  previous comments to reporters that blatant nepotism exists in the district  attorney's office might have created that impression.  </P> <P> The commission's report is expected to be on the Board of Supervisors' agenda  next week.  </P> <P> The board delayed action this week on Bradbury's request that the supervisors  find that the Trom marriage has created no nepotism problem -- or waive a  county rule that says "no person shall be employed in a position directly or  indirectly supervised by a member of his immediate family."  </P> <P> Most county supervisors did not want to act without having the Civil Service  recommendations in hand, Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer said.  </P> <P> Bradbury, who has characterized the Civil Service Commission as a tool of the  employee union that filed the Trom complaint, would not comment Wednesday.  Previously, he has denied that his office has violated county work rules.  </P> <P> Trom, who said Tuesday that he had never accorded his wife special treatment at  work, also declined comment on the commission's ruling.  </P> <P> "Mike has indicated that we will make our response to the Board of  Supervisors," Trom said. "I'm comfortable with that."  </P> <P> The Civil Service Commission's actions are an endorsement of the findings of  staff adviser Ray Charles, who conducted an investigation after a Feb. 6  complaint by the Public Employees Assn. of Ventura County.  </P> <P> In a summary report, Charles said that, since 1985, numerous employees have  complained to their superiors about the conduct of Escobar Trom and asked to be  transferred from the small work teams she has headed.  </P> <P> Most of the complaints "went unanswered or unresolved," Charles said. "In time,  Ms. Escobar was perceived as one who enjoyed 'most favored status' because of  her relationship with the director."  </P> <P> Trom has said that he and his wife lived together for several years before they  were married. There is no county rule against a supervisor living with a  subordinate as long as they are not married.  </P> <P> In an interview, Charles said he based his conclusions on conversations with  about 20 family-support officers, about half of the 40 workers in that section  of the Child Support Division.  </P> <P> "They all shared the same litany of complaints," he said. Most complaints  involved "just the day-to-day relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Trom. They  felt, for example, that Mrs. Trom did not carry a workload comparable" to those  of other supervising officers.  </P> <P> They were especially critical of her for taking time off to attend conferences  with Trom before and after they were married, Charles said.  </P> <P> "She spent a lot of time away from the office and in her absence others had to  assume her workload," he said. "No other employee gets the opportunity to go to  that many conferences."  </P> <P> Trom said earlier this week that his wife has taken unpaid leave to join him at  quarterly conferences. But, he said, he has never turned down a request for  unpaid leave for any of his employees. His wife also has attended conferences  on her own time while her co-workers were paid to attend to avoid allegations  of favoritism, Trom has said.  </P> <P> Charles' finding that there is a history of complaints about Escobar Trom  seemed to surprise her husband. Trom said he was unaware of a single complaint  by workers about his relationship with his wife before they were married.  Charles said the complaints were filed with the chief family service officer,  who reports directly to Trom.  </P> <P> Commissioners Carolyn Goldsborough and Christine Sims endorsed Charles'  findings, they said, partly because of declarations made by several employees.  Those declarations, which remain confidential, "speak much more clearly than  the report itself" to problems of favoritism in the Child Support Division,  Sims said.  </P> <P> Commissioners rejected the argument of Assistant County Counsel Noel Klebaum,  who represented Bradbury at the hearing.  </P> <P> Klebaum argued that there was no basis for the commission to find a violation  of county nepotism rules, partly because Bradbury changed the department's  organizational structure last November, shortly after the Troms were married.  </P> <P> Since then, Escobar Trom has reported directly to Assistant Dist. Atty. C. Toy  White, who evaluates her performance, instead of to her former superior in the  division.  </P> <P> Escobar Trom still performs the same duties and works in the same office just  down the hall from her husband, but she no longer works for her husband either  directly or indirectly, Klebaum said.  </P> <P> Klebaum told the commission that it could not conclude that work rules have  been violated unless it first concludes that "the district attorney's  reorganization is nothing but a sham."  </P> <P> The county counsel described Trom and his wife as two loyal and valuable county  employees, each with a tenure of about 20 years, who have been "unfairly  subjected to public criticism and embarrassment."  </P> <P> "There is no evidence that Mr. Trom has ever showed favoritism to Mrs. Trom,"  he said.  </P></p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Satellite dish ownership at 2.15m SATELLITE DISH ownership increased by 52,000 between February and March to a total of 2.15m according to the latest figures from GfK, the market research group, Raymond Snoddy writes. The study, commissioned by the ITV Association, also estimates that between June and December last year there was a rise of 290,000 subscribers to the pay channels of British Sky Broadcasting. The group estimates that by the end of the year there were 1.1m subscribers to Sky Sports and adds that only 13 per cent of survey respondents said the sports channel was a significant incentive to purchase a satellite dish. The research is based on a six-monthly ownership survey of 10,000 homes updated by monthly sales information. The survey does not cover Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands. The latest figure for June, from Barb, which provides official broadcasting ratings, estimates that there are 2.44m homes with satellite dishes in the UK, with a further 694,000 receiving satellite channels from cable systems. Mr Andrew Quinn, chief executive of the ITV Association, yesterday accused BSkyB - in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake - of over-stating the number of satellite homes.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yoshiyuki Itsumi, Economic News Department] </F>   [Text] The decision by the Ministry of International Trade  and Industry [MITI] to invoke safeguards under the MFA  [Multi-Fiber Arrangement] will be a "double-edged sword" for  this ministry which supposedly upholds free trade. The present  decision represents a major step toward the actual introduction  of safeguards. Behind this is the fact that the textile  industry is seriously distressed by the deluge of imports, and  the shift in Japanese trade policy in line with efforts to lay  down economic rules in preparation for the inauguration of the  World Trade Organization (WTO).    However, import curbs may result in further inflation of the  current account surplus, and foreign countries are certain to  apply stronger pressure on Japan to reduce its surplus  drastically.    The Western countries have implemented import curbs under  the  MFA for more than 20 years. The United States imposes  restrictions on 80 percent of its imported textile items, while  the European Union (EU) regulates 50 percent of these products.    In contrast, Japan, in consideration of its export products  creating economic frictions overseas, had not even considered  conditions for invoking MFA safeguards.    In the past, when the Japanese textile industry filed  dumping  charges and complained about their difficult position, MITI has  always dealt with the issue in an ambiguous manner, engaging in  behind-the-scenes contacts with the trading partners concerned,  and asking them to implement actual self-restraint in exports.    However, with the prospective establishment of the WTO,  unilateral self-restraint in exports will be banned in principle  as being a "gray measure." Japan, therefore, recently abolished  its voluntary restriction on passenger car exports to the United  States by the end of 31 March.    If export restrictions are to be imposed on textile  products,  Japan will now have to negotiate with its trading partners, and  reach a decision based on MFA rules.    Already this spring China sent a letter to the minister of  international trade and industry saying: "In consideration of  the rapid increase in exports to Japan, we are studying  appropriate measures," thus indicating it is considering  voluntary export restrictions. Tough negotiations will now have  to be conducted to coordinate this with MFA rules.    Steps being taken by the textile industry in relation to  import curbs are also being noted for their effect on efforts to  determine future policy in this industry which has lost its  competitiveness.</p>

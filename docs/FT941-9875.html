			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Slovak premier struggling after defections Slovakia's coalition government was yesterday fighting for survival after a series of defections left the prime minister, Mr Vladimir Meciar, without a working majority in parliament and facing calls for a vote of no-confidence. The opposition, which until now has proved too weak and divided to oust the increasingly unpopular Mr Meciar, appears to have been moved to action by the growing paralysis of the government, which can no longer win sufficient support in parliament to pass urgently needed legislation. This latest crisis was precipitated by the defection on Thursday of 10 deputies from Mr Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) who announced the establishment of an opposition faction called the Alternative of Political Realism (APR). Though the 10 have not officially left the HZDS, their move effectively leaves the ruling coalition between the HZDS and part of the Slovak National party (SNS) with only 63 votes in the 150-seat parliament. There has been a string of defections from the HZDS since it won almost half of the seats in the June 1992 general elections, and in recent polls the party's support has fallen to around 15 per cent. The APR faction is calling for the formation of a non-partisan transitional government to replace Mr Meciar's coalition until early elections can be held. Such a government would be made up of 'politically non-aligned experts' with the support of opposition parties. Mr Meciar has proved a formidable opponent in the past when his position has been under threat, and he wants to hold a referendum to prohibit defectors from remaining in parliament once they have left a party. But for the first time he appears to face the combined weight of almost all opposition forces in the country and he would almost certainly lose a no-confidence vote, making elections inevitable.</p>

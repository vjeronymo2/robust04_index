If one is to believe  the declarations that come from them, most of them are historic.  But viewed in a wider context, probably only very few are  worthy of the description.    I am convinced that the NATO summit on 10 and 11 January  1994  is one of these summits.    We have not only set in motion the work to update NATO to  fit  in with the new world. This work has in fact been going on for  some time. But this summit has begun a process which could  change NATO fundamentally.    This is true in more than one respect. I would like to  concentrate on a central aspect here -- relations with the  countries of central and Eastern Europe, particularly the Baltic  countries. The change has come about as a result of this  summit's adoption of Partnership for Peace. We have adopted a  comprehensive and ambitious program for concrete security policy  and military cooperation throughout Europe.    This is something new and very different.    In the past NATO was the Western defense organization  against  what we saw as an overwhelming threat from the East. That  threat has gone. The countries of Eastern Europe have won their  freedom. The Soviet empire has collapsed into ruins. From these  ruins there has arisen a new Russia which has just held the  first democratic elections since the revolution in 1917, even  though these elections have brought with them repulsive  nationalist tendencies as a result of the election of  Zhirinovskiy. This is something we must pay attention to and we  must support the positive democratic forces.    It has long been clear that if NATO were to survive we would  have to change the organization so that it fits the new  conditions in the world. Not in such a way that we would  abandon the collective security guarantee. Not in such a way  that we would water down the Western community of values. But  in such a way that we would be opening the doors to the new.    That is what we have now done.    Partnership for Peace is the tool. Within its framework we  will this year enter into a number of concrete cooperation  agreements with Eastern European countries. There will be joint  maneuvers in the field of peacekeeping. There will be direct  contacts between military staffs. Liaison offices for these  countries will be set up at NATO headquarters. There are many  other elements. All in all comprehensive cooperation tailored  to meet the needs of each individual country participating.    All will receive the same offers, but the actual concrete  form cooperation takes will vary. The countries closest to us  will want more ambitious cooperation programs. And they will  get them.    We say expressly in the declaration from the summit that we  welcome an enlargement of NATO as part of this development over  time.    This is new, decisively new. Partnership for Peace is not,  as some have claimed, a self-satisfied alliance's refusal to  accept new members. On the contrary Partnership for Peace is a  preparation to do so.    In this connection I think that it was Denmark's simple duty  to stress that the Baltic countries must be given special  support. They are three neighbors on the other side of the  Baltic Sea who have as yet scarcely had time to build up their  own military capacity. But they have decided to set up a joint  peacekeeping battalion. This fits in well with Partnership for  Peace. We want to help them with this battalion, in part by  helping with the training of their personnel.    But, the critics say, why do we not simply admit all from  Eastern Europe and get it over with? We will not do so, because  everything must happen at the right time. Security is too  important to experiment with. And if we did so we would create  more problems than we would be solving. Russia must not be  isolated. Russia must also form part of the new pattern of  cooperation. On the other hand Russia must not have a right of  veto.    Let me add one more thing: Partnership for Peace includes  access for partner nations to political consultations with NATO  if they feel that their security is threatened. This is a very  important step. It reflects what the United States recently  expressed very clearly: The security of those states which lie  between Western Europe and Russia also affects our security.  And above all: We must not create new walls -- out of fear and  enemy images -- after the fall of the old wall, but new  stability and peace-building.    I am convinced that Partnership will prove to be  epoch-making.</p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Mubarak plans talks with Rabin on peace EGYPT'S President Hosni Mubarak is seeking a summit with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, after his discussions on reviving the Middle East peace process in Washington, Israeli officials said yesterday. Mr Gad Ben Ari, Mr Rabin's spokesman, said Egypt's ambassador in Israel had requested the meeting a few days ago. But he added: 'In terms of exact dates and in terms of location, nothing is set.' Mr Mubarak, the key intermediary in efforts to revive the stalled peace talks, meets President Bill Clinton tomorrow. Mr Mubarak said last week he would report the substance of his meeting to Mr Rabin on his return. The Egyptian leader has met both President Hafez al-Assad of Syria and Mr Yassir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, in the run-up to his trip to the US. The PLO is meeting this week in Tunis to discuss possible measures to resolve the crisis over the Israeli mass deportation of Palestinians in December which has blocked the resumption of peace talks. The Palestinians have said they will not decide whether to attend the next round of talks, scheduled for April 20, until after Mr Mubarak's return from Washington.</p>

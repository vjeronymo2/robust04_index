			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Arts: From Mike Leigh, 'It's a Great Big Shame' Sad news from the normally joyous Theatre Royal, Stratford East. Mike Leigh's It's a Great Big Shame is about as dismal a three hour show as you can expect to see. It is also incoherent. The basic idea is a good one. Here are two plays presented as one. The first, and much the longer, is set in east London, 1893. The second is in the same place a century later. We are invited, I suppose, to contrast and compare and to conclude that it is still a great big shame. The title comes from a song by London music hall artist Gus Elen (1862-1940). It is a wistful, melancholy ballad in a style not far away from Kipling: sentimentality mixed with a lurking brutality. At the start of the play the song is performed by Nellie Buckett, described as a waif. Nellie looks and dresses so like a man that for a while I assumed there was some sexual nuance. But the programme states that she is a woman played by Kathy Burke. It is the degradation of poverty that is responsible for her appearance, though she is not exactly down and out. Nellie falls for the best and most interesting character in the play. He is about seven feet tall and called Jim Short, the choice of name being almost the only joke in the piece. Short is a fourth-class drayman, delivering beer to pubs. Played by Paul Trussell, he is an utterly amiable figure with an IQ well below average. He won't touch Nellie the waif, but accepts with docility a proposal of marriage from the shop assistant Ada (Wendy Nottingham). For about six weeks Ada serves him tea, gives him supper and generally waits on him. Then she turns militant, makes him scrub the floor and wash the windows. When Jim's temper snaps, it is possible that he does not mean to strangle her and is simply unaware of his own strength. It is more of a surprise when he starts to eat her. There have been some odd scenes before this outbreak of cannibalism. Ruth Sheen as Fanny Clack, the landlady of the Cock and Bull, presides over some very pleasant music hall songs in her pub. A drunken West Indian enters and is ultimately thrown out. A brief scene shows that the brewers can quarrel with their fiancees quite as brutally as the lower orders. There is an impressive entry of two huge wooden horses pulling the draymen's cart. The second act, in 1993, is all black. This time the woman has at least twice the physical bulk of her husband. She strangles him, though again whether by accident or design is not clear. Possibly it is a sign of advancing civilisation that she does not eat him: there had been earlier hints of what might be done with the microwave. The final scene is played in near-darkness, so is obscure in every sense. The person on the floor may be the dead husband toying with his own entrails, or Ada returned as a sign of what comes of excessive violence. Sole pleasures are the singing of the ballads around the bar and the early character of Jim Short in the first act. The rest is dreadful. Mike Leigh directs his own work. Theatre Royal, Stratford East. (081) 534 0310</p>

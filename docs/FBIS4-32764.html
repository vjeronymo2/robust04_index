			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 28 -- The Foreign Ministry is  supporting the fast ratification of the concordat between the  Vatican and the Republic of Poland, a department director at the  ministry Janusz Stanczyk said at a press conference organized in  Warsaw Tuesday before the first reading of the draft  ratification law to take place in the Sejm on June 30.    Stanczyk recalled Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski's  speech in the Sejm in May on Polish foreign policy, in which the  minister favoured the fast ratification of the concordat since  otherwise "Polish relations with the Holy See would enter a  difficult stage." Stanczyk refused to comment on whether the  rejection of the concordat by the Sejm would result in the  recalling of the Polish ambassador to the Vatican.    Asked whether it will be possible to negotiate another  concordat if the present one is rejected Stanczyk said that such  a possibility exists in legal terms but one cannot be sure if  the Holy See would be interested in "repeating the uncertain  procedure".    According to Stanczak the government is of the opinion that  there is no incompatibility between the concordat and the  constitution so the motion of the Democratic Left Alliance to  postpone the ratification debate until the new constitution is  signed is not justified.</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ARRESTING WOMEN WHO SOLICIT DRINKS  </P> <P> Most cities have operating budgets strained to the breaking point, violent  crime is out of control and the police and Alcohol Beverage Control Commission  guys are busting women in Santa Ana bars for soliciting men to buy them drinks  ("Bar Raids Net Women Who Allegedly Solicit Drinks," Dec. 9).  </P> <P> This is the most stupid use of taxpayers' money that I have seen in a long  time.  </P> <P> And how about the buying male customers (Let's call them Dons -- not to be  confused with Johns)? Are the police arresting and deporting them also?  </P> <P> This law should be stripped from the books in Sacramento, and the enforcement  money used for more constructive purposes, such as alcohol and drug  rehabilitation and drunk-driving enforcement.  </P> <P> BOB CONSTANTINE, Placentia  </P></p>

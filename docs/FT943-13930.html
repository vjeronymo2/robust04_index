			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Books: Poignant poetry of the past - Christopher Patten, governor of Hong Kong, reviews the evocative memoir of an Irish civil servant SWEET KILLOUGH: LET GO YOUR ANCHOR by Maurice Hayes The Blackstaff Press Pounds 7.99, 240 pages As a junior minister in Belfast, opening a red box for the first time, I was disgracefully spoiled. My permanent secretary in the Northern Ireland civil service was a Lancastrian Ulsterman called Norman Dugdale. He is a fine poet (also published by the admirable Blackstaff Press) and a student of Cavafy - and maybe, not surprisingly, the best drafter of a ministerial submission I have ever encountered. And then, such are the riches of the Province, when Dugdale retired, he was followed by Maurice Hayes, a former town clerk of Downpatrick, chairman of the Community Relations Commission and a senior mechanic in most of the efforts in the 1970s to broker civilised constitutional deals between the warring tribes of Ulster. Maurice Hayes, who went on to become Northern Ireland's Ombudsman and today's chairman of the Ireland Fund's advisory committee, is a Gaelic scholar and polymath and a high-scoring member of Ireland's 'Round Britain Quiz' team on BBC Radio. A trenchant analyst of politics and a brave and decent public servant, he has like Mary Robinson or Garret Fitzgerald, all the wit, the learning, the courage and the crack, that give the Irish at their best a head-start in the charm stakes. Now he has written a book about growing up in a seaside village in County Down before the war. And if there is a more magical album of childhood memories, real or fantasy, I would like to know what it is. As Seamus Heaney points out in his introduction, Sweet Killough is part-census, part-inventory of births and deaths, rumours and gossip, tides and winds, moons and stars, harvests and catches, trains, boats, horses, sayings and songs. Killough was a self-contained community into which the outside world encroached little. The biggest employer was the brickworks, not a very sound foundation for the local economy given the state of the building trade and the tendency of the local bricks to split and spall and let in the wet. Otherwise fishing and farming provided the jobs. Hayes described the farming calendar - the ploughing, the sowing, the harrowing, the threshing - and reminds us of the 'fragility of crops at the mercy of the weather'. But above all, in sight of the Mournes and the Isle of Man, Killough is made by the sea: 'the sea is everything, everywhere, determining the limits off existence, the weather, the rotation of activities, and often life itself and death'. We read of the shore, the jetsam, the bays, the piers, the rocks, the wrecks, the drownings, the cod, the mackerel, the lobsters, the limpets, the nuns stranded like penguins by the changing tide, and the mariners' tales which link the coast with more exotic landfalls, Table Mountain in Cape Town or Sugar Loaf in Rio. Killough itself was mercifully free of religious bigotry though reminded of it from time to time by riots and sectarian rites up the road in Belfast. 'The tell-tale signs by which religion was treated: the presence of rosary beads . . . the failure to say which instead of who in the third word of the 'Our Father' . . . to be called Liam instead of Billy . . .' none of these things mattered in Killough. Hayes grew up in a Catholic home in which the superstition of a fishing village fused with the deeper rhythms of the church's liturgical year; abstinence and fasts, Ash Wednesday and additional rosaries, and always the minutia of ritual and indulgences, for example 'how many prayers (known faintly as ejaculations) were necessary to bring about a desired end.' His father was from Waterford, had fought for the King in Mesopotamia and India, and even received a patriotic wound, though for playing football not from a Turkish scimitar. Hayes draws a marvellously evocative picture of his mother, to whom childhood illness inevitably drew him very close, as well perhaps as the fact that as the second of twins he had been expected to die, until 'coaxed into life by the heroic efforts of the mid-wife and a couple of drops of brandy'. We see his mother sewing and making jams and marmalade, apple jelly and puff pastry, we learn of her careful collection of people with cures for warts and haemorrhages and ring worm; we hear her aphorisms and the precepts learned from the nuns and from her own mother. She was obviously a remarkable woman, and at the book's end is borrowing money to buy a rundown commercial hotel in Downpatrick to help pay for a better education for her children. As in other happy childhoods, she is the heroine of the tale - at one moment bent over her sewing machine, 'her hair tumbled down on one side, masking the work', seeming to envelope mother and son in their own private tent. And then, alas, she is knocked over on her way back from the station by touring cyclists, and after that she never seemed young again. It is customary at this time of year to give advice on the books that should be packed for the beach or the river bank. All I can say, as politely as possible, is that if you do not take Sweet Killough with you this year, you are mad.</p>

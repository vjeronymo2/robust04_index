			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Base metals follow copper - Market report London Metal Exchange base metals prices generally followed copper higher in early trading yesterday and then lower as the day progressed. ALUMINIUM moved in a narrow range, meeting resistance around Dollars 1,370 a tonne for three months delivery and ending at Dollars 1,366, a Dollars 5 loss. NICKEL struggled near the lower end of the day's range for most of the session, but traders said buying was being attracted on the dips. The three months position ended at Dollars 6,555 a tonne, down Dollars 135. At the London bullion market the GOLD price recovered most of Tuesday's fall as buying was prompted by the weaker dollar and sharp drops in bond prices. But the market looked very much in the hands of the investment funds. Compiled from Reuter</p>

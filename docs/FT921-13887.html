			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Cookery: Old-fashioned is high fashion LAST WEEK I made out that roast meat was de rigueur for Sunday lunch. Correction. A joint was and is the first choice but there are other options well worth consideration. I have a personal love of boiled meats such as gammon, chicken pot au feu, silverside and leg of lamb (or, better still, mutton) served with a fennel, onion or caper sauce. Another dish that allows the cook to treat Sunday pretty much as a day of rest is braised oxtail. This has to be cooked in advance in order to shrug off surplus fat. Few meats are more lip-smackingly sticky and satisfying on a cold winter's day, and to eat such a dish now will please twice over those who like to keep abreast of the latest culinary trends, for oxtail is very much a meat of the moment. Old fashioned is high fashion in 1992. BRAISED OXTAIL (serves 6 or more) The dumplings and prunes are optional extras here but I think it is a mistake to leave out the prunes as their spicy liquor makes a fine contribution to the gravy, and the fruits themselves are easy to avoid by those who dislike them. For the basic braise: at least 4 lb of oxtail, cut into 2 in lengths (I use 2 whole large oxtail or the meaty parts from 3 smaller ones, saving the bony ends for soup-making); 1 onion; 2 celery stalks; 2 carrots; the juice of an orange; a glass of port; 1 pt beef stock or consomme; a bouquet garni; a spoonful of olive oil; 1 oz flour; a little chopped parsley. For the spiced prunes: 6 oz large prunes;  3/4 pt tea; 5 tablespoons port; the peel of a large orange, thinly shaved in long curls (the skin of the fruit whose juice is used in the basic braise); 1 bay leaf; 4 inches cinnamon stick, 5 cloves and 5 allspice berries, all bruised. For the dumplings:  1/4 lb wholemeal flour mixed with 1 teaspoon baking powder; a great deal of freshly grated nutmeg, coarsely ground black pepper and salt; 1 oz butter; 2 eggs. First prepare the prunes as they will benefit from several days soaking. Measure the tea and port into a small saucepan. Add the orange peel, bay, cinnamon, cloves and allspice. Bring slowly to a rolling boil. Away from the heat, add the prunes. Cover and set aside in a cold place until needed. A day before you plan to serve it, trim all visible fat from the oxtail. Dust the meat with flour and brown it all over in a little hot oil in a large heavy-based flameproof casserole. Chop the onion, celery and carrots. Add them to the pot, pushing them down between the pieces of meat. Sprinkle on the rest of the flour, pour on the liquids and bring to simmering point, stirring occasionally. When the liquid is simmering steadily, add the bouquet garni, some salt and pepper. Cover tightly, if necessary laying a sheet of greaseproof paper between the pot and its lid to make a good fit. Put the casserole into an oven heated to 300'F (150'C) gas mark 2 and cook for 1 hour. Turn the pieces of oxtail over in the gravy, reduce oven temperature to 275'F (140'C) gas mark 1 and cook for 2 hours more. Turn the meat again, switch off the oven and let the casserole rest in the residue heat for 1 hour. Then chill overnight. Next day lift off and discard the surface fat. Place the casserole over a low flame and heat until the beautifully jellied gravy has liquified. Remove and discard the bouquet garni, lift out the pieces of oxtail and reserve them, then whizz the remaining contents of the casserole in a food processor to puree the vegetables and so thicken the gravy a little. Return the gravy to the casserole. Set the swollen prunes aside on a plate, discard their flavourings and fast-boil their liquor until reduced to a few sticky and well spiced spoonfuls. Stir this elixir into the gravy and return the oxtail to the casserole. Cover and reheat gently in a low oven for about one hour or until the meat is very hot and meltingly tender. Turn or baste the oxtail occasionally during this time. Fifteen minutes or so before serving, check the gravy for seasoning, add the swollen prunes to the pot, pushing them well down into the liquid, and make the dumplings. For the dumplings, season the flour mixture lavishly and rub in the butter (these tasks can be done a day ahead). Then add the beaten eggs and mix until smooth. Shape with teaspoons into about 3 dozen baby dumplings. Drop each one as prepared into a shallow pan of barely simmering salted water and poach for 8-10 minutes, flipping them over at half time. Drain the dumplings well, scatter them over the oxtail and sprinkle with parsley. Serve with a dish of floury potatoes, and cabbage, carrots or an undressed bitter leafy green salad.</p>

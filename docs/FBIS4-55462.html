			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(r)": "Slovak Politicians on the Stability </F> Pact"]    [Text] Bratislava--I consider the Stability Pact to be a  kind of umbrella that will cover bilateral negotiations and  agreements between the participating states. This statement was  made yesterday by Christian Democratic Movement Chairman Jan  Carnogursky on Slovak Radio's Radiozurnal program. Prime  Minister Jozef Moravcik said in this context that the Slovak  Government is considering this plan carefully and, at the  moment, is devoting attention to the text of the document that  should be adopted. "We can only accept the whole plan under the  prerequisite that it complies with our interests," said the  prime minister. Milan Ftacnik, chairman of the Party of the  Democratic Left Deputies' Club, said that, in the original plan,  the questions of adjusting the borders were modified; they were  unacceptable for the idea of Europe as it is arranged today,  where any kind of movement on the borders may have unforeseen  consequences. "Nevertheless, it is necessary to discuss the  pact because a joint point of view on resolving the problems  that exist between countries--first and foremost, on the issue  of the minorities--is desirable, and I think that the Slovak  Republic is ready for the pact," emphasized Ftacnik.    Jozef Prokes, honorary chairman of the Slovak National  Party,  expressed his conviction that the Stability Pact "will lead to  the destabilization and not the stabilization of this region."  "The countries that adopted an intolerant attitude toward the  minorities will be given a large whip against the countries that  have been tolerant, and I personally consider this to be  interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Europe  toyed with minority ideas in the 1930's, and it all turned out  very badly. The Stability Pact now envisages bilateral  negotiations between neighboring countries under the supervision  of a third country. In other words, the European Union is  expressing its lack of confidence in the competence and  capability of the countries of Central and East Europe to  resolve their own problems," he said.</p>

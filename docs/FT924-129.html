			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / International Company News: Groupe Bull 'dumbfounded' by loss of Dollars 740m US contract IT WAS a less than happy Christmas for Groupe Bull, the French state-owned computer manufacturer. Its senior management learned on December 24 it had lost a prize - a Dollars 740m personal computer contract for US Air Force - it had believed was securely in the bag. 'We are dumbfounded,' a company spokesman said yesterday. The contract, known as Desktop IV and involving the supply of some 300,000 computers over three years, was awarded to Zenith Data Systems, Bull's US-based PC arm, in the late summer. As late as a week ago Bull executives believed appeals against the award mounted by unsuccessful bidders for the contract would be turned down. Last week, however, administrative judge Catherine Hyatt ruled that the appeals, by a group of computer companies including CompuAdd Computer, Apple Computer, Electronic Data Systems and Government Technology Services, should stand. The arguments behind the 53-page ruling will not be made public until January 4, apparently for reasons of commercial confidentiality, leaving the participants in some confusion. There was no clear indication yesterday of whether Desktop IV would be rebid, or whether the government would move directly to Desktop V. Some argue the contract has now become an embarrassment for the Pentagon because it was the first to be awarded under a new fast-track bidding process, designed to give the armed forces speedy access to the most advanced technology. It is also a serious blow for Bull, under its new chairman Mr Bernard Pache. It is struggling back to profitability and credibility after three years of losses. The contract was not the be and end all of the company 'but it does not do our image much good' said a spokesman, who went on to point out projected revenues and profits from Desktop IV had not been included in the company's budget figures for the coming year. Bull had anticipated, however, that Desktop IV would boost its revenues perhaps by as much as 20 per cent a year, while providing much needed manufacturing volume to keep prices down. The contract would also have been a strong endorsement of the quality of the company's products and an indication that its French ownership was no bar to doing business with the US government. Bull said yesterday, however, that any suggestion that its ownership was a reason for the judge's decision was far off the mark, pointing out that Bull already sells more than Dollars 100m worth of computer equipment annually to the US government.</p>

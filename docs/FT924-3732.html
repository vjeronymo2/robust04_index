			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family: Keep a sharp eye on your pay slip EMPLOYEES should keep their eyes on their pay slips following evidence this week that some employers are taxing them too much on their wages under the pay-as-you-earn system. Accountants Touche Ross have warned of a survey by tax inspectors in Bournemouth and Poole which disclosed that up to 10,000 people were paying too much tax. The error is that payroll departments have failed to take into account the 20 per cent lower rate tax band for income up to Pounds 2,000, which was introduced in the budget last April. The bottom slice was being taxed at 25 per cent rather than 20 per cent, meaning that employees were overpaying tax of Pounds 1.92 per week. This has been caused, particularly in small businesses, by a failure by the payroll department to use the government's tax tables correctly. The Inland Revenue has confirmed the findings of the survey, but says there is no evidence of similar errors elsewhere. But Maurice Parry-Wingfield, technical tax partner at Touche Ross, recommends that anyone who thinks they may be over paying should see their wages clerk.</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lonrho's brokers consider resigning LONRHO'S JOINT brokers Phillips &amp; Drew Securities are considering resigning in protest at the international trading group's lack of consultation over its big deals. The brokers, the main market makers in Lonrho shares, were particularly irritated by the group's failure to notify it of its decision to sell a third of its holding in Metropole Hotels to the Libyans. This lack of dialogue has made it difficult for Phillips &amp; Drew to act for Lonrho in dealing with the group's institutional shareholders, many of which criticised the Libyan deal. The decision to contemplate resigning the account was not taken simply because Lonrho is in trouble. Societe Generale Strauss Turnball, Lonrho's other joint broker, is to continue to act for the company. Lonrho has had talks with representatives from US-based Fidelity Management and Research, which with a 9.8 per cent stake is its second-biggest shareholder, after FMR voiced concern that it may be forced to disinvest from the company if the United Nations imposes economic sanctions against Libya. Lonrho is confident that Fidelity will not sell, even if sanctions are declared. However, although the Department of Trade and Industry has confirmed UN sanctions would not affect businesses dealing with or investing in Libya, Fidelity's concern stems from the US ban on Americans dealing with Libyan institutions. The US Treasury's Office of Foreign Control, which enforces the ban, yesterday confirmed that it is still considering whether the Metropole hotel chain should be included on the list of proscribed Libyan businesses. In a separate move the DTI announced that Lonrho's proposed sale of its Scottish and Universal Newspapers to Trinity International Holdings for Pounds 45m would be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.</p>

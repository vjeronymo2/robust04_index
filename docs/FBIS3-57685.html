Speaking about Russian-Lithuanian trade and economic  relations at a news conference in Vilnius on Thursday,  Slezevicius also expressed "regret that Moscow has so far failed  to respond to our note on the enactment of the agreement on  most-favoured nation status in trade which was signed in  November last year during Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin's visit to Vilnius."    The Lithuanian premier also said that the talks on Russian  military transit from the Kaliningrad region to Russia through  Lithuania are moving very slowly.</p>

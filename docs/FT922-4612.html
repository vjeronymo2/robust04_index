			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Pounds 36.8m is overpaid in unemployment benefit MORE THAN Pounds 36.8m of unemployment benefit was paid in 1990-91 to claimants who were not entitled to it, according to the National Audit Office, which has qualified the accounts of the National Insurance Fund for the period as a result. The government expenditure watchdog says that many of the errors arose when benefit was paid to people who were not unemployed, or who were not available for work. These overpayments were more than outweighed by underpayments of Pounds 45.1m for the year. The NAO has qualified the NI Fund accounts on two other counts, both arising from doubts over the accuracy of employers' records of employees' earnings: The amount paid out in earnings-related benefits and government contributions to personal pensions could not be accurately checked. The reliability of estimates prepared by the government actuary on the amount of statutory sick pay and maternity pay paid by employers and recovered from NI contributions was uncertain. The Employment Service said the NAO findings were based on a sample of about 1,300 claims. A new quarterly survey of the accuracy of benefit payments based on a much larger sample showed that more than 95 per cent of payments were now accurate.</p>

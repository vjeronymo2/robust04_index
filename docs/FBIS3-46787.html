"We will turn the challenges of internationalization and  opening into an oppportunity for us to build up our  international competitiveness and carry on the new five-year  economic plan consistently," the president said.    Noting that a silent economic revolution is sweeping the  world, President Kim said only capable countries and industries  can survive in the whirlwind.    The president was speeking at a new year reception hosted by  the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry at the Sejong  Cultural Center.    He said he would keep by all means the promise to make South  Korea a country most ideal for industrial activities. "The  government in its part will assure industries their free  business activities to the most possible extent," Kim said.    Calling on industries to invest now, the president said that  only those industries that make bold investment now braving a  little uncertainty can survive.    He said the Korean economy has visibly improved since the  third quarter of 1993 and is now in the stage of recovery,  adding that trade has recorded a surplus for the first time in  four years.    "Since this year would become a significant period in  deciding the fate of Korea in the 21st century, we must cope  with all challenges lying ahead [of] us with firm confidence,"  President Kim said.</p>

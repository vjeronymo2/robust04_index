			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEY HAVE POINTS TO MAKE AFTER 102-24 PREP GAME  </P> <P> To encourage a player to "shine" once in a while, as Morningside Coach Frank  Scott put it, is not the issue.  </P> <P> To allow his team and one particular individual to completely demoralize an  opponent is. And then Coach Scott has the gall to complain because the  opponents, with only four players, refused to come out for the second half.  </P> <P> I guess the old saying that you never kick a guy when he's down doesn't apply  in this case, right Mr. Scott? After all, these weren't guys, they were high  school girls.  </P> <P> How foolish of me to think that a high school coach might also be responsible  for molding character.  </P> <P> MICHAEL BRISON  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

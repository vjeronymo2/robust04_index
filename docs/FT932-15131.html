			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Overburdened but optimistic - John Authers listens to teachers in conference at Bournemouth TEACHERS spent most of their time in Bournemouth yesterday trying to demonstrate that they are overworked. With almost equal dedication, delegates to the NASUWT conference also tried to prove they are professional. These are the two main planks in the union's opposition to the government's proposed national curriculum tests: the dispute is over workloads and the claim that implementing the tests places an unreasonable work burden on them. This is a legitimate ground for industrial action. The union won its case in the High Court against Wandsworth Borough Council by taking this stand. If their action is held to be politically motivated, it could yet be ruled illegal by the Appeal Court, whose judgment is expected next week, or by the House of Lords. A large quote from Wandsworth's director of education even hangs above the stage of the conference. In it he is quoted as calling the national curriculum 'over-bureaucratic and unworkable. The sooner it is buried the better.' Support from parents, who are said to be asking for children to be withdrawn from the tests, has also been claimed. NASUWT members are also taking heart from the actions of other teachers' unions following the Wandsworth ruling. The decision by the traditionally moderate ATL union, which is not affiliated to the TUC, to ballot its members on a test boycott came after Mr John Patten, the education secretary, addressed the ATL conference. Mr Richard Hinton, an NASUWT delegate and history teacher at a Staffordshire comprehensive, said: 'Anyone who can go to the ATL and make them take action after 25 years of inaction has a great talent.' Support from the ATL, with a membership roughly the same size as NASUWT's, increases the chance that action could be effective. But the decision by the NUT, the biggest teachers' union, to ballot members over performance-related pay, caused anger because it was felt this might be seen as political activism. This could undermine support from parents, which will be vital for teachers if a compromise is not reached before June when the tests are due to take place. Cheers greeted a delegate who said: 'What's taking place elsewhere at other conferences I think we should abhor. It's not tolerable to see this profession, which we cherish, portrayed this way.' Complaints about workload made up the bulk of conference speeches. Every teacher had their own statistic. Apart from the 8,085 pages of national curriculum documentation which Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary, presented to conference, delegates were told that primary school teachers had to make 100 statements for every pupil in each class, which, according to one delegate, meant 80 hours of work a week. A Socialist Workers party stall in the conference foyer was the strongest evidence of leftwing infiltration. But the stand facing it, where a life insurance company was selling teachers' pensions, seemed to be doing a better trade.</p>

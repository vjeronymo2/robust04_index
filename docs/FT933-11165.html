			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: NZ telecom company up 61.5% TELECOM CORP, the New Zealand phone company, yesterday reported a 61.5 per cent lift in tax-paid profits to NZDollars 118.2m (USDollars 65.2m) for the three months ended June. Mr Peter Shirtcliffe, chief executive, said the result heralded a very promising result for the full year. Telecom, which is 60 per cent owned by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech, also announced plans for a capital restructuring which will reduce the number of shares on issue by 20 per cent and repay capital to shareholders. Mr Shirtcliffe said Telecom had been boosted by robust volume growth in core markets and a 'most satisfactory' reduction in operating costs. Operating revenues were little changed at NZDollars 597.5m. Operating expenses fell by 15.1 per cent due to reduced personnel costs, depreciation and other operating expenses. Staff numbers have come down by 1,605 to 11,277 over the past 12 months. In May, the company announced plans to shed 5,000 staff over the next three years. Earnings per share for the quarter were 5.1 NZ cents, compared with 4.1 cents. On plans to restructure capital, Mr Shirtcliffe said that Telecom's assets were currently funded by capital at a ratio of 33 per cent debt to 67 per cent equity. This was more conservative than normal in the industry, he said. The proposed restructuring was aimed at reducing the cost of capital.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Jia Yong (6328 3057) and Ma Xiaochun (7456 </F> 2556 2504)]    [Text] Beijing, 26 May (XINHUA) -- Since China's current  military service law was promulgated 10 years ago, people across  the country have fulfilled their obligation according to the law  and have actively supported and participated in national defense  building, ensuring the smooth development of national defense  work and socialist modernization.    Tan Dongsheng, director of the Mobilization Department of  the  General Staff Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army [PLA]  told reporters that, since the current military service law,  which was approved by the Second Session of the Sixth National  People's Congress [NPC] was promulgated on 31 May 1984,  servicemen and people across the country, under the leadership  of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the  Central Military Commission, have worked diligently to enforce  the law and have achieved noticeable results.    -- A good trend has been formed in which everyone has shown  concern for and supported national defense work. The state has  listed the study of the military service law as an important  part of the efforts to popularize legal knowledge. All  localities -- in light of their local realities, especially  their annual conscription work -- have regularly publicized the  law and applied themselves to enforcing it, enabling the masses  to be more national defense-minded. Party committees and  governments at all levels and all social sectors have endeavored  to do a good job related to military service and militia and  reserve service, and a good job in giving special care to and  making job placement for disabled servicemen and to family  members of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen. Moreover, many  provinces and cities have established and promulgated relevant  regional laws and regulations.    -- The vast numbers of military service-age youths have  enthusiastically enlisted themselves for military service,  providing large numbers of high-quality soldiers to the troops.  During each year's conscription season, people in both urban  and rural areas across the country scrambled to enlist  themselves for military service. The number of newly enlisted  young people with college or special secondary school  educational level has been on the increase year by year.    -- The large numbers of militiamen and reserve service  personnel have actively participated in military training and  endeavored to perform their duty to stay combat-ready, making  themselves the PLA's right hand and a powerful reserve force.  They have played an important role in building bridges,  constructing roads, developing mines, harnessing rivers,  building water conservancy projects, reclaiming lands for  farming use, afforesting lands, taking the lead in studying and  applying sciences, tackling key quality problems, and helping  the poor to improve their lot.    -- Work in supporting the army and giving preferential  treatment to families of revolutionary armymen and martyrs has  been strengthened and has developed in the new situation.  "Regarding the troops as the great wall and servicemen as one's  family members" has been truly practiced among the people. In  particular, since Comrade Deng Xiaoping wrote the inscription  for the "Model Double-Support City" in early 1991, the country's  double-support work has been raised to a new level and large  numbers of model double-support cities (counties) and advanced  double-support individuals have emerged.    -- Importance has been attached to giving preferential  treatment to active duty servicemen and to job placement for  demobilized and retired servicemen. The State Council has held  annual meetings on job placement services for demobilized  military cadres and party committees, and governments at all  levels have regarded the work as a political task, enabling  demobilized military cadres to be properly resettled. The  "Regulations on Resettling Retired Compulsory Servicemen" --  promulgated in 1987 by the State Council -- have assured  employment for compulsory servicemen retiring from active duty.  Governments at all levels have given various preferential  treatments to active duty servicemen and their families, and  this has played an important role in raising the servicemen's  social status and in helping them perform their military duty  free without worries.    -- Military training for college and secondary school  students has been widely conducted. As demanded by the military  service law and the "Outline for China's Educational Reform and  Development," which was jointly issued by the party Central  Committee and the State Council, as of this date, 1.04 million  college students and 620,000 secondary school students have  received military training.</p>

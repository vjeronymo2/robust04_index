			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: The rising threat to return to growth - Emma Tucker explains why the jobless present an obstacle to an economic recovery A SUSTAINED recovery in growth as a result of Britain's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism might be severely hampered by the growing pool of unemployed left in the wake of the government's tight monetary policy. Figures this week showed that unemployment in the UK has grown to 2.8m, its highest level for five years, and most economists expect it to carry on rising next year even if interest rates creep downwards. The Treasury's economic model suggests that a 10 per cent devaluation of the pound, with no change in interest rates, would reduce unemployment by 204,000 over two years. Economists are sceptical. Ms Ruth Lea, an economist at Mitsubishi Bank, said: 'The immediate outlook for unemployment is not very good. It tends to be a lagging indicator anyway and I don't expect to see a rapid turnaround.' The extent of damage already inflicted on the jobs market in the UK was highlighted this week in a survey carried out by the Department of Employment in the spring. The Labour Force Survey, quarterly results of which were published for the first time this week, gives a more comprehensive measure of economic activity than the monthly figures published by the department, which simply record the number of people claiming benefit. The latest LFS involved more than 60,000 households across Britain, and covered about 150,000 people. In addition to the so-called 'claimant count' unemployment measure, the LFS covers many groups that do not qualify for benefits, such as women returning to the labour market after raising a family, the self-employed and young people aged 16 and 17 who do not have places on Youth Training schemes and are actively seeking work. The survey throws light on those sectors of the economy which have suffered the most damaging losses in the past year. Contrary to the impression that this recession has been concentrated in the service sector, it shows that every sector of the economy has recorded a bigger percentage fall in employment than the services sector. The numbers of people employed in services was only 0.9 per cent lower in spring this year than in spring last year. That compares with a 9.2 per cent fall in construction and a 9 per cent fall in energy and water supply. Employment in manufacturing fell 5 per cent. The biggest fall was in agriculture, forestry and fishing, where the number employed fell 10.5 per cent. Furthermore, a breakdown of how different occupations have weathered the recession shows that while non-service sector occupations have suffered damaging losses, the number employed as managers and administrators has risen since last year, as has employment in professional occupations such as solicitors, businessmen and doctors. The number of craft workers either self-employed or working as employees fell 10.6 per cent, the sharpest fall out of nine groups of occupations. The numbers working as plant and machine operators fell more than 8 per cent. The only other group of occupations where employment rose was in personal and protective services, which covers the armed forces, catering, nursing and childcare. This pattern of unemployment - among unskilled workers and often in manufacturing industry - is very similar to that created in the last recession. Unemployment rates are much higher for men than for women and among unskilled and poorly educated workers. In the 1980s, when the rate of unemployment reached 11 per cent, the jobless total continued to rise until 1986, more than four years after the economy emerged from recession. The debilitating effects of long-term unemployment on the skills and motivation of those workers meant that unemployment stayed high even after the recovery gained pace. Furthermore, the shortage encouraged skilled workers to force up their wage demands with an inflationary effect on the economy. Whether unemployment starts to fall in two years or four years, the high levels of skill shortages created by prolonged unemployment may well hinder the recovery once more. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, the Japanese bank, said: 'We have invested too little in capacity and too little in people. Skills shortages are going to be a problem that constrains growth for some time.'</p>

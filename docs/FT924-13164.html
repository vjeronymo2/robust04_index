			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Arts: 'Flute' revived at the ENO - Opera At the Coliseum, John Abulafia has revived Nicholas Hytner's production of Mozart's The Magic Flute with a sure hand. And perhaps an inventive one, too  -there are telling bits of business that I had not remembered, and in any case he had to accommodate a new pair of royal principals and a new trio of Ladies. The gist of the original production remains intact: light touch, plenty of unexpected details to refresh jaded appetites, attentive sympathy with the whole unlikely tale. Neither Bob Crowley's coolly elegant designs nor Nick Chelton's clever lighting have faded by one jot. If Jeremy Sams' translation is too sophisticated to answer very closely to Schikaneder's original text, its knowing charm is nicely apt here. So is the contribution of Nicholas Kraemer, the new conductor, who favours swift, 'period'-conscious tempi (almost too swift for his orchestra in the overture) and yet ensures that each of the little epiphanies gets full value. The current cast is admirably even and unstarry though voice-fanciers will be in no doubt about the stand-out performances. Those were Richard Van Allen's Speaker, soberly, beautifully sung (and enunciated), and the irresistibly fresh and eager Pamina of Gillian Webster, whose sculpted line  -really distinguished in her G minor aria - carried no hint of a cut-glass tinkle. As Sarastro, John Connell managed only ghostly lowest-bass notes: a slight cold, maybe. In middle register he offered commanding warmth and openness, and acted the tetchy sage with a touch of self-satisfied mischief. For the Queen of Night, Nan Christie's once bell-like tone has begun to spread a bit, but her plucky attack on the coloratura heights was exciting - much enhanced by fine, flamboyant histrionics where most Queens are content to stand and deliver. Alan Opie's Papageno is an amiable bear now, full of character but a degree glummer than he used to be. At the cost of some tight, closed timbre, Paul Nilon's Tamino manages to be staunchly stylish. As the evening goes on,he makes an ever deeper mark. The new Three Ladies are Janice Watson, Susan Bickley and Therese Feighan, well matched both musically and dramatically; without any vampish mugging they convey both sexy sparks and comic malevolence. Geoffrey Pogson makes a ripely plummy Monostatos, and Mary Hegarty a tough but fetching Papagena. The Three Boys here (who will alternate with a second trio throughout the run) didn't rise vocally to angelic heights, but they were appealingly concerned and musically secure. Mostly, this Flute still gives unalloyed pleasure. In repertory at the English National Opera until November 13; revival sponsored by United Airlines</p>

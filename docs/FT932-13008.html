			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Historic church reduced to rubble after 600 years THE CHURCH that was built before the Great Fire of London, which survived the Victorian building boom, the Blitz and the plate-glass revolution of the 1980s, has been reduced to rubble. There was, however, an ironic if small silver lining to its fate - some of its treasures were moved to St Paul's Cathedral last year after it suffered damage in the Baltic Exchange bomb. Valuables, including a painting from the Bruegel school, escaped the weekend bombing. St Ethelburga the Virgin on Bishopsgate, parts of which date back to 1400, was the smallest and one of the oldest churches in the City. Only 30 feet wide and 60 feet long, it was tucked between the two office blocks which bore the brunt of Saturday's explosion. Its larger sister church and the accompanying rectory were badly scarred by last April's bomb, which wrecked the home of the the Rev Dick Lucas, rector for 30 years. Repair work to bomb damage at St Ethelburga's was just about to begin before Saturday's blast. The church was enjoying a fragile revival after being closed down some years ago. It had been re-dedicated as a Chapel of Ease in March 1992 and after some refurbishment was open for a few days before suffering Pounds 75,000 worth of damage in April. Hopes of a renaissance for the church were shattered on Saturday when Mr Paul Sutherland, the parish clerk and the building's official keyholder, was called to the Guildhall by police. The church was at the centre of the central danger zone which is expected to be closed for at least four days. But reports suggested that nothing remained except for one wall. 'Its just a crater and a pile of rubble,' said Mr Sutherland. The parish is now reduced to two churches but yesterday parish administrator Ms Elizabeth Ellingworth said: 'We are still holding services at St Peter's in Cornhill . . . in spite of the hardship we are determined not to be beaten.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Galkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- Parliamentary hearings on  the draft law "on 1994 federal budget" was held today at the  Russian State Duma. First Deputy Russian Minister of Finance  Vladimir Petrov tried to convince the deputies that the draft  will help to overcome the economic crisis and start economic  revival.    Petrov described the budget to include 120,000,000,000,000  rubles worth of revenues and 62,400,000,000,000 rubles worth of  deficit as realistic and the only correct from among all the  suggested drafts. The budget is expected to cut the inflation to  monthly seven-eight per cent at the year end and halve credit  emission as compared to 1993.    Many spending items, including social needs, will remain at  the 1993 level as compared to the gross domestic product. The  defence spending is expected to reach 37,100,000,000,000 rubles  or 5.1 per cent of the gross domestic product.    Some 5,000,000,000,000 rubles will be spend on state  management bodies, which is more than last year. "We came to  conclusion that the validity of the presidential decree on civil  service shall be suspended till 1995. The decree's  implementation would mean 11,000,000,000,000 rubles worth of  spending on the state machinery," said petrov.    The draft budget takes into account the moratorium on  increased salaries in budget-financed spheres in the second  quarter of 1994, which would require additional  2,000,000,000,000 rubles. The government thinks it should  fulfill all of its previous promises and then start further  indexation of salaries with due account of the state financial  position.    The first quarter of 1993 brought 8,400,000,000,000 rubles  worth of revenues to the budget, which is less than it was  planned. A reason for this is that a number of territories,  primarily Bashkortostan and the Republic of Sakha dodged the  payment of taxes to the federal budget. Negotiations with their  leadership is underway to settle the problem. The first  quarter's spending amounted to 17,200,000,000,000 rubles.</p>

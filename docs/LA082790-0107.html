			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> PROZAC IN ABBIE HOFFMAN DEATH?  </P> <P> Two citizens groups today asked the Bucks County coroner to reopen an  investigation into the death of political activist Abbie Hoffman for signs that  he was driven to suicide by a controversial anti-depressant.  </P> <P> Hoffman had taken the drug Prozac six weeks before he was found dead on April  12, 1989, in his Solebury Township apartment, the Citizens Commission on Human  Rights and the Prozac Survivors Support Group said in a letter to the coroner.  </P> <P> Coroner Thomas Rosko's autopsy showed Hoffman, a founder of the 1960s anti-war  Yippie movement, died from an overdose of the sedative phenobarbitol and  alcohol.  </P> <P> In their letter, the groups cite a Harvard study linking Prozac to obsessive  suicidal thoughts. Published in the February edition of the American Journal of  Psychiatry, the study found that 3 1/2% of Prozac users developed suicidal  thoughts that lasted up to three months after taking the drug.  </P></p>

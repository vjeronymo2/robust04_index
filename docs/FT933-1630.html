			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Porsche importer in S Korean talks PORSCHE'S wholly owned UK importer hopes by the end of the year to conclude a deal to import and distribute South Korean-built Daewoo cars. Daewoo, Korea's third-largest carmaker after Hyundai and Kia, wants to establish a UK market presence by 1995. It has been negotiating for several months with Porsche Cars Great Britain. The latter is being encouraged by its Stuttgart parent company to broaden its business base following the considerable shrinkage of the luxury sports car business that has taken place since the boom years of the late 1980s. The Reading-based company is also signing import agreements with a number of continental-based Porsche accessory manufacturers. In sharp contrast to Porsche, Daewoo is a producer of family and smaller cars. Until recently Daewoo relied heavily on producing cars for sale in North America. These were based on the Opel Kadett and bore the General Motors' Pontiac LeMans badge. However, it ended this joint venture last year in order to make and sell its own cars globally. It currently makes around 750,000 vehicles a year, but plans to invest Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.27bn) to triple output to 2.2m a year by the end of the decade - 1m a year outside Korea. Marketing restrictions agreed with GM expire next year, after which Daewoo is free to implement plans to expand into the US and Europe. Mr Kevin Gaskell, Porsche Cars' managing director, said the Porsche and Daewoo businesses would be run separately. Import and distribution would be carried out at separate centres and there would be no provision for Porsche dealers to sell Daewoos.</p>

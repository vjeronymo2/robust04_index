			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Arts: A new dome for Rome - Architecture I have just seen a wonder. The new mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre in Rome by the distinguished architect Paolo Portoghesi is one of the very best new buildings I have seen for a long time. First of all, it is remarkable as the first and only mosque in the capital city of Christendom. Secondly, it is brilliant as an advanced example of the work of a master architect and historian. Paolo Portoghesi won the commission to design this mosque as long ago as 1975. It is still being built on a site in the suburbs of Rome beyond Parioli. Completion is probably due this autumn but there seems to be no hurry - decoration of the interior by Moslem craftsmen continues slowly and carefully. Work did not really begin until 1985 and when you visit the site today there is an unusually calm sense of unhurried progress. The domed mosque is only a part of a group of cultural buildings - a library, prayer hall, school, auditorium and offices make up what Portoghesi calls a small slice of the city. The approach to the new mosque is a processional route that begins with a circular fountain set within a square, along a gently ascending flight of shallow steps where water runs alongside in a narrow channel, as it does in a Moghul garden. At the top of this ascent, which is almost a modest echo of that climb to Aracoeli by the Campidoglio, is a grand colonnaded square. Here the architect's real ingenuity is manifest in three dimensions. There is a forest of smooth concrete columns that divide and branch almost like trees. As the curved branching tops of these columns overlap visually, the eye sees Islamic forms cross and merge to make what appear to be the pointed shapes of Italian Gothic. At the same time there are strong suggestions of the great Islamic buildings at Cordoba. To one side of this cloistered square is the mosque itself - entered through a pair of giant doors, which the architect opened for me with an appropriately large key. The interior is a glorious revelation. Portoghesi has written about and studied the Italian Baroque as no other architect has. In his mosque is all the absorbed knowledge of the past transformed into something completely new. The inside of the beautiful dome floats above a lacework of ribs. It is pierced to allow a series of precise rays of light on to the tiled floor. The proportions of the dome are the same as those of the Pantheon - a perfect sphere would fit beneath it. There is a sense of total, calm rightness, emphasised by the complexity of the ring of the branched columns that surround it. I think it is Portoghesi's skill as a manipulator of light and structure that makes this interior so successful. It is a complex but rewarding place that intriguingly marries the mathematics and pattern making of the Middle East to a truly Roman sense of architecture. There are some worries. Much Islamic mosaic and carved decoration can be restrained and elegant. There is, however, a real danger that modern versions of Islamic pattern making can look kitsch. So far the Moroccan mosaicists have been responsive to the architecture but it would be a tragedy if the pure beauty of the architecture was overpowered by a layer of decoration of indifferent quality. In the unfinished prayer hall one feels an incredible architectural power, almost reminiscent of ancient Egypt. This could also be trivialised by casual decoration. The architect has used remarkable materials. The lowest floors are built from large scale tufa bricks. The mass of the walls are made of the thinnest Roman clay bricks that lie one upon another with scarcely any mortar - yellow ones made from Aurelian clay and red ones from Flaminian. Travertine marble trims the brickwork and is used for paving. The very subtle ribbed dome - which deliberately manages not to look either Islamic or Roman - is sheathed in lead. Traditional materials meet the prefabricated concrete columns with perfect equanimity. In the same way Portoghesi's architecture brings the intelligence of the past to the present - the result is powerfully evocative but also completely new. Professor Portoghesi is a very great architect. We are lucky in England to learn that he has recently won a competition to design a new building at St. Peter's College, Oxford. The Intellectual Property Centre will form the fourth side of the south quadrangle of the college. It will be Portoghesi's first building in this country and St. Peter's must be congratulated on making such an enlightened choice. It is a relatively small building that fills a very narrow site. It will be on six floors and house the college law library, the intellectual property law centre and teaching and residential space for visiting fellows. An important part of the design is the landscape and patterning of the court which adds a sense of dignified perspective to a quad of uneven architectural quality. Portoghesi's arrangement of pediments and gables and frames and cloisters seems to adopt elements from the disparate facades of the quadrangle and harmonise them into an intricate geometry that will be a most distinguished and intelligent addition to the architecture of Oxford.</p>

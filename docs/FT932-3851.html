			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities subdued by inflation worries Wall Street US SHARE prices were flat-to-lower yesterday as dealers and investors nervously awaited today's important inflation data, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 20.21 down at 3,491.72, but the entire loss was due to a big decline in one stock - Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing (3M). The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended just 0.40 off at 445.38 and the Nasdaq composite eased 1.19 to 688.05. New York SE volume came to 232.6m shares. For the fourth consecutive day, activity on the equity markets was dominated by apprehension ahead of the publication - due this morning - of the producer prices index for May. Ever since the surprisingly strong April inflation figures, investors in both stock and bond markets have been worried that a revival in inflation might prompt an interest rate rise from the Federal Reserve. Last Friday's unexpectedly big rise in payrolls, and the fall in the national unemployment rate, only heightened the markets' fears that rates may be increased to halt the progress of inflation. In particular, investors are concerned that they may soon be facing the worst of all worlds: rising inflation but a still sluggish economy. These fears, combined with concern that stocks may now be dangerously overpriced, suggest that conditions are ripe for a possible major correction in equity values. Among individual issues, 3M plunged Dollars 10 to Dollars 105 3/4 in busy trading after the company stated that it was lowering its own forecasts for second-quarter earnings. Computer stocks continued to suffer from brokers' downgrades and worries about the outlook for the industry. Hewlett-Packard shed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 84 3/4 , IBM Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 52 1/32 , Compaq Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 52 5/8 and Unisys Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 11 3/8 . Also weaker in the technology sector was Advanced Micro Devices, which slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 22 1/8 in active trading after the latest Semiconductor Industry Association's book-to-bill ratio came in below forecasts. The news also hurt Intel, traded on the Nasdaq market, which fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 54 3/4 in turnover of 4.7m shares. Xerox was one of the most heavily traded stocks of the day, holding steady at Dollars 74 1/4 in volume of 2.8m shares. On Wednesday the company sold 7m additional shares at Dollars 74 1/4 . Athlone Industries forged ahead Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 18 1/8 on news that Allegheny Ludlum is to acquire the company under a merger agreement. On the Nasdaq market, technology stocks started weaker, with Microsoft and Apple both incurring sizeable losses, but a subsequent recovery left them up a net Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 91 1/8 and Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 44 1/2 respectively. Canada THE TORONTO market closed mixed in fairly heavy trading as a late-session rally pushed the TSE 300 index up to a net gain of 15.7 at 3,875.4. However, falls led rises by 352 to 319 after volume of 60.4m shares. The transportation group rose 2.1 per cent, forest products gained 1.3 per cent and mining put on 1.2 per cent, but the golds sector was 0.5 per cent lower.</p>

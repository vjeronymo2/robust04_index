			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): UK insurers likely to confirm recovery - Other companies Three of the UK's biggest insurance companies are due to report rises in profits for the first quarter, confirming recovery in that market. General Accident is expected tomorrow to post pre-tax profits of about Pounds 60m, compared with Pounds 42m. Forecasts for Commercial Union's profits on Wednesday vary from Pounds 38m to Pounds 80m, while the range is Pounds 15m-Pounds 50m for Royal Insurance the same day. Some analysts warn, however, that current profit levels do not represent any increase on the last quarter of 1993 and suggest that competition is returning to some sectors of the market. Kwik Save: The UK's largest grocery discounter is expected to report interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 62m-Pounds 64m, against Pounds 61m. While it is one of those putting pressure on J Sainsbury, it faces competition on its own territory from expanding continental discounters. Scottish Power: The electricity generator and distributor is expected to reveal annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 340m-Pounds 350m on Wednesday, up from Pounds 308m. The total dividend will probably rise by 11 per cent to 12.4p. Royal Bank of Scotland: The bank, reporting on Wednesday, is expected to double its interim pre-tax profits, which stood at Pounds 91.6m last time, as well as lift its dividend. Questions will include whether it will spend its healthy capital on acquisition. Grand Metropolitan: Interim figures, due on Thursday from the food and drinks group, should show a 10 per cent increase to about Pounds 445m pre-tax. The Pillsbury Green Giant business in the US should do well, given the floods in the mid-west and the resulting rise in vegetable prices. The hot topic is whether GrandMet will unwind its unhappy Inntrepreneur pubs joint venture with Courage. Unilever: First-quarter figures on Friday for the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group should show modest improvement to about Pounds 450m pre-tax, against Pounds 440m, with detergents the main depressing factor. A downturn in the US started after the period and this quarter should also start to show the costs of launching a new concentrated detergent across Europe.</p>

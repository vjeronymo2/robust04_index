			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Broad approach to local government change is right Sir, In your leader (June 14) you coined a new catch-phrase, the 'Concorde fallacy' to describe the current review of local government structure in the English shires now being undertaken by the Local Government Commission - even though only half of our recommendations are as yet in the public domain. As an occasional user of Concorde (although not at the public expense) I am always impressed with the vision, engineering genius, international co-operation and quality of service that makes it possible for me to arrive in New York before I have left London, and fit for work. It would be nice to think that those now closely involved with local government could match these characteristics. The fallacy in your own approach, if I may say so, is shown in your last paragraph. You acknowledge a case for unitary status for Leicester and Bristol, and for the abolition of new counties such as Avon and Cleveland. But there is a substantial number of broadly similar places. If Leicester, why not Derby and Nottingham? And if not these, why not Plymouth, Portsmouth, Southampton and a good few others? And Humberside, Cumbria and Hereford and Worcester? It must be right to pursue a broad approach to cover all the English shires and to allow these issues to be aired in front of the commission and local people so that we may all weigh the evidence for change. It was also right last year to speed the process up so that local government need not be in limbo for any longer than is necessary. In undertaking the review, the commission, often alone among the many interests concerned, shares most of the concerns to which you now draw attention. First, the commission has always been clear that the law provides that it may propose no change in the current structure if that appears to be what local people want and local circumstances dictate. Second, the commission has always been concerned to determine, as closely as can be, the true costs of reorganisation and has put these forward so that local people can judge whether they wish to pay the price (as in Rutland where it could be attained for the price of a pint of Ruddles a week for every household). Third, we have been very concerned to maintain the strategic capability of local government. This has been one factor in our decision in many areas to recommend the retention of the county council and in our wish in nearly every area to retain the existing structure planning framework. It also underlines the commission's general preference for any unitary authorities in rural areas to be larger in pop-ulation terms rather than smaller. Fourth, the commission is clear that new councils should devolve management to the local level and provide a bigger role for local councils (an approach the government espouses in Scotland and Wales but so far seems unwilling to support in England). Fifth, the commission is clear that the real stakeholders in local government, that is local people, should be closely involved in the process of decision, often to the dismay of local politicians who have their own interests to promote. That is why the commission is now embarking on an unprecedented exercise to consult every household on a range of possible structures, any of which we will be prepared to commend to the secretary of state. Far from being an example of the 'Concorde fallacy' the commission's approach to its task is aimed at testing all the arguments of the proponents for change thoroughly, including the financial arguments. Then, if change is to be made, it will be in the light of all the relevant facts. A similar approach to the development of Concorde would probably have resulted in it never having been built. What a shame that would have been] Moreover, it is at least preferable to the 'chattering classes' fallacy: the notion that officials (and leader writers) in London, often with no di-rect experience of rural life, know best what is good for the people in places like Cumberland, the Fens, Huntingdonshire and Rutland. All previous experience suggests that they do not. John Banham, chairman, Local Government Commission for England, Dolphyn Court, 10-11 Great Turnstile, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, WC1V 7JU</p>

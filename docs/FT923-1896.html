			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Irish talks hang in the balance / A look at what compromises need to be made if the process is to survive DUBLIN CASTLE, the former seat of British colonial rule in Ireland, is the venue this week of the round-table talks on Northern Ireland's political future. Not since the Irish Republic won independence in 1921 and Northern Ireland split away, giving the Protestant Unionists of Ulster a secure political majority there, have Unionists met Irish ministers on Irish ground. The symbolism was not lost on the Rev Ian Paisley, the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) leader, who last Friday announced that his delegation would not be attending the Dublin phase of the talks. He has told the British and Irish governments and the other three constitutional parties in the province that are participating that his party would return to the table once the Irish government agrees to drop its territorial claim to Northern Ireland. Mr Paisley said: 'We urge other delegations when returned from their Dublin distraction to cease their play-acting and get down to the real work of negotiating a way to the territorial claim that our people expect.' That territorial claim will probably top the agenda this week in Dublin. The DUP has thus absented itself from the discussions that are of most concern to it. The DUP intransigence has exposed a breach in the Unionist flank. The Official Unionist party (OUP) is sending a 10-strong team to Dublin, and was sharply critical of the DUP at the weekend. Mr Ken McGinnis, the principal OUP negotiator, said: 'There were certain undertakings made by all parties in this process. The OUP is not going to run away, nor will it be pushed or pulled away from those obligations.' The situation is such that signs of Unionist unity over the negotiating process are becoming more difficult to detect as clear differences emerge over tactics. Mr James Molyneaux, the OUP leader, and Mr Paisley have carefully avoided direct criticism of each other's position. Both have sought to underline the importance they attach to the amendment of Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution, which deals with the territorial claim. The leaders have chosen separate paths towards their goal. Mr Paisley's party, the traditional voice of hardline unionism, is growing more impatient with the lack of progress and its future participation in the talks process is now in serious doubt. The Ulster Unionists remain committed to the dialogue for the time being but are equally emphatic that the constitution must be amended. Mr Molyneaux told the Ulster Young Unionists' annual conference in Fermanagh at the weekend: 'We are not reluctant British citizens nor coerced British citizens but citizens by birth, history, tradition and our freely expressed will in every election held since 1918.' A statement made by Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, at the talks last Friday, and leaked in Belfast and Dublin at the weekend, has indicated signs of flexibility in Dublin. Mr Andrews said: 'We do not rule out constitutional change, including change in jurisdiction, ensuing from the present negotiations . . . if agreement on a fair and honourable accommodation (between the nationalists and unionists) were to entail any constitutional consequence in our jurisdiction, the government could approach the electorate with the hope and prospect of a positive response.' A referendum would be needed to alter the Irish constitution. Mr McGinnis said yesterday: 'The tone has modified noticeably from what we previously understood to be the Irish government's position.' That was perhaps helped by a statement last week from Mr John Bruton, the opposition Fine Gael leader in Dublin, who said the government should be prepared to yield more readily on the constitutional issue. 'An opportunity, once lost, will not be retrieved by any amount of historical hair-splitting,' he said. The DUP yesterday rejected the Irish statement, however. Mr Sammy Wilson, for the DUP, called it 'a pig in a poke'. The talks have thus arrived at what is probably their most critical phase. The first indications of compromises from all parties will have to be laid on the table this week in Dublin. If none is forthcoming, it is unlikely that this particular talks process will survive.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Overseas investment into  the Wuqing High-Technology Development Zone in this north China  port city has risen rapidly this year.    The latest figures show that in the zone there are now 116  domestic and foreign enterprises in the sectors of mechanics,  electronics, biology, textiles, new building materials and  energy resources, with a total investment of 1.7 billion yuan.  Some 69 of them are funded by firms from the United States,  Britain, France and Japan, and by Hong Kong and Taiwan  companies, with a total overseas investment of 130 million U.S.  dollars.    The Wuqing zone, one of the first high-tech development  zones  approved by the state, covers an area of 24.8 sq km. As an  important part of north China's "Silicon Valley", Wuqing is  quite different, in several ways, from other development zones  alongside the Beijing-Tianjin Expressway.    It will be built into a garden-like high-tech park, with two  lakes in the center of the zone. Around the lakes will be  villas in different styles which are well on the way to  completion.    Currently, within the zone a Japanese-funded quartz  resonator  project has gone into trial operation, with an investment of  five billion yen.    A musical instrument manufacturing and supply center, one of  the biggest in the world and financed by a Taiwan firm, is  expected to be operational in five years. It will cover an area  of 10 ha and its investment totals 28 million U.S. dollars.    To meet the demands of the fast-growing overseas investment  in the zone, the administration committee has decided to provide  another 200 million yuan to step up infrastructure construction,  including a multi-function hall, hotels, apartment houses, a  customs building and a bilingual high school.</p>

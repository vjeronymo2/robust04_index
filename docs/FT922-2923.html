			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Scots court rules out car clamping on private land MRS JANE COOK from Laxfield, Suffolk, who was forced to hand over a gold tooth as 'security' to get her car released after it was clamped in Norwich this week, may wish that she lived in Scotland. The Justiciary Appeal Court in Edinburgh yesterday ruled that private wheel clamping operations on private land north of the border were illegal. Lord Hope, the Lord Justice General, said holding cars to ransom amounted to 'extortion and theft'. Two employees of a private wheel clamping company based in Hamilton, Lanarkshire, were appealing against a decision in Hamilton Sheriff Court that they should face charges of extortion and attempted extortion. The case was brought against them after they clamped a car parked without permission in a private car park near shops in Townhead, Hamilton. The charge for releasing the car was Pounds 45. Lord Hope said he had every sympathy with those whose land was used for parking without permission, but the methods used in this case fell within the proper limits of the crime of extortion 'since the whole purpose of the wheel clamping was to obtain money as a condition of the release of the vehicle'. Lord Hope added: 'In short, it is illegal for vehicles to be held to ransom in the manner described in these charges, and those who are proved to have done so are guilty of attempted extortion or, if the levy has been paid, of the completed crime of extortion.' The judgment, which does not apply in England and Wales, was welcomed by the Automobile Association, which has been pressing for a code of conduct for private clamping companies. It described the law in England as 'very confused', adding that 'We are still waiting for a precedent.' Mr Philip Bell consultant to the Wigan-based Nationwide Parking Control, the company involved in Mrs Cook's case, said yesterday the Scottish case would not affect the position in England and Wales. Wheel clamping was the only way of protecting landowners' rights over their own land, he said. 'It is now accepted practice, however disliked or unpopular it is', he said. He added, however, that his company was in favour of a code of conduct and had been in close conversation with the AA about it in recent weeks. Private clamping companies are not allowed to put the 'Denver Boot' on cars illegally parked on the highway. The Department of Transport said the only people with authority to clamp on the highway were the Metropolitan Police. The 1991 Road Traffic Act will give local authority parking attendants power to clamp, but it has not yet come into force.</p>

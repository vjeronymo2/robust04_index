			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 2,400 mark abandoned again NERVOUSNESS in the sterling foreign exchange markets, which also inspired falls in UK government bonds, took the heart out of UK equities yesterday. The FT-SE Index finally lost a struggle to regain the 2,400 mark which had been abandoned early in the session. The focus on sterling's performance came in the wake of calls for a realignment of the European exchange rate mechanism from the boardrooms of Midland Bank and ICI. City analysts continued to take a cautious view of this week's improvement in equities which appeared to be a technical bounce in an oversold equity market rather than a definitive turn for the better. A stock market looking desperately to the corporate sector for evidence of economic improvement reacted negatively to the half-time trading report from Lloyds Bank. Shares in Lloyds Bank, which have been seen as one of the most attractive in the sector, fell sharply on the disclosure that the core UK retail banking side continues to suffer. After edging briefly higher, the market dipped sharply as sterling weakened against the D-Mark. At the day's low point, the Footsie touched 2,396.8 and although an attempt was made to rally, helped by the pound, this soon fizzled out as Wall Street made a dull start to the new trading session. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,399.6 for a net loss of 12 points on the session. This week, the opening leg of the two week equity trading account, has seen the London stock market recover by 22.4 points on the Footsie scale, or just under 1 per cent. UK equities have been helped this week by improvement in both Tokyo and New York. On the domestic front, however, economic views have remained gloomy. Mr Nicholas Knight of Nomura Research Institute, rejecting market hints that he had shifted his stance, yesterday reiterated his year-end target of Footsie 2,500, with Footsie 2,300 the target for 'becoming more interested again' in the short term. He expects the current equity rally to implode. The strategy team at Strauss Turnbull believes that the market will be doing well to stay above Footsie 2,400. However, SG Warburg Securities comments that the reported demise of the equity market appears to be somewhat exaggerated and that, for those taking a view beyond the next quarter or so, 'equities are looking outstandingly cheap.' Retail business in equities has shown welcome signs of recovery from depressed levels. However, investment uncertainty has been reflected in turnover volatility.</p>

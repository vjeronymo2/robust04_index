			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DORSEY THWARTS UPSET BID BY SAN FERNANDO, 20-10  </P> <P> It's not that the Dorsey High Dons aren't intent on defending their City  Section 4-A Division title. It's just that they need a little wake-up call.  </P> <P> One week after overcoming an eight-point halftime deficit to beat Granada  Hills, Dorsey did it to a Valley team again, scoring 14 points in the final  nine minutes to thwart a San Fernando upset bid and escape with a 20-10 victory  Friday night at Jackie Robinson Stadium.  </P> <P> After jumping to a 10-6 halftime lead, the emotionally charged Tigers (2-1)  failed to stop the City Section's second-ranked 4-A Division team with the game  on the line.  </P> <P> A 32-yard punt return by Greg Burns gave Dorsey (3-0) field position at the San  Fernando 34-yard line early in the fourth quarter. Just three plays later,  Sharmon Shah swept 16 yards for a touchdown with 9 minutes 20 seconds left to  give Dorsey its first lead.  </P> <P> Dorsey, operating without City Section 4-A Player of the Year Lamont Warren,  who was resting an injured ankle, then struck again to put the game away.  Quarterback Ronald Peebles hit Keyshawn Johnson for a 58-yard touchdown with  5:43 left to make it 20-10.  </P> <P> A late San Fernando push to the 10-yard line ended when quarterback Cruz  Trevino fumbled on fourth down with just 3:46 left.  </P> <P> In Warren's absence, Shah and Yukion Fierson combined for 121 yards in 23  carries.  </P> <P> "We didn't play well at all," Dorsey co-Coach Paul Knox said. "We were just  waiting for something to happen. We needed a big play."  </P> <P> The loss was especially tough for San Fernando, which received outstanding  games from Leonice Brown (55 yards), Will Taylor (81 yards) and LaKarlos  Townsend (36 yards). The Tigers, however, were hurt by four lost fumbles.  </P> <P> San Fernando set the first-half tone with a strong defensive stand. After  Townsend fumbled on the fourth play of the game, Dorsey took over on the San  Fernando 18-yard line. The Dons drove to a first-and-goal situation at the  seven-yard line, but the Tigers would allow no more.  </P> <P> Three consecutive rushes got Dorsey no closer than the two-yard line, and the  Dons were forced to attempt a 24-yard field goal. When Adrian Villareal's  attempt missed left, the Tiger sideline erupted and San Fernando began a long  scoring drive.  </P> <P> Utilizing their three-back backfield of Townsend, Brown and Taylor (who  combined for 106 rushing yards in the first half), the Tigers drove 80 yards in  11 plays, all on the ground. Townsend's two-yard run gave San Fernando a 7-0  lead and a clear emotional edge.  </P> <P> But Dorsey marched back, moving 59 yards in just four plays, capped by  Fierson's 29-yard touchdown sweep. But Peebles, Dorsey's holder, failed in an  attempt at a two-point run.  </P></p>

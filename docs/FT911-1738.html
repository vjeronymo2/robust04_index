			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Company News: Lurgi plans to float shares in 'green' unit LURGI, the engineering subsidiary of Germany's Metallgesellschaft group, plans to float a minority stake in its environmental company later this year to help finance clean-up operations in east and west Germany. This will mark a further step in a series of deals involving Metallgesellschaft. Recent moves have included its acquisition from Davy Corporation of the UK of Zimmer, the German industrial plant builder which now comes under Lurgi, and Daimler-Benz's acquisition of a 10 per cent stake in Metallgesellschaft. The stock market flotation of the unit, Lurgi-Umwelt-Beteiligungsgesellschaft(LUB) will be the second 'green' share issue by the group. Last year, a minority of Metallgesellschaft's recycling subsidiary, Berzelius Umwelt-Service (BUS), was floated in Frankfurt to raise DM220m (Dollars 124m) Mr Jens-Peter Schaefer, Lurgi's chief executive, said it hoped to raise a similar sum for LUB. The money would help finance initial investments in the environmental sector; these would probably be higher than at BUS, since the scope of the clean-up task on the ground was enormous.</p>

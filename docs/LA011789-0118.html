			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> COLD BIRD BLAMED IN $200,000 HOUSE FIRE  </P> <P> A chilly bird turned out to be a bigger problem than homeowner Harry Tang could  have imagined, fire investigators speculated Monday after a blaze all but  destroyed Tang's two-story home.  </P> <P> Tang's pet parrot had been chilly at night, so he bought an electric space  heater to keep the bird warm, Anaheim Fire Department investigator Mike Feeney  said.  </P> <P> But something went wrong and a fire ignited, Anaheim city spokeswoman Carolyn  Griebe said.  </P> <P> "They are not sure if it was a short because of a faulty extension cord, or if  the heater was defective," Griebe added.  </P> <P> In any case, by the time firefighters arrived at the house in the 1300 block of  Dallas Street shortly before 1 a.m. Monday, it was engulfed in flames. Tang was  hard at work in an unsuccessful effort to put out the fire with a garden hose.  </P> <P> Tang survived without injury, but it was unclear whether the parrot did. The  blaze caused $200,000 damage to the six-bedroom home.  </P> <P> The good news? Firefighters saved several thousand dollars worth of koi fish by  filling garbage cans with water and transferring them with fishing nets, Feeney  said.  </P></p>

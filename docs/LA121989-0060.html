			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURMOIL IN THE EAST BLOC;  </P> <P> RUMORS OF IMPENDING COUP AND 'DARK FORCES' MAKE PRAGUE NERVOUS;  </P> <P> CZECHOSLOVAKIA: THE COUP REPORT IS LAID TO AN 'ENTIRELY IRRESPONSIBLE CAMPAIGN'  ATTEMPTING 'TO CREATE PANIC.' STILL, SOME STRANGE THINGS ARE HAPPENING . . . .  </P> <P> For more than a week, this has been a city in celebration, but in recent days  the festivities have taken on a strong undertone of nervousness.  </P> <P> On Monday, for example, the Ministry of Defense felt compelled to issue a  nationally broadcast statement denying widespread rumors of an impending coup.  </P> <P> An "entirely irresponsible leaflet campaign," centering on the provincial city  of Brno, has talked about a coup in an attempt "to create panic," Defense  Ministry spokesman Col. Stanislav Pohorel said. "The army command strongly  dissociates itself from such actions and rejects the accusation," he added.  </P> <P> At the same time, Civic Forum opposition leader and presidential candidate  Vaclav Havel broadcast a statement warning of strange "emissaries" who have  visited military units. He urged soldiers to listen to their commanders and not  these "various messengers, whatever their motives."  </P> <P> Other rumors involve tales of mysterious car accidents, missing persons and  assaults on a young man who was allegedly accosted by three men in civilian  clothes, beaten and left on a railroad track.  </P> <P> Most of the rumors are unverifiable, but they are widely believed. Together  with the lingering scars from the brutal suppression of the 1968 reform  movement here, the rumors have had a very real effect on political  developments.  </P> <P> Involved is what Czechoslovaks refer to -- often in hushed tones -- as "temne  sily," the dark forces. And there are enough verifiable incidents to make clear  that the continued presence of "dark forces" is not just a product of fevered  imaginations.  </P> <P> Shortly after 4 a.m. Monday morning, for example, a Western newspaper  correspondent here was awakened by the sound of someone opening his hotel room  door with a key. A few minutes later, an unidentified man walked in, only to  run out when the reporter asked what he was doing. American Embassy officials  say that a U.S. diplomat here recently had the same experience.  </P> <P> "We can't prove it's the secret police, but we assume so," a diplomat said.  </P> <P> Other Western diplomats have reported returning to their homes at the end of  the day to find one or two pieces of furniture moved, just enough to make the  intrusion noticeable. Such incidents have declined somewhat in recent weeks,  but they have not disappeared.  </P> <P> Over the last four weeks, the opposition has succeeded in removing from power  the people for whose benefit the Czechoslovak police state was run. But the  state apparatus itself remains.  </P> <P> Leaders of the democracy movement concede that the new government, in office  only one week, has not yet been able to bring under control the nation's  security forces -- most importantly the Statnibezbecnost, or STB, as the secret  police here are known.  </P> <P> Student demonstrators have taken "Abolish the STB" as one of their favorite  slogans. But "we cannot push that institution too fast," cautions Jan  Carnogursky, a first deputy prime minister and the senior non-Communist member  of the government.  </P> <P> And until the STB and similar bodies are brought under the control of the law,  Carnogursky and others say, an open election campaign remains impossible.  </P> <P> As a result, Civic Forum and its allies have had to adopt undemocratic tactics  to ensure the transformation to democracy.  </P> <P> The new government, for example, was hammered out in deals worked out behind  closed doors and pushed into power by the strength of massive street  demonstrations that intimidated the old Communist regime into resigning. There  is little doubt that the government more closely reflects the popular will than  the Communists did. But there is also no claim that the government was freely  elected.  </P> <P> Today, student leaders plan to use the same pressure tactics, running special  trains to bring thousands of students here from around the country to  demonstrate in front of the Federal Assembly, the Parliament, to force deputies  to vote soon to make Havel president.  </P> <P> Opposition leaders say they have no choice, given the continued strength of the  other side. "If we adhered strictly to the forms of the constitution, we could  be wiped out," Carnogursky said in a recent conversation.  </P> <P> Civic Forum leaders, most notably Havel himself, devote considerable time in  their speeches to urging their listeners not be be afraid.  </P> <P> But fear -- or at least concern -- was a major factor in the negotiations  leading to the formation of the new government, Civic Forum officials say. A  prime worry was how to devise a way to control the police that would not lead  its forces to "mutiny."  </P> <P> The resulting compromise has left the country in a strange limbo. Carnogursky  and Prime Minister Marian Calfa oversee the Interior Ministry, but no minister  has been appointed to head that ministry, which controls the security forces.  </P> <P> Prague's main squares and hotel lobbies still are ringed with surveillance  cameras, but no one is sure whether they are still monitored.  </P> <P> State television has broadcast several reports about new restrictions being  placed on telephone tapping, but it has also shown Interior Ministry officials  defending the practice.  </P> <P> Officially, mail is no longer being opened. But in practice, Czechoslovaks who  want to send political material to relatives in the West still often ask  travelers to take the sparcels out of the country for them.  </P> <P> "We are happy," said one young Czech woman after making such a request of an  American visitor. "But we remember our past. We cannot afford to be euphoric."  </P></p>

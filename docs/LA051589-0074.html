			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: RADIO  </P> <P> Garrison Keillor, whose folksy radio program "A Prairie Home Companion" made  him a national celebrity before he left for Denmark, then the bright lights of  New York, may be heading back to Minnesota. Minnesota Public Radio, which  produced and co-owns the popular variety show with Keillor as host, said it is  discussing possible radio projects with the author, who folded "A Prairie Home  Companion" in 1987. A spokeswoman said that it is too early to tell what kind  of a show it might be or how often it would be broadcast. CLAUDIA PUIG and  ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIUMPH OF THE VISUAL THAT MAKES SENSE;  </P> <P> JOE GOODE: A SURVIVOR FROM THE END OF A TUMULTUOUS ERA  </P> <P> The universe of art is awash in words. It has become a sphere that communicates  in the accents of advertising.  </P> <P> Except Ed Moses.  </P> <P> At every turn one encounters art that is: (a) all words, like the crawling  light signs of Jenny Holzer (b) words-and-pictures like Barbara Kruger's  agitprop posters or (c) signs and images such as those of Matt Mullican. Words,  words, words. Even the prevailing critical method grows from the analysis of  words. Everybody is into verbal.  </P> <P> Except Joe Goode.  </P> <P> Once modern art was proof that vision is a language unto itself. Today pure  painting, like pure poetry, has been capsized by the prosaic. There is still  plenty of abstract art around but it most often either lapses into seductive  decoration or collapses into scholastic sterility. One is inclined to  mournfully pronounce the enterprise defunct.  </P> <P> But dead art is a comatose princess waiting for a hero to snap her out of it.  Who would have thought that the magic kiss would have come from two grizzled  L.A. princes who might be considered over the hill in some circles ? But there  they stand, Ed Moses, 63, and Joe Goode, 53, two scarred veterans from the  '60s. In two recent exhibitions, their latest works represent such astonishing  individual breakthroughs as to breathe new life into the exquisite corpse. Here  is what they have to say about their work and their times.  </P> <P> Toward the end of the '70s, Joe Goode ran into an art world acquaintance at his  dealer, Nick Wilder. He announced he was leaving Los Angeles, moving to a ranch  near Springville in the foothills of the Sierras. He was decamping, he said,  because he was, "sick of chasing fame and fortune."  </P> <P> Looking back, Goode sees himself as cynical and bitter on the eve of that old  departure. It was the end of an era. The Wilder gallery was about to fold and  the art world was in the sterile grip of Minimalism. Lingering '60s buoyancy  had pretty well flattened out.  </P> <P> "I used to find stimulation in the music but even that was gone." When he  mentions music something makes you think of Roy Orbison.  </P> <P> "There was too much going on I didn't like. The pursuit of money had become an  obsession among the artists. There was a temptation to join that. I decided to  reset my priorities."  </P> <P> He married his girlfriend, a promising young artist named Natalie Bieser, and  off they went to the idyllic outback. She has happily taken to raising horses,  he has concentrated on the essence of art making and his work has increasingly  reflected nature.  </P> <P> "It occurred to me the other day that my art has always been sort of about the  environment and now everybody is real concerned with that issue," he says  thoughtfully.  </P> <P> These days he is back in town part-time working in a Venice studio on Electric  Avenue. It's a sparse, unlovely block with three converted industrial buildings  walled behind a chain-link fence covered with tennis-court netting. Goode's  flanking neighbors are Sam Francis on one side and Ed Ruscha and Laddie Dill on  the other. Goode's place has a curious, haunted anonymity as if he has never  quite decided to either move in or move out. There's a kind of tentativeness  about Joe Goode.  </P> <P> He's still trim but the face is somewhat careworn under the same old thinning  rim of blond hair. Seems like Goode's hair has been thinning like that forever.  He is perfectly polite to a visitor from the old days but now as then he speaks  softly and seems to hold something back, something somewhere between simple  shyness and secret anger. It's easy to understand why he's sometimes called  Lonesome Joe.  </P> <P> Elusiveness has always been part of his art. It seems utterly straightforward  at first, but then it slips away. To this day his trademark works remain a set  of milk bottle paintings that first brought him to notice in the '60s. A series  of one-color canvases that lie on the floor with an attached step on which  rests an ordinary milk bottle painted the color of the rest. Commonplace, but  these works are somehow unforgettable. They exist less as objects than as  memories. One remembers them as being enveloped in an actual colored atmosphere  that is in reality, of course, not there.  </P> <P> His works do such a good job of paralleling the operation of memory that  sometimes on second viewing they seem disappointing exactly as do the objects  of real cherished memories. Revisited, our childhood homes always seem smaller  and shabbier than we remembered because we have changed them in our minds. In a  funny way Goode reminds you of Giorgio Morandi.  </P> <P> Earlier this year he unveiled a series of very large cobalt blue canvases at  the James Corcoran Gallery. They are arguably the best work he has ever done  and join Moses' new paintings in giving straight abstract art a significant  shot in the arm. Wall-size, they appear as nothing more than fields of spongy  color that nonetheless make a strong impression of combined silhouettes of  foliage, water reflections and dark azure sky. They carry emotional depths at  once mature and throbbingly romantic. The quirkiness and Pop surrealism  characteristic earlier are completely gone so the paintings feel like the  expression of a guy who has outgrown youthful eccentricities and is now simply  himself. It is amazing how many years it takes to become oneself and the  unforced profundity that comes with it.  </P> <P> He seems vaguely surprised at the impression the new paintings made, even a  trifle suspicious. He says he had no sense of making a breakthrough.  </P> <P> "I've always worked the same way. One thing just grows out of another. I'm  working on something and it suggests another problem and that becomes the next  series. It occurred to me recently that almost all my work is about looking up  and down at the same time and about looking through something to something else  . . . in and out."  </P> <P> Past work included a series where canvases were sliced with a sharp blade or  blasted with shotgun pellets. Observers found overtones of violence in them  that Goode himself does not see. He was just trying to create layers of depth.  He explains the new paintings -- the "Water" paintings.  </P> <P> "I was trying to create the feeling of being submerged under water looking up  through it to trees and sky -- not the literal image but the literal feeling.  I've always thought of myself as an abstract painter but not a non-objective  painter. I don't think you can just give the viewer a formal solution, you have  to give him something to relate to emotionally."  </P> <P> He points to some new works leaning against the wall. "These are waterfalls."  </P> <P> Tall and narrow they are nothing but scrubbed surfaces in dark blues and greens  that nonetheless convey the unmistakable impression of falling water.  </P> <P> Goode invites his visitor into living quarters off the two studio rooms. His  digs combine bedroom, living room and kitchen like a spartan bachelor  apartment. A urinal in the john gives the place an impersonal air. His bed  remains unmade and is almost humorously reminiscent of his old drawings of  beds. His images often evoke a sense of ordinary peaceful dreaming disturbed.  </P> <P> "Eighty-nine has been my best year. I have never really made much money from my  art, far less than anyone else around. I've gone as long as five years without  a sale."  </P> <P> Money, or the lack of it, seems to haunt Goode. He was born in Oklahama City in  fairly ordinary circumstances. As he describes his childhood the melancholy  paintings of Edward Hopper and drift across ones mind. His folks were Catholic  and married young. His dad, Bill Goode, was a display manager in a department  store and also a painter of conventional portraits. Joe admired him and they  often drew together but he didn't take it seriously at the time. His mother  Mary (nee Waters), ambitious and sociable, was the head salesperson in the  millinery department.  </P> <P> Joe liked his Catholic grammar school and did pretty well, being athletic and  sociable. When was 12, his parents divorced. Joe and his younger brother Dick  lived with their mother. She was so busy he became something of a latchkey kid,  cut classes constantly, signed his own report cards and composed his absence  excuses. He claims he liked the freedom of the life but it gave him a taste for  solitude.  </P> <P> By the time he reached high school he had become "the kind of kid mothers don't  want their daughters dating." He was seen as a schoolyard scrapper even though  most of his fights were in defense of his sickly brother. He developed into a  serious poker player who spent sleepless weekends playing with the boys. Later,  as a poor beginning artist in Los Angeles, he sometimes made ends meet by  betting the horses. The revered artist Robert Irwin taught him to handicap.  </P> <P> Having finished with high school (he didn't graduate), Goode faced the  inevitable youthful crisis of deciding what to do with one's life. His  childhood friend Ed Ruscha had come out to Los Angeles to study commercial art  at Chouinard Art Institute. Their buddy Jerry McMillan soon followed.  </P> <P> "I remember the night I decided. McMillan was home for Christmas vacation. We  sat talking in my car. It got colder and the windows fogged up. When we got  out, there was a foot of snow on the ground. I decided right then to go to  California."  </P> <P> He sold his '55 Ford, came West with $100 and moved into a communal apartment  with Ruscha and the gang. He enrolled at Chouinard and did odd jobs. He  operated a multigraph and along with his buddies worked lunch hours at Cassel's  Patio, a legendary hamburger joint across from Bullock's Wilshire.  </P> <P> "It was a great job. I was a waiter so I could make $30-$40 and get a free  lunch to boot."  </P> <P> It was 1959 and a peak moment at Chouinard. Irwin and Emerson Woelffer were on  the faculty. Goode's fellow students included Ruscha, Larry Bell, Llyn Foulkes,  Stephan von Huene, Ron Miyashira and Ed Bereal -- the first black artist to be  taken seriously by the white gang that would become Los Angeles ruling art  mafia.  </P> <P> Goode remembers him fondly. He had married Judy Winans, a fellow art student  and she was pregnant. They were broke and the hospital threatened to refuse to  deliver the baby unless money was forthcoming.  </P> <P> "I was so worried I just sat around fantisizing and drawing these money bags."  </P> <P> Bereal dropped over and Goode explained his dilemma. Bereal asked to borrow the  drawings.  </P> <P> "He was back in a few hours with $300. He'd sold them all in La Cienega  galleries."  </P> <P> His daughter Stephanie was safely delivered. Today she's a free-lance  art-performance film maker in Boston. The marriage, however, was shortly over.  </P> <P> "Financially they were grim times. That contributed to the divorce."  </P> <P> Irwin encouraged Goode to do his own art his own way and get out of school as  soon as possible, so by 1962 the artist was looking for a gallery. He made up a  portfolio and was flabbergasted to be accepted by the first place he tried, the  short-lived Huysman Gallery directed by Henry Hopkins.  </P> <P> A poster photo for an exhibition called "War Babies" caused a fatal flap for  the gallery. The photograph depicted black Bereal eating watermelon, Jewish  Larry Bell crunching a bagel, Asian Miyashiro with chopsticks and Catholic  Goode with a mackerel. The table was draped with an American flag. At the  height of the power of the John Birch society, it caused a scandal. The show  went on but Huysman's backers withdrew and that was that. All the hot young  artists were joining the Ferus Gallery but Goode -- showing his characteristic  streak of recalcitrance -- joined the nearby Rolf Nelson Gallery which also  introduced Judy Chicago (nee Gerowitz) and Lloyd Hamrol. Nelson's candle was  brief if brilliant. Today he is a florist in New York.  </P> <P> Goode took a studio on Western near Melrose and started building some staircase  sculpture. His beginner's luck seemed to have fizzled out. His only sale had  been a milk bottle painting for $300 and his new project seemed years from  completion since he had to do odd jobs to live. Then an unknown new dealer in  town -- Nick Wilder -- turned up offering a show. Goode agreed but said it  might take two or three years to get ready.  </P> <P> "Would it help," Wilder asked, "if I gave you $200 a month?"  </P> <P> At the time it seemed like a miracle as the practice of dealers advancing money  to artists was virtually unknown here. The move effectively launched Goode's  full-time professional career and boosted him into the heady atmosphere of the  '60s. There is a conservative streak in Goode -- maybe a vestigial scrap of  Oklahoma, maybe just temperamental caution. Whatever it is caused him to remain  less crazy and less flashy than the decade permitted. He was part of the gang  that broadened out beyond the Ferus group to include artists like Ron Davis and  Peter Alexander -- an altogether colorful bunch who stayed drunk on the decade  and an influx of cash. The good times rolled but while others changed lovers as  fast as their sequined bellbottoms, Goode had just two steady girls through the  whole thing, Julie Wheeler and Mary Agnes Donohue.  </P> <P> He traveled to Europe for the first time and later had exhibitions in England,  Germany and Italy. For a while he tooled around in a Mercedes but it didn't  last. Now there's a modest Toyota parked in the concrete yard and he can hardly  wait for the weekend so he can get back up to the ranch -- to Natalie, the  horses and a place where things grow naturally at their own pace.  </P> <P> "An artist like Jeff Koons may make a big flash today but what he's doing  doesn't leave him anywhere to grow. It probably says something about me that I  like Jasper Johns better than Rauschenberg. I like the art of the past, but I  respect it too much to copy it. For me, the two most significant artists are Da  Vinci and Duchamp. They weren't just into themselves. Da Vinci was interested  in everything. Duchamp had a perceptive vision that let him pull objects out of  life and make art of them."  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UC IRVINE TO FACE BELEAGUERED SAN JOSE  </P> <P> UC Irvine has played its best games of the season against two of its toughest  opponents -- both in the Bren Center in front of a full house.  </P> <P> The Anteaters beat UCLA in late December, 91-90, and then 16th-ranked Nevada  Las Vegas last Saturday night, 99-98.  </P> <P> Irvine has another home game at 7:30 tonight, but its opponent is not so highly  regarded at the Bruins and Rebels.  </P> <P> The Anteaters will play host to San Jose State, which has nine straight losses  -- five since 10 scholarship players walked out last month, demanding the  firing of Coach Bill Berry. The Anteaters (8-11 overall and 5-5 in the Big  West) beat the Spartans at San Jose, 71-62, before the walkout.  </P> <P> The Spartans (5-15, 1-10) have a rag-tag collection of walk-ons, track and  field athletes, and football and baseball players, who have played admirally.  They lost to Cal State Long Beach, 58-54, Saturday night.  </P> <P> "There's no pressure against Vegas because you're not supposed to win," Irvine  Coach Bill Mulligan said. "But this San Jose game scares me. This is pressure.  I know San Jose can beat us. I just hope our players know it." JOHN WEYLER  </P></p>

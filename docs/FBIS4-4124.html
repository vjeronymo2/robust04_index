			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 28 (CNA) -- Taiwan will not attend  the convention on International Trade in Endangered Species  (CITES) Animals Committee meeting in Beijing, according to the  Council of Agriculture (COA).    A COA official confirmed Thursday [28 April] that Beijing  has  rejected Taiwan's application to attend the CITES Asian regional  meeting on the grounds that Taiwan is not a CITES member.    However, local conservation groups, including the Beautiful  Taiwan Foundation and Green Consumer Foundation said they will  contact Animal Committee Chairman Robert Jenkins to lobby for  Taiwan's attendance.    A three-member civilian delegation was originally set to  represent the COA at the meeting which Beijing said is an  official meeting of CITES member countries. Taiwan is not a  CITES member.    The delegation included Professor Li Ling-ling of National  Taiwan University's Zoology Department, Professor Wang Ing of  National Normal University's Biology Department, and Professor  Chang Hsien- che of the China Medical College.    The biennial CITES Animals Committee meeting is a warm-up  for  the 1994 CITES meeting, which is scheduled to open in Florida  this November.    Both the COA and local conservation groups hope to attend  the  committee meeting since it will discuss the future direction of  international wildlife management.</p>

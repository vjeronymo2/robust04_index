			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (10): Fighting intensifies in the chip war - Martin Banks finds increased competition may lead to superior processors but reduce suppliers HAVING provided PC users with a 30-fold increase in performance coupled to a near four-fold drop in system price, there can be no doubting the significance of the semiconductor industry, and in particular its most important product, the microprocessor. Much of this development also came without the usual pressures of direct and frantic competition. For the past 10 years, and more in the PC market, there have been two main microprocessor 'camps' - Intel and Motorola - and while there has been technological rivalry between the two, they rarely competed for precisely the same markets. Intel had the IBM-compatible PC market to itself, while Motorola supplied Apple and many of the early small Unix systems. Later came the Reduced Instruction Set Computer (Risc) processors from the likes of Sun Microsystems, Mips Computers, Hewlett Packard, Motorola and IBM. As they all are pitched at the same basic market - Unix systems of all types - this has been an area of greater competition and in-fighting between the manufacturers. In the PC market, however, the past couple of years has seen competition increase radically, particularly in Intel's prime marketplace of the IBM-compatible PC. Until that time, Intel had managed to defend its technological lead by judicious use of legal protection and licencing deals for its x86 processor family. The company would licence the low-end, high-volume products to other manufacturers, while maintaining total control over the high-end products. This was until one of the licensees, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) claimed breech of an on-going licence agreement, the claimed breech preventing AMD having any rights to Intel's 386 processor. The judgement was sufficiently complex to allow both companies to claim victory, but the clear result in the marketplace was to allow AMD to produce its own version of the 386. The effect was to break Intel's stranglehold on this market, which at the time was the dominant part of Intel's processor business. It also opened the floodgates for other manufacturers to move in and offer PC producers other alternatives to Intel for supplies of 386 processors. This is an important market, for the 32-bit, Complex Instruction Set Computer (Cisc) 386 processor is, in its three prime versions, now at the heart of nearly all entry-level PCs, systems which sell worldwide by the million. It is the dominant processor type in a market where Intel alone claims to have shipped 20m processors of all types past year, holding a 58 per cent share of the Dollars 5.2bn microprocessor business. With profits last year of Dollars 818.6m, the stakes both for Intel and its rivals are high. The risks are also high. One of Intel's competitors has been a US company, Chips and Technologies, which after a year of producing its own versions of the 386 processor has decided to all but pull out of the business. It will continue to market one version, modelled on the original Intel part (known as the 386DX), but has withdrawn all bar its PC/CHIP, a single-chip implementation of a complete low-performance PC, which is aimed at the notebook and palmtop PC producers. Intel still faces strong competition, however. AMD chief executive, Mr Jerry Sanders, is claiming some 30 per cent of the 386 market, and has products in all three versions of the processor; these the standard 386DX, the cheaper 386SX with reduced memory addressing capabilities and the 386SL, which uses an internal design to effectively allow the processor to stop when not in use. Called a 'static' design, it reduces power consumption, which is advantageous in notebook and palmtop PCs. Together with the other main competitors, Cyrix and IBM, AMD is pushing 386 processor technology aggressively, producing devices that are faster and cheaper than Intel's. The latter, having already introduced the faster, more powerful 486DX as the next processor in the family line, has responded to the competition in a number of ways. It started with the launched of the 486SX version, seen by some observers as a somewhat crude marketing gambit. This is essentially a 486DX with the on-board maths co-processor disabled. The additional maths co-processor is essentially a 486DX designed not to work unless the 486SX is already present. It has subsequently launched the 486DX2, which runs internally at twice the speed of the original device, and the Overdrive, essentially a 'retail' version of the DX2 chip which can be fitted into the co-processor socket of existing 486-based PCs. This latter device has been heavily criticised by many PC makers, who suggest that with it Intel is competing with its own customers - them. The company is certainly starting to court the end user directly by trying to establish the Intel brand name with them. It is also producing complete PC motherboards and other sub-systems. It contends, however, that it will not compete directly by making its own PCs. Intel has also delayed the introduction of its next generation processor, called the P5. This is at least in part to give more time for the DX2 and Overdrive products to flourish, but when it finally appears next year, it will bring Intel into direct competition with the makers of high performance Risc processors. Its 100 Mips will, for example, equal or beat the performance of devices such as the SuperSPARC chipset at the heart of Sun Microsystems' workstations, Mips Computers R4000 device which was to be at the heart of the now defunct ACE workstation collaboration (the coming of the P5 was the main reason companies such as Compaq pulled out of the Alliance), and the PowerOpen processor due to roll out of the IBM/Apple/Motorola Alliance by the end of this year. The comparability in brute performance expected between the coming P5 and the Risc chips will inevitably weaken the dividing line between PCs and workstations, quite possibly creating a situation where the winners will be those processors which run the operating systems which users decide are best, rather than the best 'technical' design. The one outsider in this at present is Digital Equipment, which has already announced a Risc processor, called Alpha. This has a claimed performance, 200 Mips, that is far beyond anything else available. Digital aims to not only use it in its own workstations, but also offer the processor on the merchant market as direct competition to the likes of Intel. Competition in the chip market is, therefore, on the verge of becoming fierce, with the extending recession meeting rapidly advancing technology head-on. The result is likely to be far superior processors, but far fewer sources of supply.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed ZS: "European Energy Charter: Risk of </F> Failure"]    [Text] Brussels, 28 Apr (ATS) -- The 50 signatory states,  including Switzerland, to the European Energy Charter are having  a difficult time trying to put their aims into practice.  Netherlands diplomat Charles Rutten, who has been chairing the  organization since its inception, said on Thursday [28 April]  that there was a risk of failure if no agreement were reached  next month on the implementation arrangements.    A compromise text already has been submitted to the  signatory  states. Mr. Rutten has invited them to bring the negotiations  to an end at a plenary session to be held in Brussels 17-20 May  and to sign the document next summer. Unanimity is not  required. However, if the majority of the governments cannot  agree, one will have to think about giving up, Mr. Rutten noted  at a press conference.  <H5>  Practical Difficulties </H5>   The Energy Charter is meant to contribute to the economic  development and to the political stability in East Europe. This  issue has priority over national interests, the Charter's  chairman added.    The Charter's objective is to turn the energy sector into  the  driving force of East's economic transition process. Favorable  conditions for investments should allow the regions involved to  rebuild their economies and to manage their resources better,  thus improving the reliability of energy supplyies for the whole  continent.    But realizing this objective has proved to be difficult.  Negotiations have been underway for three years to establish  legally binding provisions that guarantee Western investors  access to the resources, the free transit of energy, the  protection of investments, and the repatriation of profits.    Among the signatory states are all the European countries,  the republics of the former USSR, Japan, Canada, the United  States, and Australia.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Toyo Sanso K.K. (Hidetoku Inoyama, president) has  developed a new combustion method that doubles the efficiency of  the processing of gaseous materials such as silane that are  exhausted in semiconductor production processes. Combustible  gasses and air are introduced to the waste gas from outside and  the combustion temperature raised to increase the combustion  efficiency. Recently, since silane is diluted and then exhausted  at semiconductor plants, the amount of waste gas is large, and  large combustors have become necessary. In contrast to this,  this new system is said to be appropriate for semiconductor  plants, since with it a combustor of half the size can be used  with the same volume of waste gas. Toyo Sanso has plans to  incorporate this technology into a waste gas processing system  and put it on the market in the near future.    The new combustion system developed by Toyo Sanso is  technology for setting up a three layered pipe in the combustor,  in which waste gas for processing silane, etc. flows through the  innermost part, hydrocarbons through the layer outside that and  a mixture of air and combustible gasses in the outermost layer.  The combustor has also been improved to make for a construction  that reduces heat loss. By optimally controlling the mixture  ratio of air and combustible gasses, the combustion temperature  is raised, and the combustion efficiency is improved using less  combustible gas that with conventional combustion methods. At  the same time, the problem of incomplete combustion is solved,  and combustion exhaust no longer contains harmful materials.    Silane is an easily combusted gas, but at semiconductor  plants recently, it is diluted with nitrogen and the like to a  concentration of several percent silane in order to prevent  explosions or fires. Because of this, the gas to be processed is  not easily burned, the amount large, and large combustors have  become necessary. Silane, which is a compound of silicon and  hydrogen, produces silicon oxide with combustion, and silicon  oxide powder grows in a mushroom shape at the tips of nozzles  and closes them off. With Toyo Sanso's combustion system, this  problem is solved by controlling the high-temperature combustion  so that it takes place at a distance from the nozzle.</p>

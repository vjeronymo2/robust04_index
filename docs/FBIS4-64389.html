			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 2 (AFP) -- Three members of the far-left  terrorist group Action Directe brawled with gendarmes in court  here on Monday [2 May] after a judge ordered them taken down to  the cells.    Joelle Aubron, Nathalie Menigon and Jean-March Rouillan  fought with gendarmes after Judge Yves Jacob ordered Aubron, 35,  to stop reading out a statement in which she denounced his  "arrogance" and "simpering manner" and called the trial a  "caricature of justice."    Aubron resisted attempts to expel her and was badly beaten  by  gendarmes. Three guards jumped on Action Directe leader  Rouillan, 41, who fell to the ground where he was copiously  beaten.    Menigon, 36, was abruptly removed as sympathisers in court  shouted "murderers," prompting Jacob to order them expelled.  The trial was adjourned until Tuesday.    The three are accused of the 1985 murder of General Rene  Audran, who was in charge of arms sales at the Defence Ministry  and two other attempted murders of defence-related personalities.    A fourth accused, Georges Cipriani, 44, faces the same  charges, but refused to appear at Monday's hearing. The four  are also accused of bomb attacks on the Western European Union  (WEU) and Interpol headquarters in Paris in 1984 and 1986.    A fifth person, Aseime Rouabah, 47, is accused of supplying  part of the explosives used in the Interpol attack.    Action Directe grew out of the student revolt of May 1968  and  used the same violent methods as the Red Army Faction (RAF) in  Germany and the Red Brigades in Italy.    Judge Jacob gave Aubron 15 minutes to read a three-page  joint  statement after all three said they did not intend to take part  in the trial. But the judge interrupted Aubron after seven  minutes and ordered the three expelled.    Defence lawyer Bernard Ripert denounced the "brutality and  savagery" of their treatment "although they only wanted to speak  for a quarter of an hour."    Monday's trial began last November, but was adjourned after  the accused rejected their defence lawyers.    The four were already sentenced to life imprisonment in  January 1989 for the 1986 murder of Renault president Georges  Besse. Rouillan and Cipriani are held in solitary confinement  but are allowed to meet for 30 minutes daily at exercise.  Aubron and Menigon have a softer regime.</p>

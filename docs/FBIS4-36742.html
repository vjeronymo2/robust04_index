			<p>BFN     [Text] In the Kashmir Valley, militants fired a rocket and  resorted to heavy firing last night on a building in Srinagar  which houses the transmitter of the commercial service of Radio  Kashmir. It however did not cause any damage to the transmitter.  The militants fled when security fores returned the fire.  Meanwhile, three militants and two jawans [soldiers] of  paramilitary forces were killed and 11 others injured in  separate incidents during the past 24 hours. The security  forces have sealed off the Batamaloo area in central Srinagar to  flush out militants.    Authorities in Srinagar are hopeful of securing an early  release of the two British trekkers who were kidnapped by  militants five days ago. An official spokesman said the safety  of the kidnapped persons is the first priority of the  authorities. The father of one of the kidnapped persons told  AIR [All India Radio] Srinagar correspondent that efforts are  under way for an early release of the hostages. He also  appreciated the role of the authorities in this connection.</p>

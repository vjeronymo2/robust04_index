			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> FORD OFFERS 4.9% RATE, REBATES ON 4 MODELS  </P> <P> Ford Motor Co. today fired the first round in what could be a new auto  incentives war, announcing that it is offering 4.9% financing programs on four  models, or cash rebates of around $750.  </P> <P> Ford also announced huge rebates of up to $3,000 for some 1988-model cars.  </P> <P> Ford said it is offering the 4.9% rate on 24-month loans on its 1989 Ford  Escort and Festiva small cars, Mercury Tracer subcompact and the Ford Ranger  small truck.  </P> <P> It is offering a 3.9% financing rate on Tracer models sold in California.  </P> <P> As an alternative, buyers can choose cash rebates of $300 and $400 on Festiva  models, $500 on Escort, $750 on Tracer and $500 to $750 off Ranger truck  models.  </P> <P> Ford also said it would offer big rebates on leftover 1988 cars. The largest  incentive, $3,000, is being offered on the Merkur XR4Ti model, discontinued  last year.  </P> <P> Other big rebates on last year's models include $2,000 off on 1988 Scorpio  models, $1,000 off on 1988 Ford Thunderbird Turbo Coupe and Mercury Cougar XR7,  and $600 off on other 1988 Thunderbird and Cougar models. Ford recently brought  out restyled versions of the two autos.  </P> <P> The Ford rebate and incentive offers run through March 2. Ford's previous  incentive offer was scheduled to expire Thursday.  </P> <P> Ford Vice President Robert Rewey, head of North American sales operations, said  the low-interest rate programs were prompted by concern over consumer demand.  </P> <P> "We achieved significant sales gains in our cars and trucks during 1988, and  sales continue to look good overall in the first 10 days of the new year, but  slowly climbing interest rates are causing some customer concern," Rewey said.  </P> <P> He said car buyers told Ford that they would like to have an option of cash  allowances or low-rate financing to better fit their needs.  </P></p>

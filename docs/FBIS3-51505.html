			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alma Rosa Baez from Los Pinos Presidential </F> Residence; from "Vector 21" newscast -- live relay]    [Text] Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and  reconciliation in Chiapas State, has disclosed that this  afternoon he met at Los Pinos Presidential Residence with  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and the secretaries of  government and defense. He pointed out that the government has  decided to withdraw its troops from within the communities in  Chiapas State and station them on the outskirts of the towns.  Camacho said the troops will no longer be in the towns nor will  they provide surveillance and patrols in cities or towns. The  government has also decided that the humanitarian tasks the  troops were carrying out, such as medical treatment and the  distribution of food, will gradually be transferred to the local  authorities, the Red Cross, and humanitarian organizations.    Camacho Solis said that these actions will contribute to  detente in Chiapas State, adding that the constitutional  government's goal is, above all else, to foster peace and  reconciliation in the region. Camacho Solis said that in this  way, the Mexican Republic will be strengthened.    [Begin Camacho Solis recording] With institutional strength,  with a government that favors negotiation, and with an  extraordinary consensus within civilian society in favor of  peace, Mexico is not only capable of resolving the very  difficult situation in Chiapas, and thereby avoiding the very  high costs experienced by other countries, but it is also  capable of taking new steps in favor of justice, respecting the  Indians, creating broader opportunities for political  participation, and supporting Chiapas State, as it has already  begun to do. [end recording]    Camacho Solis declined to answer questions from reporters;  he  only read the communique.    Meanwhile, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has decreed a  waiver and tax exemptions on various taxes, thereby providing  Chiapas residents with administrative facilities. Taking into  consideration that the state's economic situation is  normalizing, and in an effort to ease the people's fiscal and  administrative expenses, it has been decreed that, beginning  this month and until June, income tax payments will be waived  for taxpayers who are paid salaries, without affecting their  right to receive in cash the funds they are due as credit on  their salaries. Also exempted from tax payments are taxpayers  whose homes or establishments are in the affected areas. Also,  individuals who must file tax returns or pay federal taxes will  be able to conduct those procedures and payments by 31 July  without paying any fines whatsoever.    During the current fiscal year, there will be no charge for  the issuance of nonimmigrant permits; this will benefit bus  drivers and the operators of cargo and dump trucks at the Ciudad  Hidalgo customs post in Chiapas State.    Among the municipalities that will benefit from this decree  are Altamirano, Ocosingo, San Cristobal de las Casas, Comitan,  Las Margaritas, La Independencia, Chanal, Oxchuc, Chilon, Pueblo  Nuevo Solistahuacan, and San Juan Cancun.    This decree, which will be published in Friday's edition of  the Official Gazette, states that these actions are aimed at  restoring order and harmony in Chiapas State.    I would also like to comment that about one hour ago,  approximately 40 community representatives from Chiapas State  arrived at Los Pinos Presidential Residence. They are holding a  private meeting with President Salinas and I am waiting for them  to emerge to talk with them.</p>

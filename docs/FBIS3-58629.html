Bieber: </F> "Witnesses: State Police Official Was Guest in Villa of  Intelligence Chief Wolf"]    [Excerpt] "People will be surprised how many are involved  in the affair," an insider hinted to KURIER, suggesting a  widening of the affair surrounding the state police official  Gustav Hochenbichler. A former agent for the East is still in  office -- within the state police. "He is much more important,  has good contacts, and knows a great deal about explosive state  affairs," the insider claimed.    As reported yesterday, the 56-year-old police official, who  is seriously ill, is suspected of having worked for an eastern  intelligence service for many years. Two former Stasi members  who were interrogated by the Vienna provincial court on  Wednesday [12 January] claim that the senior police official was  a former Stasi agent.    The two men think they remember that Hochenbichler was even  received by East German intelligence chief Markus Wolf, 70, at  his villa.    The police official was confronted on Friday by the two  former agents who should recognize him in person, not only in  photographs. The court has not disclosed any information about  the result.    The suspect disappeared from public view after the court  interrogation. It was not possible to contact him at home or  with his relatives in Lower Austria.    The court believes that, as head of the Vienna state police  office, Hochenbichler passed on former German Democratic  Republic [GDR] refugee data. At the time, the Austrian state  police questioned every East German refugee who was registered  in Austria. Hochenbichler may also have been attractive for an  eastern secret service because of his activities in embassies.  The police official had numerous contacts with diplomats and  often visited foreign missions. He was also responsible for  ensuring the safety of official visitors to Vienna.    Former Stasi members mentioned a "dead letter box" through  which the contact in Vienna allegedly passed on his information.  This hiding place was reportedly located in a tube near  Hochenbichler's home. When the investigators checked the place,  they actually discovered a serviceable system of tubes that led  into the basement.    Hochenbichler denies all accusations -- just as he did two  years ago when allegations surfaced for the first time. Then,  he assured his closest aides that these were all lies. As a  result of the rumors, he was not promoted to head the Vienna  state police when that spot became vacant. [passage omitted]</p>

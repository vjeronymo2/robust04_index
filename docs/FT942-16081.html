			<p>940412 FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: France starts pre-placement of UAP shares The French government will today start the next phase of its privatisation programme by beginning the pre-placement, or marketing, of shares in Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the insurance group. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, yesterday said that the price of the issue would be announced within the next few weeks, with the timing of the share sale being determined by market conditions. The issue involves the sale of the state's 50 per cent holding in UAP, which is valued at more than FFr25bn (Dollars 4bn), and a capital increase for the company. However, institutional investors can from today place uncommitted orders for shares in UAP, France's biggest insurer. The group's employees will also be allowed to reserve shares. The economy ministry has already announced that it plans to allocate more than 11 per cent of the shares to noyaux durs, or 'hard core' shareholders.</p>

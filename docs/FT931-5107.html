			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / People: Co-heads for Salomon Salomon Brothers has replaced Bill Strong, the head of international investment banking who left unexpectedly in January, with two members of its existing London senior management. However, Charles McVeigh, 50, chairman of Salomon Brothers International, and David Jarvis, 51, managing director and head of investment banking for European financial institutions, assume responsibility solely for European investment banking, whereas the rest of international will revert to Richard Barrett and Leo Higdon who run investment banking worldwide from New York. Strong had recently been promoted from head of the European side, but Salomon says the newly created job had been tailored specifically for Strong and that he had not been doing it long enough to establish the structure. Jarvis adds that the co-head arrangement has become increasingly popular at the bank - 'that way we can be in London and out with the client at the same time'. He contends that Strong spent most of his time on 'internal organisation. He was not a client man.' McVeigh and Jarvis have known each other for 20 years and the latter says that it will not be a case of dividing up the turf as they will be 'pretty much substitutable'. McVeigh has been at Salomon since 1971, but Jarvis only joined six years ago; he had been vice chairman and chief financial officer of Norwest Corporation.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARLY SIGNS POINT TO FILLMORE AS TOP TITLE CONTENDER  </P> <P> The journey through the balanced Tri-Valley League this season could be as  entertaining as ever.  </P> <P> Bishop Diego is the early favorite to win its second consecutive league title,  but the league's six teams are expected to have their say before the final jump  shot is airborne.  </P> <P> Fillmore, especially, has looked strong in the early going.  </P> <P> "Bishop Diego is a little better than the rest of us, but several teams are  right on their heels," Fillmore Coach Jim Fauver said. "It's going to be one of  those years where you can be 0-10, 5-5, or 10-0."  </P> <P> Fauver, who came out of coaching retirement last year and gave the Flashes a  commitment only through this season, hopes his team sports the latter record.  Thus far, Fillmore is a surprising 6-1, losing only in the final of its own  tournament to Nordhoff.  </P> <P> "We've been playing pretty well, and I think it's a little surprising," Fauver  said.  </P> <P> The Flashes, who have only three players taller than 6-foot, were supposed to  be too small to be a factor in the league race. Fauver isn't comfortable with  5-10 players starting at the forward positions, but the Flashes have responded.  </P> <P> "Fillmore has become a contender," St. Bonaventure Coach Marc Groff said.  </P> <P> Rick Aguilar, a 5-10 senior forward, has scored 30 or more points twice and  Pokey Sanchez is contributing double-figure scoring. Mike Richardson,  Fillmore's only big man at 6-6, is handling the middle in place of injured 6-1  senior Mike Thompson.  </P> <P> Thompson is expected to return from an early-season ankle injury this week,  which relieves some of the rebounding woes on a team that still doesn't have a  consistent starting lineup.  </P> <P> St. Bonaventure has five returning letterman from a team that was 15-9 and lost  to eventual-state champion Santa Clara in the Southern Section 2-A Division  playoffs.  </P> <P> Groff hopes his team's traditionally strong defense carries the Seraphs into  the playoffs for the fifth consecutive year.  </P> <P> So far, the Seraphs appear to be on their way. Their defense is holding teams  to 45 points a game their balanced offensive attack is led by guards Kevin Zoll  (11 points a game) and Marvin Sagles (12). Frank Huber, a 6-5 junior, has  grabbed 10 rebounds a game.  </P> <P> Although Groff isn't pleased with his team's field-goal shooting, the  aggressive Seraph defense and deliberate offense has led them to a 3-2 record.  </P> <P> "I'm real pleased with the defense," Groff said. "But we have to start shooting  the ball better."  </P> <P> Groff hopes the basketball begins to find the bottom of the net soon, or the  Seraphs won't be able to keep up with the remaining talent in the league.  </P> <P> Bishop Diego has six letterman returning from last year's 18-6 team and is led  by Dan Wolf, a 6-3 forward who as an all-league selection as a sophomore last  year.  </P> <P> Moorpark, which is 18-63 the past four years, is off to a 5-5 start and is  perhaps the most improved team in the league. Six Musketeers are averaging 10  points or more a game.  </P> <P> "This year we've already made some great strides," first-year Moorpark Coach  Tim Bednar said. "I think we have a legitimate shot at finishing among the top  three."  </P> <P> Carpinteria lost eight players from last year's 11-14 team, including the  league's Player of the Year in Jeff Meister, but is expected to compete for a  playoff berth.  </P> <P> Oak Park, which was 8-16 last year, is led by 6-6 center Ben Feick. Feick  averaged 10 points and eight rebounds a game last year.  </P></p>

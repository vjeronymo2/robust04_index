			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In connection with the North Korean Foreign  Ministry spokesman's statement on the warning of the withdrawal  from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, a government official  today issued a commentary revealing that the government expects  the North Korean side to respond to the government's efforts to  resolve nuclear issues through dialogue under close cooperation  with the relevant countries, including the United States.    In particular, in connection with the issue concerning  Patriot missiles which was mentioned in the North Korean Foreign  Ministry spokesman's statement, the government revealed that  because Patriot missiles are purely defensive weapons, the  government's review [komto] of deploying Patriot missiles is  only one of the efforts to improve the ROK-U.S. combined  defensive posture and thus has nothing do with nuclear issues.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: IMC exercises its ICD option IMC Industries is exercising its option to subscribe for 6.95m shares at 7p in International Communication &amp; Data, the marketing services company. The move has triggered a mandatory 9 1/2 p a share offer for ICD. IMC, the USM-quoted soft drinks and leisure group, will have a 10.8 per cent stake following the exercise. The company and its supporters hold a total of 28.27 per cent as well as warrants to subscribe for a further 1.38m shares. The offer is deliberately pitched low and IMC said it did not wish to gain control of ICD.</p>

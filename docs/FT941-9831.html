			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Kent Tec merger dropped A proposed merger of Kent County Council's economic development unit and the local Training and Enterprise Council has been abandoned. Councillors, officers and Tec directors will instead set up a joint policy group to 'identify and explore opportunities for closer executive action'. The merger plan, which was strongly supported by Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel and chairman of Kent Tec, had been seen by local authorities and Tecs as an important test of how obstacles to closer partnerships between the public and private sectors could be overcome. The proposed merger would have created one strategic body responsible for writing Kent's economic development plan as well as promoting regeneration projects and inward investment. One issue involved in the collapse of talks was the question of how councillors could continue to contribute to the strategy for local economic development.</p>

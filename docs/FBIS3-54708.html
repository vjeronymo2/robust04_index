			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Decree issued by Georgian head of state Eduard </F> Shevardnadze; place and date not given: "Georgian Head of  State's Decree on Boosting Production of Small-Size Power  Engineering Projects"]    [Text] The situation in the fuel and power complex of the  Republic of Georgia being critical, large-scale development of  small-size fuel and power engineering projects like small  hydroelectric power stations, mini-works for processing coal and  elements of its concentration, installations of non-traditional  [word indistinct], and so on becomes particularly urgent because  these require comparatively small investments, secure quick  returns and, along with other measures, contribute to a quicker  breakthrough in the energy crisis.    A number of interesting developments of this sort have been  drawn up in the republic. However, so far, their implementation  has proved to be impossible. In addition, no appropriate legal  mechanisms have been created by legislative and government  enforceable enactments, that will promote and encourage private  capital and foreign investments, allotment of specific state  credits for speeding up the creation of small power engineering  installations, proper and timely reaction to propositions put  forward by foreign investors, and so on.    In order to secure a rapid and large-scale development of  the  fuel and power projects:    1. The Georgian Cabinet of Ministers, together with the  Georgian National Bank, will promptly scrutinize a project drawn  up jointly by the U.S. Association of Resource Funds and the  Georgian Association for Small-Size Power Engineering,  stipulating the allotment of a long-term credit of (?20) billion  U.S. dollars for the construction of about 200 small  hydroelectric stations and will submit a motion enforced with  appropriate guarantees.    2. Following propositions of the Georgian Academy of  Sciences, the Georgian Mining Society and the Georgian  Association for Small- Size Power Engineering will be approved:    (a) To manufacture fuel briquettes from coal, concentration  material wastes and slag, and also to equip industry with works  producing boilers and other heating devices for housing and  public utilities that will use coal as fuel.    (b) To establish two small (?hydroelectric stations) at a  Zhinvali [near Tbilisi] hydropower station reservoir and a  buffer reservoir at Hudoni [western Georgia] that will secure  the implementation of the program on the utilization of  hydropower resources.    In response to this, the Georgian National Bank will provide  the Georgian Association of Small-Size Power Engineering and  affiliated specialized firms with credits of 3.5 billion coupons  in 1994 for the period of three years, with an annual interest  rate of 2 percent for the production of coal fuel briquettes and  furnishing of industry for the production of heating devices and  installations; 18 billion coupons for the construction of  mini-hydroelectric stations, 2 billion of the total sum for  1993, and 16 billion coupons for 1994 for a period of four years  with the rate of four percent.    3. Georgian state departments Saknakhshiri [coal], Sakgazi  [gas], Saknavtobi [petroleum], and the Georgian State Concern  Navtobproduktebi [Petroleum products] will render assistance for  the development of a proper material and technical basis for  [word indistinct].    4. The Georgian Ministries of Industry, Agriculture, and  Foodstuffs Production, Trade, and Supply, as well as the State  Committee of Air Transport and the Department of Highway  Transport will render assistance to the Georgian Association of  Small-Size Power Engineering and its affiliated firms in  carrying out barter operations for importing small-size [word  indistinct] and equipment to be mounted in them.    5. The Georgian Cabinet of Ministers, together with the  Georgian National Bank, will stipulate the provision of  long-term privileged credits for the development of small-size  power engineering in 1994 and the following years, and establish  a permanent control over the management of the funds.    6. The Georgian Cabinet of Ministers, along with the  appropriate ministries and government agencies will, in two  months time, draw up and submit for approval a draft legislative  and other juridical and legal enactments, the implementation of  which would promote the development of small-size power  engineering in the republic.

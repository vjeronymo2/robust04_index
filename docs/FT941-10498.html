			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Concern grows in Tory ranks after MP's death Concern about the political consequences of the bizarre death of a Conservative MP was growing among Tory backbenchers yesterday, in spite of plans by Mr John Major to launch yet another attempt to shore up his government's authority. Party leaders sought to distance the government from the death on Monday of Mr Stephen Milligan, MP for Eastleigh, which was still being investigated by police last night. 'I think the public will take the view that this kind of tragedy could take place in any party, in any organisation, and will view it in that way,' said Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman. The circumstances of Mr Milligan's death, which were leaked by junior police officers, prompted a flood of rumours about other MPs. Mr Milligan was found on the floor of his west London house, wearing women's underwear and with a plastic bag over his head. The cause of Mr Milligan's death was unclear. A post mortem was 'inconclusive'. Scotland Yard refused to rule out murder. Shocked Tory MPs drew comfort from the reluctance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats to exploit the affair, which is regarded by the opposition parties as a personal matter. Party officials hope the opposition silence will ensure that the political impact is less damaging than other recent scandals such as the admission by Mr Tim Yeo, a junior minister, that he had fathered a child outside marriage. But some Conservatives said the response to Mr Milligan's death demonstrated the danger of the prime minister's determination to stand by his back to basics campaign for a return to traditional values. 'The back to basics campaign is too inward-looking,' said Ms Emma Nicholson, Tory MP for Devon West. 'It has become a self-destructive slogan. I think we should drop it.' Downing Street said Mr Major would use a visit to Leicester to insist that he is 'supremely confident' about the government's prospects. However, the government's difficulties intensified last night after a critical speech on Europe by Lord Tebbit, a leading Thatcherite, and an admission by Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, that the government was not totally in control of events. Asked whether he intended to mount a leadership challenge, Mr Clarke said in a radio interview that 'nobody is going to be a Conservative prime minister unless we can get the government into control and put it in a position where it has a reasonable prospect of winning the next election'. The government is expected to announce that the Eastleigh by-election will be held on May 5 to coincide with local elections. Lib Dem change on EU, Page 8 Observer, Page 21</p>

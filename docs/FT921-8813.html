			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Godfrey Bradman resigns from Rosehaugh board MR GODFREY Bradman yesterday resigned from the board of Rosehaugh, which he built into one of the UK's best-known property development companies before it plunged into severe financial difficulties at the end of the 1980s. Mr Bradman's resignation has been expected since he announced plans to step down from chairman to vice-chairman last December. At the same time, Rosehaugh announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 227m for the year to end-June and said it had breached its covenants. The company has extended its standstill agreement with its banks and is trying to renegotiate a medium-term facility, the directors said. Mr Bradman will receive slightly less than his annual salary of Pounds 100,000 as a severance payment. Mr Bradman said that following the appointment of Leonard Kingshott as chairman and the reorganisation of the board and various divisions of the group, he believed it was no longer necessary for him to continue as vice chairman and a member of the board. He said he wished the board well in guiding the company 'in what will hopefully be a new chapter in its history.' Mr Bradman is continuing as a director of London Regeneration Consortium, which is planning a development at King's Cross. He will also be available to advise Rosehaugh on other matters.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Dialogue on Human Rights Should Be </F> Conducted on an Objective and Just Basis"]    [Text] In its long article published on 8 June, China's  Society for the Study of Human Rights refuted with incontestable  data and objective analyses the criticism of China's human  rights conditions contained in the China section of the human  rights report issued by the U.S. State Department in 1993. This  has fully manifested China's open and aboveboard position on the  human rights issue.    The Society for the Study of Human Rights justly and  forcefully denounced the U.S. State Department's deliberate  distortion and unwarranted accusations regarding China's human  rights conditions, which once again proves that China has never  evaded discussion or dialogue on human rights. What China  resolutely opposes is merely the hegemonism with which one  country imposes its own views on others, interferes in others'  internal affairs, and exerts pressure on others under the  pretext of the human rights issue. The United States has  precisely given itself the mantle of an "international human  rights judge," has vested itself with the "power" to  unilaterally examine human rights conditions in other countries  and to wantonly criticize others' political, economic, social,  cultural, and judicial systems. This runs counter to the spirit  of the "UN Charter." The United States' tyrannical act, in  which "the common people are forbidden to light lamps while the  magistrates are free to burn down houses," was refuted by the  above-mentioned society on just grounds. It also clarified the  United States' slander regarding China's human rights  conditions. This is conducive to pushing forward the dialogue  on human rights issues among members of the international  community on an equal basis, conducting international  cooperation, seeking common ground while reserving differences,  and safeguarding and promoting the cause of human rights  throughout the world.    The Society for the Study of Human Rights article first laid  bare the U.S. double standard on human rights issues. For  example, the United States attacked China's punishment of  antirevolutionary criminals. In fact, China's criminal law  unequivocally defines antirevolutionary crime as actions that  jeopardize state security. Every country -- including the United  States -- has stringent laws to punish crimes that jeopardize  state security, and the punishment for such crimes is  particularly severe in the United States. As for actions  outside the law, the memory of the United States' cruel  suppression of the black human rights movement and the student  movement against the Vietnam War in the 1960's, in which troops  were sent to fire on students in their campuses, are still fresh  in people's minds. The various kinds of criminals imprisoned in  the United States far outnumber those in China on a per capita  basis, so on what basis is the United States criticizing China  for its punishment of criminals who jeopardize state security?  On what grounds can it criticize China for making  "indiscriminate arrests"? As a matter of fact, the U.S. double  standard on the above subject is aimed at interfering in and  subverting other countries under the cover of the human rights  issue. For example, "Operation Yellow Bird," with which many  Hong Kong people are familiar, was a plan to interfere in  China's internal affairs and subvert the Chinese Government.  The plan was carried out precisely under the slogan of  so-called "human rights," and the U.S. CIA had a hand in it.    In its human rights report, the U.S. State Department racked  its brain to fabricate charges on China's human rights  conditions, but they are in conflict with one another, as its  unwarranted accusations are utterly groundless. The most ironic  of all is that many of the report's accusations against China  are in precisely those areas where China has performed much  better than the United States. Take the so-called  discrimination against women in China as an example. The status  and rights of Chinese women are much better than those of  American women. The United States also describes China as a  country in which the people's lives and safety are not  protected. Last January, the east coast of the United States  and China's northern city of Harbin were both hit by  exceptionally cold weather, and the temperature in Harbin was  approximately 10 degrees Celsius lower than that in the east  coast of the United States. While nobody died from the cold  spell in Harbin, more than 130 people froze to death in  Washington D.C. alone! This fact fully shows that the human  rights conditions in the United States are not better than those  in China, and in many areas are much worse. However, just 10  days after more than 130 people died from the cold in the U.S.  capital, the United States published a human rights report  criticizing China and many other countries on their human rights  conditions. Nothing is more preposterous than this.    As long as any one takes a fair and objective stance, he  will  be able to note that China's human rights conditions are  constantly improving. New China has enabled one-fifth of the  world's population to shake off the position of having no human  rights at all and of being bullied, humiliated, and slaughtered  by foreign hegemonists at will. Since the founding of the PRC  approximately 40 years ago -- particularly after 15 years of  reform and opening up -- the Chinese people, a population of 1.2  billion, have basically resolved the problem of having adequate  food and clothing and are advancing toward a moderate level of  prosperity.    As the Chinese people are working and living in  peace and contentment, the democratic politics and the building  of the legal system in China are vigorously being strengthened,  and the positive development trend of human rights in China has  considerably promoted and contributed to the cause of human  rights in the world. Instead of looking squarely at this fact,  the United States is distorting and slandering China's human  rights conditions by piecing together information from hearsay  or from its own subjective conjecture in its human rights  report, demonstrating its complete lack of a serious, fair, and  objective attitude.    China has always maintained that, owing to the historical,  cultural, social, and national conditions in different  countries, there has never been a unified yardstick or pattern  to follow in the human rights issue, and no country should  impose its yardstick or pattern on others; still less should a  country use this as an excuse to interfere in or even subvert  other countries. Differences should be ironed out through a  dialogue which is characterized by objectivity, fairness, and  equality. Only by so doing can it contribute to world peace and  progress. For example, on the issue of Sino-U.S. trade, China  has always maintained that trade and human rights should be  separated, and the latter should not be used as a weapon to wage  a trade war or put pressure on others. China's position has won  support from various countries, leaving the United States no  alternative but to sever its link between trade and human rights  in future trade with China. The long article published by the  Society for the Study of Human Rights is, in essence, a dialogue  on the human rights issue conducted with the United States on an  equal footing and in an objective and fair attitude and  position. The United States should realize that it has no  authority to vest itself with the "power" to one-sidedly examine  and criticize other countries' human rights conditions. It is  advisable for the United States to hold human rights dialogues  with various countries, particularly the vast number of  developing countries, including China, sincerely and on an equal  footing. Otherwise, if it continues to publish its one-sided  reports examining other countries' human rights conditions year  after year, it will only evoke dissatisfaction from various  countries, the developing countries in particular, and will sink  deeper and deeper into isolation.</p>

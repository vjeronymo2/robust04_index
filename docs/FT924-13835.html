			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Engineering groups condemn ministers THE jobs shake-out in British manufacturing continued yesterday as engineering employers accused the government of 'ministerial paralysis' in failing to enact policies for lasting economic recovery. Lucas Industries, one of the UK's largest engineering groups, meanwhile announced it was shedding at least 4,000 jobs - more than half of them outside Britain - over the next three years as part of a restructuring programme. The company has already announced the closure of eight sites - none of them in the UK - and says a similar number of factories in unspecified locations are also likely to shut. Lucas's restructuring takes place against a background of depressed automotive and aerospace markets, which the company says show only faint signs of revival. Its announcement coincided with the results of a survey which showed that 500 UK manufacturing sites have closed in the past year, taking with them another 47,000 jobs. There was harsh criticism from the Engineering Employers' Federation over the government's handling of the economy. It accused the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry of not supporting manufacturing industry and failing to introduce an industrial strategy for stimulating manufacturing investment and boosting public spending on infrastructure. Mr Neil Johnson, the federation's director-general, said engineering skills were going to waste in the recession, threatening Britain's longer-term ability to compete. He said the 'vibrant core' of British engineering had not yet been dismantled but he attacked the government for having no clear vision about how to achieve economic recovery. He added: 'A policy of waiting for something to turn up is demonstrably not going to provide the sort of positive results industry has the right to expect.' The federation said the recession in engineering - which has cut total output by 13 per cent since 1989 and left more than 300,000 people unemployed - has bottomed out, six months later than first forecast. But it warned that a further 55,000 engineering jobs could still be lost in the next year. Engineering output in 1992 will have fallen, according to the federation, by more than 3 per cent on 1991. It is expected to increase by nearly 3 per cent in 1993, almost entirely because of a projected 10 per cent increase in motor vehicle output. The survey of manufacturing sites by Remploy, which provides skilled workers under contract to manufacturing companies, says factories and jobs have continued to decline as companies have pursued closures and mergers to combat the recession. London has been worst hit, followed by south-west England. Another survey painted a gloomy picture for manufacturing prospects in the north-west. Chambers of commerce in the region report a slump in confidence as new orders have continued to nosedive, wiping out the more optimistic picture reported earlier in the year.

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Alcatel still keen to gain a nuclear edge - Pierre Suard, the French group's chairman, talks to John Ridding and David Buchan The rapid rise of Alcatel-Alsthom to its position as one of France's most profitable companies has been based on its ability to forge industrial alliances and acquisitions. The merger of the telecommunications activities of Compagnie Generale d'Electricite and ITT of the US gave birth to Alcatel in 1987. Since then, milestones in the group's expansion have included a joint venture with GEC of the UK in transport and energy and the acquisition in 1990 of the telecommunications equipment operations of Fiat of Italy. Now, Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of the group, has his eyes fixed on Framatome  -the state-controlled French nuclear reactor group with interests in electrical components and computer services and annual sales of more than FFr12bn (Dollars 2.04bn). He believes the centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur is preparing to give the green light to Alcatel-Alsthom's long-held ambitions to raise its 44 per cent stake in Framatome to a majority holding. This is not the first approach from Alcatel-Alsthom. In 1990, the group briefly managed to raise its stake to 52 per cent, from 40 per cent, before the Socialist government of Mr Michel Rocard forced it to reduce its share-holding. For Mr Suard the logic is as clear now as it was then. 'We are present in all areas of power generation except nuclear,' he says. To illustrate the possible advantages of a merger he points to the case of Daya Bay in China where GEC-Alsthom is building a conventional power station and Framatome is developing a nuclear facility. According to Mr Suard, negotiations would have been simpler had the deal been struck with a single group. Framatome's electrical components and computer services operations would also fit well with Alcatel-Alsthom. If Mr Suard's wish is granted, Alcatel-Alsthom should see its competitive edge further honed. It is already sharp. Confronted by the worst economic downturn in Europe since the second world war, the group has resisted well. Net profits, says Mr Suard, are likely to be about the same this year as the FFr7.1bn recorded in 1992. In the three preceding years, profits increased by about FFr1bn annually. This resistance is partly the result of the timing of the continent's economic cycles. 'In 1991 and 1992 the Spanish market was very bad but the German market was strong,' says Mr Suard. The group's principal divisions - telecommunications, transport and energy, and electrical engineering - have also proved relatively secure. But the outlook remains difficult. Mr Suard is not yet convinced by government claims that the French economy has stabilised and will start to recover from the end of the year. 'I don't see any signs of recovery which confirm the encouraging indicators of June and July, such as a pick-up in investment activity.' According to Mr Suard, the German market remains depressed, while government procurement in Italy has been 'paralysed' by the wave of scandals and corruption investigations. The response from Alcatel-Alsthom has included a strong push in productivity. 'We have always been careful to restructure as soon as it is necessary,' says Mr Suard. But this is not easy, particularly when the group is profitable. GEC-Alsthom, for example, has recently faced a series of demonstrations as French workers protest against planned job cuts. In the face of depressed European markets and what Mr Suard perceives as damaging rigidities in the continent's labour markets, Alcatel-Alsthom has stepped up its efforts in non-European markets, in particular in east Asia. In addition to the Daya Bay power stations, GEC-Alsthom has won orders for a Dollars 2.4bn South Korean high speed train project and contracts across the region for engineering projects. East Asia accounts for about 10 per cent of sales - a proportion which could be doubled within 10 years, according to Mr Suard. If overseas markets have helped maintain profits, they also raise the stakes for Alcatel-Alsthom in the transatlantic wrangling over the Uruguay round of international trade talks. Few companies are as European as Alcatel-Alsthom, which derives three quarters of its sales from the continent. It has its financial base in the Netherlands, its management base in Paris, and its biggest telecommunications market in Germany. Any threat to free-trade between Europe, the US and east Asia could, therefore, have damaging implications. Mr Suard, however, is sanguine. 'We tend to manufacture where we sell,' he argues, discounting the impact of a failure of the trade talks. In the US, for example, the group has about 12 per cent of the market for cables. Over the border in Mexico, however, the Nafta accord is likely to mean higher tariffs for switching equipment imported from Belgium. The Alcatel chairman says he is in favour of a successful conclusion of the Uruguay round, providing it is on acceptable terms. This response reflects anxieties about the terms of the current debate. Chief among them are the lack of reciprocity in public procurement contracts  -an important source of orders for Alcatel-Alsthom - and restrictions on foreign ownership of telecommunications companies in North America. For a precocious company like Alcatel-Alsthom, such constraints are hard to bear.</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Violence plagues Kenyan transition: Over 200 are killed in Rift Valley FACE down and bent over double, the lifeless body of Mina Njogu lies in a wet field full of ferns on the fertile slopes of Chapakundi, a remote farming village in western Kenya. Falling raindrops glisten off his grey hair and beard. A rusty home-made arrow head sticks out of his neck. His head is covered in four-inch deep cuts made by axes and machetes which ended his life. Yesterday, five days after he was murdered, his body still lay uncollected, one more victim in Kenya's mounting death toll from bitter tribal violence. At least 200 people have been slaughtered in the hills and forests of Kenya's Rift Valley in the past two months in the worst explosion of ethnic conflict in the country since independence in 1963. The violence threatens the country's transition from one-party rule to multi-party democracy, coming under further strain today with the long-awaited return to Nairobi of Mr Kenneth Matiba, a leading government opponent. Supporters are expecting an enthusiastic crowd to welcome Mr Matiba, a former cabinet minister, who was arrested in 1990 and detained for nearly a year before being allowed to leave Kenya for medical treatment in London. The conflict has pitted president Daniel arap Moi's Kalenjin tribe against the Kikuyu, Kisii and Luhya tribes. Traditional rivalries have been exacerbated by high population growth and growing competition for land, and fears among the Kalenjin that they will lose out if the presidency changes hands. The main street in Chapakundi is littered with clothes, empty suitcases and home-made wooden shields. Mr Geoffrey Muturi, a Chapakundi resident, says hundreds of Kalenjin warriors, dressed only in shorts, their faces covered in warpaint, and armed with machetes and bows and arrows, first attacked the village last Saturday. In three days of fighting they killed at least 20 people, burned homes and looted shops. On Monday they forced everybody to drop their possessions on the dirt road and flee to nearby towns. Mr Muturi says the fighters also destroyed title deeds to land and identity cards which enable people to vote in elections. The same pattern of violence was repeated in the villages of Kaplamboi, Saosa, Korofa, and Olenguruone. Yesterday, all along the muddy roads leaving the areas of the clashes, hundreds of scared people, mostly Kikuyus and Kisiis, were still struggling on foot weighed down with heavy sacks stuffed full of whatever possessions they could carry on their heads. They are joining what has become an exodus of at least 20,000 people who have abandoned their homesteads and farms and fled to the makeshift camps being set up in nearby towns, mostly by the Catholic church. Last March, Kenya's Roman Catholic bishops issued a pastoral letter accusing the government of instigating the violence. Opposition leaders have claimed a pretext is being sought to declare a state of emergency and delay elections, perhaps indefinitely. Impending political change in tribal composition and the presidency has stirred deep fears. Fears are widespread of an escalation in the conflict as more lives are lost and the elections, which must be held before next February, approach. One of the greatest fears is that the clashes will spread to the multi-ethnic towns and cities. Last week, a Kalenjin man found carrying arrows was stoned to death in downtown Nairobi by an angry mob.</p>

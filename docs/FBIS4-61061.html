			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Azerbaijani Parliament Speaker Rasul Guliyev </F> by Aydyn Mekhtiyev; place and date not given: "`Azerbaijan Will  Not Be a Federal State.' Parliament Chairman Rasul Guliyev  Hopes for Moscow's Mediation in Resolving Karabakh Problem"]    [Text] [Mekhtiyev] Mr. Guliyev, during the official visit  to Moscow by your parliamentary delegation an "Agreement on  Interparliamentary Cooperation Between the Russian Federation  [RF] Federal Assembly and the Azerbaijani National Assembly" was  signed. How do you assess the prospects for cooperation between  the parliaments of Azerbaijan and the RF?    [Guliyev] We attach very great importance to relations with  the RF since we think that the RF, as the rightful heir of the  former USSR, plays a tremendous role in both the region and the  world as a whole. We regard the document we have signed as a  very important step toward developing partnership relations. We  agreed to regularly exchange information regarding the two  countries' current legislative activity and also to help  synchronize ratification processes in respect of agreements  concluded between the two countries.    [Mekhtiyev] It is known that during your delegation's talks  with the RF leadership discussion of the Karabakh problem was  one of the main topics. Did you succeed in reaching agreement  in your approaches to resolving this problem?    [Guliyev] Both sides were unanimous that it is pointless  continuing the war. As a first step it is necessary to ensure a  cease-fire in the region, then start pulling back the troops a  certain distance, and lastly completely withdraw Armenian troops  from the occupied territories. We think that these phases  should be completed within 30-40 days. Once all of the above  terms have been met discussion of the political status of  Nagorno-Karabakh can begin.    [Mekhtiyev] RF Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko  said 28 April at the final press conference that it is necessary  to acknowledge the existence of three warring parties while the  conflict is being resolved, namely Azerbaijan, Armenia, and  Nagorno-Karabakh. At the same time, official Baku is previously  known to have repeatedly stated that the conflict is directly  between Armenia and Azerbaijan....    [Guliyev] We are not opposed to Armenian representatives of  Nagorno-Karabakh taking part in the coming talks, but the  Karabakh Armenians cannot speak on behalf of the whole  population of Nagorno-Karabakh. The point is that until the  conflict began in 1988 almost 25 percent of the population of  this former autonomous oblast were Azerbaijanis. As you know,  they were all expelled. There can hardly be talk about defining  the status of this territory without taking their opinion into  consideration even though they are in exile. Azerbaijan is not  about to become a federal state. When the political status of  Nagorno-Karabakh is discussed it is necessary to proceed on the  basis of the CSCE Council of Ministers decision of 1992, which  stresses that this territory is an inalienable part of  Azerbaijan.    [Mekhtiyev] Do you not think that the CIS should defend the  sovereign rights of Azerbaijan more vigorously?    [Guliyev] At the moment, the Commonwealth is not making full  use of its potential for defending this organization's member  countries against possible aggression, and during the meeting of  the heads of state in Moscow 15 April the abnormality of the  situation where two members of the CIS are fighting among  themselves was pointed out. The Commonwealth could make  vigorous efforts to establish peace in the region. That is why,  after signing the Treaty on Collective Security, Azerbaijan  proposed an amendment whereby members of the CIS should be  protected not only from outside aggression, but also from  aggression from neighboring CIS countries and from occupied  territories.    [Mekhtiyev] During their summit in Moscow the CIS leaders  advocated the continuation of Russia's peace efforts to resolve  the conflict and urged the world community to back the Russian  plan for a peace settlement. However, reports appeared in the  press saying that the Azerbaijani leadership refuses to accept  the Russian plan for a settlement of the problem...    [Guliyev] It is inaccurate to use the word "refuse." The  Azerbaijani leadership made several remarks about the peace plan  that was proposed for discussion early this year. An updated  version of the peace plan for the settlement of the Karabakh  problem has now been taken as a base with consideration for our  remarks and suggestions. At our insistence the plan under  consideration includes a point, which makes provision for the  withdrawal of Armenian troops from the Azerbaijani cities of  Lachin and Shusha. We are indeed insisting that specific  timeframes be given for the withdrawal of the Armenian forces of  occupation from these and other occupied areas. Another way in  which this plan differs from its predecessor is the principle of  both sides' troops being pulled back. The previous plan made  provision for the symmetrical withdrawal of both warring  parties' troops, that is it was not only the Armenian side,  occupying 20 percent of our territory, that was to pull back 20  km but also the Azerbaijani side; however, fulfillment of these  terms would have jeopardized the safety of the civilian  population in the abandoned areas.    We expressed doubts as to the advisability of a symmetrical  troop withdrawal and our arguments were viewed with  understanding by the Russian leadership. The previous draft did  not give a precise indication of where the troops would be  stationed following the withdrawal, thus enabling the Armenians  to come up with their own interpretation of the accords reached.    [Mekhtiyev] Mr. Chairman, is the Russian plan not at  variance with the CSCE Minsk Group's mediatory mission? Is one  not conscious of a kind of rivalry between Russia and the CSCE  in the peace efforts to resolve the Karabakh problem?    [Guliyev] I would venture to disagree with that assessment.  The Minsk Group does not deny the role of Russia and the CIS in  resolving the problem. There is plenty of scope here to  coordinate the peace efforts made by Russia and the CSCE. I  think that the presence of international observers in the  conflict zone could play a positive role. They should monitor  any breach of the accords by the sides.</p>

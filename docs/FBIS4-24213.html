			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent John Mukhela in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] Even as the fighting in Angola has intensified, the  talks between the government and UNITA [National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola] rebels in Lusaka have continued or  some might say have dragged on. Once again there were reports  yesterday of an important agreement at the talks but once again  it seems to have been a mirage. From Lusaka, John Mukhela  telexed this report.    According to the UNITA delegation leader, Jorge Valentim, no  factual agreement has in fact been reached between his team of  negotiators and their Angolan Government counterparts, who are  led by General Francisco Eugenio. Mr. Valentim told me this  afternoon that under discussion was what is known as point 16 of  the negotiations. He said that under point 16, demands had been  tabled by UNITA to the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation  of Angola] government, urging it to give UNITA presidential and  office accommodation for its top leadership. Mr. Valentim said  the deliberations on point 16 have been taking place for the  last two weeks. Tentative agreement on point 16 was reached,  however, only yesterday. He said, however, that the government  delegation has not been categorical on whether or not it could  go along with the UNITA demands.    As of now, the government delegation said it would consider  the UNITA proposals on the understanding that only a total of  124 offices and houses would be handed over by the government to  the UNITA officials. Of these 124 offices and houses, Mr.  Valentim said two-thirds were situated right in the Angolan  capital, Luanda. He said that this was not a happy outcome and  that the current offer fell far short of what UNITA required.  It did not match UNITA's status and responsibilities, he said.  The need for office and residential accommodation was an  important part of the negotiation process because the government  had nationalized all UNITA-held property in 1975 when it  originally came to power. Valentim added: Our leaders need  proper facilities and they cannot continue indefinitely to  operate from hotel rooms.</p>

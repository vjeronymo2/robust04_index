			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Susan Oh] </F>   [Text] The clean-up of China will cost US$200 billion, most  of which must come from overseas investment according to Yu  Yuefeng, vice-president of the China Association of  Environmental Protection Industry. Mr Yu said it would cost $15  million to clean the city of Guangzhou alone.    Pollution control was beyond China's means, but investing in  the mainland's environmental protection meant having a stake in  the market for green technology to emerge in the next two to  five years, he said. The Private Sector Committee Environment  Centre estimated the global market for environmental  technologies to reach $600 billion by the turn of the century.    "We will need investments internationally and locally.  Environmental degradation is an obstacle in the market which  cannot be solved by China alone," Mr Yu said. He called on  foreign companies to help China develop its own technology to  stop environmental degradation resulting from massive industrial  development. "Chinese technology is cheap and practical, but  only for other Asian centres. We will follow a basic strategy  to use foreign investment in order to exploit the market and  export overseas," he said. Mr Yu predicted a huge market for  environmental technology, but said China's preparations depended  on costly American technology.    The most pressing concern was treatment of water and solid  waste, which would account for 70 per cent of the $200 billion.  Air pollution, for the promotion health and machine  maintenance, was also a concern. China was in desperate need of  dust-removal technology for both general and industrial use, Mr  Yu said. Machines to extract dust and sulphur were especially  needed in the southern region where manufacturing was  concentrated. China was looking to foreign companies to develop  better ways of treating water from wood and pulp plants, highly  concentrated waste water and toxic waste. "We have over 30,000  small pulp plants. Pollution is a concern, but closing them  would cause a shortage of paper products," Mr Yu said.    Ordinary mainlanders felt a strong need for environmental  protection because of worsening pollution, but a country with  per capita income below $1,000 could do little, he said. "Now  that people have bread and butter, they can worry about the  environment. There is a growing awareness and concern," he said.  Mr Yu said those countries with a per capita income of more  than $3,000 must initiate the process, and countries such as  Japan could be doing more to help.</p>

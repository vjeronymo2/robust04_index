			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> CITY DELAYS DECISION ON CLEARING CANYONS  </P> <P> The City Council has delayed for three months a decision on a controversial  Fire Department plan to prune trees and clear dried vegetation and brush in two  Corona del Mar canyons.  </P> <P> More than a dozen people showed up for Monday's public hearing, most of whom  were opposed to the weed abatement project, which could cost each homeowner  $2,000 to $8,000.  </P> <P> Many attending the meeting argued that clearing out the vegetation would  increase erosion along the sometimes steep hillsides and that the city would be  liable for any damages resulting from the work. Others complained that by  getting rid of the natural plants in the area, grasses and weeds that are less  drought-resistant would grow and the risk of fire would increase.  </P> <P> "There is no question that Buck Gully could burn, but I think if you take the  material out of there now and replace it with grasses, you're going to have a  worse situation," said Ronald Kennedy, a resident of Hazel Drive.  </P> <P> Residents along the two canyons were notified this summer that the Fire  Department considers houses along Buck Gully and Morning Canyon to be at  significant risk for fire.  </P> <P> In July, homeowners were asked to remove all dead brush, weeds, grass or trees  and to prune tree limbs and shrubbery according to Fire Department  specifications. At that time, a crew of city fire inspectors began visiting  properties in the affected areas, pointing out violations and providing  instructions at the request of residents.  </P> <P> As of last weekend, only 33 of the 167 properties along Buck Gully and Morning  Canyon had complied with the department specifications. Monday night's action  means that the remaining residents will have at least 90 days to comply, while  the city staff gathers information about possible soil erosion if the work is  completed.  </P> <P> If the weed abatement is approved by the council, city crews will be brought in  to clear the property and owners will be charged for the work on their property  tax bills.

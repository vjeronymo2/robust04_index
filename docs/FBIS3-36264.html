Von Ondarza, 60, who is to retire in April 1994, expressed  satisfaction with the results of his visit and confessed that he  had always looked at the Soviet Union and its allies through  "the gun sight." His visit has become possible due to the  political thaw in relations between the east and west, he said.    In Moscow the general met with Vladimir Semenov, commander  of  the Russian land forces, Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the  Russian General Staff, and other officials.    He welcomed Kolesnikov's words that "the General Staff of  the  Russian armed forces is studying the Partnership for Peace  programme with interest. It contains good ideas. The practical  realisation of this programme will speed up our rapprochement  with the North- Atlantic Alliance."    The NATO general said NATO is ready to provide assistance to  the peace-keeping forces of Russia and the CIS, including to  train specialists for work in areas of inter-ethnic conflicts as  observers.    Von Ondarza's visit was part of the Russia-NATO programme of  military cooperation which envisages over 50 joint projects in  1994, including senior officer and expert exchanges, joint  military manoeuvres and other events.</p>

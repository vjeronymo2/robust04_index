			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An approved cotton CMA may enter into a Form CCC-Cotton G, Cotton Cooperative Loan Agreement, with CCC that allows the CMA to obtain cotton price support through servicing agent banks that are agents of CCC. This proposed rule adds &sect;1425.4(f) to require the execution of this agreement before a CMA can participate in the cotton price support program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A CMA requesting approval to participate in the price support program on behalf of their members must comply with this regulation. However, on occasion, a CMA may not be able to fully comply with the all regulations for reasons beyond the control of the CMA, or because the CMA articles of incorporation or bylaws may require amending. This proposed rule revises &sect;1425.6(b)(2) to authorize CCC to grant conditional approval for a CMA that substantially meet all requirements of this regulation to participate in a price support program:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) When failure to comply with the regulations is determined to be beyond the control and not due to the negligence of a CMA, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) When the articles of incorporation or bylaws of a CMA do not comply with the regulations and the board of directors provide resolutions agreeing to recommend the necessary revision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws to the membership at the next membership meeting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An approved CMA may have members that are also a CMA. CMA members must also abide with the provisions of this regulation. This proposed rule revises &sect;1425.7(a) to provide that CCC approval of a CMA to participate in a price support program may be withdrawn if any member CMA does not operate in accordance with representations made in the application for approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulation provides that an approved CMA must be owned and controlled by its active members to help ensure that the CMA is operated for the benefit of its active members. Determinations of active member ownership are based on a requirement that active members must own more than 50 percent of an approved CMA allocated equity. However, the amount of equity allocated to active members must not include equity a member obtains as a result of a loan that is not repaid within a reasonable time. Because the term ``reasonable time'' may be subject to varying interpretations, this proposed rule revises &sect;1425.8(b)(2) to require that any such loans not repaid in one year shall be excluded from the amount of equity owned by active members of the CMA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule revises &sect;1425.8(e) to correct a typographical error.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On occasion, a CMA requests for approval to participate in the price support program on behalf of members and the CMA has amended its articles of incorporation or bylaws to contain the verbatim article of incorporation and bylaw provisions contained in this regulation. This proposed rule amends &sect;1425.9 to provide that approved CMA need not amend their articles of incorporation and bylaws to contain the same wording as the regulation. The articles of incorporation and bylaws must only contain provisions that comply with the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulation provides that an approved CMA may only allow elected directors to make nominations to fill officer positions. This is unduly restrictive and more CMA's are now allowing members to make nominations to fill officer positions. In addition, member nominations allow individual members a more direct role in selecting officers. This proposed rule revises &sect;1425.9(d) to allow members to make nominations to fill officer positions when the articles of incorporation or bylaws of a CMA authorize the action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulation, with one exception, prohibits voting by proxy or under a power of attorney in the affairs of an approved CMA. Because the limited prohibition of voting by proxy is also sufficient to prohibit voting under a power of attorney, the specific prohibition of voting under a power of attorney is redundant. Accordingly, this proposed rule revises &sect;1425.9(g) to remove the specific prohibition against voting under a power of attorney.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulation provides that a CMA requesting approval to participate in the price support program must have net worth that exceeds a minimum amount based on the amounts of authorized commodities handled by the CMA. The minimum calculated equity amount may exceed the amount necessary because most approved CMA's handle authorized commodities that are not included in their approval requests. For example, a CMA may request approval to participate only in the price support program for wheat and also handle corn and sorghum. The minimum net worth would be based on the volume of wheat, corn, and sorghum handled and not based solely on the volume of wheat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule revises &sect;1425.10(b)(3)(i) to provide that the minimum net worth requirement is based only on the authorized commodities for which CMA is requesting approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule also revises &sect;1425.10(b)(3)(ii) to provide the unit rates used to determine the minimum equity of a CMA requesting approval to participate in the price support programs for shorn mohair or shorn wool.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule revises &sect;1425.11(c)(3) to change the reference from &sect;1425.17 to &sect;1425.18 The regulation provides that at least 80 percent of a crop of a commodity that an approved CMA acquires for marketing must be produced by its members. However, CCC may, for a period not to exceed two years, waive such requirement for a CMA, if the CMA satisfy specific criteria. One of the criteria is that a CMA must have a plan, approved by CCC, which will ensure that the CMA is in compliance with this provision. This proposed rule revises &sect;1425.14(c) to provide that the plan must be in the CMA members' best interests. This will prevent the CMA from taking action that would be detrimental to their membership to satisfy this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amount of payments producers may receive from participation in the price support program is limited. This limitation also applies to payments (marketing gains and loan deficiency payments) that an approved CMA may receive on behalf of their member producers. Because members of an approved CMA may obtain payments as individuals through a county ASCS office and as members of an approved CMA, the CMA is responsible for ensuring that maximum statutory payment limitations are not exceeded by its members. This proposed rule adds a new &sect;1425.16 to provide that an approved CMA must monitor the payments they receive on behalf of members to ensure that the sum of such payments does not exceed the assigned amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Individual producers must maintain beneficial interest in a commodity for the commodity to remain eligible for price support. If beneficial interest is lost, the commodity is immediately ineligible for price support. This proposed rule amends the redesignated &sect;1425.17(a)(2) to provide that an approved CMA and their members must maintain continued and uninterrupted beneficial interest in all commodities included in an eligible pool. This action will allow individual producers and CMA members to more equally participate in the price support program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An approved CMA may on occasion inadvertently include ineligible commodity in their otherwise eligible pools. This may be the result of receiving incorrect information, clerical errors, or other infrequent, inadvertent actions. When this happens, it is inappropriate to determine that the whole pool is ineligible for price support. This proposed rule revises redesignated &sect;1425.17(b)(2) to provide that when CCC determines a quantity of ineligible commodity has been inadvertently included in an eligible pool, it does not make the remaining quantity of commodity in the pool ineligible for price support.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule revises redesignated &sect;1425.17(b)(1)(ii)(B) to change the reference from &sect;1425.17 to &sect;1425.18.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule revises redesignated &sect;1425.17(b)(1)(iii) to indicate that the time limit is 15 workdays and change the reference from &sect;1425.17(a) to &sect;1425.18(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

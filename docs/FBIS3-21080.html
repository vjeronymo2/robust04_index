			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by "re": "Solid-State Reactions Instead of </F> Precipitation Process"]    [Text] Frankfurt--The Cermet  Metallkeramische Werkstoffe GmbH [Cermet Materials, Ltd.]  company (Hansaring 145-147, 50670 Koln [Cologne]) reports  that, by applying knowledge from the processing of powders for  ceramic materials, it has succeeded in producing without waste  water entirely new types of catalysts having compositions and  high activities not producible thus far. The new process is  based on mechanically induced solid-state reactions between the  oxide powders instead of the joint precipitation of heavy-metal  oxides from dilute solutions, whereby highly polluted waste  water results, as well as dust when calcining.    In addition, the process presents the capability of  reactivating spent catalysts. For this purpose the catalysts are  again subjected to mechanical treatment after the organic refuse  has been separated, in the process of which it has become  apparent that fresh catalyst surfaces become available and  contaminated surfaces are to a large extent cleaned. Specimens  thus treated display activity almost equal to that of newly  produced catalysts, it is further reported.    The process, for which a patent has been applied for in the  meantime, can be translated relatively easily to the commercial  scale, because the plants required for the reaction are to a  large extent available from other applications. A production  plant having a daily capacity of a ton and more could also be  built within a short time. The production costs are much lower  than with conventional precipitation, the Cermet company  emphasizes.</p>

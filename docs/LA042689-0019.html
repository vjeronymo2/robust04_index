			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HENRY G. PARKS JR.; ENTREPRENEUR, ELECTED OFFICIAL  </P> <P> Henry G. Parks Jr., who sold real estate, beer, soda pop and even cinder blocks  before finding fame and fortune in the sausage business, died Monday of  complications of Parkinson's disease.  </P> <P> The entrepreneur, who formed what is considered the first black-owned business  to raise money by selling stock to the public, was 72. Baltimore-based Parks  Sausage makes scrapple, sausage and other meat products for sale in stores from  Massachusetts to Virginia. The company's slogan, "More Parks Sausages, Mom," is  well-known throughout the East.  </P> <P> Parks founded the company in 1951 in an abandoned dairy in Baltimore. He took  it public in 1969.  </P> <P> "That's so significant," said Raymond V. Haysbert, chairman of Parks Sausage.  "Public financing of companies is what America is all about. Underlining that  achievement is that only three or four other black firms have followed Parks  into public financing since 1969."  </P> <P> Parks Sausage was one of the largest black-owned companies in the nation when  Parks sold his interest in it in 1977 for $1.58 million.  </P> <P> Parks also served on the Baltimore City Council from 1963 through 1969 and  pushed bills opening public accommodations to blacks and easing bail  requirements for people accused of crimes.  </P> <P> "I think that I proved that black businessmen not only can be successful but  that they can be successful on the same terms as anybody else," Parks once  said.  </P></p>

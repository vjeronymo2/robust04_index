			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIS ANGER FUELED MINI-MARKET BLAZE;  </P> <P> CRIME: WITNESSES SAY A DRIVER WHO WAS REFUSED BEER PLOWED HIS CAR INTO THE  ESTABLISHMENT'S GAS PUMPS.  </P> <P> A motorist who apparently became enraged when a clerk at a Maywood mini-market  refused to sell him beer early Sunday drove his car into one of the market's  gas pumps, setting off an explosion and fire, police said.  </P> <P> A clerk and two customers ran from the fire and escaped injury, but the  gas-station portion of the Arco AM/PM market was destroyed, Maywood Police Sgt.  Steve Nagy said. The explosion, which sent flames 150 feet into the air, blew  out about six windows on nearby apartments.  </P> <P> Jehzeel Narchena, 22, was arrested on suspicion of felony vandalism; a  companion fled before officers reached the scene, Nagy said. Their car, a 1983  model, was destroyed in the fire.  </P> <P> "It looked like something out of Vietnam, like a napalm drop," said Nagy, one  of the first officers to arrive. "The whole thing went up . . . all eight pumps  exploded into one mushroom cloud.  </P> <P> "The heat was incredible. I couldn't even get close to the market to see if  anyone was injured."  </P> <P> It took 75 firefighters from Maywood and surrounding communities about 45  minutes to extinguish the blaze. Damage was estimated at $500,000.  </P> <P> Police said Narchena initially gave them several different names. He was being  held at the Maywood police station.  </P> <P> Authorities said the incident began about 5:40 a.m. when Narchena and his  passenger tried to buy beer at the market at 4700 E. Slauson Ave., but were  told that California law prohibits the sale of alcohol from 2 to 6 a.m.  </P> <P> The men argued with the clerk and, when still refused service, returned to  their car and "started driving recklessly . . . doing 'doughnuts' (looping  around the pumps) in the parking lot," Nagy said.  </P> <P> "Then he came back around and purposely rammed one pump, ran over the pump  (and) completely severed it from its base, which started spewing gasoline all  over the place.  </P> <P> "Then the car just got away from him," Nagy said.  </P> <P> The car crashed into a metal support beam at the station just as the spewing  gasoline ignited and "the whole thing went up," he said.  </P> <P> Narchena, arrested while walking from the scene, was "believed to be somewhat  intoxicated," Nagy added.  </P></p>

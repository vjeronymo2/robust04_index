(Buenos Aires CLARIN in  Spanish 23 May 94 pp 16, 17)    On 19 May, business sources reported that Germany has  implemented trade sanctions against Argentina for its delay in  paying $7 billion in interest to the Paris Club.  Argentine-German Chamber of Commerce sources indicated that the  sanctions include the suspension of German loans, which are  worth $300 million per year, to finance bilateral trade exports.  The overdue interest involves loans contracted with German  banks within the Paris Club to finance the Yacyreta  hydroelectric dam project and the Atucha nuclear power plant  project.

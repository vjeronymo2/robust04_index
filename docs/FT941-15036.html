			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Japanese investment in Europe falls Japanese industrial investment in Europe fell by nearly a quarter last year, reflecting Japan's economic troubles and the shift of fresh production to emerging Asian markets. Japanese companies spent Dollars 7.06bn (Pounds 4.7bn) on 538 investments in western Europe, Turkey and the former Soviet Union, in the year to last July. This was a 24.7 per cent fall on the previous year, says a study by the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Japan. Europe's share of overall Japanese investment has also fallen slightly, from 22.5 per cent of the total to 20.7 per cent, but the chamber forecasts that the region will remain an important production base for Japanese companies. The drop 'reflects a certain investment saturation and the current economic slump,' said the report. The chamber predicts Japanese overseas investment will recover, due to the erosion of domestic industry's competitiveness caused by the yen's continuing strength, tough regulations on local content in foreign markets, and international pressure to cut the trade surplus. Of the European total, 70.8 per cent of investments were in manufacturing industry, mainly cars, electronics and chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Only 7 per cent of overall Japanese industrial production is based offshore, against 25 per cent of US production. Britain remains Japan's favourite industrial location by a long way, with Dollars 2.95bn of investment in the survey period, followed by the Netherlands with Dollars 1.45bn, Germany with Dollars 769m and France with Dollars 456m. At the same time, the number and scale of foreign acquisitions in Japan declined last year, according to accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. Foreign groups announced only 35 acquisitions compared with 43 in 1992. Purchasers disclosed the value of 11 deals last year worth Y16bn (Pounds 96m), compared with 26 deals in 1992 worth Y62bn. Stryker Corporation's 20 per cent stake in Matsumoto Medical Instruments was the largest non-Japanese acquisition in 1993, but was worth only Y3.3bn. KPMG said the lengthy and complex nature of purchasing Japanese companies explained the absence of significant deals last year. The largest proportion of Japanese companies acquired last year were family-owned groups. Only one listed company was purchased. Of the foreign acquisitions last year, five were in the pharmaceuticals industry, five in the computer or software sectors, four in chemicals and four in industrial machinery. US companies concluded the largest number of purchases.</p>

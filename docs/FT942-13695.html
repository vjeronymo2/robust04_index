			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / UK Company News: Cattle's chairman goes with Pounds 0.4m pay-out Mr Roy Waudby, the 65 year old outgoing chairman of Cattle's, has been well-rewarded for his 40 year stint at the company. The consumer credit group revealed yesterday that he is being paid Pounds 400,000 as compensation for loss of office, on December 31. Mr Waudby, the highest paid director, also received a final salary and bonus cheque of Pounds 157,789, up 17 per cent from Pounds 135,330 in 1992. This compared with the 16 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 15.84m. According to Mr Edward Cran, managing director, the board had an understanding that the age of retirement was 65, but it appears that this was not a legal requirement. The board was unanimous that Mr Waudby should resign when he hit 65 last year, but 'he chose to hide behind his three year contract'. Fortunately for the company, Mr Arthur Milburn, a director for 20 years who recently reached the same age, agreed to resign unrewarded. Mr Cran admitted 'it was an expensive difference of opinion', but he said the 65 year limit was now written 'in tablets of stone'.</p>

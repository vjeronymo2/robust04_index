			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Business and the Law: Stop-press allegations - Robert Rice on The Independent's OFT complaint against The Times Britain's newspaper price war is hotting up. Last Friday, Newspaper Publishing, owner of the struggling Independent, formally complained to the Office of Fair Trading that News International was trying to squeeze it out of the market by cutting the price of its loss-making flagship, The Times, by 15p. Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, editor in chief of The Independent, accused The Times of predatory pricing - deliberately lowering prices to uneconomic levels in the short term with the intention of eliminating competition, and so enhancing profits in the long term. The Times rejected the allegation. The move was in the interests of the industry as a whole and had already resulted in an increase in the size of the quality broadsheet market, it said. It claimed that a similar expansion of the market had followed News International's price cut for The Sun in July, giving it a 7p advantage over its rival the Daily Mirror. The Sun's circulation has risen by 300,000 copies to 3.38m a day. But the Mirror's circulation is also increasing, rising by 63,000 during August. Although the 30p Times is only a week old, early signs are that News International may be right. The Times's circulation is up - some newspaper wholesalers say by as much as 40 per cent - but not at the expense of its rivals. Overall, the quality broadsheet market appears to have increased by about 3 per cent. Even The Independent concedes that a survey of 1,000 outlets showed its circulation had risen by 2-3 per cent, making its complaint to the OFT more puzzling. However, it is early days, and on the surface there appears to be a good case for an OFT investigation. The OFT says it will look at The Independent's submission before deciding whether or not to launch a formal investigation under the 1980 Competition Act. Sir Gordon Borrie, former director-general of fair trading and now a non-executive director of Mirror Group Newspapers, believes it should. 'I think there is a prima facie case to answer. It is difficult to see what the point is apart from trying to see off The Independent. I can't imagine them being able to demonstrate to the OFT that The Times is viable at 30p.' But Sir Gordon warned that establishing predation would be difficult. The problem is that it is difficult to decide precisely at what point desirable price competition ends and predatory pricing begins, and even harder to establish predation in any particular case. There have been several attempts to frame an economic test of when a price is predatory, the most well-known being that of the Americans Areeda and Turner. They argued that a price should be deemed predatory and therefore unlawful under US law where it was less than a company's average variable cost, and presumed lawful where it was above average variable cost - average variable cost being calculated by dividing costs that vary according to output, such as raw materials and labour, by actual output. This strict cost/price analysis poses significant problems for competition authorities in establishing a company's average variable cost. The test has also been criticised as being too narrow, some economists arguing that pricing above average variable cost can still be predatory, particularly where there is a clear intention to eliminate competition and where that is the practical result. Not all US courts have followed the Areeda/Turner test. In the UK the OFT has only carried out seven formal investigations of alleged predatory pricing since the Competition Act came into force, most recently finding two local bus companies, Southdown Motor Services and Maidstone &amp; District Motor Services, guilty of predation. The best indication as to the approach the OFT might take comes from the 1988 Becton Dickinson case, where Sir Gordon cleared Becton Dickinson, a medical equipment maker, of selling hypodermic syringes and needles at predatory prices. But in doing so, he set out three criteria for deciding whether a price was predatory. It was necessary to look at the relationship between costs and prices, the structure and characteristics of the market, and for intent on the part of the predator, he said. This test is wider than the straight cost/price analysis of the Americans. It involves consideration of a number of issues: whether the predation is likely to succeed; the strength of the predator's position in the market; its ability to sustain losses in one market by cross-subsidisation from other markets; and any barriers to market entry once the predator has restored its price to its normal level. Since then, however, there has been a change at the top of the OFT and perhaps more importantly a significant decision in Europe in the Akzo case in 1991, which might influence the OFT's approach to The Times case. The European Commission found Akzo, the Dutch company, guilty of abuse of its dominant position, but rejected the Areeda/Turner approach. The Commission said cost/price analysis was one element in deciding whether a price was predatory, but it was also important to look at whether the dominant company had a strategy of eliminating competition and what the likely effects of its conduct were. On appeal the European Court upheld the Commission's approach. The Court said that where a price was below average variable cost it would be presumed predatory, but when prices were above average variable cost but below average total cost (the total of variable and fixed costs of a company divided by actual output) the company could still be guilty of predation if the prices were fixed in the context of a strategy aimed at eliminating a competitor. The OFT is likely to face considerable difficulty in assessing costs at The Times, not least because of the complicating factor introduced by the advertising side of the business. However, Sir Gordon believes there may be a more simple obstacle to establishing predation - the difficulty of proving an intention to put The Independent out of business. 'I don't suppose there will be too many office memos lying about the place,' he says. Others agree, but also point to further difficulties. Mr Derek Ridyard, of National Economic Research Associates, says that, although it is not a legal requirement in the UK, the OFT would normally be looking for some evidence of dominance in the market. It is not obvious that News International is dominant, he says, although there might be an argument that it is using its strength in the Sunday quality market to gain an advantage in the daily market, particularly if the price cut has an indirect effect on the viability of the Independent on Sunday. Given the quantity and complexity of the issues faced by the OFT, a quick decision looks unlikely. Sir Gordon believes the OFT may wait until the effect of The Times price cut becomes clearer. If News International is right and the result of the price cut is to increase the overall size of the quality daily market, then an investigation would be superfluous. If, on the other hand, the price cut begins to eat into The Independent's sales, the damage may well have been done by the time it takes to complete an investigation.</p>

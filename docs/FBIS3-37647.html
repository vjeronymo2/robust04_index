The Lithuanian border guards were not been informed  about this train in advance.    Colonel Pranas Dragunaitis, head of the headquarters of the  state protection service, told the Baltic News Service  correspondent that the Lithuanian border guards only learned  about the military cargo after the arrival of the train at the  Kybartai post on the border with Kaliningrad region. The  armored vehicles were accompanied by armed Russian servicemen  who did not have the necessary permission issued by the  Lithuanian Ministry of Internal Affairs to transport weapons.    It was decided to allow the train to cross the border so  that  the dangerous cargo should not get stuck near Lithuania. The  border protection servicemen watched the train all the time to  ensure that the armored vehicles would not detrain on the way.    The train with the armored vehicles left the territory of  Lithuania crossing the Kena border post on the Belarusian border  without incident at 0500 on Sunday.    According to Colonel Dragunaitis, the working group for  negotiations with the CIS should reach an agreement with Russia  as soon as possible on the procedure of such transit, so that no  conflicts should arise in the future.

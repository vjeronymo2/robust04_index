			<p>BFN     [Text] The reaction of Mr. Agboyibor to the new Togolese  Government has not been slow in coming. The leader of the  Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] said today that Edem Kodjo  can no longer say that he is part of the opposition to General  Eyadema.    [Begin recording] [Agboyibor] In many of his statements, in  particular his introduction to the presentation of his  government, Mr. Edem Kodjo continues to refer to the Togolese  Union for Democracy [UTD] - CAR parliamentary majority. But it  is difficult to know whether he really believes in this  majority, because, if that were the case, he should behave  consistently. This means that, once we told him that for  clearly defined reasons our party, the CAR, cannot join his  government, he should have drawn the correct conclusion and  refrained from forming a government.    He cannot say, in spite of this refusal, well, I am forming  this government with the Rally of Togolese People [RPT]. This  act is an act of rupture with the UDT-CAR parliamentary majority.    [Unidentified Correspondent] So if Mr. Kodjo remains in the  government, he only wants to ally himself with the RPT?    [Agboyibor] We have seen this. In a government where the RPT  has more than 60 percent of the ministeries, while Kodjo has  scarcely 9 or 10 percent, it is more than partnership, it is an  alliance. [end recording]</p>

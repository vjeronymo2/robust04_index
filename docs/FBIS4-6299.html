			<p>BFN     [Text] During talks with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata in Marrakech, U.S. Vice President Gore  asked that if the United States imposes independent sanctions on  North Korea prior to the UN Security Council doing so, will  Japan cooperate with the U.S. sanctions? This was disclosed on  18 April by a diplomatic source familiar with Japan-U.S.  relations.    According to the diplomatic source, Vice President Gore  stressed to Foreign Minister Hata: "North Korea's suspected  development of nuclear weapons is a graver issue for Japanese  security than for the United States." During his talks with  Foreign Minister Hata, Vice President Gore also said that if  North Korea refuses to accept further inspections of its nuclear  facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the  United States may impose its own sanctions against North Korea;  he asked for Japan's aggressive cooperation with the U.S.  sanctions. In response, the foreign minister promised to study  if Japan should cooperate with sanctions. However, the foreign  minister refrained from giving an immediate answer, and  explained Japan's political situation by saying: "North Korea's  suspected development of nuclear weapons is high on the agenda  of consultations among the ruling coalition parties as regards  the basic policies of the new government."    At an 18 April meeting of representatives of the ruling  coalition parties to discuss the basic policies of a new  government, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] demanded a change in  the basic policy of dealing with North Korea's suspected nuclear  development on the basis of the U.S. request. The basic policy,  the contents of which were changed at Shinseito's request, says:  "Japan will act in accordance with UN policy." Says a  concerned official in Tokyo, Shinseito is believed to have  demanded a change in the basic policy after concluding Japan  would be helpless when it needs to cooperate with the United  States in enforcing the sanctions.</p>

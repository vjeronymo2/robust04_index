The United States and Russia  will be better at finding a peaceful solution than the EU's  [European Union] negotiator, Lord Owen, Bosnian Muslim Vice  President Ejup Ganic told BERLINGSKE TIDENDE.    The Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government considers the recent  Geneva peace conference chaired by EU mediator Lord David Owen  and his UN counterpart, Thorvald Stoltenberg, to be concluded.  The United States and Russian have now taken over the initiative  to find a broad peaceful solution to the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and this is giving rise to optimism in  Sarajevo. So said Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic in an  interview with BERLINGSKE TIDENDE.    Ejup Ganic is chiefly happy that Lord Owen is no longer at  the center of the negotiations. The Bosnian Government has  tried several times in vain to have Lord Owen, whom they accuse  of being responsible for the deterioration in the situation of  the country's Muslims, removed.    Lord Owen's biggest mistake, Ejup Ganic said, is that from  the start he has accepted that the Bosnian Serbs should have  territorial gains from their military conquests.    It has not been possible anywhere in the world to create a  stable peace by rewarding the aggressor. Why should Bosnia be  an exception? said the vice president, who takes the view that  the EU-UN negotiations in Geneva were set up for academic  reasons.    "Lord Owen has made a mess of everything by not having a  clear agenda," said Ejup Ganic, who unlike several Bosnian  Muslim leaders does not fear that Russia's active role both  diplomatically and through the deployment of Russian soldiers in  the Bosnian Serb-controlled areas could freeze the current  military frontiers.    "Of course there is a strange feeling around. I grew up with  news reports that now Russia has invaded Hungary, now they have  invaded Czechoslovakia, and now Afghanistan. Every time Russia  has come into the picture we have been used to seeing them as an  invading power. But now they are here under the UN umbrella and  under General Rose's command which will try to mix them with  soldiers from other countries. When the Russian soldiers  arrived, there were quite a few who did not behave particularly  well (by celebrating with the Serbs -- editorial note). But I  am satisfied with the official Russian statements.    "We could have refused the Russian soldiers access for the  same reason that the United Nations rejected offers from Turkey,  Pakistan, and Iran, because those countries would have taken  sides in the war. But we accept the Russian soldiers who will  perhaps support that element in Russian diplomacy which is  trying to wrest the initiative away from Vladimir Zhirnovskiy's  wing in Russia," Ejup Ganic said.    Ejup Ganic is happy about the past week's cease-fire in  Sarajevo, but gave me constant reminders that the capital is  still besieged and divided militarily.    "The killing of civilians has been drastically reduced  because the artillery and the tanks in the mountains were used  primarily to kill civilians. Our fronts are only 50 meters from  each other and therefore the Serbs' artillery has not been  particularly effective against our infantry, but it has been  effective against the civilian population. That is why we are  now seeing a clear reduction in the bombardment. But the city  is still under siege and all the other conditions are still the  same. In the next few days we will see what further steps we  can take to break the siege and turn Sarajevo into an open city."    Vice President Ganic, who earlier in the war was viewed as  one of the most pessimistic and uncompromising figures in the  Bosnian Muslim leadership, views the events of recent weeks in  Sarajevo as a turning point in the war.    "This has had a decisive psychological effect on the Serbian  regime. They hade become absolutely certain that concrete steps  would not be taken against them by the international community.  They were 100 percent sure that the jets flying over them were  only a show. For eight days they ignored NATO's ultimatum. But  now I believe that they know that they have to negotiate. They  are still trying to create confusion, but they did nevertheless  move out of the mountains," Ejup Ganic said.    However, the Bosnian Muslims' optimism is still guarded and  contains a large portion of bitterness toward the international  community. When Ganic, as NATO's jets thunder through the air  above Sarajevo's presidential palace, began to discuss the  background, he tried to overcome the noise with his own  thunderous words:    "NATO only needed to produce a single piece of paper which  contained an ultimatum to the besieging Serbs to withdraw their  heavy arms from the mountains around Sarajevo. If they had  produced this little piece of typewritten paper earlier we would  not today have 1,000 new graves in Sarajevo.    "The lesson for NATO and the United Nations is that they  must  stop writing all these declarations which no one understands.  Make public something that is crystal clear. Something that  has a clearly defined beginning and end. Something that has a  clear deadline and a description of concrete actions which will  be set in motion at a specified time and with specified means.  Past declarations have been watered-down nonsense," said Ejup  Ganic, who despite all the war's murders and destruction still  believes that there is a possibility of creating a multiethnic  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "We must begin from within and try to recreate what we had.  In the area controlled by Karadzic's forces 50 percent of Serbs  have also fled. No one is asking them what sort of Bosnia they  want. They are Bosnians. They will not suddenly be able to feel  themselves to be something else. People from all groups in the  population are in Croatia, Serbia, or in Western Europe. They  have now gotten to know what a refugee's existence means. One  day they will wake up and think about the blessings they had in  Bosnia, and they will travel home and help in the rebuilding of  their homeland. A partition of the country is unnatural. We  have to heal ourselves after this tragedy. First people will  have to learn to greet each other again. A year later they will  perhaps be able to drink coffee together and the younger  generation will be able to play sports together.    "The key point for the recreation of the multiethnic Bosnia  is that those who are guilty of war crimes are punished. When  this happens everyone who has lost a son or a daughter will be  able to see who the guilty ones are, who gave the orders, and  who carried them out. Those left behind will then perhaps be  able to feel some relief," the Bosnian vice president said.</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DUSTING OFF OLD FAIRFAX;  </P> <P> NEW BOOK OFFERS A BACKGROUND OF OIL FIELDS AND AIRFIELDS FOR THE LOS ANGELES  DISTRICT, WHICH HAS MUSHROOMED INTO THE LARGEST OF JEWISH NEIGHBORHOODS WEST OF  CHICAGO  </P> <P> Think of the Fairfax District -- small shops selling pickles and salami, old  folks on bus benches taking in the sun, neat little houses and crowded  apartments -- and it seems as if it has been there forever.  </P> <P> But it hasn't. Less than a lifetime ago, there were little more than bean  fields, oil fields and airfields in the wide open spaces that became the center  of Jewish life in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> And, "in the '60s there was a large exodus out of there . . . it was a little  bit seedy," said Lynn C. Kronzek, whose book, "Fairfax . . . A Home, A  Community, A Way of Life," was published this fall by the Jewish Historical  Society of Southern California. In her research for the book, Kronzek dug up  some little-known history of the early years.  </P> <P> Because of the many changes in the neighborhood, she found few residents who  have been around since the early days, she said.  </P> <P> Among the reminders of the older days that remain are a couple of Irish bars  and the 56-year-old Farmers Market, whose owner, A. F. Gilmore Co., has held  the land since 1880 and remains one of the area's largest landowners.  </P> <P> Kronzek said that most people used to think of history as the doings of kings  and presidents and conquering armies, so hardly anyone bothered to save the  records or memorabilia of everyday life.  </P> <P> So the author, who holds a degree in history, relied mostly on archival sources  like the municipal files preserved in an annex near Los Angeles City Hall.  </P> <P> There, in a storeroom where researchers wear bibs or full-length aprons to ward  off the orange dust of old records, she found the May 27, 1924, petition in  which 15 residents asked that the largely empty space on the map known as  Sherman, Calif., and RFD (rural free delivery route) No. 10 be annexed to the  city of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Under the rules in force at the time, the petition had to be signed by at least  one quarter of the population in the area.  </P> <P> After 14 residents voted in favor and none opposed, the area was included as  the Fairfax Addition, a name apparently taken in honor of the Colonial Virginia  family whose coat of arms inspired the emblem of Fairfax High School.  </P> <P> The names of the time -- Ward, Hole, Hackaday, Lee, Newman, Coak, Lightfoot --  gave no sign that Fairfax was to become a center of ethnic life, the largest  Jewish neighborhood west of Chicago, she said.  </P> <P> With the opening of the high school in 1924, the construction of new  developments and the eventual establishment of the Miracle Mile as an upscale  shopping district, the population began to grow.  </P> <P> But vast tracts along Wilshire Boulevard stayed empty for years. So empty that  some parcels were used for airfields.  </P> <P> "One could purchase a flight in a World War I Jenny, if you had the courage,"  one old-timer recalled in the book, which includes a picture of airplanes  parked on the site of what is now the May Co. store at the corner of Wilshire  Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue.  </P> <P> Most Los Angeles Jews lived then on the Eastside, in the neighborhoods of Boyle  Heights and City Terrace.  </P> <P> But the Fairfax District offered newer, bigger, more comfortable houses, and  the Jewish population started moving west, said Kronzek. She used census data  to track the population shifts.  </P> <P> A handful of religious groups were already meeting in private homes when the  Etz Jacob congregation built the area's first synagogue in 1932, she said.  </P> <P> During World War II, thousands of servicemen from the East Coast were exposed  to the warm weather and other charms of Southern California. Some eventually  moved here, and by the late 1940s, Fairfax was well-established as a  neighborhood of single-family homes, affordable apartments, synagogues and  social and political organizations.  </P> <P> "Really, its heyday was the '50s," Kronzek said. "There was a balance of  affluence and Jewish culture. But in the '60s a lot of affluent people moved  out, and Fairfax had to deal with a lot more social issues. Now it's coming  back and getting very developed."  </P> <P> As for the future, with a large-scale commercial development now proposed for  the Gilmore Co.'s Farmers Market property, and the owners of the Park Labrea  apartment complex eager to build office buildings and more rental housing,  "It's hard to even imagine what it's going to be like," she said.  </P> <P> A former Fairfax resident, Kronzek said she got interested in local history  when she and her husband rented a garden apartment at Park Labrea after moving  from the Washington, D.C., suburbs.  </P> <P> A chance conversation with an official of the Jewish Historical Society led to  the commission to write the book.  </P> <P> "It was a labor of love, but I lived there and it was interesting and it helps  you get in touch with your own background," she said.  </P> <P> Also, as a former editor of history books, "It was fun to get a crack at it on  my own," she said.  </P> <P> The couple has since moved on to Playa del Rey, where they found quieter  streets and ocean air.  </P> <P> Kronzek also found work as a consultant to nonprofit organizations. The Fairfax  project netted her only a modest fee.  </P> <P> "It was not a full-time project, but it was all-consuming, and when it was done  I made real money again," she said.  </P> <P> Stephen S. Sass, president of the Jewish Historical Society, said the 112-page  Fairfax booklet, although marred by some typos and fuzzy photographs, is  notable because it is probably the first history of a Jewish neighborhood in  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "Nothing's been done yet on Boyle Heights or West Adams or any other areas of  Jewish settlement," he said.  </P> <P> The society now plans to collect oral histories from former residents of those  areas, he said.  </P> <P> "We have to move fast, because those memories are dimming or, unfortunately,  passing away," he said. "At least on Fairfax we have something (left) to  celebrate."  </P> <P> The booklet can be purchased at the Jewish Historical Society offices at 6399  Wilshire Blvd., Suite 502, for $11.95 or by mail for $13.95.  </P></p>

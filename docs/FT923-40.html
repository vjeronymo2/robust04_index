			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (5): Figures point to new pressures - Workstations THE workstations is still one of the big-selling product families of the computer industry, generating good revenues for the suppliers in spite of the recession. But competition in the workstation marketplace is becoming as fierce as that of the the PC. Sun Microsystems, generally accepted as the market leader, has seen its annual revenues grow from Dollars 3.2bn in 1991 to Dollars 3.6bn in the financial year that ended in June, while watching profits dip from Dollars 190.3m last year to Dollars 173.3m. At the same time, the number of units shipped reached record levels. - 56,000 during the company's last quarter. These figures points to increasing price competition in the workstation marketplace, although Sun's President and CEO, Mr Scott McNealy, stresses instead a high spend on research and development as the cause of the profit decline. The pressure on pricing and market development and growth is definitely on, however. In the US, IBM has started a mail order service for its RS/6000 product family. In practice, this approach is aimed mainly at selling add-on products such as expansion memory and extra disk capacity to existing users. However, although the company does not expect many customers to buy complete systems 'off the page', the fact that this is possible demonstrates the way the workstation market has changed over the past year. Hewlett Packard is also expanding its routes to market. It is adopting the technique already perfected by Sun and Mips Computers of licencing third party manufacturers. In HP's case, its latest agreement is with Korean-based Samsung, which is to start by selling a re-badged version of HP's Model 700 workstation. Samsung's semiconductor division is, however, already working on producing its own version of the system's Risc processor, and workstations of its own design are bound to follow. Unix-based workstations are finding their level in the overall spectrum of computing. They are still the best solution to a number of different tasks, especially those such as computer-aided design where high resolution graphics and the ability to run a number of different applications on a desktop system are important. In most situations where these capabilities are required there is also a need to network several workstations together. To do this, the same hardware architectures of the leading workstations are now important in the role of network file servers and network management. Here, the capabilities of Unix to run multi-tasked applications within a virtual memory environment - while fully exploiting the power of the processors - is proving an important lever for many users, particularly in the financial community. One of the biggest developments in the workstation marketplace, however, is in the user interface to the system. The Unix operating system used in workstations is, to the uninitiated, complex to use. Over the past year, however, this complexity has largely been eradicated by the widespread adoption of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) as the standard working environment. This means that anyone with some experience of using either an Apple Macintosh or a PC-compatible with Windows 3, is now equally experienced at using a Unix workstation. There are two main contenders for the title of 'standard' GUI for this market. One, Open Look, has Sun Microsystems as its prime supporter. The company ships this GUI with every workstation it sells, making it numerically the dominant system. The Open Look GUI is a Sun development, and is promoted by Unix International (UI), the Unix industry grouping of which Sun is an important member. Open Look is, however, only prevalent on Sun systems and on those from companies that use the Sun-developed Sparc Risc processor and associated operating systems, SunOS or Solaris. The GUI that is proving the most popular with manufacturers is Motif, promoted by the rival industry grouping to UI, the Open Software Foundation (OSF). The most popular implementation of the OSF-Motif style guide comes from Cambridge-based IXI. Its X Desktop system has been licensed by most workstation suppliers, including IBM, Bull, NCR, Data General, ICL, Unisys and Olivetti. Not only is there increasing price competition in the workstation market for the dominant suppliers, Sun Microsystems, IBM and Hewlett-Packard, there is also growing competition on the technology front. Digital Equipment, in particular, has started to ship the first workstations built around its new Alpha Chip processor which, at an operating speed of 200 Million Instructions Per Second (Mips), is the fastest processor available in this market. The performance of the Intel-based PC is also rising sharply. The company is now scheduled to introduce its next processor, known as the P5, early in the new year and this will produce PCs capable of running at up to 100 Mips. This will be fast enough to cope with many of the applications for which a workstation is currently the only practical solution. Also needed, is an operating system that can exploit such potential power. Microsoft's combination for Intel-based PCs, MS-DOS and Windows, does not offer sufficient functionality, particularly in multi-tasking, and users have the choice of either OS/2 from IBM, or one of the PC-based implementations of Unix. Microsoft hopes to rectify this next year when 'industry-strength' versions of its new operating system, NT, are launched. The combination of P5-based PCs and the NT operating system could at last see the PC challenging workstations in terms of functionality and performance. If this happens, current workstation suppliers could be in for a difficult time.</p>

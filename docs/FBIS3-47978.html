The message reads:    Dear comrade minister; on the occasion of the 45th founding  anniversary of the LPA, on behalf of all cadres and combatants  of the Vietnam People's Army and on my behalf, I would like to  convey to you, and through you to all the cadres and combatants  of the fraternal LPA, my most sincere greetings of solidarity.    Throughout the last 45 years, under the leadership of the  Lao  People's Revolutionary Party [LPRP], the LPA and the multiethnic  Lao people have bravely advanced through all difficulties and  obstacles, continously defeated all the invading imperialists as  well as the domestic reactionaries, achieved glorious victories,  and restored independence and freedom to the fatherland.    After the complete liberation of the country, the Lao armed  forces still went on to crush all the dark schemes and sabotage  activities of the enemies. In the past 20 year, the Lao  People's Democratic Republic have recorded important  achievements in all areas of national security, politics, and  external relations, and in the socioeconomic domain. Domestic  stability is constantly improving, the country's status on the  international stage is being heightened, thus contributing to  the protection of peace and stability in Southeast Asia as well  as in the world.    We are happy for your achievements, and strongly trust that  the Lao people and the LPA will continue to record ever greater  achievements, successfully implement the resolution of the Fifth  Congress of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, and build a  peaceful, independent, unified, and prosperous Laos.    Also on this occasion, on behalf of the Vietnam People's  Army, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the LPRP,  the government, the people, and the LPA, for the fine sentiments  and valuable assistance they had given to the Vietnamese people  and the people's army during the past revolution as well as in  the present rennovation undertaking.    May the special friendly solidarity and the comprehensive  cooperation between the two peoples and the two armies of  Vietnam and Laos be evermore solidified and developed. I wish  you, comrade minister, good health and happiness in your life,  and more achievements in fulfilling your noble duties.    My solemn salute to you, dear comrade.</p>

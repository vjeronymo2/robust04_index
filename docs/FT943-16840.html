			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Japan's PM attempts to ease anxiety Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's new Socialist prime minister, yesterday attempted to win confidence in his much-criticised government by pledging to pursue moderate conservative policies. He acknowledged that there was anxiety over his appointment and pledged to 'make further efforts to make my cabinet more trustworthy and reliable'. The three-party alliance of the conservative Liberal Democratic party with its traditional enemy the Social Democratic party, plus the New Harbinger party, an LDP splinter group, has achieved instant unpopularity after seizing power in a parliamentary coup on Wednesday. Only 33 per cent of the electorate supports the new government, according to a poll yesterday by the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper. The figure rose to 40 per cent in a survey conducted by Television Tokyo. In his first public address since taking office, Mr Murayama outlined polices roughly in line with those of the dominant coalition partner, the conservative LDP. He promised to extend the current one-year income tax cut, in an attempt to boost domestic demand, and said the government would try to reach a conclusion by the end of the year on how to finance a tax reduction. Finance Ministry plans for a law by the end of the year to increase sales tax would be delayed for many months, a government official said. The government will press on with plans to reform the political and electoral system and will hold the next general election under the new rules, rather than the old ones, the prime minister said. On foreign relations, Mr Murayama pledged broadly to continue the diplomatic policies of the previous government. He reassured US President Bill Clinton by telephone yesterday that Japan would abide by the US-Japan security treaty, under which US troops are stationed on Japanese soil. The pacifist SDP has long advocated scrapping the treaty. Mr Murayama shared the previous government's caution over North Korea's nuclear ambitions by saying Japan would continue to seek a solution through dialogue, rather than economic sanctions. However, he toned down the previous government's attempts to step up Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. 'I don't believe Japan should actively manoeuvre,' for the post, he said. Japan would, however, continue to help with UN peacekeeping duties within the limits of its pacifist constitution. That is a change from official SDP reluctance to accept Japan's constitutional right to have armed forces, another indication of the concessions the party has made to share government with the LDP.

			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> VISTA;  </P> <P> JURY TRIAL WAIVED  </P> <P> A man accused of murdering his ex-wife after she won $727,000 in the California  Lottery has waived a jury trial and will allow a judge to decide the case.  David Scott Harrison, 33, who already has been sentenced in federal court for a  car bombing, arson and an insurance fraud scheme, is charged in the  strangulation of Anne Jenkins, whose body was found in her San Marcos home in  February, 1988. Prosecutors say that Harrison killed his ex-wife after he  realized that with the state lottery winnings she could better finance her  court battle against Harrison over child custody and visitation.  </P></p>

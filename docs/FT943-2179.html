			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Mirror's raid nets 15% stake in Scottish Television The Mirror Group, publisher of the Daily Mirror, yesterday launched a raid on Scottish Television, spending Pounds 37.4m on a 14.9 per cent stake. The move is the strongest evidence so far of the determination of Mr David Montgomery, Mirror Group chief executive, to diversify from popular newspapers into television. The stake, which will make Mirror Group the largest individual shareholder in STV, has been bought through its Scottish newspaper subsidiary, the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail, to emphasise the Mirror's Scottish credentials. The raid does not appear to presage a further attack on the independent Scottish channel even if UK TV ownership rules, which prevent a newspaper group owning more than 20 per cent of an ITV company, are lifted. Share prices of ITV companies not yet swallowed by larger predators received a boost from the purchase, however. Yorkshire-Tyne Tees rose 29p to 392p yesterday, neighbouring Grampian was up 29p to 354p and Ulster improved 37p to 720p. HTV, however, fell by 1p to 164p, probably on the assumption that the 20 per cent stake bought by Flextech this year will help to block takeover attempts. The Mirror Group bought 7.2m shares at 520p compared with the closing price of STV shares on Monday of 443p. The main sellers are believed to have been the financial institutions, Fidelity of the US, PDFM and Mercury Asset Management. Mr Murdoch MacLennan, chief executive of the Scottish Daily Record, yesterday emphasised the opportunities for co-operation. 'We do not believe it is necessary for the two companies to come under common control for these benefits to be achieved.' Scottish Television, appeared wary and merely noted the assurances that common ownership was not necessary. STV's share price ended yesterday at 501p - a rise of 58p on the day.

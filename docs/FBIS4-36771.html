			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salamah Ni'mat: "Changing Negotiations Venue </F> Reflects Their Seriousness"]    [Text] Amman -- An authoritative Jordanian source  yesterday expected the Jordanian-Israeli negotiations, which  will resume "in the region" next month, to witness "real and  tangible progress with regard to a number of issues included on  the negotiations agenda signed 14 September 1993.    The source told AL-HAYAH that the Israeli side "has  expressed  willingness to respond to Jordanian demands with regard to the  occupied Jordanian territories, border demarcation, and water  rights" -- which are among the Jordanian side's basic demands.    The source said that holding the negotiations in the region  "means that they will be held on Jordanian territory and Israeli  territory" for the first time since the peace process was  launched in Madrid about three years ago.    The source pointed out that "holding the negotiations on  Israeli territory and Jordanian territory -- and in the region  in general -- will cause the peace process to move closer to the  peoples concerned with it and will influence public opinion."    The Jordanian official said that the decision to move the  negotiations to the states concerned "reflects the seriousness  which will characterize these negotiations." He noted that the  Jordanian-Israeli talks held in Washington 6-7 June were  "practical and effective in reactivating the Jordanian-Israeli  track."    On Syrian reservations about moving the negotiations to the  region, the Jordanian official said: "I do not believe that the  negotiations' venue is going to change their results or is going  to change the negotiators' positions."    He added: "We agree with Syria that normalization should  follow an agreement, not vice versa. However, we must agree  first on what is meant by normalization."</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: BT The exact timing yesterday of the chancellor's announcement of another BT share sale may have caught the market on the hop - but there is no obvious reason why the news should unsettle UK equities. Another BT issue was needed to meet next year's Pounds 5.5bn target for privatisation proceeds; even before the coal fuss, that was likely to take precedence over disposal of the government's remaining stakes in the electricity generators. Moreover, on the far-from-clear assumption that the entire 22 per cent BT stake is put on the block at once, retail demand and a part-payment structure could limit the call on UK institutions next year to just Pounds 1bn-Pounds 1.5bn. From institutions' point of view, of course, it all forms part of the same large pot of money required to finance the government's widening deficit next year. In this respect, though, the bright prospects for retail demand must be encouraging. The effect of falling interest rates  - and widening bank and building society margins - is already evident in the behaviour of savers. The more rates converge with BT's prospective yield - currently around 5.4 per cent for 1993 - the more attractive BT's mix of income and capital growth becomes. There is also a convenient regulatory lull, though investors may worry that once unburdened of its BT shares the government could really let Oftel off the leash.</p>

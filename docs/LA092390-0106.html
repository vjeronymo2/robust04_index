			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: POMONA FOES AGREE -- SOMEWHAT, FOR A WHILE  </P> <P> Singing Harmony -- Pomona Mayor Donna Smith and Councilwoman Nell Soto are  political enemies with nothing in common, it seems. But they were singing the  same tune -- more or less -- after last week's special election to choose a new  council member.  </P> <P> Both said this is a good time for the council's warring factions to bury the  hatchet.  </P> <P> Oh, Smith couldn't resist crowing a little about picking up a political ally on  the council in Boyd Bredenkamp, who had defeated Soto's choice, Bob Dahms. "I  never doubted for a minute that Boyd would win," she said by phone from South  Carolina.  </P> <P> But she added a hope that Bredenkamp -- who is as cautious in his statements as  his predecessor, C.L. (Clay) Bryant, was rash -- might help restore peace.  </P> <P> "There was a message out there," Smith said. "I think that the entire City  Council has to recognize that the community wants stability."  </P> <P> Even if the council meetings don't produce harmony, they are likely to be  shorter than the marathon sessions that were routine when Bryant was in office.  The council is limiting its agenda to 15 items a meeting and has cut back on  its meetings from weekly to twice a month.  </P> <P> Party Crasher -- Why is KABC radio commentator Dennis Prager, a registered  Democrat, speaking to the Pasadena Republican Club?  </P> <P> That's what some of her fellow board members wanted to know, said Angeli  DiLucca-Paterson, when she suggested the club invite Prager. More eyebrows were  raised, she said, when she told them that Prager commands fees for his  appearances. Pay a Democrat to speak? Unheard of, no doubt, said  DiLucca-Paterson, but if the Berlin Wall can come down, maybe the barrier  against Democrats could be lowered.  </P> <P> In any event, DiLucca-Paterson said, no one is better than Prager at discussing  the differences between conservatism and liberalism. So the Republicans will  bring Prager to Pasadena and have invited everyone, including Democrats, to  hear him talk on "Liberalism vs. Conservatism: A Moral Question" at 7:30 p.m.  Thursday at the Pasadena Center, 300 E. Green St. Admission is $20, with a  half-price discount to students with ID.  </P> <P> Debatable -- The American Assn. of Retired Persons has criticized Reps. David  Dreier (R-La Verne) and Esteban Torres (D-La Puente) for rejecting its  invitations to debate their election opponents.  </P> <P> Lee Weinstein, spokesman for the group's voter education arm, AARP/Vote, said  the organization will stage political forums anyway and will set up empty  chairs for the missing legislators if they persist in their refusals.  </P> <P> Dreier's aide, Brad Smith, said his boss didn't exactly turn down the AARP  invitation. Instead, Dreier suggested that the organization join two other  groups -- the Whittier Area Chamber of Commerce and a local realty board -- as  a sponsor of a candidates forum already set for 7:30 a.m. Oct. 23, at Hinshaw's  Auditorium, 13550 Whittier Blvd., Whittier. But AARP insisted on hosting its  own forum.  </P> <P> Dreier and his two 33rd District opponents -- Democrat Georgia Houston Webb and  Libertarian Gail Lightfoot -- will share the Whittier program with candidates  from the 52nd and 59th Assembly districts.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for Torres, meanwhile, said he has not ruled out participation in  an AARP-sponsored debate but is trying to negotiate a suitable time. Torres'  opponent in the 34th District is Republican John Eastman.  </P> <P> The only congressman to accept an AARP invitation so far is Rep. Carlos  Moorhead (R-Glendale), who has agreed to debate his opponent, David Bayer, at 1  p.m. Nov. 2 at the First United Methodist Church in Pasadena. MIKE WARD  </P></p>

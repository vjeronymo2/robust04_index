			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Food manufacturers The government's success in curbing inflation can be gauged by how loudly retailers moan. There is nothing shopkeepers like so much as a dose of price inflation and there has been much belly-aching of late. But recent government retail sales statistics suggest inflation may be creeping back into the system and that moaning may start to quieten down. Some food manufacturers, such as Albert Fisher, have also suggested there has been some easing in the deflationary climate. Pricing pressures have certainly been building up at the front end of the food chain. Many food manufacturers have been under intense pressure from rising raw material prices ever since the pound devalued. United Biscuits saw the operating margins at its McVitie's biscuits business slide by two percentage points after it was unable to pass on higher sugar prices. Packaging companies have suffered from rises in paper and PVC prices and are desperate to pass them on. Some food companies, such as Nestle, have already pushed through commodity price rises on coffee and cocoa. But Nestle's dominant market positions and its formidable brand clout make it a comparatively easy task. Yet the food retailers have done the government a favour by ploughing their shareholders' money into additional retail space. That over-capacity will keep a firm lid on prices whatever the macro-economic climate. All but the strongest food manufacturers will be suffering for some time yet.</p>

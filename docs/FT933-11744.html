			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Business and the Environment: Threat to rural England Development of rural land in England cannot continue at the current pace and the government should conduct a far-reaching review of planning and farming policies to try to protect the countryside, according to the Council for the Protection of Rural England. Tony Burton, senior planner at the CPRE, will launch the organisation's new study on the changes in regional land use between 1945 and 1990* today with a call for the government to revise its planning policies so that less rural land is used for development. The scale of development and land changes across England is 'unsustainable', Burton argues. 'If we carry on using land at this rate we will have lost a resource the general public value as their countryside and we should be cherishing for the future.' In England, as a whole, the urban area has grown by more than 700,000 hectares since 1945. In addition, almost 30 per cent of rough grazing has been lost. The south-east has lost the most countryside to the urban jungle. Since 1960 the number of people supported by each hectare of urban land has declined by a fifth from 31 to 25 people. The CPRE is critical of road proposals that encourage this sort of urban sprawl. Burton said it was concerned about the government's decision to widen the M25 orbital motorway around London. 'These sort of proposals encourage de-centralisation and the M25 decision can only exacerbate that trend.' A comprehensive review of local, regional and national planning policies to protect the countryside and make more efficient use of land in urban areas should be conducted, the CPRE says. Green belts should be protected, particularly where they are under threat from local authorities. The CPRE wants farmland to be better protected for its environmental as well as its agricultural value. *The Lost Land - Regional Data, technical report Pounds 30 or leaflets Pounds 2.50 each from the Council for the Protection of Rural England, Warwick House, 25 Buckingham Palace Road, London SW1W OPP.

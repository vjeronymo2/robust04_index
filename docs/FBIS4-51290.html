			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 25 (XINHUA) -- More than a hundred  members of the House of Representatives have declared that if  President Clinton chooses to extend China's most-favored-nation  trade status unconditionally they will support his decision.    The assurance of support was made in a letter sent to  Clinton  Tuesday [24 May], which was signed by 118 House democrats and  republicans. In the letter, the congressmen emphasized the  importance of Clinton's forthcoming announcement regarding  China's MFN to the U.S.-China bilateral relations and American  economic and security interests. They called for increased  trade and economic links with China by unconditional extension  of MFN.    Representative Jim Kolbe, an author of the letter, said that  "If the President imposes trade sanctions at this juncture, we  will see a destructive ripple effect on the carefully nurtured  U.S.-China relationship that has evolved over the past 20 years."</p>

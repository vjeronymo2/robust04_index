			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Sale of operating subsidiaries could take place soon Price Waterhouse, administrators to Maxwell Communication Corporation, said yesterday that the sale of operating subsidiaries could take place soon following approval of its administration plan by a New York court last Friday, writes Richard Gourlay. Mr Jonathan Phillips, a joint administrator, said it would be only a matter of weeks before the first subsidiary could be sold. An early candidate for sale was Macdonald, the UK publisher with imprints that include Sphere and Futura. At least three groups were interested in Macdonald, all led by former employees of the publisher. The three were Simon &amp; Shuster, the Paramount publishing company, a company called Headline, led by Mr Tim Healey-Hutchinson, and Orion, formed by Mr Anthony Cheetham, formerly of Random Century, with Lord Weidenfeld. Mr Phillips said the administrators had had 70 enquiries about sales of subsidiaries but that he could not say how many were serious. The administration plan approved by judge Tina Brozman of the US bankruptcy court would lead to creditors holding a controlling majority of the equity in the reorganised company. It would be formed around the core businesses of Macmillan, the school publishing company, and Official Airline Guides, MCC's main assets, Mr Phillips said. Mr Peter Laister, who became chairman of MCC after Mr Kevin Maxwell resigned in order to avoid conflicts of interest, had gone 'off salary', Mr Phillips said. He was, however, remaining to help look after the interests of pensioners who have been badly hit by the unauthorised transfer of cash from their pension funds to private Maxwell companies. He said Price Waterhouse 'had a handle' on where the main amounts of cash missing from MCC went. In particular, they were still trying to trace the shares of Berlitz, the languages and education company.</p>

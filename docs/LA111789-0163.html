			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEHIND THE WHEEL: GM PRODUCES NEW MINIVAN GENERATION  </P> <P> When American Dreamers drove the firstborn of the baby boom to their Kaiser  homes in the San Fernando Valley ("Northridge Knolls . . . $8,000 -- GIs No  Down"), it was in another suburban essential of those late '40s -- the  plastiwood-paneled, chromium-plated, harmonica-grilled, nine-passenger station  wagon.  </P> <P> Park Club. Country Squire. The names implied living in Connecticut, working in  the big city, and men in gray flannel suits drinking arid martinis on commuter  trains. In the four decades since, Americans have bought about 35 million  station wagons.  </P> <P> But today's trend -- and one still based as much on image as on any straight  sense of utility -- is away from the station wagon and toward several dozen  marques of imported and domestic minivans.  </P> <P> Station wagon sales are down and stuck around 700,000 units annually. Next  year, say researchers, minivan sales could touch one million. Of particular  satisfaction to flag-waggers, Lee Iacocca and the UAW is that 97% of the U.S.  market is held by domestic minivans and 51% of that huge slice belongs to  Chrysler.  </P> <P> Now comes General Motors with the second generation of minivans -- that are so  rounded, so streamlined, so wedgy, they make earlier editions look like  Conestoga wagons. They will be battling Ford (the existing Aerostar) and  Chrysler (Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager) and the imports from Mazda and  Toyota.  </P> <P> Under the generic heading of All-Purpose Vehicle, GM's entry is a  three-division product. Pontiac calls its version the Trans Sport and it is on  sale this month. Chevrolet introduced the Lumina APV in September. Oldsmobile  will come to market later this year with its Silhouette.  </P> <P> They are identical vehicles apart from some reworked skirting here, a different  facia line there and leather upholstery available only on the slightly  up-market Oldsmobile.  </P> <P> All come with 3.1-liter, V-6 engines, automatic transmission and injection  molded fenders that pop out like Ping-Pong balls when dented by the dings and  furrows of outrageous parking.  </P> <P> Price ($15,000 for naked versions, $20,000 for one with all toys and trimmings)  and performance are much the same and so is the 2001 styling input by Italian  designer Pinafarina.  </P> <P> With their sloping noses, generous use of aerospace carbon composites and low  aerodynamic coefficients, the APV appears to have been whelped at Edwards Air  Force Base.  </P> <P> The windshield is 17 square feet of glass raked to a 66-degree slope. To reduce  the obvious greenhouse effect, a special coating has been applied to reflect  60% of the solar heat load away from driver and passengers. To increase the  space shuttle look, the pitch of the windshield continues through the hood line  and flows into grooved, bulging bumpers suggesting an air-cushion vehicle for  lunar cruising.  </P> <P> By concept and purpose, however, the APV is strictly down-to-earth.  </P> <P> The average suburban mom and dad with their 1.4 pets and 2.5 children hitting  .384 in Little League have had it with station wagons that drive like pickups.  </P> <P> They have found that even fur-lined vans equipped with VCRs and bean bag chairs  lurch and clatter no less than the van driven by the pool cleaning man.  </P> <P> Missing has been a family vehicle that implied urban-rural elegance, had enough  hauling area to satisfy Bekins -- and really did drive like a car.  </P> <P> The APV is such a vehicle and Pontiac's Trans Sport (based on the Pontiac 6000  platform) is typical of GM's series.  </P> <P> Here is emphasis on functional design before attention to styling. Here is the  product of some serious team-think about end use: If seats are to be removable,  can they be removed quickly, easily and by an fumble-fingered owner who thinks  a socket wrench is a torn rotator cuff? Does interior space equate to maximum  usable space? How much additional loading room in the rear is allowed by  front-wheel drive, which does not require differential and drive-shaft humps?  Does the ride approximate that of a car or is it exactly the feel and  performance of a car?  </P> <P> The verdict: the minivan should do for family men what the mini-truck has done  so successfully for the handyman.  </P> <P> Visually the Trans Sport is exquisite.  </P> <P> It is over styled, of course, and really does look like something that should  be mounted on the monorail at Disneyland. But if God had been interested in  purpose devoid of shape, he would have given Eve square shoulders.  </P> <P> So the Trans Sport has been allowed to flow and sweep and those are verbs of  the wind, not some mechanical blockhouse. Slotted magnesium wheels are in  concert with the grooved, wraparound skirt. Every slope of the roof line leads  to a curving door in search of a rounded corner. Black glass conceals ugly  posts. All the necessities -- headlights and handles, seams and grill -- are  flush, recessed and integral.  </P> <P> Thanks to composite panels (also used for hood, roof, tailgate and rear quarter  areas) the Trans Sport's barn doors open with ease. Stepping up into the  vehicle is a zero energy maneuver. The sit-down into bucket seats is barely  noticeable. Such lack of extrusion is what comfortable travel is all about.  </P> <P> And those seats (take your pick of benches or buckets and configurations  ranging from five to seven passengers) really do come out with a flick and a  click, without tools.  </P> <P> All-Purpose Vehicle, however, is something of a misnomer.  </P> <P> For if "all-purpose" means towing a 40-foot sailboat or hauling 8,000 pounds of  reinforcing bars, you'd be better off with a truck. But if the average load  tends to be no weightier nor tougher to load than a platoon of kids, four tubas  and two damp dogs, the Trans Sport, as a people mover, is perfect.  </P> <P> Now the bad news.  </P> <P> Someone on Pontiac's dashboard team must have mumbled when ordering and  mounting heater and air controls.  </P> <P> The result is a downsized climate panel and tiny buttons that can only be seen  by squinting around and below the steering wheel. How small the buttons?  Imagine a pocket calculator. Think about operating one at arm's length while  driving 55 m.p.h. At night.  </P> <P> Ducting for the van's man-made climate is another problem.  </P> <P> Despite a secondary fan for rear seat passengers, air barely whispers from  small-mouthed vents and into the back forty. So when the environment is toasty  and Palm Springs up front, it's Michigan out back and Seattle somewhere in  between.  </P> <P> Externally, Pontiac has persisted with door handles that are mounted north to  south.  </P> <P> Vertical handles require the application of force to either left or right of  the handle, which is cumbersome and awkward for any tugger attempting to bring  the door towards them. With horizontal handles, direction of force and  direction of travel do not cancel themselves out.  </P> <P> On the tailgate, Pontiac approaches handling with the right idea but, again,  the wrong item of equipment. This time, the latch is a small butterfly handle.  It has room only for fingertips. An entire hand around a full handle is needed  to open and raise any tailgate.  </P> <P> Some magazine critics have found fault with the power spread of the Trans  Sport, in particular with its oomph level above 50 m.p.h. when carrying bodies.  The Trans Sport, obviously, is no Testarossa. On the other hand, few family men  are Ferrari drivers and all are quite accustomed to the amble of suburban  transportation impaired by family, coolers, barbecues and beach umbrellas.  </P> <P> Yet full or even half-loading represents only 8% of all trips undertaken.  Under-loaded or empty, the Trans Sport leaves the line with ample vigor. Under  way, it will hum along as well as anything else in the van pool.  </P> <P> Brakes are all they should be and at any speed. The steering seems a little on  the floppy side and when combined with the obvious breadth of the vehicle,  handling becomes somewhat twitchy when crowded by irritable traffic on surface  streets.  </P> <P> In just about all other respects, the Trans Sport certainly fulfills its  promise -- that is, to deliver the starting lineup of your high school  basketball squad, plus totes, with the ease, comfort and quiet of a modern  sedan.  </P> <P> The concept of the APV is quite brilliant. It's the execution that is lightly  scratched by flaws. But next year . . . well, with a tweak here and a  correction there, GM could be hitting a home run.  </P> <P> James Westby, an APV manager for GM, has noted that these minivans are aimed at  those who have been delaying buying until someone took the bounce and boxiness  out of the product.  </P> <P> A GM marketing survey has shown that typical minivan buyers will be family  persons and college graduates making more than $50,000 a year.  </P> <P> They also will be members of the fortysomething set -- whose first car rides  likely came when their parents drove them home from the maternity ward in a  Country Squire station wagon.  </P> <P> 1990 PONTIAC TRANS SPORT SE  </P> <P> COST :  </P> <P> Base -- 18,125.  </P> <P> As tested -- $19,650.  </P> <P> ENGINE :  </P> <P> 3.1-liter V-6, developing 120 horsepower.  </P> <P> PERFORMANCE :  </P> <P> 0-60, manufacturer's claim, 13 seconds.  </P> <P> Estimated top speed 100 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Fuel economy, city-highway average, 20 m.p.g.  </P> <P> CURB WEIGHT :  </P> <P> 3,500 pounds.  </P> <P> THE GOOD :  </P> <P> Space-shuttle styling and fun before function.  </P> <P> Estimated top speed 100 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Room galore.  </P> <P> THE BAD :  </P> <P> Poorly located, pinhead heater controls.  </P> <P> Vertical door handles, undersized tailgate latch.  </P> <P> THE UGLY :  </P> <P> Yesterday's vans.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE SIGNS GO UP -- AND CRIME GOES DOWN  </P> <P> Carol Hamilton squinted and surveyed the crowd of about 150 people eating hot  dogs, dancing to rap music and playing softball Sunday afternoon at Ross Snyder  Recreation Center in South-Central Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "If there are gang bangers here they must be having a good time," said  Hamilton, executive assistant to Councilman Gilbert W. Lindsay, standing in the  shade of a yellow- and white-striped tent and handing out cookies to  youngsters. "Today, there's no turf thing going on here."  </P> <P> A year ago, the upbeat mood at the recreation center on East 41st Street might  have seemed incongruous -- the park is smack in the middle of what Los Angeles  police say was the most violent neighborhood in the 10 square miles patrolled  by the department's Newton Division.  </P> <P> But on Sunday, residents peacefully mingled with police officers to celebrate  signs that the community is safer than it was last year: Drive-by shootings  have dropped 85% and overall crime dropped 24% in the half-square-mile area  bounded by 33rd Street, Vernon Avenue, Central Avenue and Compton Avenue, said  Police Capt. Gordon Harrison.  </P> <P> He attributed the decline to 50 wooden and concrete barricades surrounding the  neighborhood with orange signs warning passers-by in English and Spanish that  they are entering a narcotics enforcement area. Since February, 10 police foot  patrols have been assigned to the area at a cost of $27,000 a month to the  city, Harrison said.  </P> <P> "People see these signs and say, 'Wait a minute, I'll go somewhere else to buy  my dope,' " he said.  </P> <P> Sang Brown, 69, founder of the neighborhood's Jefferson Community Block Club,  said gang members have stopped congregating in front of his home on 40th Place.  </P> <P> Not every resident agreed with the program's success. "I see them smoking  (crack) like it's nothing," said Sergio Miguel Cardenas, 17, a sophomore at  Jefferson High School.  </P> <P> His friend, Jose Delgado, piped in: "There were three drive-by shootings here  yesterday. If (police) had any idea what was going on, they'd stay here  overnight."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 31 May (EFE) -- Uruguay will challenge  Chile's partial entry into the Common Market of the South  (Mercosur) or access through a free trade zone, and will only  accept it as a full-fledged member, diplomatic sources linked to  the negotiations stressed in Montevideo today. Chile is the  only South American country that has its way paved toward  joining Mercosur, as it is not a member of any other system.    An exception clause for Chile's future entry into the common  market formed by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay was  specifically included in the Asuncion Treaty of 26 March 1991.    Other countries do not have this possibility as the Asuncion  Treaty bans the entry of those countries that have joined other  agreements such as the Andean Pact, of which Chile is not a  member. So far, this clause has prevented the entry of Bolivia,  the first country to be interested in joining the Southern  Cone's economic system.    Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa announced that in  June, his country would formalize a proposal to join Mercosur by  establishing a free trade zone.    The Uruguayan negotiators' reaction did not take long, and  they expressed that any country that wants to join Mercosur  would have to meet all requirements, including the  implementation of a common external tariff.    The Uruguayan stance seems to challenge the interests of  Argentina and Brazil, Mercosur's main partners. Following the  interest expressed by President Frei's new administration,  Argentina and Brazil are promoting a partial association with  Chile.    The Uruguayan officials admitted that the Mercosur partners  have not yet discussed the Chilean proposal. The Uruguayan  Government has therefore not yet had an opportunity to express  its official opinion.    Experts, however, have noted: "A country that does not pay  the cost of a common external tariff cannot enjoy the same  benefits in exporting to markets in Brazil and Argentina."    In a commentary for a newspaper that specializes in economic  issues, another Uruguayan official said: "We Uruguayans do not  want to lock ourselves into a stubborn stance, nor replace  imports with local products, but if we do not respect legal  frameworks we would be drawing up agreements like custom-made  clothes."    According to the newspaper EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO, for  Uruguay, "any integration must take place within the legal  framework that we are handling. In this regard, the Asuncion  Treaty applies. Any country that wants to join in will have to  abide by the entire treaty and not by part of it alone."</p>

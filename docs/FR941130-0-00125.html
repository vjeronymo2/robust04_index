			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The goals for special affordable housing (i.e., housing meeting the needs of and affordable to low-income families in low-income areas and very low-income families) applicable to each GSE were established under the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, 12 U.S.C. 4501&hyph;4641 (the 1992 Act), and the Interim Notices as two-year goals covering 1993 and 1994. This rule extends the 1993&hyph;1994 special affordable housing goals for each GSE into 1995 and provides that the goals for 1995 shall be as described below. The special affordable housing goals established under this rule also shall apply on a proportional basis to that portion of 1995 before permanent goals are established and effective following rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The level of the two-year (1993&hyph;1994) special affordable housing goal for each GSE was established at a dollar amount above and beyond a 1992 baseline. The GSEs were asked to provide the Secretary with a good-faith estimate of the dollar amount of each enterprise's 1992 mortgage purchases that would have qualified under the special affordable housing goal if the goal had applied to 1992 purchases. Fannie Mae estimated that in 1992 it purchased $7.1965 billion of mortgages that would have qualified toward the special affordable housing goal had it applied. Freddie Mac estimated that in 1992 it purchased $5.214 billion of mortgages that would have qualified toward the special affordable housing goal had it applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1993&hyph;1994 special affordable housing goal for Fannie Mae was then established as twice the 1992 baseline ($14.393 billion) plus $2 billion_the minimum amount of the goal for the transition period established for Fannie Mae under the 1992 Act_for a two-year goal of $16.393 billion. The 1993&hyph;1994 special affordable housing goal for Freddie Mac was then established as twice the 1992 baseline ($10.428 billion) plus $1.5 billion_the minimum amount of the goal for the transition period established for Freddie Mac under the 1992 Act_for a two-year goal of $11.928 billion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary recognizes that in 1995 the dollar amount of conventional mortgages originated will be substantially lower than the amount originated in 1992. HUD estimates that there will be a reduction in conventional originations of at least one-third between the 1992 market ($819 billion) and the 1995 mortgage market (an estimated $510 billion). In addition, seasonality is an important factor in the mortgage markets_fewer mortgages are originated in the first quarter of the year than in any other quarter. These goals are likely to be in place for only a portion of 1995, including that quarter for which mortgage originations are the lowest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of these two factors_the large reduction in the size of the mortgage market and the seasonality of originations_the Secretary has appropriately revised the baseline applicable to the special affordable housing goals that will be in place for 1995. The Secretary has reduced the baselines for each enterprise by 50 percent. The 1995 goal for Fannie Mae is $4.598 billion (the revised baseline plus $1 billion, half of the two-year goal under the 1992 Act). The 1995 goal for Freddie Mac is $3.357 billion (the revised baseline plus $750 million, half of the goal for Freddie Mac under the 1992 Act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Since 1968, the Secretary has had general regulatory authority and specific regulatory authorities respecting Fannie Mae. Since 1989, pursuant to the Financial Institution Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (Pub.L. 101&hyph;73, approved August 9, 1989) (``FIRREA''), the Secretary has had the same regulatory authorities respecting Freddie Mac.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1992 Act substantially changed the Secretary's regulatory authorities respecting the GSEs. The 1992 Act increased and detailed the Secretary's authority to establish, monitor performance under, and enforce annual goals for mortgage purchases by the GSEs of mortgages financing: (1) housing for low- and moderate-income families; (2) housing located in central cities, rural areas, and other underserved areas; and (3) housing meeting the needs of and affordable to low-income families in low-income areas and very low-income families. (See generally sections 1331&hyph;49 of the 1992 Act.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1992 Act provided for a transition period of 1993 and 1994, for which the Act established annual targets for the purchases by both GSEs of mortgages financing housing for low- and moderate-income families and housing located in central cities. These transition targets were set at the same percentages provided under HUD regulations applicable to Fannie Mae that were issued in 1978. Accordingly, the 1992 Act set the transition targets at 30 percent of the mortgage purchases of the GSEs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1992 Act provided that, for the transition period, in cases where a GSE was not meeting its 30 percent target as of January 1, 1993, the Secretary was to establish annual goals so that the GSE would improve its performance relative to the target annually and, to the maximum extent feasible, would meet the target at the conclusion of the transition period. The 1992 Act also established dollar goals for the GSEs' purchases of mortgages financing special affordable housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 22, 1993, in accordance with requirements in the 1992 Act, the Secretary provided the GSEs with an opportunity to review and comment on the proposed interim goals. Subsequently, HUD staff met with representatives of both GSEs for discussion of the comments received, after which the GSEs provided additional comments to the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to sections 1332(d)(3), 1333(d)(4), and 1334(d)(3) of the 1992 Act, on October 13, 1993 (58 FR 53048 and 53061) (``October 13 Notice''), the Secretary published two notices in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  establishing the interim goals for each GSE_applicable to the transition years of 1993 and 1994_and requirements for implementation of the goals. Since neither GSE was meeting its targets as of the beginning of the transition period, the goals were established so that the GSEs would, to the maximum extent feasible, meet the targets by the end of the transition period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The October 13 Notice established Fannie Mae's low- and moderate-income housing goal at 30 percent of the units financed by mortgages purchased by Fannie Mae in 1993 and 1994. The notice also established Fannie Mae's central cities goal at 28 percent of units financed by mortgages purchased by Fannie Mae in 1993, and 30 percent in 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The October 13 Notice established Freddie Mac's low- and moderate-income housing goal at 28 percent for 1993 and 30 percent for 1994. The notice also established Freddie Mac's goal for purchases of mortgages financing housing located in central cities at 26 percent for 1993 and 30 percent for 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The October 13 Notice established the Special Affordable Housing Goals as two-year goals for the GSEs' purchases of conventional mortgages on rental and owner-occupied housing meeting the then-existing unaddressed needs of, and affordable to, low-income families in low-income areas and very low-income families. This goal for Fannie Mae was established as not less than 2 billion dollars ($2,000,000,000) above Fannie Mae's existing performance and commitments. This goal for Freddie Mac was established as not less than 11/2 billion dollars ($1,500,000,000) above Freddie Mac's existing performance and commitments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Basis for Secretary's Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary is empowered to extend the housing goals under section 1321 of the 1992 Act, which confers on the Secretary general regulatory authority and the authority to ``make such rules and regulations as shall be necessary and proper'' to ensure that the purposes of the 1992 Act and the purposes of the Fannie Mae Charter Act and the Freddie Mac Act are accomplished.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1331 of the 1992 Act provides that the Secretary shall establish housing goals by regulation. Section 1331 also provides that from year to year the Secretary may adjust any housing goal by regulation. Section 1349 of the 1992 Act provides that any final regulations necessary to implement the provisions of the 1992 Act relating to the housing goals shall be issued after notice and opportunity for public comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

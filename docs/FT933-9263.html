			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Royal Bank's accounts criticised by watchdog THE ROYAL Bank of Scotland was yesterday criticised by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the accounts watchdog, for an entry in its 1992 results which nearly doubled profits. The bank introduced a change of accounting policy in 1991 which had the effect of substantially lifting 1992 profits but which should have been shown instead in the 1991 accounts. The panel said the treatment breached SSAP 6, the accounting standard dealing with prior year adjustments, and ruled that the amount should have been shown in the previous year. The accounts had received an unqualified opinion by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the auditors. The bank has agreed to amend the comparative 1992 figures in its 1993 accounts and to include appropriate explanatory notes. That will reduce 1992 profits by more than Pounds 9m. The panel held back from issuing a stronger reprimand or requiring the bank to re-issue the disputed accounts to shareholders as it did in one previous case. Royal Bank changed its accounting policies in October 1991 to defer acquisition expenses in its insurance operations over the period in which premiums were earned. The effect was a one-off boost to profits for 1991 and prior years of Pounds 9.1m. But the bank took the gain as an exceptional item in its accounts for the year to September 30 1992, which lifted pre-tax profits for the year to Pounds 20.9m. The review panel had no objection to the new accounting policy, which the bank argued was in line with market practice and the statement of recommended practice of the Association of British Insurers. Mr Robert Speirs, finance director of Royal Bank, stressed yesterday that the adjustment was not concealed but was clearly flagged in the accounts as an exceptional item. The bank had sought advice from accountants before using the approach. 'This was purely a technical matter,' he said. The criticism of Royal Bank follows a reprimand at the end of last month against Breverleigh Investments, which breached three separate accounting standards in its accounts for the year to June 30 1992. Breverleigh failed to provide a cash flow statement, did not consolidate a subsidiary, Banyan Tree of Key West, and did not include a statement in the accounts that they had been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The accounts were not qualified on these grounds by Copeland &amp; Co, the auditors. The directors accepted that the departures from accounting standards were not justified and assured the panel there would be full compliance in the future. The 1992 figures will be adjusted accordingly in the 1993 accounts. Banyan, which was 77.5 per cent owned by Breverleigh, had net liabilities of Pounds 339,000 and showed a loss for the year of Pounds 279,000. Breverleigh showed a pre-tax profit of Pounds 887 before an extraordinary loss of Pounds 198,000.</p>

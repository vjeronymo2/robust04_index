			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / How To Spend It: Crafty gift ideas with cachet - Lucia van der Post considers the pleasures of owning hand-made goods To all those who think of the crafts as a peripheral phenomenon, it might come as something of a surprise to learn that in 1993 some 13m people visited a craft shop or gallery. The Crafts Council has just produced what it calls an independent socio-economic study of craftspeople which says that there are about 25,000 working in England, Scotland and Wales. These are interesting figures and evidence that the pleasure people get from making things by hand is almost matched by the pleasure others getting from owning objects that are not mass-produced. The figure, though, that would really interest me is what kind of a wage craft workers make. The difficulty, as always, lies with the fact that few retailers have woken up to a shift in people's tastes. It still remains true that those who long for things that are individual, one-off, hand-made and desirable have few places to go where they can regularly be sure of seeing them. Peripatetic craft markets and market stalls are still the most common way for craftspeople to sell their wares. However, many enlightened retailers discovered some years ago that just a few quirky, idiosyncratic artefacts in their shop could bring a lot of life and fun to the business of selling life's necessities. Joseph, always a touchstone for retailers, has been selling furniture by designers such as Andre Dubreuil, Tom Dixon and Mark Brazier-Jones, and chandeliers, candelabra, glass and ceramics by other makers. Sales may be limited but Joseph understands that they lend a bit of dash and pizzazz to the atmosphere of the shop as well as providing a much needed platform for designers. Egg, one of the sensational retailing successes of the year - Maureen Doherty, its owner and buyer, had to shut her shop during August as she had nothing left to sell - is loved by its customers because it is not like any other emporium. Besides the ranges of Indian cotton khadi trousers and jackets - and beautiful silks by Asha Sarabhai - there is always a selection of exquisite hand-made pots and hand tie-dyed silks and smocking, goods made with love and care. Nicole Farhi, in her airy new shop in New Bond Street, London, has gone to the trouble of scouring Italy for hand-made pieces; wooden stools, glass vases, quirky plates, *something in here (HP) * bowls and wrought-iron candlesticks. (Although one wonders why it has to be Italy when there is so much that is splendid in the UK.) Admirable though these retailers are, there is still the big problem that there are not enough who think as they do and that crafts sold through standard retailing outlets have to absorb a huge mark-up (100 per cent plus VAT) and this puts the goods beyond the reach of many. All of which brings me to Chelsea Crafts Fair, which opens on Tuesday and runs until October 23. Many Weekend FT readers have become regular fans, going back year after year to look for special anniversary or Christmas presents, to find a craft worker who will make a one-off piece of furniture, a made-to-measure chest of drawers, candlesticks of specific dimensions or jewellery for a special occasion. Last year some 28,000 visitors trooped through the doors of Chelsea old town hall in Kings Road, London and the fair has become one of the biggest, best-known forums for arts and crafts. The work has been sifted carefully - far more people apply than can be accommodated - but the result is a big and varied exhibition where almost every craft is represented. Fashion, textiles, ceramics, glassware, jewellery, toys, papier mache and bookbinding - there ought to be something for everyone. Do not, however, expect everything to be cheap. Many people who ought to know better persist in feeling that hand-made goods should cost less than machine-made articles but, although crafts often do represent wonderful value, they cannot be cheap if fine materials (solid wood, gold, precious stones, silver, enamels) and intricate workmanship have been used. I urge London readers not to miss the Chelsea Crafts Fair. There will be a completely different set of exhibitors each week so it may well be worth going twice. The fair opens from 10 am to 8 pm, Tuesdays to Saturdays, and 10 am to 6 pm on Sundays. Entrance fee is Pounds 7 for one visit each week, Pounds 5 for a single visit. Finally, if you have time today, hurry along to the last day of the Goldsmiths' Fair, at Goldsmiths Hall, Foster Lane, London EC2V 6BN. Jewellers and silversmiths will be showing and selling a vast range of jewellery, cutlery, salt and pepper pots, claret jugs, vases, goblets etc - again a marvellous place to pick up special presents. It is open from 11 am to 7 pm. The Pounds 1 entrance fee includes a catalogue.</p>

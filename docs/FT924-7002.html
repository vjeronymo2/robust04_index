			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Turkish Finance, Investment and Industry (11): State sell-offs prove inviting - John Murray Brown explains the foreign interest in cement CEMENT, like so many of the industries attracting foreign interest in Turkey, is booming for one simple reason - the country's vast underdeveloped home market. The point is often missed by those preoccupied with Turkey's role as a regional trade hub; but, like cars and the food and beverage industry, the most exciting sectors are those narrowly focused on the increasingly prosperous Turkish consumer. Cement is one of the most promising. Foreign interest is rising, in anticipation of the sale of 11 state-owned companies, the results of which are expected to be announced before the end of the year. Faced with the new competition, the large domestic producers are pushing through their own modernisation plans to stay in touch. 'We come here to acquire market share,' said Mr Pierre Conso, the former head of Societe Ciments Francais (SCF), during a visit to Ankara last year. European cement concerns, stifled by a downturn in activity in their home markets, are looking to Turkey to boost their balance sheets. The strategy, as in the car sectors and the food and beverage industry where there has also been a surge of foreign interest, is to tap into Turkey's large and still relatively undeveloped local market. 'Turkey is one of the last European countries where we see real growth prospects,' says Mr Claude Grinfeder, head of SCF's East European Division.' We didn't know the market, but we knew our product.' Production, at around 26m tonnes a year, is equivalent to the amount of cement sold in Spain or France. But more important, sales are growing at around 4-5 per cent, according to Adnan Ignebekcili, president of SCF's local Turkish company, Set Group Holding. Analysts, looking at the level of average annual consumption, believe the country still has a way to go. 'This growth will continue,' says Hac Sabanc, head of the cement division of the local Sabanc Holding Group, Turkey's largest privately owned industrial conglomerate. Demand in the housing sector is rising, as home-owners try to hedge against rampant inflation. What is perhaps more surprising, the market for cement seems to have been little affected by the government's decision to cut back on public infrastructure spending. The Turkish cement market tends to be highly regional. For example, it is not easy for producers in Izmir to break into the Istanbul market, as they discovered last year, during a brief price war. The cost of transport and the lack of a good road and rail system has proved a disincentive to competition, and helps to explain why small producers, with plants with less than optimum capacities, are able to survive. In Turkey, 80 per cent of sales are still made in sacks; the rest is bulk sales. In Europe the reverse is true. Undoubtedly, part of the catalyst for all this activity was provided by the arrival of the big foreign players. Many of the local concerns were clearly taken by surprise. In some quarters, the issue provoked a chauvinistic reaction with industrialists openly voicing opposition to the policy of selling state assets to foreign groups. Indeed, in 1989 SCF, the French group, found itself caught in a legal dispute, after deputies took action in the courts to have the sale declared illegal, on the grounds that the companies had not first been offered to domestic buyers. Ironically the deputies were from the party of the current prime minister, Mr Suleyman Demirel, when he was still in opposition. Earlier this year, Mr Demirel was invited to preside over the opening of SCF's latest investment, a Dollars 70m expansion of its clinker plant near Ankara - an irony not lost on local commentators. Sabanc, Turkey's largest producer with around 15 per cent of the market, welcomes the foreign competition. Mr Hac Sabanc says this has forced the local companies to diversify their product range and make investments which they might otherwise have postponed. Cement is now Sabanc's second most important business. Mr Sabanc is one of five brothers who run the holding company, believes the company will remain a force to be reckoned. 'Italy was at the bottom of the world league table, and now they're the largest cement producer. The only thing in our minds is to how to achieve that sort of growth,' he says. The company is now examining some of the 11 companies slated for privatisation. 'It's impossible to build a new plant, because of the cost of land.' Ten years ago, Citosan, the state company, controlled more than 50 per cent of the market. Today, privatisation provides the opening for a number of foreign groups to enter the Turkish cement market. In 1989, in the first round of sales, Ciments Francais invested Dollars 105m in the Turkish cement sector, buying five plants. In 1990, the company purchased a sixth and embarked on a major expansion into ready-mixed concrete, pre-fabricated products and aggregates. All the factories are located inland, another reminder of the fact that this is not an export business. The company says it has also spent Dollars 42m on modernising the plants and installing environmental controls. Following in its wake, Lafarge Coppee, the French group now the world's largest producer of building materials, acquired the Aslan Cimento company through a private share placement by the state-owned Isbank. The plant, one of Turkey's largest, with capacity of 1.5m tonnes, accounts for about 20 per cent of the key Istanbul cement market. Lafarge has also bought a clinker plant near Ankara, and plans to use the site to build a full cement works in an area where the company estimates that there is still under-capacity. The company is now developing its presence in the ready-mix market, which industry officials say is growing by 25-30 per cent a year. The company bought into the Istanbul market, through its purchase of the local Ekmel Beton. With the latest round of sales by the privatisation agency, an estimated 18 per cent share of the Turkish cement market is available. The French groups, SCF and Lafarge, have both made offers. Local municipalities have set up companies in order to be able to bid for the local cement factories.</p>

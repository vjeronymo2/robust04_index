			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Australian bulls pay for misplaced hopes - The economy let them down It has not been a good year for bulls in Australia. Time and again, brokers have forecast a sustained rally, only to retreat hurriedly as the All Ordinaries index resumed its downward trend. At yesterday's close of 1,435.2, the index was 13.1 per cent lower than at the end of last year, and down more than 37 per cent since the all-time high of 2,300 in October 1987. The bulls have reason to feel hard done by. Most of the misplaced optimism was based on slowly improving economic fundamentals following Australia's emergence from recession in the last quarter of 1991. As the federal government keeps pointing out, Australia's economic cycle is ahead of most of the rest of the world, and its annualised GDP growth rate of 2.1 per cent is now one of the fastest in the OECD. But the market has remained stubbornly unmoved, in spite of three cuts in official interest rates and a substantial fiscal boost delivered in two expansionary economic statements earlier this year. With the benefit of hindsight, the lack of response suggests that the market had fully discounted the prospects of a return to economic growth by the end of last year. Investors may have been disappointed by the slower-than-forecast pace of recovery, and disturbed by the signs of impending currency and current account difficulties which have accompanied it. They may also have been put off by the sea of red ink which has spilled from the books of most of Australia's big companies as the impact of the 18-month recession works its way through the accounts. Hardly a corner of the economy has emerged unscathed. Of the 24 sectoral indices quoted by the Australian Stock Exchange, only three are higher than at the end of last year. And two of those - chemicals and property trusts - have barely moved. The only real success story has been the media index, which is up more than 50 per cent, mainly because of a spectacular improvement in the share price of News Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's newspapers, film and broadcasting group. The media index has also been helped by the performance of John Fairfax, the newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph group, and Nine Network, the television group controlled by Mr Kerry Packer. Significantly all three groups are recovering from earlier reverses. However, the media index makes up only about 9 per cent of the All Ordinaries index, and its performance has been overshadowed by the collapse elsewhere in the market. The gold index is down more than 11 per cent, diversified resources 26 per cent, developers and contractors 26 per cent, building materials 23 per cent, transport 23 per cent, banking and finance 25 per cent, and alcohol and tobacco 37 per cent. There are some hopeful signs for the future. The Australian dollar has declined by more than 13 per cent this year on a trade weighted basis, which makes local stocks cheaper for overseas buyers. Corporate net profits increased by 26 per cent in the three months to the end of September, to a level 37 per cent above the low point of the recession in mid-1990. However, earnings before interest, tax and depreciation rose by only 6.4 per cent, suggesting that most of the improvement in net profits flowed from lower interest rates and cost cutting, rather than higher sales or margins. Apart from the media groups, few major companies made an unambiguous return to the good financial health in the full-year reporting season which ended last month. Exceptions included Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's biggest company; Amcor, the packaging and paper group; CSR, the sugar and building materials producer; and Mayne Nickless, the transport, security and health group. But many big companies continued to disappoint, including TNT and Brambles, the transport groups; the miners CRA and North Broken Hill Peko; Goodman Fielder Wattie, Australasia's largest food producer; and Pacific Dunlop, the diversified manufacturer. Worst of all, the banking sector is still showing the strains of recession and falling property prices. The conservatively-managed National Australia Bank produced an improvement, but Commonwealth, Westpac and ANZ all reported disappointing or disastrous results. The market was also badly hit in October by Westpac's ADollars 1.2bn fully-underwritten rights issue, which closed 72 per cent undersubscribed, leaving millions of unwanted shares overhanging the market. In the absence of an unexpected acceleration of economic recovery, the market is likely to mark time over the next few months in the hope of improved results in the interim reporting season beginning in February. The more optimistic bulls are still forecasting the long-delayed rally, which some claim could take the index to 1,800 by the middle of next year. But nervous investors should be aware that bears are tipping a floor of 1,250 before a sustained recovery begins.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (7): Tough guy at the bank / Profile of Hilmar Kopper Tall, thick-set and radiating energy, Mr Hilmar Kopper, 59, seems to be thriving after five years at the head of Deutsche Bank. He talks of rising profits, greater efforts to fight off domestic competition and improve efficiency, and a new push abroad in investment banking, writes ANDREW FISHER. His period as speaker of the management board at Germany's largest commercial bank has, he says, 'been a very lively period of tremendous growth and great challenge'. But the latest of his years in one of Germany's most demanding corporate jobs has undoubtedly been one of the toughest. As the country climbs out of recession, criticism of banks' lending policies and sometimes high-handed attitudes to customers have grown. Adding to Deutsche's tribulations was the near-collapse of Metallgesellschaft, the industrial and trading company with which it was involved as shareholder and creditor. A further blow came with the failure of the Schneider property group, to which the bank was a major lender; it was while commenting on that crisis that Mr Kopper made his fateful remark about outstanding payments to contractors being 'peanuts' - the German press picked this up with glee as evidence of the bank's arrogance. But these upsets were nothing compared to the circumstances in which Mr Kopper came to his present post. He was appointed after Mr Alfred Herrhausen was murdered by terrorists in November, 1989, just three weeks after Germany had experienced the euphoria of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Mr Kopper's pragmatic down-to-earth style is very different from that of Mr Herrhausen who had a high public profile through expounding on a variety of political and economic topics beyond the world of banking. Mr Herrhausen spoke in favour of reunification before many in west Germany had accepted its inevitability. But it was Mr Kopper and his colleagues who had to move the bank eastwards. 'We had to make some of the fastest and most far-reaching decisions made since World War Two,' he says. 'Looking back on it (the investment in the east), there is very little we would change. We are very pleased with how we were able to grow in that period.' Now, it has a larger market share in east Germany (nearly 9 per cent) than in the west. Surprisingly to many people, Germany's big banks have a smaller share of their own market than their counterparts in other countries. With total assets of DM570bn, Deutsche Bank is well placed for further expansion; it has bought retail banking networks in Spain and Italy and is locating its worldwide investment banking activities in London, where Morgan Grenfell (its merchant bank subsidiary) is based. But there is one area where Deutsche Bank does not plan to expand: its industrial shareholdings, with a market value of some DM25bn. While these provide a useful earnings cushion, they also attract envy and critical comment about the Macht der Banken (power of the banks). Compared with the market capitalisation of listed companies, German banks' holdings are tiny. But to some politicians, they are a provocation. Calls to reduce them are voiced often, usually linked with the demand that the prominent presence of bankers on company's non-executive supervisory boards be reduced. Mr Kopper rejects the view that banks make poor shareholders. 'What makes a bank a worse shareholder than anybody else?' He says Deutsche does not intend to increase its portfolio, though it would like to diversify it. On this and other issues where the bank has come under fire, he has a simple answer: 'We are a member of society and there is nothing wrong in people discussing what we do.' Even so, he must hope the next few years bring fewer barbs and controversy than 1994.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours Newscast"] </F>   [Text] In a scene that looked like something out of a war  movie, 60 members of the Aburra Valley Militia -- wearing hoods  and carrying weapons -- travelled from Medellin to Ojevas, Sucre  Department aboard government helicopters. The action is part of  the process to reincorporate the Socialist Renewal Movement  [CRS] into society.    At about noon today, the 60 men and women of the People's  Militia of Aburra Valley were taken in two helicopters to the  camp at Flor del Monte in Sucre where conversations are underway  on the demobilization of the CRS. For the time being, these  talks have not led to any significant agreement.    [Begin unidentified CRS member recording] The CRS is an  organization that operates mainly in the cities. Throughout the  nation it has 3,000 members, of which only 300 are in arms. That  is the part we are going to negotiate with the national  government. [end recording]    This is the third group of militias that has decided to go  to  negotiations in Medellin. Two other groups are conducting  negotiations with the state in an area close to Medellin. The  CRS, leader of these militias in the Aburra Valley, hopes that  this example of urban disarmament will result in the release of  200 men who are imprisoned before 3 April when the negotiations  conclude.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Democratic Constituent Congress [CCD] President  Jaime Yoshiyama yesterday announced the establishment of the  National Environment Authority [Autoridad Ambiental Nacional]  which will guide and coordinate environment policies.    Yoshiyama also asked developed countries to swap part of the  foreign debt for environment protection and measures against  poverty.    Yoshiyama said: "A direct relationship exists between  poverty, environmental damage, and sustainable development which  must be considered in any international relations that are based  on solidarity and shared responsibility."    Yoshiyama also asked developed countries to pardon part of  the poor countries' foreign debt so as to restore economic  well-being and assist development compatible with sustainability.    Yoshiyama made these remarks during a "Sustainable  Development and Economic Growth in Ibero-America"  entrepreneurial meeting. This meeting was part of the 22d AICO  [Ibero-American Association of Chambers of Commerce] executive  board meeting between 2 and 4 May.    Yoshiyama, who delivered the main lecture, admitted that  human rights, the removal of poverty, tariff agreements, the  protection of intellectual property, and the protection of the  environment are among the most important and universally  relevant issues.    The ruling party congressman emphasized the significance of  a  common strategy among the regional countries to cope with the  problem of universal environment protection.    Yoshiyama also asked for a change in attitudes and  practices,  specially by developed countries, and the transfer of the  technology needed by developing countries to protect their  environments.    He said he wants costs and benefits of sustainable  development to be equally shared at the international level.    Yoshiyama wants large-scale education policies to make  people  aware of the importance of the environmental issue.    He announced that a National Environment Authority would be  established within the next few weeks. This National  Environment Authority will guide and coordinate environmental  policies. Marc Dourojeanni--the Inter-American Development Bank  environment division chief--hailed this announcement and offered  a donation of $2 million toward this National Environment  Authority.    Yoshiyama explained that the new Constitution includes,  among  the human rights, the right to a balanced environment that  favors the development of life. He added that the CCD is  working on this.    To the surprise and approval of the large number of  participants at the AICO meeting, Yoshiyama said: "I want to  announce that within the next few weeks the Peruvian Congress  will vote on a bill on the establishment of a National  Environment Authority."    Yoshiyama emphasized: "In response to the concern of public  and private organizations, the National Environment Authority  will guide and coordinate environment policies and control the  sustainable use of our natural resources. It will also guide  actions in this area." [passage omitted]</p>

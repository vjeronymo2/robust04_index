			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / World Trade News: EC to hit back at US steel 'dumping' suits BRUSSELS told the US yesterday it would respond vigorously to the American steel industry's launch of anti-dumping and subsidy suits against five EC steelmakers. The real purpose of the suits was to 'obstruct legitimate trade in steel or force partners of the US to accept the renewal of voluntary restraint agreements,' the European Commission charged. The EC executive urged Washington to examine each anti-dumping complaint rigorously, adding it would 'not hesitate to use all methods of recourse available under Gatt' to contest the suits. This new skirmish in the widening transatlantic trade dispute, although anticipated, does little to improve chances of the EC and US settling their wider differences within the Uruguay Round negotiations, the main subject of next Wednesday's bilateral summit in Washington. The US industry's complaint has been made against United Engineering of the UK, Usinor and Ascometal of France, Thyssen and Saarstahl of Germany, and an unnamed Brazilian steel producer. The complaint wants countervailing duties of 53 per cent, and anti-subsidy duties of 10 per cent against the UK company; the respective figures claimed against the French producers are 69 and 20 per cent, and against the German companies, 79 and 25 per cent. The action follows the failure two weeks ago of talks on a Multilateral Steel Agreement (MSA) to replace voluntary restraints on entering the US market, which expired at the end of March. EC officials say that some European steelmakers, especially those on long-term contracts, could as a result of weakness in the dollar be selling into the US more cheaply than at home. But they insist that this 'technical dumping' would make it hard to prove injury to US producers, especially when the EC had cracked down on state aid to steelmakers, and total Community exports to the US had fallen back from 7m tonnes to under 6m tonnes since 1989. The MSA talks made some progress before being broken off at the end of last month, and the Commission yesterday urged their resumption 'without undue delay.'</p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / The Markets: Inflation falls, analysts seek other worries - London Positive domestic economic news, including an unexpected fall in underlying UK inflation to its lowest level for 27 years, helped the FTSE-100 climb 43 points on Wednesday and pierce 3,200 briefly on Thursday. The US Federal Reserve's decision to increase its key discount rate by half a percentage point to 4 per cent late on Tuesday also helped calm market anxieties over nascent inflationary pressures across the Atlantic. Subsequent US economic data was less encouraging and the UK market faltered after Wall Street opened lower on Thursday, but the FTSE-100 rallied on Friday to close the week 49.1 points higher at 3,191.4. The Fed's move, coupled with the decision by the Bundesbank on Thursday to leave the German interest rates unchanged, will add to the pressure on other countries to react quickly and decisively should signs of renewed inflationary pressure emerge. Market expectations about European interest rates were thrown into turmoil the previous week by the unforeseen rise in rates by Italy and Sweden. The absence of a German rate cut has therefore made it increasingly likely that the interest rate reduction process in continental Europe is at, or very close to, an end. 'The lack of easing by the German authorities has left the continental European equity markets vulnerable,' notes Kleinwort Benson. NatWest Securities agrees that continental European markets have reached: 'a significant risk point as the primary engine for the continental European markets shifts from being led by interest rate reductions to being driven by the prospects for earnings and dividends.' Market optimists argue that the UK has crossed this Rubicon and should now be driven by the continued recovery of corporate profits but some analysts argue that London is locked into the same interest rate bind as Wall Street. With anxieties about domestic inflation allayed but not yet dismissed, some argue the best news for equities would be a pre-emptive intererst rate strike. 'For equities to be able to make significant further ground in the short term we need to see a decline in long gilt yields,' says Charterhouse Tilney Securities. 'Ironically the best news for the gilts market would be a rise in base rates, a move which would provide confirmation that the Treasury intends to be pro-active in terms of its counter-inflation policy.' Such a strategy entails its own risks, particularly when weak money supply and retail sales data continue to indicate the fragility of the UK economic recovery. As a result, not even the most bearish forecasters are suggesting that UK base rates are heading back into double figures. NatWest Securities argues accordingly that retail investors will have to get used to a much lower return on cash deposits than the 10.5 per cent average they have enjoyed over the past decade. One effect of low deposit rates is that unit trust sales have held up in spite of the weak market since the start of February. NatWest expects net unit trust trust sales of Pounds 11bn this year with perhaps Pounds 2bn of this directed towards UK equity income funds. Since UK equity income trusts are restricted to investment in companies with a yield at least 10 per cent higher than the FT-SE-A All Share index, NatWest Securities argues that strong flows into income funds will restrict the yield divergence between sectors. Indeed, as the chart shows, as short and long term interest rates fell through 1993, so the yield spread between different sectors, based on year two yield forecasts, narrowed. Then, as gilt yields bounced back towards 9 per cent after February, the sector yield spread widened as high yielding sectors tended to underperform. More recently, as gilts found a bottom, the rebound in the equity market has been led by some of the highest yielding sectors including utilities, pharmaceuticals and selected financials. This was the case again last week as the sparsity of results forced a relatively quiet market to focus on other issues. On Monday the markets were given a timely reminder of the dangers in interest rate forecasting as HSBC Holdings, the international banking group and last of the UK banks to report, revealled that it had largely abandoned bond trading on its own account after losing Pounds 123m on bond and interest rate-related trading during a turbulent first half. The news overshadowed a 24 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.46bn, aided by a sharp fall in bad debt provisions. The interim dividend was raised by 14 per cent to 8p, but that was insufficient to head-off a decline in the group's share price which closed 39p lower on the week at 720p. On Tuesday, Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, reported a 10 per cent increase in third-quarter pre-tax profits which came in at Pounds 282m, towards the lower end of analysts's expectations. The results showed the benefits of the Dollars 3.4bn Quantum Chemical acquisition last autumn, as the US-based polyethylene and propane group contributed Pounds 46m to profits on sales of Pounds 344m. Hanson's shares closed the week 8 3/4 lower at 256 1/2 p. Hanson also figured in one of the wilder market rumours of week: that GEC might be a potential target for one of the big conglomerates such as BTR or Hanson. Most analysts dismissed the rumour asserting that GEC was much more likely to emerge as a predator than a target. Meanwhile BICC, the UK cables and construction group, announced a 26 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from a restated Pounds 50m to Pounds 63m. The group also said it is planning to treble its cable sales in the fast growing Asia Pacific by the end of the decade. BICC closed the week 18p lower at 400p.</p>

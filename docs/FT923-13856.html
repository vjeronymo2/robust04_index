			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Channel Tunnel Invests severs links with past MR PHILIP LING, chairman of Haden MacLennan, is leading a new management team as Channel Tunnel Investments breaks the last links with its past. The company, incorporated in 1881 to promote the building of a tunnel between England and France, is raising Pounds 1.5m by a placing and rights issue, acquiring Carflow, which supplies car and truck locking wheel nuts and other security products, and changing its name to Channel Holdings. It is planned to develop the company into an industrial group by acquisitions. In the year to March 31 Carflow reported pre-tax profits, before exceptional items, of Pounds 572,000. Channel is paying an initial Pounds 2.25m with a further profit-related maximum payment of Pounds 300,000. Channel is making a conditional placing of 6m shares and an underwritten rights issue of 2.93m shares on a 2-for-1 basis at 20p, against a suspension price of 46p. Of the proceeds, Pounds 1.38m will be used to pay part of the Carflow consideration with the balance for working capital. Most of the board is retiring, leaving only Mr Patrick Rogers who becomes chief executive. He is joined by Mr Ling as chairman, Mr Barry Treacy, executive director, and Mr Desmond Mitchell, finance director. For the 1991 year Channel Tunnel Investments reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 10m (Pounds 806,000 profit). Losses per share were 0.8p (earnings 0.04p). At December 31 net assets were Pounds 225,000 with net assets per share of 15p. People, Page 16</p>

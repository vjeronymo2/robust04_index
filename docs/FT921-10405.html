			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar declines amid rate fears THE world economic situation appeared to be conspiring against the dollar as it continued its drift downwards yesterday, helped by fears over a US rate cut and pessimism over German inflation, writes Peggy Hollinger. The US currency came under pressure around the globe, opening lower in New York, London and Tokyo. At the fix in Frankfurt the dollar stood at DM1.5881, compared with Tuesday's DM1.5988. The markets were becoming increasingly nervous ahead of tomorrow's jobs data, which is expected to show anything from a rise in non-farm payrolls of 120,000 to a fall of 100,000. That, together with the likelihood that Germany would retain its more attractive rates for some time to come, encouraged dollar for D-Mark trade. The attraction of Germany was enhanced by strong comments from Bundesbank member Mr Lothar Mueller, that there was no prospect of a rate cut in Germany for some time. The bears on the dollar were restrained, however, by support at the DM1.58 level. The jobs data could make or break that support. The dollar closed in London at DM1.5880, down from the previous close of DM1.5920. In New York, the US currency opened lower at DM1.5835/40 and Y125.72/77, compared with a close of DM1.5925/35 and Y126.15/25 respectively. Sterling enjoyed a brief flutter of excitement as rumours of a political scandal involving a senior UK politician depressed the currency. At one point, sterling was trading at DM2.8640 as dealers worked themselves in a lather over a possible Tory scandal before the general election. However, sterling made a strong recovery when it was revealed that the politician involved was Liberal Democrat leader Mr Paddy Ashdown. The UK currency jumped 100 basis points to DM2.8740 on the news. Sterling finished the day at DM2.87, compared with a previous close of DM2.8675. Against the dollar, sterling finished at Dollars 1.8075, compared with Tuesday's Dollars 1.8005. The Canadian dollar recovered some of the ground it has lost recently. Intervention from the Bank of Canada and the weaker US dollar were believed to be behind its recovery. Both the Canadian and Australian currencies have been suffering as domestic interest rates decline and economic troubles widen. Dr Mark Austin, an economist with HongKong bank, said he expected to see further declines in both currencies. The D-Mark maintained its lead within the European Monetary System, on a generally quiet day. Sterling remained at the bottom of the grid, 44 per cent below its allowed divergence from the central rate. The Bank of Portugal intervened twice yesterday to re-strain the upward flight of the escudo. Dealers said the bank wants to stabilise the currency in advance of Portugal's expected ERM membership later this year or early in the next.</p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> HIGH-TECH RESURRECTS TRADE RITUAL  </P> <P> Dale Williams had the windows of his car tinted, wallpapered his house, bought  new shoes, and went out to eat at dozens of fine restaurants -- all without  spending a penny.  </P> <P> No, he didn't steal anything. Williams got those goods and services the  old-fashioned way: by bartering.  </P> <P> He is among more than 3,000 merchants, laborers and professionals who have  rediscovered barter through an Orange-based company that offers a high-tech  version of the ancient trade ritual.  </P> <P> The outfit, Trade American Card Corp., held its annual barter exposition over  the weekend at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa. Williams was among  hundreds of people who flocked to the event to eyeball the goods jammed into an  airy exhibit hall.  </P> <P> "So far, I got myself some shoes, and I'm working a deal for some Western boots  for my daughter for Christmas," said Williams, who trades the services of his  typesetting and voice mail firm for other merchandise and services. "Through  the years, I've bartered for a variety of things, just about whatever struck my  fancy."  </P> <P> Under the Trade American Card system, members who pay a $495 initiation fee can  sell their goods and services to others in exchange for trade credits instead  of cash.  </P> <P> Members can then spend the accumulated points on merchandise or professional  services offered by other members. Anyone can join, as long as they have  something worthy of barter.  </P> <P> The range of goods and services traded through the computerized system is vast:  One can barter for a hair transplant or pay for croissants from a bakery.  Professional services offered by members include behavior modification and  biofeedback.  </P> <P> More than 200 restaurants participate in the system, along with graphic  artists, locksmiths, lawyers, lawn mower repairmen and landscape contractors.  An assortment of physicians and dentists can be hired through barter.  </P> <P> "I even gave birth to my daughter on barter -- I traded with my obstetrician,"  noted Sondra Ames, vice president of the Trade American Card network. "And  we've got a mortician who can offer you a casket. From cradle to grave, we've  got it all."  </P> <P> Ames helps run the agency with her husband, Michael, who founded the firm in  the early '70s. Today, more than $1 million a month is bartered by members of  the network, she said. The only money involved is what participants are billed  each month for sales taxes and the 10% cut that Trade American Card takes on  each transaction.  </P> <P> Traditionally, the biggest two days of the year come during the barter expo at  the fairgrounds. This past weekend was no different: Ames said she expected  upward of $2 million in bartering to be done.  </P> <P> At first glance, the folding tables covered with an assortment of wares -- from  cooking utensils and computers to stuffed dolls and sports equipment -- gave  the convention the look of any old swap meet.  </P> <P> But looks can be deceiving. There was nary a dollar bill to be seen. Wallets  were firmly tucked in purses or pockets.  </P> <P> "You can find almost anything here," said Susan Schapel, owner of a Tustin silk  flower shop. "I've put all three of my children in braces through barter. I've  done all my car repairs, 100% of the printing for our shop. And I've done fun  things, like going out to dinner."  </P> <P> Many of the network members are owners of small, independently operated  businesses. Services such as printing, medical help for valued employees, car  repair for commercial vehicles and other work-related services are valued trade  items, Ames said.  </P> <P> Kimberly Salotti said the barter system has helped her 1-year-old  designer-clothing firm get off the ground, easing cash-flow problems and  opening up a whole new market of customers that otherwise might never have  materialized.  </P> <P> "This has been the best business move I've made," she said, estimating that up  to 50% of her business has come through the barter association. "It's a  networking system, and everyone just wants to help." ERIC BAILEY  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> AZINGER CHIPS HIS WAY TO VICTORY  </P> <P> Paul Azinger made a 40-foot chip shot from the rough for a tie-breaking birdie  on the final hole and beat Wayne Levi by one stroke with a course record 267 at  the Greater Hartford Open Sunday.  </P> <P> Azinger, who lost a four-stroke lead on the back nine, repeated his tournament  triumph of 1987, when he beat Levi and Dan Forsman by a stroke.  </P> <P> "It was a Jekyll and Hyde round. I probably have never hit the ball in my life  as well as I hit it on the first nine holes," said Azinger, who shot  six-under-par 65 in the final round. "I became very unsure of myself (after  that)."  </P> <P> Levi, the co-leader after the third round, had a 67 Sunday and 268.  </P> <P> Azinger, 29, seemed to have a safe lead when he shot six-under-par 30 on the  front nine and went 17 under.  </P> <P> At that point, Levi was in second place, four strokes behind after eight holes.  </P> <P> Levi began his charge on the 585-yard ninth hole, in which he birdied. Then, he  birdied the 10th and 12th to cut Azinger's lead to one stroke.  </P> <P> Azinger, at the 14th hole, was making his fifth consecutive par, but Levi made  an eight-foot birdie putt on the 13th to tie for the lead.  </P> <P> Moments after Azinger bogeyed the 446-yard 15th hole, Levi bogeyed the 424-yard  14th, leaving both at 16 under. They stayed there until Azinger played the  18th.  </P> <P> The record since the event moved to the TPC of Connecticut in 1984 had been  269, the score of four of the previous five winners.  </P> <P> On his last 41 holes, Azinger had 11 birdies, 29 pars and one bogey.  </P> <P> He moved from 11th place to fourth on the tour's earning list. The $180,000  first-place prize in the $1 million purse gave him $597,499 for the year. He  has finished in the top 10 in nine of his 18 tournaments.  </P> <P> Dave Rummells shot 66 to finish third at 14-under-par 270. Jim Carter, with a  66, Lee Trevino, with a 67, and Mark Calcavecchia, with a 69, tied for fourth  at 271.  </P> <P> Penny Hammel, holding off challenges by Nancy Lopez and Betsy King in the final  nine holes, won by two strokes for her second Jamie Farr Toledo tournament  championship.  </P> <P> Hammel, whose only two victories in her five years on the LPGA tour have come  in the Farr, closed with an even-par 71 to finish at seven-under-par 206 at the  Highland Meadows Golf Club in Sylvania, Ohio.  </P> <P> Lopez, with a final-round 68 after back-to-back 70s, shared second place with  reigning U.S. Open champion Liselotte Neumann and three-time Open champion  Hollis Stacy at five-under 208.  </P> <P> Lopez's tie for second marked the fourth time she has finished second in the  Farr.  </P> <P> Neumann, defending her Open championship next week at the Indianwood Golf and  Country Club at Lake Orion, Mich., finished with a 71 after starting the day  alone in second place, two strokes back of Hammel.  </P> <P> Stacy closed with her second consecutive 68 after a first-round 72.  </P> <P> Bob Charles of New Zealand rallied from two strokes back with a seven-under-par  65 to win the $300,000 Seniors Classic in Concord, Mass., his third victory on  the tour this year.  </P> <P> Charles' 54-hole total of 16-under-par 200 was three shots better than Mike  Hill, who closed with a 69 and a total of 203.  </P> <P> Dale Douglass and Bruce Crampton each had final-round 71s and were tied at 204,  12 under.  </P></p>

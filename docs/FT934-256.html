			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Right-wing leader limps back to Moscow Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Russia's ultra-nationalist leader, yesterday returned to Moscow after a controversial 10-day trip to Europe, during which he was refused an entry visa to Germany and Bulgarian authorities expelled him. Mr Zhirinovsky and seven of his aides had been due to arrive in Berlin last night at the start of an 18-day visit. However, a spokesman for Germany's Foreign Ministry said the leader of Russia's Liberal Democratic party was barred from entering the country on the grounds that his presence would damage German interests. The German media had earlier this month sharply criticised the authorities for granting Mr Zhirinovsky a visa. Bulgarian authorities deported the maverick politician after accusing him of meddling in the country's internal affairs. Mr Zhirinovsky, who is reported to have referred to President Zhelyu Zhelev as 'scum', was stranded at Sofia airport because of a pilots' strike. The Russian politician has hardly spared a government or leader from his insults since embarking on his trip to Europe 10 days ago. Romania's parliamentary deputies and senators yesterday condemned Mr Zhirinovsky's statement in which he referred to their nation as 'an artificial state of Italian gypsies'. He also accused Greece and Turkey of planning to conquer the Balkans. The Russian Foreign Ministry has distanced itself from Mr Zhirinovsky and said attention only served to give him more publicity. 'Russia has nothing to do with the statements of the Liberal Democratic party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky and does not share his opinions,' an official said.</p>

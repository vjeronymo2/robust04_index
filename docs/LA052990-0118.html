			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> GROWTH IS MAIN ISSUE IN GENTEEL CAMPAIGN FOR DANA POINT COUNCIL;  </P> <P> ELECTION: CANDIDATES DISAGREE -- BUT POLITELY -- ON WHETHER OR NOT THE CITY  SHOULD BE DEVELOPED AS A TOURIST DESTINATION.  </P> <P> A growing dispute over the direction this small South County beach community  should be taking as it moves into the 21st Century is perhaps best summed up by  a campaign slogan.  </P> <P> "Do you want a destination point or a Dana Point?" City Council candidate  Thomas B. Moy asked during a recent speech to local business owners who had  gathered to hear the seven candidates pitch their political wares.  </P> <P> With a week left before voters go to the polls in the first City Council  election since Dana Point was formed 17 months ago, the issue over whether the  city should remain a bedroom community or become a world-class tourist resort  has emerged as the major campaign topic.  </P> <P> And, as the city is poised to begin drafting its general plan -- the blueprint  for future development -- three of four challengers are hoping there is enough  dissatisfaction over the city's growth to unseat at least one of the three  incumbents.  </P> <P> "Dana Point is going to look, I'm afraid, like Long Beach if we don't watch  out," said optometrist William L. Petersen. "We moved here because we liked the  small beach town atmosphere. The powers that be don't seem to be looking at it  that way."  </P> <P> Incumbents Mike Eggers, Eileen Krause and Ingrid McGuire face their first  opposition since the city was incorporated in January, 1989. In addition to Moy  and Petersen, they are being challenged by Harold Kaufman and Karen Lloreda.  </P> <P> Although no one publicly acknowledges that some candidates are running as a  slate, Eggers, Krause and Lloreda have received endorsements from the Coastal  Taxpayers and the Dana Point Chamber of Commerce. Eggers and Krause are the  only two to be endorsed by the South County Republican Assembly.  </P> <P> "I'm not running with anybody," Eggers said. "The slate is created by the  (endorsing agencies) and not created by the candidates."  </P> <P> Eggers, Orange County chief of staff for Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), is the  only candidate to stress fiscal responsibility as the most important issue in  the campaign.  </P> <P> As such, he calls himself a "destination resort booster," saying that an  increased emphasis on high-end tourism would bring much-needed tax dollars into  the city coffers.  </P> <P> "Out-of-town visitors are the cleanest industry we can have," said Eggers, who  headed formation of an economic development commission early in his term as  councilman. "When somebody comes here for a vacation, they are, in essence,  paying for police protection, helping to pay for street maintenance. And yet  they don't live here."  </P> <P> McGuire is the only incumbent to call for strict limits on growth and tourism  in the city.  </P> <P> "I think it's important for someone on the council to represent the majority of  citizens," said McGuire, who has led efforts to increase the use of  drought-resistant landscaping in the city as a way to conserve water.  </P> <P> Other than the issue of growth and tourism, however, the campaign leading up to  next Tuesday's election has been notable for its lack of major controversy.  </P> <P> The candidates have remained unusually cordial throughout the campaign, which  has included three public forums sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce and the  League of Women Voters.  </P> <P> Even the challengers, who admit to an uphill battle for a council seat, say  that they are proud to be running what can best be described as genteel  campaigns.  </P> <P> "We've always gone about our business in a very professional manner," said  Kaufman, who lost his bid for a seat on the charter council in June, 1988, and  now serves as chairman of the city's Planning Commission. "That attitude has  been carried forward."  </P> <P> Like Moy and Petersen, Kaufman said he believes the city has developed too  fast. The council, he said, should have taken action, despite the fact that  most development agreements were approved before the council members took  office.  </P> <P> Kaufman, who directs out-of-court settlements for a living, said that as a  council member he would be able to act as a mediator between various interests.  </P> <P> But, he said, he would fight to keep large-scale development out of the city.  </P> <P> "Our density ought to be reduced," Kaufman said, adding that the city should  allow only limited development on the Headlands, one of the last large,  undeveloped coastal areas in the city, where several hotel complexes have been  proposed in recent years.  </P> <P> City officials have supported turning the 115-acre parcel into a billion-dollar  resort as a way to help finance city services, including increased police  protection, road improvements and a future City Hall.  </P> <P> Lloreda, president of the Capistrano Beach Community Assn. and the only  candidate to live in that section of the city, has joined incumbent Krause in  urging stronger anti-drug and anti-gang programs.  </P> <P> Many residents in the Capistrano Beach business district, where Lloreda enjoys  her strongest support, have complained that police have been unable to stem  crime in their neighborhood.  </P> <P> They have complained that drugs are sold openly in alleyways, frightening  potential customers and threatening the quality of life in Capistrano Beach.  </P> <P> "These people feel that the problems have gone too far," Lloreda said. "Some of  them are ready to close up shop."  </P> <P> Lloreda, a supporter of revitalization in the aging business district, said  that the council needs a Capistrano Beach representative to ensure that future  redevelopment projects benefit the community.  </P> <P> "Capistrano Beach can offer the city of Dana Point a lot, but it has to be  carefully done," Lloreda said.  </P> <P> Krause, the city's current mayor, said that besides developing the general  plan, establishing a workable redevelopment project and controlling traffic,  one of the most important issues facing voters in this election is stemming  drug and gang activity in Dana Point.  </P> <P> She said that the current council has been facing all those issues and will  continue to do so if left intact.  </P> <P> "We've set the tone of (the city's future) as a council," Krause said. "We have  set the tone of professionalism. Everyone is comfortable with the way things  are going. Even the ones that disagree with us are supportive."  </P> <P> Krause said that the lack of a more vocal campaign is proof that the honeymoon  period with the current council is continuing. Even the challengers, she said,  have not come up with any strong criticisms of the present council.  </P> <P> "I think we all want the same thing," Krause said. "We want the city to be the  best city it can be."  </P> <P> </P> <P> DANA POINT CITY COUNCIL  </P> <P> Incumbents:  </P> <P> Mike Eggers  </P> <P> Home: Dana Point  </P> <P> Age: 42  </P> <P> Occupation: Congressional aide  </P> <P> Background: Eggers has served as the Orange County chief of staff for Rep.

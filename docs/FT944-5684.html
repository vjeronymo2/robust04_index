			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / People: AA marks Geoff Bruce's card While AA insurance continues its job-shedding exercise, its companion operation - AA Financial Services - is gearing up to expand and improve its services and products. To oversee this task, Geoff Bruce has been headhunted from Visa International, the card payment organisation, to become director of AA Financial Services. Bruce, 43, had been at Visa since 1990, with responsibility for developing products in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and sounds pleased to have escaped to more direct contact with customers. 'Visa is a membership organisation, its members are banks and you're dealing with them on a bank-to-bank footing,' he says. 'Here, you're dealing with people; it's more on the frontline.' Having become an AA member himself on taking up his post last month, his mission now is to extend the financial services operation's reach further into the 4m personal members of the AA, and to develop further the instalment credit schemes, Visa cards and loan accounts AA already offers. Both he and Mark Wood, who runs AA's insurance, financial services and retail arms, plan to extend operations into new areas, such as motor finance. 'So long as we always recognise that the core of the relationship with the AA member is the road service, and associate other activities very closely to that, then I think the member will see an integrated value in the services we provide,' he says.

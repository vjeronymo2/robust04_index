			<p>BFN     [Text] His Eminence Acting Mufti Shaykh Muhammad Rashid  Qabbani has denounced as piracy Israel's kidnapping of al-Hajj  Mustafa al-Dirani, a Lebanese national resistance official, from  his house in Qasr Naba and carting him off to occupied Palestine.    His eminence said it is high time for the Arab nation to  wake  up, unify its ranks, and curb Israel's continued acts of piracy.  He said that the unity of objectives, thoughts, stances, and  decisions; the rallying of all potentials and energies; and  joint planning to attain the objective of our nation to salvage  its honor and regain its rights and glory represent the sole way  toward salvation.    Shaykh Qabban add: This is a frank call for confronting  Israel's designs, which is lying in wait for our Arab nation.</p>

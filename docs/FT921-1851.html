			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Jobs to be cut in mail sorting THE POST OFFICE confirmed yesterday that its Royal Mail subsidiary expected to shed about a third of the 45,000 jobs in letter-sorting over the next few years as a result of a Pounds 250m investment programme. Machinery is being introduced which will be able to read handwritten post codes rather than just typed addresses as at present. That will help Royal Mail deal with an expected 18 per cent growth in volume over the next five years and improve the quality of the service. Royal Mail stressed that the job losses in sorting, estimated at 15,000, would not require compulsory redundancies and that some staff will transfer to other parts of its operations, which will expand. The Union of Communication Workers, the main Post Office union, said it was surprised about the numbers of jobs that might be shed but said it knew about the technology plans. It also pointed to a national agreement on new technology which commits the Post Office to consulting the union and avoiding compulsory redundancies. Mr Alan Johnson, UCW general-secretary elect, said he hoped the introduction of new technology would cut the number of staff who have to work a six-day week.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Clyde calls for Pounds 34m as losses hit Pounds 40m CLYDE Petroleum, the UK exploration and production company, yesterday called on shareholders for Pounds 34m and at the same time reported an after-tax loss of Pounds 39.8m for 1992. That compared with a previous deficit of Pounds 1.2m, a figure restated to conform with accounting changes which forced the company to write off Pounds 80m of previously unsuccessful exploration expenditure. Mr Colin Phipps, chairman, said the rights issue would give the company a cash cushion following the go-ahead of its development of the Gryphon field in the North Sea later this year. 'This is a major sea-change within Clyde - we're moving to the fast track development of Gryphon,' he said. Originally, Gryphon was due to come on stream in 1996 but Clyde now plans to start production in the final quarter of this year. That would involve investment of Pounds 90m - Clyde has a 35 per cent stake in Gryphon - this year which would push the company's debt to equity ratio to over 100 per cent. Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said: 'We're at a peak of our expenditure this year and the rights issue will help keep that under control'. The rights issue, of 79.86m shares on a 1-for-4 basis, will give the company the flexibility to continue its exploration programme overseas while it proceeds with UK developments. Clyde is also involved in the offshore development of the Wytch Farm oilfield in Dorset, the Stirling oilfield and several gas fields in the Netherlands. Some 90 per cent of the company's commercial reserves will come on stream by 1994. Cashflow will increase to Pounds 350m next year as the company's production rises to 55,000 barrels a day in the second quarter from a current level of 23,874 b/d. With the strong cashflow, the company plans to pay down its debt quickly and reduce gearing from the 100 per cent level to 60 per cent by 1994 and 15 per cent by the end of 1996. The company is looking at break-even this year with possibly a small profit or loss. For 1994, when it hopes to return to profit, it plans to pay an interim dividend of 0.5p followed by a final of 1p. Clyde is continuing its exploration efforts in the Yemen and Syria as well as some small developments in the Netherlands. Turnover for 1992 dropped to Pounds 83.3m (Pounds 87.2m). COMMENT Investors taking up the rights issue are demonstrating their faith in the management to continue growing the company beyond its production peak in 1994. But at 44p a share, the rights issue is priced at a discount to the company's net asset value, which is estimated to be between 50p and 56p a share. The company will reach a peak in production and see a big increase in earnings and cashflow in the next few years. But investors must ask how sustainable this is. Clyde is clearly hoping for good exploration success in the Yemen, the results of which will become apparent towards the end of the year. Without good success in exploration, the company will be looking at making an acquisition over the next 18 months. Investors should be able to bank on a dividend in 1994, but they will be hoping to see some clear evidence of oil discoveries before then.</p>

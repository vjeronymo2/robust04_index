			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Claudiu Harcioaga: "Restoration Is Being </F> Prepared in the Army -- The Slave of the Power"]    [Text] A number of young army officers, the names of whom  we will not disclose to protect them, have warned us that  important changes will be carried out within the leadership of  the Romanian Armed Forces. Thus, commanders of various units  are to be replaced with "political commissaries of the Ceausescu  era," under the pretext that during their lengthy careers and  especially after 1989 the latter "distinguished" themselves by  not making any mistakes. The same sources revealed that this  genuine restoration is to take place with the consent of the new  defense minister, Mr. Gheorghe Tinca, whom the military consider  "the slave of the power," and that the move is part of Romania's  "new" military orientation distinguishable over the past month,  intended to establish a full-scale alliance with Russia.    Considering that Mr. Adrian Nastase [speaker of the Chamber  of Deputies and executive chairman of the Social Democracy Party  of Romania] is also pleading for the replacement of the army  commanders appointed by the former defense minister [Lieutenant  General Niculae Spiroiu], there are no more doubts left as to  the efforts made by the state power to place the armed forces  under its authority.</p>

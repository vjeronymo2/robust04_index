			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Irina Shchegoleva] </F>   [Text] Sochi, 6 May -- During meetings between Russian  Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov, Russian Deputy Defense  Minister Georgiy Kondratyev, and the leadership of Abkhazia, an  understanding was reached that peacekeeping forces should be  introduced along the confrontation line and not on the entire  territory of Abkhazia, as the Georgian side was insisting.    Today, the Abkhazian Information and Press Ministry informed  an ITAR-TASS correspondent about this and noted that these  consultations pursued the goal of agreeing the positions of the  sides on the eve of a regular round of the Georgian-Abkhazian  talks, which should be held in Moscow on 11 May.</p>

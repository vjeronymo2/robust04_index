			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Phil Harris plans listing SIR PHIL HARRIS, who sold the Harris Queensway furniture and carpet group in 1988 and then saw it go into receivership, is planning to take his Carpetright retail chain public next year, he said yesterday. He received about Pounds 70m for his shares in Harris Queensway when it was taken over for Pounds 450m. He then set up the Carpetright chain, with some backing from MFI Furniture Group, which still has a 22 per cent stake. Mr Derek Hunt, chairman of MFI, is also head of Carpetright, which rents 18 stores from MFI. Sir Phil was speaking at the annual meeting of Great Universal Stores, the retail and finance group, where he is a non-executive director. Lord Wolfson, chairman of GUS, told his shareholders that profits for the half year to end-September were ahead of the comparable period last year. Then they were Pounds 186.6m. Asked by a shareholder about possible enfranchisement of the non-voting shares, Lord Wolfson said the matter was being kept under review.</p>

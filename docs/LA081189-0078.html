			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> City officials Thursday announced that an $80,000 grant from the San Diego  Housing Commission will fund the efforts of the city's first Fair Housing  Council, formed to combat housing discrimination citywide.  </P> <P> The council will use the money to hire staff members who will educate renters,  landlords, apartment owners and the public about the requirements of federal  fair-housing laws. The organization will also take complaints from home seekers  who believe they have been victims of discrimination and will send out  anonymous white and minority volunteers to test for landlord bias.  </P> <P> In a covert audit conducted last year, the Urban League of San Diego found that  blacks seeking apartments in seven separate sections of the city faced  discrimination 40% of the time.  </P> <P> "The major goal of the Fair Housing Council will be to eliminate illegal  housing discrimination through a strong educational program, solicitation of  cooperation from all segments of the community and housing industry and  improved enforcement," said Judith Green, president of the council's interim  board of directors.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD PARK;  </P> <P> SUPER MAY PROVES HIS VERSATILITY, WINS THE MERVYN LEROY HANDICAP  </P> <P> Regarded primarily a turf specialist, Super May won earlier this year in the  slop at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> Sunday at Hollywood Park, the 4-year-old Super Concorde colt also showed he can  handle a dry track, providing trainer Richard Mandella with several options in  the coming months.  </P> <P> Ridden perfectly by Robbie Davis, Jack Kent Cooke's California-bred beat 35-1  shot Charlatan III in the final furlong to win the $211,600 Mervyn LeRoy  Handicap.  </P> <P> Successful in seven of his 16 lifetime starts, Super May, the fifth choice at  8-1 in the 12-horse field, won by a head in 1:40 4/5 for the mile and a  sixteenth.  </P> <P> It was the second stakes and first Grade I victory for Super May, whose last  triumph on a fast main track had come Jan. 21, 1989.  </P> <P> "Knowing how tough the turf races are going to come up here with Golden  Pheasant, Steinlen and Prized, I looked at the nominations to this race and I  thought it would be quite a bit easier than running against them," said  Mandella, who won the Wilshire Handicap two Sundays earlier with 16-1 shot  Reluctant Guest.  </P> <P> "He'd won three races on the dirt before and he's just a better horse this  year, period. So I thought he had a chance of handling the job."  </P> <P> Super May has lost only once in six 1990 starts. He was second to Shining Steel  in the Shoemaker Handicap April 29.  </P> <P> "He had lots of little problems as an early 3-year-old," said Mandella. "In the  four to five months he was off, he developed physically and mentally and is a  better horse."  </P> <P> Davis has ridden Super May seven times and has five victories and two seconds.  </P> <P> "The pace was real strong (22 3/5, 45 3/5 and 1:09 3/5 for the first six  furlongs) and my horse was going along just as comfortable as can be," Davis  said. "I was right about where I wanted to be turning for home because I wanted  to get the jump on Lively One (the 2-1 favorite) before the quarter pole.  </P> <P> "He fired well just like he always does. When I was running head and head (with  Charlatan III) I had all the confidence in the world in him because he's just  as game as can be. He's a very nice horse to ride."  </P> <P> Charlatan III, winless since 1988, was two lengths clear of Lively One, who had  beaten him in Golden Gate's Kensington Handicap two weeks ago.  </P> <P> Bruho was fourth, followed by Stylish Winner, Santangelo, No Marker, Hollywood  Reporter, Payant, French Stress, Swing Shift and Silent Prince.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> According to Bob Selvin of Handicapper's Report, anyone betting $200 to win on  horses breaking from the outside post in one-turn races would, through  Saturday, show an $11,000 profit. Letters Of Love and Duckling Park each won  from the outside Sunday. . . . Timeless Answer ran the fastest six furlongs of  the meeting when he won the seventh, a $60,000 overnight handicap, in 1:08 3/5.  Black Jack Road, the 6-5 favorite, was eliminated at the start when he broke  several lengths behind the field. The Kennedy Road gelding was acting up in the  gate when the latch was sprung.  </P></p>

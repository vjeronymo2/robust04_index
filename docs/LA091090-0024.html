			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL '90;  </P> <P> FILM REVIEWS  </P> <P> Highlights among the more than 100 films and videos from 25 Pacific Rim  countries are reviewed here:  </P> <P> Today  </P> <P> Mother  </P> <P> Indonesia  </P> <P> Screens today at 8 p.m. at Los Feliz Theater, 1822 N. Vermont Ave., Hollywood;  Thursday at 6 p.m. at Melnitz Theater, UCLA  </P> <P> This Indonesian film -- the equivalent to an American liberal "problem" soap  opera -- confronts a stalwart matriarch with a seemingly endless series of  romantic and social quandaries inflicted by her offspring, ranging from  adultery to miscegenation to simple bad manners. The images are wide-screen and  colorful, the decor sedately middle-class, and the actors restrained.  </P> <P> As a contrast, the film juxtaposes, against all this bourgeois comfort and  dissonance, a violent period melodrama: a stage play in which one of the  mother's sons has an inappositely daredevil role. Interesting only as a  seemingly realistic reflection of Indonesian culture and family life, "Mother,"  despite all the sibling trouble and turbulence, never explodes into much  dramatic fire or emotion. It's not exactly a lifeless film, but it's certainly  a careful one. MICHAEL WILMINGTON  </P></p>

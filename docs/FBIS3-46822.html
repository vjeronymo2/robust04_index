The gist of the New Year address was reported by the  Nepalese  papers HINDU DAINIK, NEPAL POST and KUER PRASAD, the BBC  television of India, the SANA News Agency, radio and television  of Syria, the Syrian papers AL-SAURA and TISHRIN and the Thai  paper BANGKOK POST.    The Yemeni paper AL-THAWRAH January 2 said:    "President Kim Il-song of the Democratic People's Republic  of  Korea in his New Year address said it is the United States that  has created the fictitious `doubt about nuclear development by  the North', and it is the United States that has actually  shipped nuclear weapons into the Korean peninsula and has been  threatening the Korean people.    "Pressure or threat will have no effect on the Korean  people,  President Kim Il-song said, warning that such an attempt may  invite catastrophe, far from finding a solution to the problem.    "He stressed that the nuclear problem on the Korean  peninsula  must on any account be settled through Korea-U.S. talks."    The Malaysian paper STAR January 2 quoted President Kim  Il-song as saying "since a joint statement has been adopted by  Korea and the United States, the nuclear problem on the Korean  peninsula can be settled fairly if both sides keep and implement  the principles that have been agreed upon."    The Malaysian radio and television and newspaper NEW STRAITS  TIMES also reported the same content.</p>

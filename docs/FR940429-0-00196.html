			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters responded to the Secretary's request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for comments regarding the acceptability of a ``bond rating'' as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient indicia of a nonprofit institution's financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility. The majority of the commenters expressed support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the use of a bond rating as a means of evaluating financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility. One commenter suggested that the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider an institution to be financially responsible if it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to demonstrate that it has a debt financing arrangement that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is acceptable to the College Construction Loan Authority (Connie  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lee). Another commenter believed that the Secretary should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broaden the definition of acceptable bonds to include other than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general obligation bonds because certain types of revenue bonds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issued by pubic nonprofit institutions also have ratings by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nationally recognized rating agencies. One commenter believed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the Secretary should expand the provision to exempt for-profit institutions with an acceptable bond rating.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary believes that a superior bond rating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may serve as an effective proxy for demonstrating an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's financial responsibility. An institution that has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the capacity to issue a top rated debt security is, in general,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered to have the financial resources necessary to meet all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of its financial obligations. The Secretary believes that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt paying ability of an institution, as determined by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprehensive credit review conducted by a nationally recognized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statistical rating organization, is representative of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's financial health. For an institution's bond rating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to serve as an acceptable proxy, the institution must have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial resources required to obtain a rating at or above the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second highest level used by the rating organization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the Secretary requires that an institution provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence that the issue has been rated without consideration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any insurance, guarantee, or credit enhancement that may have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been used to lower the institution's cost of capital. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary requires that an institution provide an actual rating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since Connie Lee is not a rating organization, financing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrangements that are acceptable to Connie Lee are only eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for consideration to the extent that they are separately rated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a nationally recognized rating organization that is acceptable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary. The Secretary agrees with commenters that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitution of a bond rating for an institution's having to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate financial responsibility should be expanded to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include other forms of rated debt such as revenue bonds. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary also agrees that this provision should be applied to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both nonprofit and for-profit institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 668.15(b)(7)(ii), (b)(8)(ii) and (b)(9)(v)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been added to provide that the Secretary shall consider an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to be financially responsible if the institution is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has an outstanding debt obligation which has been rated by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nationally recognized statistical rating organization at or above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the second highest level rated by that organization. To be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable to the Secretary, an institution's debt must have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rated without consideration of any insurance, guarantee, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit enhancement employed by the institution to lower its cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of capital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General standards of financial responsibility. Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters expressed concern that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's requirement that an institution submit an audited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial statement without qualification or disclaimer was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly burdensome because the commenters believed an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution is likely to be faced with a ``qualified'' statement as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a result of adopting new accounting standards mandated under FAS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 117.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary believes that the reliability of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial statement is dependent upon the ability of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's independent auditor to determine and report that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the information contained within the financial statements is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fair representation of the institution's financial resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The auditor will issue a qualified statement if the auditor is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unable to determine that the information is a fair representation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of any uncertainty. It is the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility to identify the cause of the uncertainty and make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> every reasonable effort to correct it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

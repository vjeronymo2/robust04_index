			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) There are no known long-term degradation mechanisms which would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause the seal to fail within the design life of the DSC; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The possibility of corrosion has been included in the design (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SER Section 3.2.2.5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These conditions ensure that the internal helium atmosphere will remain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stable. Therefore, an individual continuous monitoring device for each HSM is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not necessary. However, the NRC considers that other forms of monitoring,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including periodic surveillance, inspection and survey requirements, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of preexisting radiological environmental monitoring programs of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 CFR Part 50 during the use of the canisters with seal weld closures can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequately satisfy NRC requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the use of instrumentation and control systems to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitor systems that are important to safety, the user of the Standardized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NUHOMS will, as provided in Chapter 14 of the SER and in Section 1.3.2 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certificate of Compliance, be required to verify, the cask thermal performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a daily basis by a temperature measurement, to identify conditions that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threaten to approach cask design temperature criteria. The cask user will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also be required to conduct a daily visual surveillance of the cask air inlets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and outlets as required by Chapter 12 of the SER and Section 1.3.1 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certificate of Compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the HSM and DSC are considered components important to safety,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are not considered operating systems in the same sense as spent fuel pool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooling water systems or ventilation systems that may require other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrumentation and control systems to ensure proper functioning. Due to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passive design, temperature monitoring and surveillance activities are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate and sufficient to assure adequate protection of the public health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and safety for this design.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the Standardized NUHOMS DSC is welded closed and has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decontaminated before being placed in a HSM, there is no routine radioactive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liquid generation that would require a retention basin or sump. Water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entering the storage area has no mechanism of becoming contaminated because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the DSC is enclosed within the HSM and is expected to be dried by the heat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated during storage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C.2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter expressed concern over the possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> external corrosion of the stainless steel DSC because of exposure to water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over decades. Another commenter expressed concern about corrosion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stainless steel under conditions of indefinite duration, stating that while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stainless steel corrodes less rapidly than carbon steel, even the plumbing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fixture industry is finding unexpected stainless steel pitting and corrosion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under conditions far less intense than those in a DSC. Another commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that the system is not designed for remote inspection of the DSC for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrosion while it is in the HSM and that the only way to inspect the DSC is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to return it to the spent fuel pool. Periodic inspection of the DSC is needed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to preclude or identify gradual canister deterioration by unknown mechanisms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter inquired about a checking system for the NUHOMS in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future. How will corrosion be evaluated on the canister (DSC) and the support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rails inside the HSM? Is it possible for them to accumulate moisture and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrode together over possibly many years of storage? What check is required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the possibility that the canister couldn't be removed at the end of cask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

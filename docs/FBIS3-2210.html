The State Administration for Industry and Commerce has  launched a trial programme to ensure the business is handled  only by designated advertising companies .    The programme began last Tuesday [1 March] in the Guangdong  cities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Foshan and  Zhanjiang.    The administration said the rules and regulations now  prohibited the cities' media units from seeking or meeting  clients for their own advertising business.    Domestic and foreign enterprises in the six cities who want  to put ads in magazines and newspapers or on radio and  television must use government-approved advertising agencies to  deal with the media.    Officials with the administration said the trial in  Guangdong  Province was likely to pave the way for a similar programme  nationwide.    "It aims to give a fair chance of competition to the  country's advertising companies," said one who declined to be  named.    At present, media units are monopolizing their own  advertising trade, which is often handled by so-called  circulation or advertising promotion departments, instead of by  government-backed agencies.    The official said overseas enterprises, including foreign  advertising companies, must also consult domestic agencies about  any work they require.    The reason is simple, the official said, as competition  heats  up companies are advertising more and more.    If things are left to develop uncontrolled, there will be  chaos, he added.    Domestic companies are also keen to use celebrities as the  heavy artillery in the battle for a slice of the market.    Many film, television and sports stars are lighting up  commercial breaks across China.    Chinese companies spent 13.4 billion yuan ($1.56 billion) on  advertising last year, an incredible 13.3 billion yuan ($1.54  billion) more than 13 years ago.    The figures have rocketed as stronger competition forces  enterprises to seek every means possible to make their brands  stand out.    At the same time the government has come to realise the need  to reinforce the management of the advertising market.    It is still in its infancy, and while the State sanctioned  specific ad agencies, anyone could still set themselves up to  sell space or air time around the country.    This potentially lucrative business has already attracted  more than 310,000 people in terms of the employed workers around  the country.    China has 31,000 advertising agencies--15,000 more than at  the beginning of last year.</p>

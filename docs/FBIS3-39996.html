			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Patrick Marx report: "GATT: Aeronautics Back on the </F> Scene"]    [Text] Jean Pierson, managing director of Airbus Industrie,  feels that the American attitude toward the Saudi contract  proves that, in their view, "GATT is just a piece of paper,"  valid only "for other people." Aerospatiale Director Louis  Gallois feels that American political pressure should ecourage  Europeans to examine this very revolutionary way in selling  airplanes.    In effect, the Saudi contract revives the U.S.-European  dispute about international trade in airliners, an issue that  was not resolved during the recent marathon of GATT  negotiations, since the United States preferred not to make any  conclusions on this point until they could find a chink in the  armor of European defenses. It refused to include the 1992  agreement as one of the exceptions to the GATT general rules,  and it is still seeking to limit Airbus influence in the world  while attacking the consortium for the reimbursable advances  which its industrial partners receive from the four countries  involved in the the project (France, Germany, Great Britain, and  Spain). At the same time the United States defends tooth and  nail their own system of indirect support through military  research programs which lead to civilian spin-offs.    It was hoped that the agreement reached in 1992 between  Washington and Brussels on direct and indirect public aid to the  civilian aviation industry would calm moods. The Saudi affair  shows that this is simply not the case. By referring to GATT,  the leaders of the European aeronautics industry are baulking at  Washington's argument, because Article 4 of the text concerning  the trade in airliners expressly states that "the signatories  shall refrain from subjecting airlines (...) to excessive  pressure for the purpose of buying civilian aircraft of a given  origin, which would entail discrimination against suppliers from  another signatory."    By announcing the signature of the Saudi contract, Bill  Clinton provided the Europeans with a weighty argument during  the negotiations on the aeronautics section of GATT which are to  enter a crucial phase this year.</p>

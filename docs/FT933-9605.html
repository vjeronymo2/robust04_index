			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Arts: Goehr at Tanglewood - Music Tanglewood is the most celebrated and influential of America's numerous summer music festivals. With its concert series and renowned summer school for performers and composers - the Tanglewood Music Centre - it is blessed beyond its musical distinctions with as romantic a site and mountain prospect as can be found anywhere. Dating back to the early 1930s, the festival has from the start been a major enterprise of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, whose then conductor, Serge Koussevitzky, created the school and selected the architect (Eliel Saarinen) for the famous 'shed' - an enormous radial structure, open at one end to the elements, but possessed of remarkable acoustics - which since its 50th anniversary, in 1988, has borne his name. Beyond the shed's slender posts stretch immense lawns shaded by a fantasy of lofty trees and decorated by topiary hedges, a vine trellis and a recently installed 'analemmatic' sundial. Besides the shed, there is a 'theatre-concert hall' for recitals, student concerts and the events of the subsidiary Festival of Contemporary Music. A new concert hall now being built will release the theatre-concert hall for operatic productions by the TMC. The shed seats 5,000. When the lawns are fully occupied, the total capacity is well over 16,000, and the feeling is truly of a 'national' occasion. The main (orchestral) concerts take place on Friday and Saturday nights and Sunday afternoons throughout July and August - a total of 22 appearances by the BSO this year, in programmes making a feature of Tchaikovsky and Rakhmaninov, respectively 100 and 50 years dead. Very much alive - nearly 61 years old - is the British composer Alexander Goehr, who is in residence the summer long to teach the TMC composition fellows and enjoy a 'mini-festival' of performances of half a dozen of his own works, including a repeat of the 25-minute piece Colossos or Panic, Op. 55, written to a Koussevitzky commission for the BSO and premiered at Symphony Hall, Boston, last April. (It was warmly welcomed on this page by Paul Griffiths.) The Goehr context was nicely sketched in a 'Prelude' concert by the Tanglewood Festival Chorus - his a cappella Imitations of Baudelaire (1985)  -and the three programmes forming the first half of this year's contemporary music festival. Composer-conductor Oliver Knussen has been in charge of the latter for seven years, and for this his last festival he has chosen to arrange the concerts in two 'clusters' separated by three weeks. Treats such as Stockhausen's Gruppen for three orchestras are in store for the end of the month. Meanwhile we have had some sufficiently fascinating evenings. On August 1, for instance, TMC players and conductors began with Robin Holloway's aptly mosquitoey and stickily-irritable Summer Music (1992), proceeded to a dynamic, high-definition Stefan Wolpe quartet (From Here On Farther, 1969), Hanns Eisler's amazingly deft, deliciously fleet Fourteen Ways of Describing Rain, Op. 70 (originally a film score), and a rare and tantalising bit of Busoni (the Red Indian-inspired Song of the Spirit Dance, from 1915), before ending with Goehr's superbly cogent and touching Little Symphony, Op. 16 (1963), in an account under Knussen's own direction that was a model of keenness and clarity. Goehr's fine piano trio (1966) had been played the previous night; and the following night brought his ambitious and curious song-cycle to Frank Kermode's elaborate cento of English poems, Sing, Ariel, Op. 51 (1990), conducted by Knussen, its dedicatee. The work is curious not least because the instrumental parts, or at any rate the piano and double-bass cadenzas, tend to sound more commandingly lyrical than the mezzo-soprano (Lucy Shelton) herself or her two soprano accomplices. The big Goehr orchestral piece, given on a Sunday afternoon programme under (as before) Seiji Ozawa, also struck me as curious - impressive, original, felicitous, but not untypically evasive in sensibility and gesture. I find it nearly impossible to relate the music to the alarming Goya image on which it is allegedly founded. The colossus to which the two movements do react is more likely the monster of Musical Tradition. This is a self-proclaimed 'symphonic fragment', not a symphony. It seeks to avoid and yet has been partially crushed by the giant foot of the Past. Steeped in traditional rhetoric, the music nonetheless attempts to reduce it to ridicule. The two movements seem uncertain of their precise function while toying with symphonic archetypes. A scherzo-and-trio form is buried in the first (and longer) of them. The second, marked Maestoso, evokes the pulsing string lines, the ecstatic melodic sequences of a Bruckner Adagio, but instantly wrecks such expressivity with ironic measured clops of the celesta. There is great beauty, though, to be found in ruins, and Ozawa's confident reading revealed it in all its strangeness.</p>

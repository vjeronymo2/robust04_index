			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: And the next job is, dying - Nigel Spivey would have liked a pint with Blake Morrison's dad / Books AND WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER? by Blake Morrison Granta Boks Pounds 14.99, 219 pages ALL DECENT people have a book like this within themselves. The marvel is that so few get round to sustaining it, though scribbled reminiscences must sit in plenty of old desk drawers. For a son to celebrate his father's life might be reckoned an act of common piety; but it also becomes an exercise in self-definition, from the moment one utters a certain phrase and hears the old man speak. Towards the end of his account, Blake Morrison reveals that he has taken to seeing a therapist since his father's death. Perhaps, then, it is not only piety and self-definition, but therapy too. There is nothing extraordinary to report about Arthur Morrison, GP and Yorkshireman. He was not a saint. He indulged in some gentle but steady adultery, he enjoyed minor infringements of the law, he believed in no god, and he spent every Sunday Simonizing his car (the law, he thought, was less inclined to catch a speeding car if it was clean). He loved his children and his wife, and was evidently held in local affection. You would have welcomed his predictable chat over a pint and, more or less, trusted his medical sense. He died of cancer of the bowel, but he was 75 when he went. The reportage of his death is poignant, but he seems like the sort of GP who would have despised the notion that you have to die of something in old age, as if otherwise you might carry on for centuries. As a ghost he makes a late appearance and demands of his son 'What's the big deal about death?', but we are not confined to the moribund man and the book is not all loaded with grief. Astringent flashbacks catch father and son at intervals over 40 years  -camping in the Lakes, polishing that car, tinkering with their DIY chores. Even an expert at the father-son relationship like Arthur Miller would be hard pushed to make anything dramatic of this yet, curiously, the book does not suffer for lack of drama. Father in his dying state is not like the drunken Noah, needing to be covered up. He meets death with dignity. His peccadilloes have no tragic consequences, and those occasions when the term 'old sod' seems to fit him best are related without rancour. The power of the book is drawn from its ordinariness. Never mind that this is a literary editor at work: the fact is that the subject of the hagiography is a man only ever seen with a copy of Jaws in his hands (and he never finished that). What we like is the characterisation of a survivor, who is easily understood by his endearing paternal dicta ('How much for cash?'). The last vignette is bitten-off, and brilliantly done. Four weeks before his death, he is still in charge around his son's London house, having just mended a chandelier. He switches it on to test it. Then off again. And in the darkness: 'Excellent. What's the next job, then?'</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU to finance African mining investment forum The European Union is financing a forum to take place next month in Lusaka aimed at increasing European investment and co-operation in the Southern African mining industry. About 200 European companies will attend the three-day, by-invitation-only event where they will be presented with details of nearly 200 projects in 10 of the SADAC (Southern African Development Community) countries: Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The EU points out that annual mineral production in the region is worth an estimated USDollars 4bn and the mining sector's contribution to gross domestic product is substantial, averaging 11 per cent for the region. Nevertheless, the potential for developing new small and medium-sized mines is large but this has not been realised because of lack of investment. The region also offers great exploration potential. Two-thirds of the forum time will be given over to private meetings between European and African company representatives and the EU says a computerised meeting scheduling system has been set up to facilitate these discussions.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [AFP, YONHAP report from Vienna] </F>   [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] warned  on 14 May that if the work of replacing the North Korean nuclear  fuel rods reaches "a serious stage," [simgakhan tangye] the IAEA  inspection team will suspend its inspection and leave earlier  than scheduled.    IAEA spokesman David Kyd said that the inspection team will  leave Vienna on 15 May and arrive in Yongbyon, North Korea  sometime on 17 May. He said that the inspection team will  confirm whether North Korea has just started regular preparation  measures to replace the fuel rods at the five megawatt-class  atomic reactor or it has already reached "a serious stage" of  carrying out the replacement work such as unloading the nuclear  rods. He added that the inspection team is scheduled to stay in  North Korea for eight days, but that their stay there may be  extended.</p>

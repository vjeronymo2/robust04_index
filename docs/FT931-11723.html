			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: DnB considers separate units DEN norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, is considering a sweeping reorganisation of its corporate structure to strengthen its healthier operations which have been weakened by five years of massive credit losses and mounting non-performing loans, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. The bank is considering establishing a holding company structure under which a so-called 'good bank,' its healthy operations, would be established. A 'project bank' would also be established. This would hold non-performing loans, high-risk loans and property acquired by the bank which served as collateral for loans which became non-performing.</p>

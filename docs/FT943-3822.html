			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt As Germans ponder for whom to vote in the October general election at a time of accelerating economic recovery, the bond market is faced with a different question. Do German short-term interest rates have further to fall - however little - or is the downward trend now over? It is not an easy one to answer, especially in light of renewed US interest rate rise fears caused by last Friday's wholesale price data. Nor is it likely that this Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting will provide any insights. The latest German economic data has reinforced the views of those who expect no more cuts in the discount and Lombard rates. Germany's recovery, they argue, needs no further help from interest rates. Bundesbank directors were at pains to dampen speculation in the bond market, thrown off course at the start of last week by comments suggesting no more cuts were in the offing. In the confusion, 10-year Bund yields approached 7.5 per cent. SG Warburg said they could soon exceed 7.75 per cent but then tail off to 7.5 per cent as funding pressures ease and political certainty returns. Those seeing further rate cuts on the horizon point to falling money supply growth and inflation, hopes of moderate wage rises, and a lower government deficit but their optimism could be dashed by events in the US.</p>

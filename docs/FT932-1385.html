			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Central bank cuts Indian interest rate THE Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said it was cutting the minimum lending rate for banks by one percentage point to 16 per cent from today, Reuter reports from Bombay. Bankers said the central bank had apparently moved to reduce interest rates and further stimulate the economy following the arrival on schedule of monsoon rains and the reduction of inflation to less than 6 per cent. Inflation as measured by the wholesale price index has come down to a year-on-year 5.8 per cent from 13 per cent a year ago. Business leaders said the interest rate cut appeared designed to refocus attention on the economy at a time when Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao was embroiled in allegations that he received an improper campaign donation from a stock broker involved in the country's biggest financial scandal.</p>

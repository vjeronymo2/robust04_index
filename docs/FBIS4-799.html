			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In Rwanda, fighting grew more intense in the  capital today. Fighting between the armed forces and the  Patriotic Front [RPF] even reached the center of Kigali. UNAMIR  [United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda] reported intense  fighting with light weapons and shells lasting for about two  hours.    Dug in at the old parliament building, which dominates the  east of the town, the RPF leaders repeated to the few  journalists there that they were still fully resolved to take  the town if the killings did not stop.    According to our colleague from AFP, the conversation was  punctuated by deafening artillery fire coming from right next to  the building and aimed at targets the rebels refused to identify.    The RPF has still not taken control of the strategic points  because the time is not yet ripe, they said during this news  briefing, and indeed the three large military camps are still  held by the regular army, even if the one in the north has been  surrounded by the rebels, they said.    According to the UNAMIR head of military operations, the  time  for the RPF to take Kigali is not far off.    Finally it must be noted that the RPF shelled the  pro-government free radio, Mille Collines, today, accusing it of  incitement to murder. After having demanded its closure in  vain, this morning it reduced it to silence. [passage omitted]    The nomination of a new chief of staff, Augustin Bizimungu,  today will not make things any easier: he is an extremist, says  the RPF, and his appointment to head the army makes the  situation more dangerous.    The UN mission on the ground, however, is not giving up; it  is continuing discussions with the two sides separately in the  hope of trying to arrange a meeting.</p>

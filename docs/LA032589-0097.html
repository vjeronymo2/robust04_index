			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 2 HELD IN FARM WORKERS' SLAYINGS; RACISM HINTED  </P> <P> Acknowledging an indication of racial overtones in the case, homicide  detectives announced Friday the arrest of two San Diego teen-agers in  connection with the slayings of two Latino farm workers who were fatally shot  Nov. 9.  </P> <P> San Diego police have arrested a 17-year-old youth from Mira Mesa and Dennis  Bencivenga, 19, of Rancho Bernardo, on suspicion of murder in the deaths of  Hilario Salgado and Matilde de la Sancha, both 18, who were found dead along  the 7800 block of Black Mountain Road.  </P> <P> Bencivenga was arrested at his home Friday. The unnamed youth was arrested  Thursday at Ft. Benning, Ga., where he was undergoing advanced training in the  Army. The youth remained in jail Friday in Georgia, police said. Bencivenga was  in County Jail Friday in lieu of $1 million bail.  </P> <P> Homicide Sgt. Frank Martinez said an investigation that has continued since the  night of the slayings recently culminated in the arrests of the two teen-agers.  Some of the acquaintances of the suspects whom investigators interviewed told  police that the two had bragged about the killings, Martinez said. Police  declined to say why they believe that the attack may have been racially  motivated.  </P> <P> Martinez said police believe the youths may have intended to rob the victims,  but that nothing was taken from them. Witnesses arrived immediately after the  shots had been fired about 8 p.m.  </P> <P> Police estimate the truck was about 10 feet away when the victims, walking  along the road, were shot "several times each" by a high-powered, .223-caliber  semiautomatic assault rifle. Police declined to say which of the suspects is  believed to have done the shooting.  </P> <P> None of the witnesses who aided police in the inquiry actually saw the  shootings, Martinez said, adding that people near the scene did not hear the  assailants say anything before the shooting.  </P> <P> The victims, who had temporary work permits and were applicants for amnesty,  were on their way to Rancho Penasquitos when they were shot, Martinez said.  </P> <P> The case has been handed over to the district attorney's office and, based on  witnesses' statements, the death penalty may be considered for the suspects,  who were both employed and "came from pretty good families," Martinez said.  </P></p>

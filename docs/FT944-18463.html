			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Berber question returns to haunt troubled Algeria: Kidnapping of a singer has threatened to drag a nationalist element into the violence The recent kidnapping in Algeria of the Berber singer Lounes Matoub has again raised the issue that has haunted modern Algeria - the Berber question, or, to be more precise, the Kabyle question. Matoub is a militant of the Berber Cultural Movement (MCB) which calls for Berber to be treated as a 'national' language in Algeria, on a par with Arabic, and for it to be taught in all schools. As provocative as he is popular, Matoub recently claimed he was 'neither an Arab nor a Moslem' and argued that the Kabylia Berber heartland, a mountainous region 100 miles east of Algiers, should be granted autonomous political status. His latest record, Kenza, is dedicated to the daughter of Tahar Djaout, a Kabyle writer and polemicist who was murdered by supporters of radical Islam in June last year. Matoub is suspected of being held by a similar group. The singer's publicly expressed love of whisky has turned him into what Tahar Djaout was until his death, the man religious zealots love to hate. On Sunday more than 100,000 people took part in a peaceful demonstration in the Berber capital of Tizi Ouzou marked by calls and threats for the safe return of Matoub. The MCB plans simultaneous protests tomorrow and on Thursday in four cities, including Algiers and Tizi Ouzou. The original inhabitants of North Africa were Berberbut the process of Arabisation, the adoption of Arabic language and culture, has, over 13 centuries, left only a third of the Maghreb's 60m people with Berber as their mother tongue. Between 20 and 25 per cent of Algeria's 26m people speak Berber, two-thirds of them coming from Kabylia. The Kabyles played a key role in Algeria's modern history, one quite out of proportion to their numbers. Between the two world wars, emigrants from Kabylia formed the vast majority of Moslem Algerian labourers in France where they founded the first Algerian nationalist movement, L'Etoile Nord Africaine. As trades unionists, and with the help of French Communist party members, they became acquainted with modern ideologies and methods of resistance. The Etoile and its post-war successor, the Party Populaire Algerien, provided the fount of modern Algerian politics. The idea of independence for what had been for a century three French departements came from their ranks. During the eight bloody years of the war of independence which started in 1954, the two Berber mountainous heartlands, Kabylia and the Aures mountains to the south, witnessed some of the worst fighting between French troops and the armed supporters of the Front de Liberation National (FLN). The leading ideologue of the FLN, Abane Ramdane, a Kabyle, was murdered by some of his peers in Morocco in 1959 - an act which symbolised the events which were to take place at independence in 1962 when those FLN leaders who had spent most of the war years in Morocco and Tunisia usurped power from those who had fought in the bush. This 'betrayal', as it is now seen by many, opened a wound which has yet to be healed. Despite the fact that Krim Belkacem, who led the talks at which France agreed to Algerian independence, was a Kabyle, the new rulers of Algeria, President Ahmed Ben Bella and - after he was ousted by a military coup in 1965 - Colonel Houari Boumediene, clamped down on the freedoms their countrymen had paid such a heavy price to win. All expression of Berber culture were forbidden and fast Arabisation imposed. The MCB was born after riots in Tizi Ouzou in 1980 forced the new president, Colonel Chadli Bendjedid, to grant a greater measure of freedom. Singers such as Matoub, who had adapted old Kabyle songs to a more modern musical form, had already become popular. Music became a key vehicle for the expression of a culture and language whose alphabet is the old Phoenician script but has not be commonly written for centuries. Like most of their countrymen, the Kabyles are not of one mind. The lines that fracture Algerian society run through Kabylia as they do through every social group and region. After riots in 1988 broke the power of the FLN, two parties boasting a distinct 'Kabyle' identity emerged. The Rassemblement pour la Culture et la Democracie (RCD) traced its roots to the MCB while the Front des Forces Socialistes (FFS) rose from the clandestinity forced on it since its foundation in 1963. In the first round of the elections in December 1991, the FFS did much better than the RCD. The two leaders reacted very differently to the annulment of the election in January 1992 and the de facto military coup that accompanied it. Despite being deeply opposed to the ideology of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which looked set to win the election, the FFS leader Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed opposed the suspension and argued that democracy could only be won on the ground. The RCD leader, Mr Said Sadi, whose links with certain military commanders was an open secret, backed the coup. On learning of the 47.3 per cent share of the vote the FIS had picked up in the first round, against the RCD's meagre 2.9 per cent, he confessed to not understanding the country he lived in. For a while he was a firm advocate of 'eradicating' fundamentalism. The Christian schools set up in Kabylia by the French in the late 19th century and, later on, emigration to France, gave Kabyle Berbers a training in the ways of the modern world and gave rise to a more literate people than any other social group in Algeria. Many Kabyle Berbers still support the FIS, one of whose most renowned military commanders, Mohamedi Said, is Kabyle. The man who was responsible for setting the FIS on a solid financial footing, until he 'deserted' the movement for the ranks of the nomenklatura in June 1991, Ahmed Merani, is Kabyle. One of the no-go areas which the army has lost control of in recent months is the mountains between the ports of Jijel and Collo, part of the so-called 'Corniche Kabyle'. Be they 'Arab' or 'Berber', most Algerians feel insulted by Kabyle Berbers claiming they are 'not Moslem'. They are also fearful that such statements are conducive to confrontation rather than dialogue, a form of politics desperately lacking in Algeria. Attempts by the FIS and the military to 'cleanse' the country of each other have already cost 28,000 lives.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE BERBER PROTEST CONTINUES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The language issue  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Ancestors of the indigenous peoples of North Africa, the Berbers were   in Algeria centuries before the area became a Roman province in 106   BC, to be followed by the Arab conquest of the late 7th century, the   Ottoman takeover in the mid-16th and French colonisation in the   mid-19th. Algerian independence was won in 1962.  -Algeria's official language is now Arab (about 75 per cent of the 26m   population speak it), and, although French remains widely used, 20-25   per cent of the country's population still consider Berber to be their   first language, French the second and Arab only the third.  -'The Algerian authorities deny this is a serious difficulty because   Berber is not a written language,' writes Peter Mansfield in his book   The Arabs. 'As the minister of information and culture, Mr Ahmad   Taleb, remarked in 1972: 'It is wrong to say that Algeria is made up   of Arabs and Berbers. . . The Algerian people is an Arab-Berber people   whose culture is Arab.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

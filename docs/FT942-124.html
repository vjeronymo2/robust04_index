			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Enterprise initiative Enterprise's bid for Lasmo would have looked half-hearted if the company had not been prepared to buy at least some shares for cash in the final stages. It has not delivered a knock-out blow, though. The gulf between Lasmo's share price and the value of Enterprise's bid has narrowed but it is still wide. The fall in Enterprise's share price may well reflect fears that it could now end up having spent Pounds 159m on a minority stake in Lasmo which will bring few benefits. Indeed, PDFM, the lucky investor which sold half its large stake for cash, looks to have come away best of all. Doubtless other investors, particularly in the US, will complain that they did not have a similar opportunity to put up their holdings for cash. Had Enterprise wanted to be strictly fair it could have spread its cash around and added a 16p cash payment to its paper bid. But that would hardly have been a winning stroke and the rules of the UK game allow fire power to be concentrated in this way. Normally that does at least allow the bidder to pick off the waverers. Supporters of Enterprise argue that PDFM was a natural port of call since it is the largest shareholder in Lasmo and since market purchases have to be carried out quickly. But Enterprise's task would have been easier if PDFM had been willing to indicate support for the paper offer. The cash could then have been spent on other investors. There are still a lot to convince, and it remains an uphill task.</p>

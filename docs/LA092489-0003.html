			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I am in total agreement with Tara Dawn Wadlington (Viewers' Views, Sept. 3). I  too feel that "Love Connection" ought to match up individuals of different  races. The dates then might be more enjoyable for both the participants and the  audience. I am definitely voting for cross-race dating on "Love Connection."  </P> <P> Terri Alynne Epstein, Los Angeles  </P></p>

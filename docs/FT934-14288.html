			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / CBI hits at EC 'tide of rules' THE Confederation of British Industry has stepped up its opposition to 'the tide of increasing EC regulation' which it says is seriously damaging European competitiveness. In its response to the European Commission's policy paper Growth, Competitiveness and Employment, the CBI today calls for a package of measures to improve European economic performance in the face of increasing competition from newly industrialised countries. Publication of the CBI's views follows last week's success by the British government in winning a six-year opt-out from EC legislation intended to protect young people at work. Ministers afterwards predicted the move could encourage multinational companies to relocate European operations in the UK. The CBI says EC policy initiatives must not be allowed to make Europe less competitive by adding burdens on employers. EC regulations, it adds, should aim at simplifying procedures and reducing compliance costs. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, calls on the commission to 'change the way it sees the world'. He says that, despite the policy paper, his organisation remains to be convinced that there has been a change of heart in Brussels. Mr Davies adds: 'The latest noises on social policy suggest that there has not. That is why we are setting out clearly the scale of the problem.' The CBI's response to the commission's paper, contained in a memorandum which has been sent to Mr Jacques Delors, commission president, stresses that the EC has lost a fifth of its share of world trade since 1980. It claims that the position will continue to deteriorate without action to reduce costs and bureaucracy.</p>

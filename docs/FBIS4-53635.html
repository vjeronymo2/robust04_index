			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Korean People Prepared To Counter Rimpac, Foreign Ministry </F> Spokesman" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- "The Korean people are  not afraid of anyone's military action, but are prepared to  counter even the U.S.-orchestrated multinational military  action," declares a spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a statement today.    Pointing to the scheduled start of the Rimpac manoeuvres, he  says:    "The Naval forces of the United States, Japan and the South  Korean puppets plan to form the first unified fleet ever in  history and stage a joint operation against fleets of other  countries.    "This is a military action which must not go unnoticed in  view of the arms buildup the United States is forcing in South  Korea while seeking 'sanctions' against the DPRK over its  fictitious 'nuclear issue.'    "The joint operation is going to be staged by a unified  fleet  this time while the military bosses of the United States, Japan  and South Korea are holding aggressive confabs repeatedly  against the DPRK, visiting each other frequently. This is a  vivid proof that the three-way military alliance with the United  States as the axis, which was formed long ago for stifling the  DPRK and other Asian socialist countries, is stepping into the  stage of practical action.    "We cannot but be alerted against the United States bringing  into the open through such joint operation its intention to  force the military action against the DPRK, come what may.    "The Korean people are not afraid of anyone's military  action  but are prepared to counter the U.S.-orchestrated multinational  military action.    "The dangerous military situation created in and around the  Korean peninsula today proves the validity and opportuneness of  the overture of the DPRK for negotiations to establish a durable  peace arrangement that will replace the military armistice  machine in Korea and urgently demands its early realisation.    "The United States must know that it is a reasonable act  either in view of the interests of the United States itself or  in view of the guarantee of regional peace to respond to the  peaceful overture of the DPRK, instead of taking adventurous  military actions against it with the mobilisation of its  satellites.    "Otherwise, the DPRK will no longer be able to discharge its  duties under the Korean Armistice Agreement, and the United  States must know this."</p>

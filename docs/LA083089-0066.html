			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP MUSIC  </P> <P> Singer Engelbert Humperdinck planned to cross the picket lines and open a  two-week engagement at the Las Vegas Hilton Tuesday as scheduled, despite a  strike by musicians. A hotel spokesman said Humperdinck cited an obligation to  his fans and his band as the primary reasons for going ahead with his  engagement. Humperdinck was the first singer to cross picket lines established  by Musicians Local 369 at five major Las Vegas resorts in a dispute over the  use of taped rather than live music.

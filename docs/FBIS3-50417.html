			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski by </F> correspondent Andrzej Urbanski, "assisted" by Malgorzata  Bochenek and Anna Machcewicz; place and date not given]    [Text] [Urbanski] Minister, what was the formal  legislative situation concerning Poland's security, which you  found on assuming office?    [Olechowski] Poland has signed friendship and good-neighbor  relations treaties with all its neighbors except Lithuania.  Therefore, if real life were seen in terms of treaty-signing, we  would have good guarantees of continued national security.    [Urbanski] So can we feel secure?    [Olechowski] We believe, to quote a priceless formula used  once by the president, that it is not guarantees that are a fact  but that hard facts constitute guarantees. At present,  cooperation within the framework of a broader community remains  the only form of ensuring that we have both national security  and development. Polish people would like to be members of a  community of Western states--hence our endeavors to be accepted  into organizations that bind West European states together: the  European Union [EU] and NATO. We will be associated with the EU  as soon as February of this year.    That association will give us a definitive status; also, on  the one hand, it sets the timetable for our entry into other  European institutions, and, on the other, it creates premises  for the belief that we will in the future become members of the  EU. However, it must be stated that we still have no detailed  timetable for the stages of our entry into Union membership.    As regards NATO, following the Brussels summit we know that  it is not a closed organization. One of the criteria of  acceptance of new members will be the latters' active  participation in the Partnership for Peace program, but it will  not be the only criterion with which we will have to comply.  Unfortunately, no definitive conditions which will determine  our membership have been set as yet, although we had asked for  them to be set.    To recapitulate, we are already, as it were, in the  vestibule  of the EU, whereas as regards NATO, the door leading to the  vestibule has already been opened.    [Urbanski] The process of our rapprochement with West  European organizations began in 1989 with the great "fall of the  peoples," but its first formal effects are beginning to appear  only today.    [Olechowski] We Poles are naturally impatient. In addition,  we have a "demanding" attitude to the world, which stems from  our sense of having been instrumental in spreading peace in  Europe; it is enough to mention Solidarity, Lech Walesa, and so  on.    Nevertheless, we must remember that we want to join an  existing community which has forged a mutually satisfying  coexistence as a result of a series of difficult compromises.  In addition, we must remember the problem of the actual  organizational and decision-related capabilities: It is not  without significance whether there are a dozen or twenty  countries in any given community.    Finally, the people of the countries belonging to the  European Community must first approve our accession to the  Community: They must become accustomed to the idea of  cooperation with us and the possibility of the need to defend  our borders. When we view all these things in the light of the  need for mutual integration, four years do not appear to be too  long at all. It took much longer for Spain to be accepted into  NATO and the EEC.    [Urbanski] How should we demonstrate our active  involvement in Partnership for Peace?    [Olechowski] The role played by a partner state is fairly  well defined in that program. A partner is a state which has  adopted NATO's values and principles concerning the behavior of  a member in matters of military and foreign policies and which  is ready to take an active part in all operations designed to  uphold or restore peace and in emergency rescue actions in  Europe. Participation in such operations will require the  assignment, training, and equipment of military units so that  they are compatible with NATO requirements. At the same time,  that will constitute a test designed to show whether the given  country is capable--in military terms--of NATO membership.    The carrying out of such adjustment operations will require  financial outlays. Some countries, including Poland, will  strive for integration with NATO. On the other hand, those  countries which decide to choose a different model of political  development or else decide not to cooperate militarily with  NATO, can still be passive members of Partnership for Peace or  they can opt for taking no part in the program.    [Urbanski] How much truth is there in the assertion that it  was pressure exerted by Poland that was responsible for  Partnership for Peace assuming its final shape?    [Olechowski] We do not know that for sure because some of  the talks were held behind closed doors. We are convinced that  other participants beside us spoke about those points in which  the final version of Partnership for Peace differs from the  original draft. Nevertheless, it was certainly we who raised the  level of the public debate as high as it was as we articulated  clearly what we were striving for.    Those negotiations, in any case, should have been held out  in  the open, because they touch on issues that are of principal  importance for the state. Therefore it would be most important  for politicians to get to know the public's opinions and  reactions.    Of course, such a manner of conducting negotiations involves  its own price. It is a method similar to the manner of our  negotiations concerning debt reduction, which we also held out  in the open. The point of departure for those was a targeted  80-percent reduction; in the end, we obtained 50 percent, and  that was a great success. Even so, some people still considered  it a failure. This time also a part of the population might  regard the outcome of our negotiations over Partnership for  Peace as a failure.    We consider the absence of a precise timetable of events  designed to bring us closer to NATO a highly disappointing and  frustrating circumstance. However, we should view it from a  more general perspective of transformations in the global  politics and from the viewpoint of the other side, which has no  precisely defined vision. That is why it is difficult for us to  obtain such concrete details.    [Urbanski] What allies do we have in our attempts to secure  these details?    [Olechowski] All the countries of the Visegrad group which  have identical chances of entering NATO. The Baltic states, on  the other hand, are less well prepared for such a move, and for  them the absence of such a prospect is at present a more  advantageous solution.    We have allies in Germany, and I also sense that there is a  compatibility with our interests on the part of the United  States. We have heard a most categorical assurance that the  security of the United States as well as European NATO members  depends directly on our own security. Anyone who views the  issue of security in global terms will also think about Poland's  security, whereas those who think of it as a regional concern  will tend to forget about us.    [Urbanski] In recent weeks we witnessed a diplomatic  offensive on the part of our biggest Eastern neighbor, who  opposed the idea of a speedy expansion of NATO membership.  Should we fear Russia?    [Olechowski] We need not fear Russia in the immediate  future, because it has no designs on us. On the other hand, we  should be afraid of the failure and collapse of democracy in  Russia. Fortunately, the results of the recent election show  that the enemies of democracy there are in the minority--albeit  a vocal minority. A democratic, strong, and prosperous Russia  would be an ideal dream neighbor for us.    [Urbanski] In addition to strong criticism of our concept of  European security, statements made by Russian politicians  nowadays contain two additional, highly menacing elements: an  attempt to invoke the right of veto against NATO's decisions,  and assertions that Poland still lies within the Russian sphere  of influence.    [Olechowski] These signals suggest that many people in  Russia still think in terms of the historical past. However,  there is a certain attenuating circumstance. Russia is simply  too big ever to become a rank-and-file element of any system.  If I were the Russian foreign minister, I would also set out to  oppose any final decisions concerning a new security system  until a definitive vision of Russia's place and role in the  world is formulated--a vision that will successfully match both  Russia's power and its needs.    On the other hand, we are deeply concerned about the fact  that Russian politicians have been trying to dictate their  neighbors' moves and behavior. That is inadmissible.    [Urbanski] A new opinion was recently voiced in the American  press: that Partnership for Peace also represents a chance for  Ukraine....    [Olechowski] The inclusion of Ukraine in the program is a  most important question from our viewpoint. I would not even  imagine a situation in which Partnership for Peace could embrace  only East European countries. In such an event the "frontier  line" would be moved to our Eastern border, and that is not at  all in our interest. We would than become a "frontier state."    [Urbanski] Have our political forces in Poland reached a  consensus on the question of how to ensure security for our  state?    [Olechowski] It is enough to scan the news announcements  carried by newspapers of all political orientations. It seems  to me that there is total agreement as to the principal  direction of our foreign policy. Many prominent and influential  politicians representing individual groups support our current  line in foreign policy. It is true that in that respect I am a  particularly lucky minister.    [Urbanski] Over the past months I noted several opinions by  our politicians at home in which they set out proposals for  foreign regional cooperation--for example, linking Bonn with  Warsaw and Moscow. What do you think of such proposals?    [Olechowski] We could carry out a brief analysis of these  alternative concepts. One of them claims that we should declare  neutrality. However, we would be too weak on our own to be able  to repulse a possible threat to our security. Nor could we  really consider disarmament, either, because all too quickly  someone would take a lively interest in claiming our piece of  "unguarded property." It would only be possible to set up  regional cooperation with our neighbors in the south; however,  these countries are militarily just as weak. Again, it would  not be feasible to to set up regional cooperation based on one  of our Western neighbors--for example, Germany--because in order  to do that we would have had to make an earlier active effort to  break up NATO, and that would be an act of patent insanity.  Such an action would be to the detriment of European as well as  world interests, and it would directly contravene the idea of  integration.    Consequently, what remains is the Eastern option, that is,  building a community of states around Russia. However, as  things are today, we would have to beg Russia on our knees to  consider such an idea, because we are not a serious partner for  it either in terms of political or economic interest. As far as  Russia is concerned, a serious economic partner would be one  that could offer it financial credits; in a certain sense, then,  such a position could be bought. Therefore, if we were to  secure enough money to finance such a scheme, we could  strengthen our position quite considerably. An additional  argument against that option is that Russia is not as yet a  democratic state.    Each of the above solutions would be unattractive from the  perspective of our civilizational development. Poles have  always shown a marked leaning toward the West: our culture, our  civilization, and our religion all have their roots there.    [Urbanski] Do you agree with the thesis that Poland has  chosen the Westward path also in order to bring its economic  relations with Russia to a higher level?    [Olechowski] I do. I believe that we should act as a  coorganizer of economic cooperation between Europe and Russia.  If Poland approaches the Western level of economic development  while Russia, Ukraine, and other countries to the east of our  borders remain at the stage of having no market economy owing to  the lack of support from the outside and the world's reluctance  to make room for them in the global markets, then the increasing  difference in our potentials could create great tensions that  might eventually threaten an explosion.    Polish economic interests oblige us to take an active part  in the process of building a democratic and wealthy Russia. The  eastern markets are a natural opening for us. Many Polish  cities grew and developed through trading with Russia. We  should strive even today to ensure that Polish suppliers have  the optimum chances of reaching Russian markets, so that in the  future we can set up well-functioning channels of economic  cooperation.    [Urbanski] Where can we find the funds to finance such a  scheme?    [Olechowski] All programs stipulating development of  commercial exchange with Russia should receive favorable bank  loans. We have been pressing for this for a number of years,  but somehow the finance minister's hand would always tremble  before he made the decision to sign such an agreement. However,  I will keep insisting that it is a mistake not do do that. We  should protect ourselves against the possibility of dropping out  of the Russian market, and we must act with a view to  establishing the best possible contacts there.    [Urbanski] Do you expect that the government will reach a  consensus in this matter?    [Olechowski] We must explain the ins and outs of the whole  issue carefully in order to preclude the possibility of  misconceptions. For the time being we are preparing ourselves  calmly and carefully to present the integrated picture of the  premises of our policy as regards our Eastern neighbors. We  want to breathe a new spirit into our relations with them, but  for the time being we must wait until the present state of  tension eases a little. There is no doubt that my recent  statements did not quite match the declarations made by Mr.  Kozyrev and other Russian politicians.    [Urbanski] What dreams do you cherish as foreign minister?    [Olechowski] I hope that during 1994 or 1995 we will see a  clearly mapped-out route to NATO. However, I would not like to  see Poland become a NATO member as a result of an emergency  because of a destabilization of the situation in Russia. It is  a dream of mine that by the year 2000 we are, alongside Russia,  democratic partners within NATO. [Interview ends]  <H5>  [Box, p 8] </H5>   The interview with Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski that  is published above will serve as point of departure for the  first program of a new television series to be broadcast on  Polish Television's Second Channel, entitled "Questions About  Poland."

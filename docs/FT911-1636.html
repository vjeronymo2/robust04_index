			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Management reshuffled at Saatchi US arm SAATCHI &amp; SAATCHI, the advertising group which recently completed an emergency recapitalisation package, has reshuffled senior management at Backer Spielvogel Bates, one of its main US agencies. Mr Kenneth Rogers, 44, has been promoted to president and chief operating officer of Backer. He is replacing Mr Dean Scaros, who has resigned. Mr Rogers, who was previously responsible for client service as managing director, now takes control of Backer in the US. Backer, which is based in New York, is seen as one of the weakest areas in the Saatchi group after a series of significant account losses. The agency is estimated to have lost Dollars 230m of business culminating last month in the loss of its Dollars 110m (Pounds 65m) Miller Lite beer account in March. Its Dollars 30m Avis car hire account is now up for review. The promotion of Mr Rogers comes only a month after Backer ended its long search for a new creative director by bringing in Mr Don Easdon, as executive creative director, from Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos, a Boston-based agency.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Renault union in anti-Volvo protest THE Confederation Generale du Travail, France's communist-led trade union group, said yesterday that it planned to hold a day of action on November 18 to protest against the planned merger between Renault and Volvo. The union, the largest at Renault, described the merger as 'packaging, which is being used to achieve a privatisation opposed by the workforce'. It called for a demonstration in Paris and a stoppage by Renault workers. The statement by the CGT coincides with opposition to the merger from some Volvo shareholders. They are demanding clarification of the French government's plans to privatise the merged group and oppose the retention of a golden share by the French government after privatisation. Their demands forced Volvo to postpone until next month a vote on the merger proposal. Mr Daniel Sanchez, the CGT's representative at Renault, said the fears of the Volvo investors were justified. Unlike Swedish shareholders, however, which want a firm commitment to privatise the group, the CGT is opposed to the sale of the French government's stake.</p>

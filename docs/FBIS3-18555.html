			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The commander of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]  lacks men to consolidate the Bosnian cease-fire. General Cot  has criticized the attitude of NATO which, he says, is only  ready to send troops once an overall peace agreement has been  reached. Here he is: He is demanding urgent reinforcements.    [Begin Cot recording] What I need is troops, immediately. If  I count on my fingers who can send me soldiers tomorrow morning,  it is very simple: The Americans first of all; the British  second; the French third. Planning in the NATO framework [is  based on] 100,000 men, and then it was brought down to 50,000  men: Today I am asking for 10,000. If they don't want  everything that has been achieved with immense effort in  Sarajevo to collapse completely, these troops must get here  straight away.    We had to bend over backwards to get 15,000 men to Sarajevo,  who came from Bosnia itself, from Croatia, and even from  outside, since France sent a (?fighter squadron). We cannot go  any further now. I am saying that I am less optimistic than Mr.  Akashi. I am saying that if we do not get troops quickly, I am  afraid that what we have gained will be lost.

			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH, AIDES WEIGHING SHIFTS IN STANCE AT ARMS TALKS  </P> <P> Bush Administration negotiators will resume superpower talks on strategic arms  reductions in Geneva on Monday, six months after the talks recessed due to the  change in U.S. administrations, with only "relatively minor" alterations in the  position inherited from the Reagan Administration, White House Press Secretary  Marlin Fitzwater said Friday.  </P> <P> However, President Bush and his chief advisers will spend the weekend at Camp  David discussing possible major new modifications to the U.S. proposal,  probably on whether mobile land-based intercontinental missiles (ICBMs) should  be permitted under a strategic arms treaty, U.S. officials said.  </P> <P> If they come up with any significant changes in policy, they would seek  approval from key congressmen first before revealing them and cabling them to  negotiators by Wednesday when the first formal plenary session for the  Strategic Arms Reduction Talks is scheduled. A new proposal would enable the  Administration to hold on to its new-found momentum in the U.S.-Soviet  competition for arms control initiatives, the officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Congressional Commitments  </P> <P> A senior Pentagon official indicated that congressional commitments will have  to be substantive before the Administration will agree to significant  modifications of its positions on mobile missiles, however. What kind of  commitments the Administration would want was left unstated.  </P> <P> The Administration also wants to test in advance a system for verifying any  limits on mobile missiles, to ensure that an agreement can be effectively  policed, the Defense Department official said. Whether this concept is  sufficiently advanced to be presented to the Soviet negotiators in Geneva was  not clear, however; nor is its acceptability to the Soviets.  </P> <P> While the idea has "some panache," one source said, it does not address any of  the major issues still outstanding in the START negotiations.  </P> <P> "There may be very little here in the end or it may be a big deal," a  knowledgeable State Department official said of the Administration  deliberations on the new talks due to get under way Monday. "It is most  important to get new positions which will be supported in Congress and then  reinforce them by having them reflected in our negotiating stance, rather than  adopt new positions which do not have a strong domestic base."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Embarrassing' Prospect  </P> <P> Nonetheless, another official remarked, "It will be embarrassing to go back to  Geneva after six months and tell the Soviets we 'reserve' our position on the  most important items" -- meaning the United States has nothing to say, at least  for the time being. "We're going to look rather foolish."  </P> <P> Soviet chief negotiator Yuri K. Nazarkin, upon arriving in Geneva on Friday,  said the long break in negotiations was "plausible" because of the change in  U.S. presidents. "But the facts are here, much time has passed and the  negotiations must be marked by intense and hard work."  </P> <P> Nazarkin said he did not come "empty handed," although the consensus is that  the ball is in the U.S. court because Washington asked for the prolonged delay  in the talks in order to conduct a reassessment of its global strategic  posture, including its arms control positions.  </P> <P> He and the chief U.S. negotiator, Richard R. Burt, will meet briefly Monday to  discuss negotiating procedures, according to U.S. officials, with the first  formal session involving the entire teams scheduled for Wednesday.  </P> <P> Fitzwater said "a number of decisions" affecting instructions for U.S.  negotiators had been made, but that Bush "will continue to make decisions . . .  and provide them to our Geneva representatives on an ongoing basis."  </P> <P> "The changes that we'll begin with on Monday will be relatively minor," he  added, "but we do reserve the right to review these matters and make changes on  an ongoing basis. The question of mobile missiles is one that was not resolved  before. Sea-launched cruise missiles (SLCMs) is another very difficult (issue).  . . . These could be changed later but it's unlikely that we will have changes  in the first sessions."  </P> <P> An agreement on reducing strategic, long-range weapons was largely completed  during the final Reagan years. About 400 pages of a joint draft text commit  both sides to reduce their nuclear offensive arsenals by about 50% to equal  ceilings of 6,000 warheads and cruise missiles. They may be carried on no more  than 1,600 "delivery systems" -- that is, missiles and bombers.  </P> <P> About five major issues remain and threaten to delay completion of an accord  well into next year or even later.  </P> <P> Chief among them is the issue of mobile land-based missiles. The United States'  current proposal is to ban such weapons, but it may be changed.  </P></p>

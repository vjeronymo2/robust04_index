			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 27 -- Industry Minister Marek Pol  announced on Monday that he will meet with both Prime Minister  Waldemar Pawlak and leader of the Union of Labour [UP] Ryszard  Bugaj later in the week. "I realise that I may have to choose:  Either remain a minister, or a member of the party," said Pol.  When asked if one can be a member of an opposition  parliamentary caucus and a minister at the same time, Pol  replied: "It is virtually impossible."    Pol recalled that he voted against the decision of his party  to join the opposition to the government coalition and that he  does not represent any specific political grouping in the  ministry, but finds himself there due to his experience and  qualifications.    The National Council of the Union of Labour decided on  Sunday  to switch over to the ranks of the opposition. The direct cause  behind the decision was, according to Union of Labour leaders,  the "Strategy for Poland" economic policy presented by Deputy  Prime Minister and Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko which in  their opinion signals a shift to the right in the government's  policy.</p>

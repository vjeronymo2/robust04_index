			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Francesco Pionati--recorded] </F>   [Begin Pionati recording] The efforts to find the votes are  continuing ceaselessly. In 48 hours, the government will go to  the Senate in order to begin the debate on the confidence  motion. On paper, the votes in favor of the Freedom Alliance  are scant. The stakes are high and Umberto Bossi and Gianfranco  Fini are not mincing their words: Either the government obtains  the vote of the Senate, or new elections will be called.    In the Freedom Alliance there is great optimism, despite the  dramatic tones of Bossi and Fini. Silvio Berlusconi is the  first to be convinced that at the end of the day many senators  from the Center and the Left will give his government the  go-ahead. All this despite the fact that Achille Occhetto, in  the name of the Party of the Democratic Left, has rejected any  talk of collaboration--on the contrary, announcing that  opposition to the government will be firm. The picture from the  Center is, however, a lot less clear. The Italian Popular Party  [PPI] is divided: Officially both the party leaders at its  headquarters at Piazza del Gesu and Nicola Mancino, the party's  Senate caucus leader, stress that the PPI will vote against the  government, as was decided before the election and as was  promised to the electorate. The party says that collaboration  with Forza Italia is possible, but certainly not at present.    However, it seems that Forza Italia is making headway in the  party ranks. For the time being only individual (?senators)  have spoken tentatively of support, but the actual situation  will only emerge at the vote. One of the theories put forward  by Rocco Buttiglione and Roberto Formigoni is to abstain from  voting in order to allow the government, albeit with a reduced  quorum, to win the confidence motion. Ciarico de Mita has said  that this will lead to the dissolution of the PPI. Instead, he  floated his own idea: The PPI has to vote as a united front  against the government so that Berlusconi is rejected by the  Senate. However, newe elections would not be called because the  largest party had the right and the duty to govern--although  under different conditions. De Mita's objective is to have a  government headed by a Berlusconi who would break with the Right  in order to form an alliance with the PPI. The idea is  appealing, but it would be very difficult to put into practice.  [end recording]</p>

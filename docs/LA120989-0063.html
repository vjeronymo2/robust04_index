			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 'AGAINST THE MOB' LONG ON '40S CHIC, SHORT ON ALL ELSE  </P> <P> We have a great affection for the '40s. Life was simpler, or so it seemed. Men  wore hats and smoked, women had bulky hair and you could tell all the cars  apart.  </P> <P> Well, simpler isn't always better. For example, "Man Against the Mob: The  Chinatown Murders," airing Sunday night at 9 on Channels 4, 36 and 39, with  George Peppard returning in a second rendition of L.A. mob cop Frank Doakey  circa 1945.  </P> <P> You know the simple plot from early in the opening act. Ex-pug Buddy (acted  with extra enthusiasm by Charles Haid) witnesses the murder of a small-time  Chinese mug. It looks like new muscle is trying to take over the Chinatown  rackets, and of course it's cops on the take.  </P> <P> Doakey is a rough, tough detective of the old rough, tough school, and he and a  small band of investigators -- just enough to make a TV series -- walk through  the pedestrian script without much difficulty.  </P> <P> Peppard looks good in a hat and is properly wiseacre. He doesn't appear to  extend himself much, which is the problem for the whole adventure. Everybody  stands around looking '40s.  </P> <P> The ambience is great. The cars are fabulous and whenever there is some action,  they never damage the cars. They only shoot out the windows. Whew. -- I. L. IRV  LETOFSKY  </P></p>

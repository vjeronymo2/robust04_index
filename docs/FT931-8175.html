			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Letter: No case for exempting forces from a 'classless' society Sir, According to Philip Stephens and David White ('Major's 'classless' honours plan upsets forces chiefs', February 13) service chiefs are arguing that classlessness may be all very well in civilian life but the rigid observance of social status is a vital component of a well-oiled military machine. Perhaps they have forgotten the Victoria Cross, the only award available to all ranks of the three services according to their deeds. All the rest are remnants of a distasteful system which awards decorations to officers and medals to other ranks for the same level of bravery. Britain stands alone in maintaining such an outdated, class-ridden system. It is time the prime minister removed this blemish - the people wish him well.

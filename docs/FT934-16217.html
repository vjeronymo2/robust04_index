			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Matt Clark seeks Pounds 30m for buy - Grants of St James's seen as perfect fit with significant cost benefits MATTHEW CLARK yesterday offered shareholders the sweetener of a 7.5 per cent dividend increase to 18p as the drinks group launched its second rights issue in four months to fund an acquisition. Shareholders, who provided Pounds 13m in June to buy a drinks wholesaler, were yesterday asked to contribute Pounds 30m through a 3-for-5 rights issue at 375p to fund the purchase of Grants of St James's, the wines and spirits supplier, from the Hiram Walker offshoot of Allied-Lyons. The shares, which were suspended last week following speculation over the acquisition, closed at 498p. Mr Peter Aikens, chief executive, said Grants and Clark were 'a mirror image . . . they are a perfect fit'. Both groups had a branded wine business and a drinks wholesale division. Allied-Lyons said that following a strategic review earlier this year light wine and wholesaling was not considered to be a priority. Mr Aikens said there were significant cost benefits to be achieved by merging the two businesses. He expected annualised cost savings of about Pounds 8.5m to begin to feed through in the new year. The acquisition would also strengthen Clark's ability to take advantage of the opportunities provided by a rapidly changing drinks sector, Mr Aikens said. It has been estimated that between 700 and 800 pubs would eventually be free to choose their suppliers following last week's announcement that Grand Metropolitan was selling its Chef &amp; Brewer estate to Scottish &amp; Newcastle. Over the last three years, Clark has been restructured away from its original role as agency for a few branded drinks to a producer, wholesaler and supplier. It owns Stone's Original Ginger Wine and last year purchased Strathmore bottled water. Grants is a leading company in the wine-in-a-box sector, claiming 40 per cent of the UK market with brands such as Stowell's of Chelsea. Mr Aikens said he expected the acquisition to enhance earnings this year. Rationalisation costs of about Pounds 10m will be provided for in the balance sheet. Analysts, who had been expecting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 8m for the year to April 30, are revising forecasts to about Pounds 10m. Clark will make an initial cash payment of Pounds 28m for the business and assets of Grants. There will be a further payment of about Pounds 4.5m on completion. The acquisition follows the purchase in July of Freetraders, a drinks wholesaler. Mr Aikens said Freetraders had shown solid growth since its acquisition with a 37 per cent increase in profits before interest and tax to at least Pounds 3.2m.</p>

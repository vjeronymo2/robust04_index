He suggested that military actions by Afghan Mojahedins  and the armed Tajik opposition might become more active in  spring.    According to Yushkov, the way from Afghanistan to Tajikistan  will become easier due to opening of the mountain pass in spring.    The CIS defense ministers agreed to carry out the earlier  agreements on stabilization of the situation on the Tajik-Afghan  border. For instance, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan  will bring their military contingency to Tajikistan.    The decision on the Tajik border is to be confirmed at the  regular CIS summit planned for March 31.</p>

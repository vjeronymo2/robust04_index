			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: AMGEN SEEKS OK FOR UNITED KINGDOM SALES  </P> <P> Amgen and Swiss pharmaceutical giant F. Hoffmann-LaRoche &amp; Co. have filed  for approval in the United Kingdom to sell a new biotechnology drug that  produces white blood cells that help alleviate anemia in cancer patients who  are undergoing chemotherapy.  </P> <P> Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, has developed a drug called G-CSF that has shown  considerable promise in human clinical trials. The company has already filed an  application to market the same drug in the United States, but Food and Drug  Administration approval isn't expect to be forthcoming for at least 18 months.  Amgen is one of several companies that is developing biotechnology-engineered  drugs that trigger production of white blood cells.  </P></p>

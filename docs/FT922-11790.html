			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Leaving sterling room FT-SE Index: 2607.8 (-18.0) The market's attitude towards sterling has undergone a significant shift in recent days. The first reaction to the election result was to assume that since sterling was so strong, interest rates would be cut. The argument is now reversed: since rates are not apparently going to be cut, sterling deserves to be stronger again. Yesterday, money market rates stood steady at 10.5 per cent while sterling rose above the French franc within the ERM for the first time in a very long while. The market has switched to another preoccupation: whether it is time for sterling to enter the ERM's narrow bands. The answer is probably not. First, it is too early to be sure whether the post-election enthusiasm for sterling will last. Second, there is still the outside chance of a further tightening in German monetary policy. Third, there is no economic case for making the move in isolation without cutting rates as well. And there is every reason for leaving rates alone until it becomes clear what is going on in the domestic economy. Yesterday's Chambers of Commerce survey depicted a slow and patchy recovery in March. But the money supply figures showed bank lending in March falling on a seasonally adjusted basis for the first time ever. Doubtless, there will be a post-election boomlet to compensate. What happens then is anyone's guess. As a political question, the move to narrow bands is a different matter. There is an obvious appeal in the UK playing the good European as it assumes the EC presidency in July. But speculating on the timing is scarcely worth the market's while. It would be better advised to reflect that with sterling less than two pfennigs away from its central rate, there is probably not much more to go for.</p>

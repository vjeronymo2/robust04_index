			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> MORE TESTS NEEDED ON CHANNEL WATERS  </P> <P> Tests of Ventura Keys water taken Aug. 6 show that the Keys channels are "safe  for ocean water contact activities," but more testing will be done, the city of  Ventura announced.  </P> <P> "The results of a single test should not be considered conclusive, so the city  continues to advise that users of the channels exhibit caution/discretion in  any bodily contact with channel waters," said city Coastal Project Manager  Barbara Fosbrink.  </P> <P> An earlier test had shown that channel water had a "higher-than-normal coliform  count."  </P> <P> That usually indicates the presence of raw sewage or decaying organisms.  </P> <P> On Thursday, health officials returned for more tests after a thick frothy  substance was found in the water. Fosbrink said test results on the samples  will be available this week. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL  </P></p>

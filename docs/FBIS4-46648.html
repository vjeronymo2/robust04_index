Belkov, doctor of  philosophical sciences, professor: "Abrupt Conceptual Change or  Defamation of the Past? (On Development and Problems of Russian  Military Science)"]    [Text] VOYENNO-ISTORICHESKIY ZHURNAL No 9, 1993  published an account about a conference held in the Russian  Federation Ministry of Defense Military History Institute. The  question discussed was on the place of military historical  science in day to day activity of the Russian Armed Forces,  which caught the interest of many of our readers. Fulfilling  their numerous wishes, the editors asked specialists for their  opinions on this problem. At the same time, we do not consider  the materials published below to be indisputable and suggest  that readers continue the discussion.    The present state of Russian military science could be  characterized by one word--crisis. It stands to reason that this  relates not only to the area of military knowledge, but to all  other social sciences as well: philosophy, political economy,  political science, history and so on. All are experiencing a  period of profound conceptual change. The previous  scientific-methodological base is collapsing and basic views and  many fundamental aims and propositions are being revised.  Seemingly settled and unshakable categories and concepts are  being swept aside to be replaced by new ones in a number of  cases, but a void often forms in their place. Thus, a very  complicated, contradictory process is going on in which both  negative as well as positive trends, and elements both of growth  and of decline are interwoven.    This clearly reflects characteristic features of Russian  society's present development: the country's difficult  situation, confused public thinking, loss of precise reference  points and of the majority of previous values, painful  transition to new economic relations, exacerbation of internal  struggle, a change in the foreign policy course and a  reorientation of very important military doctrinal aims. Hence  also the vagueness of development of military-theoretical  thought.    In the history of Russian military science this is not the  first sharp turn caused by radical transformations in politics  and in the material means of warfare. The October Revolution  became one of the first critical, destructive stages, but at  that time Soviet military science, the successor of previous  traditions, still was able to create the nucleus of rational  Russian military scientific aims by relying on what had been  achieved in the past, was able to rework them with consideration  of the altered historical conditions, and on this basis was able  to achieve a high level of development, which helped us win the  supreme victory in the Great Patriotic War.    Will the crisis in military science be overcome now?  Evidently it will, but it is also obvious that this process in  all likelihood will be more painful and will stretch out for a  lengthy time. The present crisis in military science is  extremely distinctive. At any rate, it is dictated by a very  complex set of closely interwoven political, economic,  ideological and strictly military reasons, by very profound  changes for the better in the entire world military-political  situation and, most important, by the intensive reideologization  of the majority of aims and views. In cleaning communist dogmas  from military science, modern theorists persistently try to  reorient it toward standards of a new ideology. At times not  just irrational, but also many rational kernels and true  propositions are tossed overboard if they are based on Marxist  dialectics or are linked with the names of classics of  Marxism-Leninism and their statements, regardless of whether or  not they meet the truth and actual practice. Doubt often is cast  even on obvious things, particularly propositions about the  essence of war as a continuation of politics by other, violent  means, on the class sources of wars, on dependence of methods of  waging war on methods of production and so on, although the  truth of these propositions is confirmed clearly both by a  millennium of experience as well as by everyday life. Almost all  Soviet military history is being defamed. Instead of filling in  the gaps in our country's history, many heroic pages of our past  often are blackened. The very concept of "Soviet," "socialist"  military science is refuted, just as is that of "bourgeois"  military science, on the grounds that any truth is abstract,  independent and international, although it is known that various  social groups interpret many provisions of social sciences from  their own standpoints, relying on different methodological  principles. Doubt also is cast on the national character of  military science, particularly the legitimacy of existence of a  strictly Russian military science, in view of the fact that  military knowledge knows no boundaries. The influence of  national traditions and traits, which inevitably are reflected  in the direction of military theory and practice and especially  in the character of military organizational development,  military strategy, operational art and tactics, is ignored, not  to mention that it is impossible to separate military science  from specific military thinkers, theorists and practitioners of  military affairs and from their national soil.    It is without question that it would be incorrect to  idealize  Soviet military science and regard it as exceptional, sinless,  and free of shortcomings and mistakes. Soviet military thinking  interpreted many questions in a biased, tendentious,  oversimplified manner, primarily from a class standpoint, giving  little regard to other objective factors. Nevertheless, only it  (with appropriate corrections, of course) can become the basis  of modern Russian military science, which always essentially was  its main nucleus.    The crisis of Russian military science is being aggravated  now by decreased interest in basic military-theoretical research  and by attempts at substituting chiefly applied and momentary  short-term developments for it. In the future this is fraught  with serious miscalculations, loss of a general course, and a  general lag in studying fundamental problems of military  affairs, of ensuring national security and of strengthening the  country's defense. A serious danger also is being created in  connection with the sharp reduction in financing of military  science and RDT&amp;E and in connection with leading Ministry of  Defense scientific research establishments being bled dry from  the drain of skilled cadres. As a result, science's potential  and capabilities are narrowing and timely, full-fledged  development of military science problems demanding high  professionalism and appropriate funds and time is being impeded.    Of course, with all this one cannot help but admit that  Russian military science lately has succeeded in solving a  number of important problems, moving forward in the study of new  trends in development of military affairs, delving more deeply  into problems of preventing war, and creating a scientific base  for producing a new Russian military doctrine. But these  achievements are relative and quite incommensurable with the  enormous volume of problems which still must be solved. I would  like to single out the following among the large number of  problems facing Russian military science.    Evidently it is necessary to move away from the past  narrowed  interpretation of military science, which limited its subject  only to one aspect of war, armed warfare, and that in a strictly  professional sense. Obviously, war as a whole must become the  subject of military science as a specific social phenomenon,  including all its aspects and inner relations and new forms of  warfare. This of course does not preclude the study of specific  elements and components of war by other sciences, but their  comprehensive study also is required, which can contribute to a  deeper, more comprehensive understanding of war and to a  revelation of its logical patterns, reasons for appearance,  course and outcome.    Clarification of interrelationships of military science with  other sciences and military art, and especially with military  doctrine, is gaining urgency at the present time. This is  determined by the fact that already now an intensive process is  under way in the majority of world states for revising and  reworking military doctrines. This is linked with global  improvements in the disposition and correlation of world  military-political forces. Radical changes in the direction of  Russia's policy and new conditions for ensuring international  and national security cannot help but affect all spheres of  states' political and military activity. The Russian Federation  presently has adopted a fundamentally new military doctrine, but  its scientific substantiation and, most important, development  of rational mechanisms for its realization are required.    Military doctrine relies on conclusions of military science  in one way or another. Depending on the extent to which this is  supported, military doctrine may be progressive (vital) or  adventuristic (faulty). Progressive military doctrine usually is  built on a firm scientific foundation; adventuristic military  doctrine, submitting to the aims of politics, most often ignores  the demands of military science and is founded on attendant  factors. Such military doctrine, however, cannot reliably  guarantee either a state's security or attainment of other  military-political goals. Therefore sooner or later it leads to  military collapse, as happened with fascist Germany.    The Russian Federation military doctrine presently adopted  as  a result of lengthy, strenuous work is scientific in its basis,  but its theoretical substantiation has not yet been completed.  Specific principles of implementing basic provisions also have  not been developed; moreover, some are not distinguished by  clarity and definiteness, are at times abstract and are outlined  with insufficient precision. This relates in particular to the  classification of possible wars and military clashes, to an  assessment of the nature of military danger and probable  military threats, and to a determination of methods of deterring  and routing an aggressor. It is asserted that Russia has no  enemies, but Russia is forced to reckon with a broad set of  hypothetically dangerous actions. Politically this is  understandable, but from a theoretical and practical aspect this  is tantamount to admitting that all states may be potential  enemies of Russia, not to mention that reality is ignored with  that statement of the matter. Most important, it is impossible  to conduct military organizational development and prepare armed  forces purposefully, since it is impossible to build them  regardless of with what means, against whom and under what  conditions they may be employed. Military science must find a  solution to this contradiction and come up with rational  approaches to an assessment of the geopolitical and  military-strategic situation; to an analysis of military  threats, the sources and causes of war, and measures for  preventing it; and to principles of waging war against an  aggressor who is pursuing particular goals and possesses a  varying military-technical potential.    Evidently the internal structure of military science also  needs refinement. A new approach to principles of the general  theory of war, which until recently was artificially substituted  for by the methodological base of science, is necessary in  particular. It would appear that in this initial, determining  division of military science it is advisable to examine the  totality of general, fundamental problems of war, including its  essence, content, reasons for appearance, classification, laws  of development, factors determining its course and end results,  and all forms of warfare being used (armed, ideological,  economic, diplomatic and so on). In our view, the opinion  developed in the General Staff Military Academy is sufficiently  substantiated in this respect.    Complex tasks arise in specific areas of military science,  especially in theory of military art, theory of military  organizational development, theory of military training and  education, arms theory, military command and control theory, and  in all closely related areas, above all military history.    The following are becoming very important tasks in  developing  the theory of military art: revealing the nature of possible  wars, armed conflicts and other military clashes of varying  scale and intensity both at the present time as well as in the  future (for 10-15 years ahead at the very least); forecasting  models of possible development of large-scale and limited wars  waged using the newest and future weapon systems or only certain  traditional kinds of military equipment; and revealing features  of regional wars and armed conflicts. Not only must we take into  account dominant traditional trends in the military-political  and strategic situation and in the economic and  military-technical base of warfare and means and methods of  warfare, but also possible new objective and subjective factors  affecting the content and forms of war as well as internal  processes occurring in Russia and in the near, middle, and far  abroad, new relationships forming in regions, the probability of  disintegration or, conversely, unification of a number of states  into regional blocs of varying orientation, and transformations  of existing military-political alliances, above all NATO. A  completely new page must be opened in this matter, since those  wars toward which the Soviet Armed Forces oriented themselves  and prepared for in the past, above all a global world war  between the two world systems, now are absolutely ruled out. New  forms of military clashes, insufficiently studied for now, have  come to the foreground.    A theory of the modern system of armed forces operations as  applied to missions of preventing war, deterring an aggressor,  and being involved in medium and high intensity conflicts is to  be studied comprehensively and essentially developed anew, and a  finished theory of strategic and regional operations in their  new conception and operations of defensive and striking forces,  mobile groupings and peacekeeping forces is to be created.  Special attention evidently should be given to researching  methods of repelling aggression in its various forms and  preparing and conducting protracted and fast-moving strategic  and operational missile-air operations and joint operations of  all branches, and to substantiating countries' broad military  cooperation for ensuring regional and international security and  organizing a collective defense and a defense designed primarily  for one's own forces within limits of national boundaries or  moved onto territories of neighboring friendly countries if  necessary.    Fundamentally new directions are opening up in the theory of  armed forces organizational development. We are speaking of  developing fundamental principles of forming and developing a  Russian military organization under new conditions with the  country's altered geostrategic position and transformed  political, economic and military systems. The urgency of this  requires no proof. Military reform is proceeding with great  difficulties specifically because it was begun not with  development of new theoretical principles, but with the  resolution of separate, scattered practical problems and  measures, with the vacillations, miscalculations and other costs  inevitably stemming from this. It would appear that Russian  military science has to ensure formation of a refined concept of  full-scale, comprehensive military reform envisaging not  particular transformations, but implementation of fundamental,  radical, long-term solutions encompassing all aspects of armed  forces organizational development and activity without exception.    In the area of arms theory, scientific principles of a new  Russian Federation military-technical policy and corresponding  military-technical concepts for the transition period and  subsequent years are to be developed, figuring on a radical  modernization, reduction, standardization and universalization  of arms with a simultaneous significant increase in quality  characteristics using the most advanced technologies. It is  important to concentrate efforts on problems of creating and  producing (in rational amounts) above all advanced, highly  effective weapons with full factual realization of the  "effectiveness-cost-time" principle and with consideration of  the economy's transition to market relations, deep conversion,  introduction of dual technologies and the need for establishing  new scientific-technical and production ties. A scientific base  thereby should be created for forming the future technical look  of the Russian Armed Forces, developing more rational arms  programs, and faultlessly determining priority and superpriority  systems and kinds of weapons and military equipment.    Very important, labor-intensive tasks arise in the sphere of  military command and control theory. The question arises of the  most rapid development of principles of many-sided perestroyka  of entities, the material base and the entire armed forces  command and control system in peace and wartime based on changed  missions, new conditions for conducting military operations, and  promising directions of military-technical progress opening up  in information assets. Research and development of more  effective forms and methods of command and control of troops and  naval forces using new-generation automated systems and advanced  communications equipment assume special significance.    Special mention must be made of military history. A new work  front is opening up here connected with a reinterpretation of  military-historical events of the past, with an in-depth study  of World War II and the Great Patriotic War and their lessons  and experience, with the development of military art, and with  the study of military conflicts. At the same time, the need  arises for a more thorough analysis of various military  phenomena which accompanied past wars and of their immediate and  long-term consequences. A fundamental assessment both of  deciding battles as well as of many local (including unfinished)  operations, and an objective demonstration of all processes of  war and of the real military leadership hand of military leaders  of all belligerents are required with consideration of new facts  and data. In this connection an objective need has matured for  an urgent renewal of work to create both a multivolume history  of the Great Patriotic War as well as other capital works on the  history of military art and on individual problems of war. The  development of military art in Russia should be researched  especially. At the same time, work must be activated to study  foreign military experience, and the preparation of fundamental  works on the history of wars and of military art from ancient  times up to our days must be organized.    In other words, we are entering a new stage of development  of  Russian military science, realization of which will require a  sharp intensification of military-scientific work at all levels  and the conduct of a set of closely interconnected, basic and  applied military-political, military-theoretical and  military-technical research. In accordance with this, the entire  system of the scientific research structure needs  reorganizing--involvement of a wide circle of skilled military  cadres in performing tasks of scientific support of armed forces  organizational development, evolution and employment, and  genuine mobilization of the country's entire military-scientific  potential. The discussion which has unfolded in the journal's  pages can contribute actively to successful resolution of these  problems.    Colonel General A. A. Danilevich  Candidate of Military Sciences  <H8>  * * * </H8>   Philosophical problems of military theory are especially  pertinent now, when Russia's national-state interests and  military policy are forming and the Russian Federation Armed  Forces are being reformed.    To create a modern army it is necessary to develop new  ideological principles, determine basic directions, and  formulate value ideals distinct from those which existed in  Marxist-Leninist ideology. This task can be accomplished within  the framework of various sciences, both traditional as well as  embryonic: military science, military-historical science,  philosophy of war, military political science, military  economics, military sociology. For this it is necessary to  "audit" them to establish the truth and depth of cognition of  war and the Army and, most important, create new concepts  meeting Russia's socioeconomic and strategic situation. From  this standpoint I would like to examine the interrelationship,  social role and functions of totalitarian socialism and  Marxism-Leninism.    Marxism-Leninism's function was to support CPSU and state  political strategy theoretically, ideologically and spiritually  and to protect and glorify the Communist Party and socialist  system.    This task was accomplished both by developing true and  truthful knowledge as well as by distorting reality and creating  myths and legends. I will name some of them: world socialist  revolution, dictatorship of the proletariat, complete and final  victory of socialism, developed socialist, decaying capitalism,  imperialism as the eve of socialist revolution, international  duty, peaceful coexistence, and so on.    The Marxist-Leninist teaching on war and the Army played an  important role in theoretical support of CPSU policy. This is  explainable. It was impossible to achieve world socialist  supremacy without armed violence and wars. Therefore the  corresponding concepts, myths and legends were created here too:  theory of socialist violence, absolutization of the economic  factor as the source and cause of wars, concept of just wars,  absence of a domestic function in socialist armies, victory with  little blood, right to be first to initiate war, fight on  foreign territories, victory in a nuclear war, the system of  capitalism will cease to exist after a nuclear war, and so on.  The very nature of the totalitarian socialist state was creating  hothouse conditions for developing Marxism-Leninism and its  teaching on war and the Army, and it contributed to  establishment of its theoretical and organizational monopoly  among all social and natural-technical sciences. It was more  than the science of sciences. It was a superscience, having  monopolized methodological and ideological functions with  respect to all military theory.    Only party leaders and general secretaries acted as creators  of Marxism-Leninism and the teaching on war and the Army. Only  they could utter "truths." The CPSU created a powerful  propaganda system, which forcibly introduced Marxist-Leninist  ideology to the awareness of people, including Armed Forces  personnel. The party created the "Iron Curtain" and isolated  spiritual life and military-theoretical thinking from world  spiritual values, from world military science. Party ideologues  distorted scientific ideas of western scientists, falsified  military history, and subjected the achievements of western  military theorists to criticism using primitive arguments.    Political slogans and actual reality often contradicted each  other in the Soviet Union. For example, party documents  proclaimed that the socialist army performed only an external  function, but practice did not conform to the myth. The army was  used in putting down the Kronshtadt revolt, the Tambov uprising,  and in Novocherkassk, Vilnius, Tbilisi and Baku. Therefore the  question is especially acute today: Just what is to be done when  Marxism-Leninism and its teaching on war and the Army are in a  state of crisis?    Marxism-Leninism cannot be reformed, just as it is  impossible  to reform totalitarian socialism, although its evolution is not  precluded. Marxism-Leninism and its teaching on war and the Army  cannot be the spiritual, theoretical basis for creating a new  Russian Army. World military-philosophical and  military-theoretical thought, a great contribution to which was  made by Russian and Soviet theorists, must become its basis.    Marxism-Leninism contains true and false knowledge; it  cannot  be expunged from the history of the 19th and 20th centuries.  True knowledge of the Marxist teaching on war and the Army  should, in my opinion, be included in the newly forming  sciences, above all the philosophy of war, military political  science and military sociology. False propositions of  Marxist-Leninist teaching are subject to oblivion.    A system of scientific knowledge on war and the Army was  created in the Soviet Army. It needs substantial correction of  course. And the most important thing in it is the replacement of  Marxism-Leninism and its teaching on war and the Army with new  sciences: philosophy of war, political science, sociology and  its military aspects.    In my view, in forming a new system of knowledge it is  advisable to remember that any science has an international  character. There was no Soviet, socialist or bourgeois military  science. There is no American, Russian or Ukrainian military  science now. There is a single military science. But the  contribution of each state's scientists to various sciences is  not equivalent. One can speak of leader states and their  outstanding achievements in particular areas. One people left  the world more of a military-theoretical heritage, and another  less. We can be proud both of the Russian as well as the Soviet  military-theoretical heritage.    A correction of the scientific system of knowledge on war  and  the Army and formation of a new methodological base will  contribute to creation of a powerful Russian Army and to a  theoretical and spiritual base of a new concept for educating  its officers and men.    Major General (Reserve) Yu. Ya. Kirshin  Doctor of Philosophical Sciences  Professor  <H8>  * * * </H8>   The importance of the problem under discussion is difficult  to overestimate. Military theory is the unified  ideological-methodological basis for many theories encompassing  military science as a whole. As a form of scientific knowledge,  military theory provides an integral conception of its  fundamental principles and in particular of its important  components such as object, subject, structure, boundaries, and  correlation with other sciences. It is systematic in nature and  quite legitimately includes other interrelated theories of those  relatively independent disciplines and sectors of knowledge  which are its components.    It is common knowledge that there was a period in the  history  of domestic military science when it was called "Soviet military  science," and it was then that it was dissolved in the teaching  of "Marxism-Leninism on war and the Army." As the principal  object of cognition and research of military science, war was  studied above all by Marxist-Leninist philosophy, political  economy and scientific communism. The objects of historical  materialism were wars and armies in all historical epochs;  objects of political economy were the interrelationships of  economy, war and the Army; objects of scientific communism were  revolutionary wars. And in the early 1960's a new direction also  appeared--the "Marxist-Leninist teaching on protection of the  socialist homeland, achievements of socialism, and communism in  the process of being built."    This was one of the reasons why military science, divided up  among many sciences, just was not recognized as an independent  field of knowledge. And to this day there is no department of  military sciences in the Russian Federation Academy of Sciences  (previously the USSR Academy of Sciences).    The object of military science, war, and its subject,  warfare, were defined fully correctly for military science. But  it seems to me this now no longer fully reflects reality, since  significant changes also occurred in the functions of armed  forces. This is especially clearly visible in the new Russian  Federation military doctrine recently adopted. Functions of the  Armed Forces are defined here such as operational localization  of the beginning of tension, stopping possible military  operations, peacekeeping operations, involvement of Russian  Federation Ministry of Defense troops in assisting organs of  internal affairs and internal security troops, and so on.  Nuclear weapons also have new functions now. They no longer are  a means of conducting military operations, but have become a  political tool for deterring aggression.    Thus, the subjective area of military science substantially  broadened and went beyond the bounds of warfare. Perhaps for now  only in the first approximation it can be called the "employment  of armed forces," which would conform to these changes to a  greater extent.    I agree that the new situation in Russia as well as in its  Armed Forces requires resolution of long urgent problems of  military theory.    The teaching of Marxism-Leninism on war and the Army  considered general sociological laws and wars as a whole and was  a unified methodological foundation of many sciences, including  military science. Now this proposition is being revised.  Basically this unified methodological foundation simply is being  rejected, but nothing new is offered in its place. A distinctive  vacuum has formed in military theory, which hardly will be  filled by new areas of military knowledge which have appeared  such as geopolitics, military political science and security  theory. I would like to continue the thought connected with the  study and research of military history problems. We studied this  scientific discipline a long time with great distortions, since  in fact military history and military art of the CPSU was  studied in curricula of military educational institutions. We  even looked at military history of ancient eras from this  aspect. Evidently it still is not soon that we will have an  impartial military history such as it must be in reality. Not  everything also is correctly stated in the methodology of  research of military history problems.    As a rule, scientific methods are absent from dissertations  being defended in this science. Basically there is only an  enumeration of what occurred when. In the best instance, new  historical documents are placed in scientific circulation, but  little attention is devoted to the direct development of  military science.    Major General V. I. Slipchenko Doctor of  Military Sciences Professor, Corresponding  Member, Russian Federation Academy of Natural  Sciences  <H8>  * * * </H8>   The ideological and moral reassessment of values generated a  profound, largely painful turning point in the life of the  country and world, and we are its contemporaries. Society found  itself in a situation where past scientific work, moral  reference points and regulative standards are not working, but  there are no new ones which characterize modern realities with  objective precision. This has a pernicious effect on all walks  of life of society and all kinds of human activity. The absence  of a generally recognized system of value orientations has a  devastating effect on statehood and all its attributes and  institutions, including the Army.    The eroded nature of ideological principles which  consolidate  the state's military organization and elevate people's military  activity turns the Army into a phantom, whose existence becomes  a useless or even harmful waste of people's efforts and state  assets.    A particular theoretical resolution of ideological, moral  and  ethical questions as well as rejection of any resolution of them  whatsoever hardly is only of cognitive significance. It either  gives the state and society reliable reference points of  endeavor or directs their activity into a false channel and  leads to costs and defeats. Suffice it to recall that a  unilateral interpretation of conversion turned out to be not  only a ruinous destruction of the military-industrial complex,  but also a weakening of the country's scientific-technical  potential; official discussion about unified and then Combined  Armed Forces of the CIS and about a unified defense space  engendered many problems for Russia in military organizational  development that are difficult to solve to this day; the slogan  "the Army is outside of politics" seriously disoriented the  political elite and counterelite (opposition), society, and the  Army itself. Today the "Army's peacekeeping activity," as any  use of the Russian Armed Forces and various forms of its  activeness (including combat operations and "fire for effect")  are called more and more often, is included among such phantom  words today.    Thus, development of a political and philosophical concept  of  the state's military activity must precede the establishment of  constitutional and legal rules regulating the military sphere of  society's life and a determination of specific measures in this  area.    Until recently the Marxist-Leninist teaching on war and the  Army provided the "only correct resolution" of all such  questions in our country. But the new conditions showed that  this aggregate of officially approved theoretical propositions  on the military-political realities of social life does not meet  modern needs and requirements.    For familiar reasons, the "Marxist-Leninist teaching on war  and the Army" acquired in fact the nature of an illustration and  substantiation of decisions made by the country's political  leadership and became a canonic code of ideologized dogmas,  which did not explain life, but drove it into the framework of a  given scheme, leaving everything that did not fit into it on the  outside.    The sober, even harsh reassessment of values natural for a  transition period leads to the conclusion that propositions  brought together into the Marxist-Leninist teaching on war and  the Army are not, strictly speaking, Marxist-Leninist, since  they include many conclusions and assessments formulated not  only by K. Marx, F. Engels and V. I. Lenin, but to a  considerable extent before or after them, and they cannot be  viewed as a teaching, since they do not provide an integral,  comprehensive development of the theory of war and the Army.    In reassessing the system of knowledge in question from the  standpoint of new political thinking, it is impossible to slip  to the position of reckless denial. It is necessary to see that  there are propositions in it that were incorrect and erroneous  from the beginning, that there are assessments correct for their  time but now obsolete, and that there are generalizations of  permanent significance. The task is to separate the wheat from  the chaff. How can this be done? What must come to replace the  Marxist-Leninist teaching on war and the Army?    Without taking the liberty of providing an exhaustive final  answer, I would like to direct attention to several points. A  realization of the need for a social-science, humanitarian  analysis of the military sphere of life is the result neither of  Soviet nor of post-Soviet specifics. For example, N. N. Golovin  was insisting on this back in the early 1930's. It is hardly  possible and advisable to constitute a new system of views  within the framework of a unified metascience. The nucleus of  this system evidently is formed by military political science.  This is a special branch of social science studying the theory  and practice of military organizational development, the  mechanisms, structures and institutions of military policy of  modern states, and the status and development trends of  military-political attitudes in individual countries and in the  world as a whole. It studies those aspects of political life  directly linked with the creation and use of military force as a  factor of policy, and those military phenomena and processes  which carry in themselves political content. This determines its  difference both from general political science disciplines  (science of the state, international relations theory,  ethnology, conflictology and so on) and from military science  (strategy, military art, theory of military organizational  development and so on).    The development and spread of philosophical, political  science, economic, psychological and other knowledge about war  and the Army are not a strictly academic task and are of great  practical significance. By acting as an important aspect of  political culture of society and the individual, they help  people independently understand political contradictions of  history and modern times, see the deep-seated springs of  political dynamics, and understand their own capabilities for  entering into those dynamics.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Chong Pyong-chin: "Three Ways for the </F> United States `To Deal With the Kim Chong-hwi Case'"]    [Text] Our attention is now focused on the U.S.  Government's official response to the request for "political  asylum" made by the former senior presidential secretary for  foreign and national security affairs. It was learned that our  government made unofficial contacts with the U.S. Government on  several occasions in connection with former senior Secretary Kim  Chong-hwi's "request for political asylum," but the contacts  continued only a tug-of-war over the interpretation of his  present status, whether he is a public official or a private  individual.    On 22 January, however, our government requested the U.S.  Government to give its official response to this matter and, at  the same time, informed it of our position "opposing the  granting of permanent residency" to him. The U.S. Government is  expected to make a final decision on this matter sooner or later.    In this connection, an official concerned at the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs said on 22 January that "there have been  `complicated and delicate differences of views' between the ROK  and U.S. Governments over the matter on whether former senior  Secretary Kim Chong-hwi's request for permanent residency is a  simple request to extend his private stay in the United States  or an official request to seek political asylum," adding that  "now that we have delivered our official position to the United  States, the U.S. Government is expected to inform our government  of its opinion and its measures."    There are three basic ways the U.S. Government can respond  to  our government. First, the United States can take considerably  stern measures on former senior Secretary Kim, who is a figure  of the Sixth Republic, in consideration of the friendly  relations existing between Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Clinton.  Second, the United States can protect him because he was a  "witness" to the arms dealings between the ROK and the United  States. Finally, the United States can regard this case as a  matter of the Office of Immigration and refer it to this office,  based on the experiences attained in the close-door negotiations  held thus far with the ROK Government.    Stern measures by the U.S. Government against former senior  Secretary Kim Chong-hwi are precisely what our government has  openly demanded. His departure from the U.S. Heritage Foundation  no longer allows him to stay in the United States legally.  Therefore, he can no longer stay in the United States and has  to leave even though his passport and visa are valid for four  more years. As a result of this, the United States will have to  face complaints from numerous "non-Americans" residing in the  United States.    Relevant Foreign Ministry officials foresee no signs of the  United States actively protecting former Senior Secretary Kim.  Their reason is that if the United States take measures to  protect former Senior Secretary Kim, it will stir up unpleasant  memories in the ROK of the Kim Hyong-uk exile case and will  directly spark not only diplomatic friction but also anti-U.S.  sentiments, which have died down since the inauguration of the  civilian government. In an attempt to prevent "discord" with  the ROK Government while avoiding "discomfort" internally, the  U.S. Government is expected to state openly that "it is  difficult to intervene in the issue at the government level."    While noting through unofficial channels, the inevitability  of assuming an "equivocal attitude," it has been learned that  the U.S. Government, in fact has been hesitating due to our  government's repeated calls against granting permanent residency  to former Senior Secretary Kim on the grounds that "domestic  public sentiment makes it difficult to accept." Nevertheless,  the United States continues to explain that "rather than being  subject to government approval, permanent residency is granted  almost automatically when requirements are met."    At all events, the United States is now in a position of  having to make a decision on former Senior Secretary Kim soon.  It cannot continue to procrastinate on this "hot potato." It  will be worth noting how our government, as well as the U.S.  Government, handles this issue of former Senior Secretary Kim's  "seeking refuge in the United States" because it is a very  delicate one involving the domestic laws of the two countries,  the international judicial cooperation treaty, and public  sentiment in both countries.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Jakarta (JP) -- Minister of Finance Mari'e  Muhammad said here yesterday that the government will continue  to restrict the inflow of offshore commercial loans to avoid  worsening the country's debt-service ratio.    The private sector should minimize the domestic financial  sources to finance their investment projects, the minister said,  adding that the private sector should avoid using offshore loans  despite their growing role in the country's development efforts.    "The strict control of offshore borrowing is essential, not  only to maintain the level of the balance of payments at a  comfortable level, but also to reduce the debt burden, the  minister said at a seminar on strategic financing sources.    Bank Indonesia [Central Bank] Governor J. Sudrajad  Jiwandono,  president of the state-owned Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI)  [Indonesian State Bank], Winarto Sumarto and chairman of Merril  Lynch Limited for the Asia and Pacific Region, Peter Clarke,  were among the speakers at the seminar held by the EDITOR weekly  magazine.    Mar'ie promised to further address the country's non-bank  financial sources to enable the private sector to benefit from  the government's massive infrastructure projects in the  1994-1999 sixth Five-year Development Plan (Repelita VI) period.    The capital market should be further developed to give the  private sector better alternatives for raising investment funds,  he said.    Indonesia should invest at least Rp [Rupiah] 660 trillion  (US$314 billion) to sustain economic growth in the current five  year development plan. The private sector is expected to  contribute around 37 percent of that figure.    The Central Bank governor shared the finance minister's view  on the need of the private sector to enter the capital market to  obtain investment funds.    "I think the capital market is the best financing  alternative  at present," Sudrajad said, adding that domestic banks are also  a good financing alternative, but the available funds in the  banks are not sufficient to meet the huge investment demand.    He said the private sector should use local financial  sources, as raising commercial loans from overseas will still be  restricted in order to reduce the country's debt burden.    Sudrajad said the country's debt-service ratio is expected  to  decline to 20 percent by the end of the Repelita VI period in  1999 from around 32 percent at present.    He said the government will also continue to improve the  investment climate to further attract foreign investments.  "Foreign direct investment is one of important financial  alternatives for development in the next five years," he said.    In another development, the finance minister dismissed  reports of a rush to buy dollars [US] based on rumors of the  government's plan to devalue the rupiah.

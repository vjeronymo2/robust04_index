			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Observer: Sunny side up Deutsche Bank director Ulrich Weiss was wheeled out yesterday, along with chief executive Hilmar Kopper and Georg Krupp, to suffer a mangling at the hands of the press over the Jurgen Schneider affair. In typical cagey German banker fashion, none of the three would admit to knowing Schneider well. 'The first I knew what he looked like was when I saw his picture in the paper (after the property tycoon had absconded),' said Krupp, who is supervisory board chairman of the bank's main property lending arm. Weiss, on the other hand, let on that he had received a call from Schneider 10 days before Easter. The man who disappeared with at least DM219m of his group's money at the beginning of this month had said he wanted to talk about management succession, possible flotation and so on - a general 'tour d'horizon' about the future, as Weiss put it yesterday. Since the meeting did not concern operating businesses, Weiss went on, both men decided to make a date for when they had returned from their respective vacations. The fabled punctuality of German businessmen notwithstanding, it is reliably understood that Schneider did not turn up for the tete a tete - scheduled for 5 pm yesterday. While Weiss battles with the fall-out from the property collapse, Schneider remains on holiday - location unknown.</p>

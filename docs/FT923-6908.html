			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Lebanese poll plan revives fear of violence / A look at why the country's first post-civil war election is so bitterly opposed PRESIDENT Elias Hrawi's Syrian-backed government yesterday appeared determined to go ahead on Sunday with the country's first parliamentary elections in almost two decades, in spite of opposition from most of the country's Christians and widespread fears that the poll could lead to renewed violence. Christian groups want the elections postponed until after Syrian troops withdraw from Beirut and other areas in the autumn as agreed in a Moslem-Christian peace agreement signed in the Saudi resort of Taif in 1989. Lebanese politicians, the Maronite Patriarch, the Papal Nuncio and the French ambassador to Lebanon continued a flurry of consultations yesterday in a last-ditch attempt to postpone Sunday's voting and stave off a three-day protest strike by Lebanon's Christian community starting today. A stormy cabinet meeting called to discuss the elections broke off inconclusively Wednesday. Three Christian members of parliament brought an implicit threat back from their meeting in Damascus with Mr Abdel-Halim Khaddam, the Syrian Vice President, on Wednesday night. 'If those boycotting the elections endanger security,' the deputies quoted Mr Khaddam as saying, 'then no one should expect Syria to help the Christians. No power in the world will come to their assistance.' Opponents and supporters of the elections accuse each other of undermining national unity and dire predictions are made by both sides. Mr Nabih Berri, leader of the pro-Syria Amal Shia movement and a candidate in the south, said he fears the Lebanese army - responsible for security during the poll - could disintegrate, provoking the return of the militias. General Antoine Lahd, the leader of Israel's South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia allies in southern Lebanon, condemned what he called 'sham and illegitimate elections' and warned of 'dangerous developments' if they take place. Inhabitants of the Israeli-occupied area would have to obtain passes from the SLA to vote in territory controlled by the United Nations or the Lebanese government. Mr Uri Lubrani, the Israeli official responsible for Israeli activities in Lebanon, later expressed support for General Lahd's position and accused Syria of trying to force Lebanon into 'bogus elections.' Voting is scheduled to start on August 23 in northern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley, the two regions of Lebanon most firmly under Syrian control. Prime Minister Rashid Solh is reportedly willing to postpone the August 30 Beirut-Mount Lebanon and September 6 southern Lebanon rounds - on condition that elections take place there before October 15 when the present parliament will be dissolved. But such a 'compromise' is unlikely to satisfy the Christian opposition unless Syrian troops withdraw from Beirut in the meantime. Twenty-two contestants - including four prominent Moslems - withdrew their candidacy this week in protest at the conditions under which the elections are being held. In addition to the presence of foreign troops, opponents say the pre-civil war voters' lists are invalid, that a supervisory body required by the constitution was not formed and that thousands of people displaced by the war are afraid to go to their home villages to vote. The Taif Peace Accords established Lebanon's 16 mohafezat, or provinces, as voting districts. But the government has maintained the smaller caza where necessary to favour pro-Syrian, pro-government candidates in the Chouf and the south. Yet despite the controversy and the LPounds 10m (Pounds 2,220) registration fee, there is no shortage of candidates for the parliamentary seats, which still carry privileges in Lebanese society: 275 candidates are disputing 51 seats in the Bekaa and northern Lebanon, while in Beirut and Mount Lebanon, 198 are competing for 54 seats. Registration for the remaining 23 seats has not yet closed. Thousands of photo-posters of candidates cover the walls of Beirut, but the lackluster campaign has elicited more cynicism than enthusiasm. One exception, Mr Adnan Traboulsi, the fundamentalist leader of a poor but respected Sunni Moslem clan, assembled 50,000 supporters at a rally last week. Mr Traboulsi's posters proclaim him to be 'an honest man' in a country rife with corruption. The uncertainty surrounding the elections has increased pressure on the Lebanese pound, which traded yesterday at up to LPounds 2,500 to the dollar after rising to LPounds 2,340 on the strength of Central Bank intervention at the beginning of the week. Central Bank officials last week said the Bank was spending some Dollars 4m each day in foreign exchange reserves to shore up the currency.</p>

Here in Luanda today, Joao Lourenco, National Assembly  deputy and information secretary for the Popular Movement for  the Liberation of Angola [MPLA], once again said the National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] is not acting  in good faith.    On the possible breakdown of the peace talks in Lusaka, the  MPLA information secretary said that, if that happens, the  government will not take the blame. He spoke of the many  violations carried out by UNITA.    [Begin Lourenco recording] The government will never be the  one to blame for a possible breakdown. We cannot say the same  about UNITA, whose history has been characterized by a series of  treacheries and violations of the agreements it makes. I would  like to recall that it was UNITA that violated the (?Madrid)  Accord. It was UNITA that seriously violated the Bicesse  Accords by resuming war. It was UNITA that violated the Namibe  meeting, 48 hours thereafter, by capturing Uige. UNITA was to  blame for the failure of the meetings in Addis Ababa and  Abidjan. Today again, it is this same UNITA that is to blame  for the impasse being created at the Lusaka peace talks. [end  recording]    The government has no intention to give ministries or  provinces to UNITA in their entirety. The provinces or  ministries offered to UNITA will not entirely be led by them.  The MPLA information explains:    [Begin Lourenco recording] What the government intends to  offer is only the post of governor in certain provinces, only  the post of governor. When we speak of Uige, Lunda Sul, and  Cuando Cubango, only the governor will belong to UNITA. It does  not mean that the government will hand the entire province to  UNITA. The same is the case with the ministerial posts at the  level of the central government. When we say that we shall  offer UNITA the Ministry of Culture, for example, it does not  mean that the entire ministry will be led by UNITA. It means  that only the minister will belong to UNITA. This being the  case, this UNITA minister will not, for example, be able to  appoint as deputy minister an individual who also belongs to  UNITA. This must be very clear. People think the government is  offering UNITA complete regions -- the whole of Uige, Lunda Sul,  and Cuando Cubango Provinces. That is not true. [end recording]</p>

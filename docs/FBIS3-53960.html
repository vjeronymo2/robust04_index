			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by the political correspondent in Jerusalem] </F>   [Excerpt] Political sources in Jerusalem said yesterday  that President Clinton knew in advance that Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin would decide on a referendum should a withdrawal  from the Golan Heights be called for.    It appears that Rabin divulged this intention to Clinton  during their last meeting in Washington. Rabin explained to  Clinton the difficulties he would face in Israel should he have  to undertake such a task. Therefore, the U.S. Administration  was not surprised by the announcement on a referendum.    Government ministers say they will raise this issue during  Sunday's cabinet session, because it is inconceivable that Rabin  should divulge such a move to Clinton while hiding it from the  government. At the same time, it is believed that at least one  minister -- Justice Minister David Liba'i, who has already asked  for information on Swiss referendum laws -- was apprised of the  plan.

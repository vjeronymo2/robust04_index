			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL EARNINGS: FORTUNE PETROLEUM PROFIT IS $88,000 IN 3RD QUARTER  </P> <P> Fortune Petroleum Corp., reaping the benefits of the surge in oil prices, said  its third-quarter profit jumped to $88,000 from $4,000 a year earlier.  </P> <P> Fortune, a small energy concern based in Agoura Hills, said its revenue in the  quarter that ended Sept. 30 climbed to $342,000 from $230,000. That's because  the average price Fortune received for its oil in the latest quarter was $21.62  a barrel, up from $13.80 a barrel in the second quarter. Oil prices rose  sharply after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Fortune reported a $41,000 loss for the first nine months of this  year on revenue of $793,000. A year earlier, it lost $36,000 on revenue of  $734,000.  </P></p>

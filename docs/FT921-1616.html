			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (7): How the City's boats were burnt THE CITY OF LONDON: CONTINUITY AND CHANGE by Ranald C Mitchie Macmillan Pounds 30, 238 pages THE SCENE: a London dinner-party in the 1850s. Thackeray's daughter: 'And what is your profession?' The man from Barings: 'A merchant.' Miss Thackeray: 'A merchant] I picture you to myself sitting at your desk by an open window overlooking the broad estuary of the Thames. You glance from time to time at the distant reaches of the river. Presently you see a noble ship taking advantage of the incoming tide. She is yours and she is laden with precious tribute from foreign countries . . .' THERE ARE not many noble ships coming up the Thames in Ranald C. Michie's City, nor for that matter merchants gossiping on 'Change, nor stockbrokers being hammered, nor black-coated clerks scrawling away laboriously at sloping desks. Altogether this is a book short on City atmosphere. Does it matter? The answer is broadly 'no', for what Michie has provided instead is a well-organised, challenging and in many ways pioneering technical history of the modern City. In four central chapters - 'Commercial City', 'Credit City', 'Capital City', 'Client City' - he divides the City into what he sees as having been its key functional components, and within them he gives a tightly argued chronological overview of each. There is relatively little archival research, but he has done what no one has had either the insight or the stamina to do before, which is to read and draw appropriate conclusions from a thousand unambitious histories of a thousand unambitious, niche firms - that cumulative corporate history of the myriad-like, disintegrated City before it all changed. The most striking of these chapters is the one on the Commercial City. Michie shows that up to 1914, and arguably up to 1939, the City was predominantly a commercial centre rather than a financial one. This was less through its handling of physical trade, important though that was until the port of London's post-1945 decline, but was connected to all the major commercial centres by telegraph and 'the result of this communications revolution was that it became possible to conduct a global trading business from an office in the City.' And, often through the ill-appreciated work of continental immigrants, the City before 1914 'was the only commercial centre in the world that possessed the range and depth of personnel, experience, institutions and facilities to handle the increasingly large and complex network of international trade.' Now it is very different. The two world wars cost the City dear in lost contacts and expertise; the end of Empire, informal as well as formal, broke many ties with London; the commodity markets after 1945 only falteringly returned to free trading; and the City merchant became almost an anachronism. There have been growth areas - such as in countertrade - but overall the picture is one of decline. What has at least partially come to the square mile's rescue is Client City  -by which Michie means a whole range of client-orientated services, including accountancy and merchant banking, all activities which have risen in importance while market-based activities have dwindled. Michie is perhaps over-schematic about this - is securities trading, for instance, a client-based or market-based activity? - but it is a new way of looking at the City's more recent history that demands consideration. A final chapter takes the long-swing approach. He sees 1914 to 1971 (when fixed exchange rates broke down) as a regrettable, over-regulated hiatus, and interprets the era since then as a chequered attempt to return to the 'normal' pre-1914 world of unfettered capital flows. He is neither bull nor bear about the City's future, though one senses a scepticism as to whether the City will really 'ensure that competitive forces pervade all its markets and services.' And he considers briskly the old chestnut of the City's responsibility for British economic decline, concluding that since both City and the larger economy have been in relative decline since 1945, they are probably both part of the same problem. All in all, not a book for a budding novelist, but the man from Barings should take it on board.</p>

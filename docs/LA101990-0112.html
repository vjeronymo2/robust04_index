			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES: UNKNOWN LOUIS ARMSTRONG RECORDINGS FOUND;  </P> <P> RARITIES: SIX TRACKS FROM 1929-30 ARE NOT DAMAGED OR WORN. 'THEY BLAST,' SAYS  THE PRODUCER WHO UNEARTHED THEM.  </P> <P> For lovers of early jazz, the discovery of six previously unknown performances  by trumpeter Louis Armstrong is akin to the discovery of King Tut's tomb.  </P> <P> "A find like this comes along once in a lifetime," said producer Michael  Brooks, who ran across the Armstrong sessions serendipitously earlier this  year. "Nothing new from this period has been found in 50 years. For a jazz  record collector, it's akin to finding another draft of 'The Great Gatsby' or  the missing (edited) footage from 'The Magnificent Ambersons'."  </P> <P> The selections, from 1929 and 1930, include two versions of "After You've  Gone," two of "St. Louis Blues," one of "Dallas Blues" and another of "I Ain't  Got Nobody." The first two have just been reissued on "Louis Armstrong in New  York, Volume 6" (Columbia Jazz Masterpieces). The remaining four will be issued  in early 1991.  </P> <P> Brooks, who has been a free-lance producer at CBS for almost 20 years, came  upon his gold mine when he was in the middle of a reissue project. He noticed  that one of the production sheets for an Armstrong session had a penciled  notation that had been erased. "I rubbed it out and found a set of matrix  numbers which had nothing to do with Louis," he recalled. "I went to the CBS  files and found a card which showed we had a master of the tracks. I ordered  the master up and found it was unissued Louis Armstrong material."  </P> <P> The six tracks were originally recorded for the Odeon and Parlophone labels,  offshoots of CBS that were started in England but were used in this country  mainly to provide instrumental dance music for Latin American markets. After  the initial find, Brooks called up all the Odeon and Parlophone masters -- only  about 100 existed, he said -- and found the additional four Armstrong tracks.  </P> <P> Of particular interest is the fact that all the tracks are instrumental  versions of songs released by Armstrong as vocals. On four of the newly found  sides, Armstrong plays an interpretation of the song's melody in place of his  original vocal. But on "St. Louis Blues," which will be released in February,  trumpeter Red Allen plays the part originally taken by Armstrong's vocal, then  the maestro adds his own improvisation to climax the selection.  </P> <P> Brooks was astounded at his good fortune. "It's amazing that these still  existed, that they weren't thrown out for scrap during World War II, when CBS  scrapped tens of thousands of (the metal) parts (that early shellac 78 r.p.m.  recordings were made from)."  </P> <P> Besides the thrill of simply finding these rarities, Brooks was ecstatic about  the sound of the takes. "Nobody has played these," he said. "They've never been  pressed, so they're not damaged or worn. They blast. They are magnificent  records."  </P> <P> GETZ HONORED: Saxophonist Stan Getz will blow his own horn and others will toot  for him too, at "A Night in Hollywood," the Hollywood Arts Council's annual  fund-raiser that takes places Saturday, 7 p.m., at A&amp;M Records, 1416 No. La  Brea Avenue, Hollywood.

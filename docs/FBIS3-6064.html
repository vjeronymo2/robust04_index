Governor Yi Sang-yong and  Superintendent of Educational Affairs Kim Pyong-to explained to  the president about Kangwon Province's plan.    President Kim said, "using the opportunity of Visit Korea  Year, South Korea should promote the tourism industry and  enhance the level of service offered to foreign tourists." He  asked the governor to make optimum use of Kangwon's beautiful  tourism resources and turn the province into a top-class tourist  destination. Kangwon Province, famous for its beaches, ski  resorts and beautiful mountains, is already the country's top  tourist draw along with Cheju Island.    President Kim said, "the beautiful scenery of Sorak Mountain  and the east coast has made the province an excellent tourist  site." He instructed the governor to find and analyze problems  with Kangwon Province's tourism and study composite measures to  eliminate such problems. Kim added, "Kangwon Province is a  `future land' which has unlimited potential for development. It  should study its functions and role as the center of the Korean  peninsula in the post-unification era." He told the governor to  push ahead with a composite development plan for the 21st  century.</p>

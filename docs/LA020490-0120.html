			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> ANTIQUES;  </P> <P> HOUSE OF SCREEN IMMORTALS  </P> <P> "SHE WAS THE last of the great movie stars," says Al Morley, owner of Matinee  Idol, an intriguing shop in West Hollywood that specializes in film and theater  collectibles. Morley is referring to the late Bette Davis, and he recently  devoted an entire window display to her: movie posters, autographed letters,  signed photographs and sheet music (also signed) from some of her many movies  such as "Now, Voyager" and "Dark Victory."  </P> <P> Davis often boasted that nothing went out of the studio that she did not  personally sign.  </P> <P> When Davis died last fall, people were in the shop the next day looking for  autographs and other memorabilia. "It's something that didn't happen when some  other great stars died," Morley says, "stars like Cary Grant and Fred Astaire  and Lucille Ball." He attributes this to Davis' stature as the ultimate movie  star. Even for those who aren't Davis fans, a trip to Matinee Idol will prove  worthwhile for playbills, posters, souvenir programs (including "Birth of a  Nation" and "Wings"), signed photographs of Errol Flynn (looking quite pleased  with himself) and a $3,000 press kit (called a "campaign book") for "Gone With  the Wind." The rarest and most expensive pieces deal with Marilyn Monroe,  Humphrey Bogart, James Dean, Laurel and Hardy and Charlie Chaplin -- or  anything to do with Rick's cafe in "Casablanca." Matinee Idol, 8650 Melrose  Ave., West Hollywood, (213) 659-5569. SAM BURCHELL  </P></p>

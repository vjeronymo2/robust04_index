			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- No Japanese citizens remain  in the southern part of civil-war-torn Yemen, as the last three  left the embattled southern city of Aden aboard a French boat  Monday [9 May], the Foreign Ministry said. The three Japanese,  a tourist from Fukuroi in Shizuoka Prefecture and an embassy  personnel stationed in the former southern capital and his wife,  are on their way across the Gulf of Aden to Djibouti.    Northern forces were reported to have almost overrun Aden on  Monday.    In northern Yemen, another 68 Japanese citizens were flown  out from the capital of Sanaa aboard German and Italian military  aircraft Monday, following advice from the Japanese Embassy to  leave as soon as possible. Their arrival in Djibouti could not  yet be confirmed.    Tokyo is still trying to have the remaining 21 Japanese  residents and tourists evacuated quickly, as hostilities  continue to grow between rival southern and northern army units.  They will likely be evacuated by emergency aircraft of other  nations, government sources said.    A total of 16 Japanese, including embassy-related personnel,  are reportedly in Sanaa with five Japanese in the northern city  of Mafraq.</p>

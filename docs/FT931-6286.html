			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Thomson-CSF, Shorts in missile deal THOMSON-CSF, the French state-controlled defence electronics group, and Short Brothers, the Belfast aerospace subsidiary of Bombardier of Canada, yesterday agreed to join forces to make very short-range ground-to-air missiles. The move sparked anger from Matra Defense, France's main private sector defence electronics group, against which the Thomson-CSF-Shorts joint venture will compete. Normally, the French defence industry avoids competing against itself, on national interest grounds. Thomson-CSF and Short Brothers will have an equal share in the venture, to be called Shorts Missile Systems in the UK and Thomson Shorts Systemes in France. It will have a FFr1bn (Dollars 179m) annual turnover, representing one-fifth of the world market for this type of weapon, with a top range of 3km. Thomson-CSF denied the venture would compete directly with Matra. Matra's Mistral used an infra-red guidance system which made it suitable for use against heat-emitting targets such as jet fighters, while Shorts' missiles were laser guided, and so more suitable for cooler targets such as helicopters, said a Thomson-CSF official. Shorts will make the missiles, while Thomson-CSF will produce the electronics and guidance systems.</p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COOKE DISCUSSED STADIUM PLANS WITH D.C. MAYOR MARION BARRY  </P> <P> One day before he was arrested, Mayor Marion Barry met for several hours with  Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke at Cooke's Middleburg, Va., estate to  discuss specific plans for a 78,000-seat stadium next to RFK Stadium, sources  have confirmed.  </P> <P> At the Jan. 17 meeting, Cooke presented plans for the stadium, complete with  lucrative skyboxes and other amenities, according to a monthly report on  commercial real-estate circulated this week to area real-estate executives. It  was believed to be the first time Cooke has shown plans for his stadium to D.C.  Armory Board officials, who had expressed impatience with Cooke on this issue.  </P> <P> "At the meeting, Cooke reportedly even conceded to having high-rise parking  built instead of taking nine holes of the (Langston) golf course," according to  the public-relations firm of Arthur J. Schultz and Co., which writes the report  for Smithy Braedon, a commercial real-estate services company.  </P> <P> Cooke declined comment. Artis Hampshire-Cowan, general counsel to the Armory  Board, called the meeting "good and fruitful," but refused to discuss details.  </P> <P> Hampshire-Cowan said that despite Barry's arrest and subsequent decision to  enter a rehabilitation center in Florida, negotiations between Cooke and the  Armory Board are "on the fast track."  </P> <P> She said she spoke to Barry the day after his arrest specifically about the  stadium. "The mayor and I discussed what's going on with the stadium and he  instructed me to proceed," she said.  </P> <P> With the Redskins' 30-year lease on RFK Stadium set to expire at the end of the  year, Cooke told Barry in a Dec. 13, 1989, letter obtained by The Washington  Post that he still wanted to build a stadium next to RFK but was exploring  "other locations for the new stadium."  </P> <P> Sources have said that major environmental problems may make it extremely  difficult for Cooke to begin construction of a stadium in the District.  </P> <P> Among concerns is the issue of filling in a portion of the Anacostia River and  reconfiguring parts of Langston Golf Course to make room for the stadium and  parking. But that problem might be solved with Cooke's reported interest in  high-rise parking.  </P> <P> Another meeting between Cooke and Armory Board officials is scheduled for early  March, according to the Smithy Braedon report.  </P></p>

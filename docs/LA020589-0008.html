			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POSTMODERN CHILDREN AND 'IN THE BEGINNING'  </P> <P> I would like to respond to the Endpapers by Jack Miles on Barry Moser/Virginia  Hamilton, "In the Beginning" (Book Review, Jan. 8) as well as to the article by  William Pfaff cited by Miles (Times, Dec. 30). Despite differences, both  writers appear to regard the current critical and philosophical "postmodernist"  vogue as, a particularly pernicious relativism. In this light, Miles seems to  wonder whether children of tender years ought to be exposed to such a shocking  fact as that there are a number of different creation myths abroad in the  world.  </P> <P> What postmodernism has tried to do is unmask those "moderns" who claimed a  uniquely privileged position to survey and judge all such myths and values from  the standpoint of reason, science, and "general truths" to which we today are  especially privy. Aided by deconstructionism, postmodernism says that all  language is metaphor and "mythical," that is, works out of a presupposed  value-laden worldview.  </P> <P> Does this mean nothing but know-nothing relativism? Not at all. Postmodernism  does not say traditional beliefs are right or wrong, or true on one level and  not on others, only that we are human beings no different from those in other  times and places who have affirmed them, that we are myth-makers and  myth-thinkers like them.  </P> <P> The thing to do, then, is to discover (note I did not say choose) your own myth  and live it wisely. In this journey of discovery, it seems to me that a book  like "In the Beginning" -- and comparative mythology generally -- can be  nothing but a help.  </P> <P> ROBERT ELLWOOD  </P> <P> DIRECTOR, SCHOOL OF RELIGION  </P> <P> USC, LOS ANGELES  </P></p>

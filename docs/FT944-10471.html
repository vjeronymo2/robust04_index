			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Glaxo fends off attack on patents for Zantac Glaxo, the drug company, has fended off one of several attacks on patents protecting its biggest selling drug, Zantac, for ulcer treatment. This increases the chances that Zantac will not have competition from generic rivals for a year beyond the expiry of one of the drug's patents at the end of 1995. Zantac's US sales are running at about Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.34bn) a year. A US district court has rebuffed an application by Novopharm, the Canadian generics maker, that part of a Glaxo suit for patent infringement against Novopharm be rejected. The decision means Glaxo's case goes ahead as before. The first patents on Zantac expire in December 1995, and the 30-month delay from the patent suit filing should protect the drug from competition until late 1996. Mr Leslie Dan, Novopharm chief executive, said yesterday if he had secured a partial dismissal of Glaxo's case, his case to have the 30-month period cut by the court would have been much stronger. Novopharm said that its generic version of Zantac would cost between 30 and 50 per cent less than Glaxo's drug. Novopharm is also challenging the validity of a second patent on Zantac, which expires in 2002. Mr Dan said challenges to both patents will continue and that he remained 'optimistic'. Separately, Novopharm has taken a step towards launching a generic version of Zantac based on the later patent. That step is a type of approval from the US Food and Drug Administration called a conditional Abbreviated New Drug Application. Early launch would only be possible if Novopharm secured a reversal of last year's lower court decision upholding Zantac's 2002 patent. The case is with the US court of appeals.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Schneider in tax evasion probe Mr Jurgen Schneider, the German property magnate whose company went bankrupt with debts of up to DM5bn (Dollars 2.9bn) after he disappeared last month, is now under investigation for tax evasion, the Frankfurt prosecutor's office said yesterday. Mr Schneider is already under investigation for falsification of documents and is the subject of bankruptcy proceedings. A warrant has been issued for his arrest. Mrs Hildegard Becker-Toussaint, spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office, said the new investigation had been triggered by numerous Schneider employees reporting income on which they had not paid taxes and information from the tax authorities. Mrs Becker-Toussaint was unable to comment on newspaper reports that Mr Schneider had transferred DM242m to accounts in the Bahamas via London.</p>

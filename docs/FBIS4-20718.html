			<p>CSO     [Text] The general manager of mines and metals for  Kohkiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad Province said: The very rich mines in  this province are not being exploited in the desired manner due  to investment problems.    Engineer Mojtaba Shari'ati added: Since the year 1361 [21  March 1982-20 March 1983] 33 mines have been readied for  operation in this province, and 25 exploration projects have  also been carried out.    According to him, in the current year mine exploration  operations in Kohkiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad Province were done  through the use of satellite photographs and information for the  first time in the nation's history, with credits of 835 million  rials.    He said that this province's important mines include those  for silicone, dolomite, copper, phosphate, oxide, decorative and  facade stone, salt, fire clay, and celestine.    The general manager of mines and metals for Kohkiluyeh va  Boyer Ahmad noted: The assays for the ores in this province's  mines are generally above standard.    He added: The celestine mines in Kohkiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad  are considered to be among the world's richest, with proven  capacities of 2 million tons and assayed at 92 percent by  foreign and domestic experts.    Engineer Shari'ati added: The province's phosphate mines,  with reserves of 400 million tons and assayed at 12 percent,  have been recognized as being among the nation's best phosphate  mines. Likewise, the presence of 200 million tons of dolomite  reserves assayed at 23 percent presents favorable conditions for  the construction of factories to produce dolomite fire clay.    He said: The task of completing the exploration for copper  mines, along with the accompanying elements such as silver with  192 "PPM" is being carried out in the province, and with the  identification of mines for facade and decorative stone with  high reserves and quality, it is necessary to invest to activate  these mines.    He added: Utilization of the province's bauxite mines, with  reserves of 10 million tons assayed at 54 percent, could play an  effective role in creating prosperous economic and social  conditions in the Province of Kohkiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad.    Engineer Shari'ati said the province has significant  reserves  of marl and limestone. He said: The mines in Dasht-e Rum of  Boyer Ahmad, with the capacity to produce 2,000 tons per day,  can meet the needs of a cement factory for 150 years.    He noted the abundance of gypsum mines in the Kohkiluyeh va  Boyer Ahmad Province. He said the Karik gypsum in Boyer Ahmad,  with its 100-percent purity, could be used for medicinal and  export purposes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Sun Yong (1327 0516)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 19 Jan (XINHUA) -- Some 400 scientists of  all ages from the capital attended a tea party at the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] Auditorium  today to ring out the old year and ring in the new.    Li Ruihuan, member of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau Standing Committee and chairman of the CPPCC National  Committee, spoke at the gathering. He said: Fundamental changes  have taken place in China's intellectual and scientific and  technological circles in comparison with more than a decade ago.  These changes should be attributed to the leadership of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping in guiding the party to correct the mistake of  taking class struggle as the key link and in setting the  guideline of making economic construction the center of the  party's work, as well as to his important theses --  "intellectuals are a part of the working class" and "science and  technology constitute a primary productive force."    Li Ruihuan said: The current situation in China's  intellectual and scientific and technological circles is  generally good, though there are some problems. The solution to  these problems lies in leaders' keen attention and the nation's  economic capability, and requires a better understanding and  earnest implementation of these two important theses of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping in actual work. It is hoped that the relevant  departments and scientific and technology circles will work in  concert in studying ways to implement the thesis that "science  and technology constitutes a primary productive force," drawing  on successful foreign experiences and formulating policies for  combining science and technology with the development of  production and enabling them to promote each other, thereby  imbuing vigor and vitality into the undertaking of science and  technology.    On behalf of the State Council, State Councillor Song Jian  paid high tribute and extended warm regards to science and  technology workers across the country. He said: The "Decision  on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist  Market Economic Structure," adopted by the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee, has laid an important policy  for deepening the reform of the science and technology  management system. The implementation of the policy of "holding  fast to one end and leaving the whole field open" -- that is,  while redoubling research efforts in basic science and for the  development of new and high technology, it is necessary to give  free rein to research, development, and business activities of  organizations engaged in developing technology or providing  scientific and technical services -- and the establishment of a  new science and technology management system will surely give a  strong impetus to the strategy of "relying on science and  technology in economic construction and gearing scientific and  technology work to the needs of economic construction."    Song Jian continued: In the coming year, both central and  local governments and enterprises should invest more in the  development of science and technology. Party committees and  governments at all levels and various sectors of the community  should further improve the working and living conditions of  scientists, show concern for the growth of young scientists, and  train a contingent of academic and technology vanguards who will  lead the country in the march toward the world's advanced  science in the next century.    Zhu Guangya, chairman of the CPPCC Science and Technology  Committee and chairman of the China Association for Science and  Technology, reviewed the country's brilliant achievements in  science and technology over the past year. He said the Science  and Technology Committee and the Association for Science and  Technology will continue to do everything possible to serve  scientists and technology personnel affiliated with the  association.    Wu Jieping, vice chairman of the National People's Congress  Standing Committee, and scientists Ye Danian, Bai Chunli, Feng  Shunshan, Lai Luhua, and He Zuoxiu also spoke at the gathering.  They made a number of suggestions for accelerating the  development of science and technology and bringing into better  play the scientists' role.    Comrades Lie Jieqiong, Ye Xuanping, Wu Xueqian, Hong Xuezhi,  Hu Sheng, Qian Zhengying, and Sun Fuling were present at the  gathering.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 13 (CNS) -- The President of the  People's Construction Bank of China, Mr. Zhou Daojiong, said  that the bank would finish its shift into a commercial bank this  year when policy-oriented loans for state key items and the  discount business would switch to the newly founded state  development bank.    With alterations in the management mechanism, the  construction bank will see a lot of changes in its business and  this will be effected in two main parts. First, its direct  undertaking of policy-oriented business and discount business  will be handled in a way of being entrusted by the state  development bank. Second, the new management mechanism employed  by the construction bank will observe the pattern of a  commercial bank featuring responsibility for its own management,  risks, for its own profit and loss as well as self discipline.    The bank will undertake medium- and long-term credit  business  with no change in its name or status as an independent legal  person while the ranking of the staffing remains unchanged.    As of late last year the bank registered total general  deposits of RMB 372.2 billion [renminbi] while the balance of  various loans was put at RMB 32.9 billion.    Following the establishment of a representative office in  London, the bank last year also set up such offices in Tokyo,  Seoul, Hong Kong and Singapore while preparations for a branch  in New York is now underway.</p>

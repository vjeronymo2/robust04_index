			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> VIRGINIA IS NO. 1 FOR FEDERAL DOLLARS  </P> <P> Virginia, home to major naval and Marine bases and several suburbs of the  nation's capital, topped all states in per capita federal spending last year,  the Census Bureau reported today.  </P> <P> The federal government spent $5,953.71 per resident in Virginia in 1988, moving  it past Alaska to claim the top ranking. Alaska slipped to third, New Mexico  was second and Maryland was fourth. Only those four states managed to receive  federal spending of $5,000 or more per capita, largely a result of military  bases or location near Washington. California ranked 16th.  </P></p>

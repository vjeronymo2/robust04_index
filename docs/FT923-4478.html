			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Consumer confidence 'has sunk' CONSUMER confidence in Britain has 'collapsed' in the four months since the Conservatives' election victory, and household spending intentions are at a lower level than at any time in the past 18 months according to a survey to be issued today. PA Cambridge Economic Consultants says in its latest quarterly survey of household economic confidence that the main uncertainty undermining consumer confidence appears to be the fear of increased interest rates. 'This has extremely serious implications for the prospects of an upturn in consumers' expenditure,' the private-sector economic research group says. 'The very fact that an increase is possible is enough to dampen the likelihood of a recovery in consumption this year. If interest rates are forced up in practice, the implications for economic recovery could be even more severe.' The survey was unveiled as Labour launched a fresh attack on Mr John Major's 'seven broken promises' since election predictions of an early end to recession. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said the seven promises included the promises of a post-election economic recovery and of a 'classless society'. Mr Major had also pledged an end to most home repossessions and provision of places on Youth Training and Work Experience schemes along with extra spending on a range of public services. The Tories, he said, were guilty of a 'breach of trust with the electorate', and even their own supporters had become disillusioned. The 'broken promises' theme will dominate the opposition's campaigning over the autumn, with the message being taken to constituencies as well as being driven home in Westminster. 'Ministers must now admit they misled the public and tell us how they will change policy to honour their promises,' Mr Brown said.</p>

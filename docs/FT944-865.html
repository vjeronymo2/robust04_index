			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Technology: Food, glorious nutritious food - FT writers offer words of wisdom on food, drink, nutrition and the legend you're likely to be taking part in this weekend Christmas eating is seriously misrepresented. Not only is it not bad for you, but it provides the nearest thing to the perfectly-balanced day's eating. When else does one eat dates (loaded with potassium)? Don't we all eat tangerines (beta-carotine, vitamin C) at Christmas? Is there anybody who does not get chocolate and nuts (vitamin E, magnesium, potassium) in their Christmas stocking? The menu was created by a great nutritionist. Turkey is a very low-fat meat, which helps maintain a healthy cholesterol level. It is rich in folic acid - especially important for pregnant women and elderly people. It contains zinc which contributes to healthy sexual functioning. And there is evidence it may help psoriasis sufferers, according to Earl Mindell, author of The Food Medicine Bible. The meat also contains vitamins B1 and B6 which help digestion, while potassium is good for the heart. Poultry liver contains iron and selenium, which help combat free radicals (which can damage the cells genetic material and lead to cancer). Chestnuts are rich in starch, an important energy source. Cranberry juice helps to flush out the bacteria (E. coli) responsible for most urinary infections. Goose contains a high proportion of oleic fat, which is valuable in protecting the cardiovascular system. Michel Montignac points out in his Recipes and Menus for healthy eating that high life expectancy rates in Gers, France, coincide with a high consumption of duck and goose fat, eaten mainly in foie gras. Potatoes, the Cinderella vegetable (or 'dieter's dream', according to Mindell), are a great source of fibre (for regular bowel movement), potassium, and vitamins C and B6. Green vegetables are packed with vitamins and nutrients, but don't overcook them or much will be lost. Wine contains a high concentration of minerals, trace elements and soluble fibre to help the digestion. Sherry is said to have aphrodisiac qualities. Christmas pudding with brandy and cream must be bad for you, but eat it for the sheer pleasure as happier people live longer, according to Professor David Warburton, director of the human psychopharmacology group at the University of Reading. But if Christmas festivities become too much of a strain 'take time out to indulge a little and relax', says Warburton, also a member of the Arise group (Associates for Research into the Science of Enjoyment). He recommends 'guilt-free enjoyment' as a relaxation strategy at a stressful time of year. 'There is clear scientific evidence that spoiling ourselves with, say, a glass of wine or beer . . . or a few pieces of chocolate and all things sweet, makes people calmer, more relaxed and generally happier. And medical evidence shows that happier people live longer, so moderate indulgence can only be beneficial.' You need never feel guilty again.</p>

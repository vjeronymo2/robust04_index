			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Unions plan pension schemes for members Five of the biggest trade unions plan to make new industry-wide pension schemes available for their members. Money-purchase schemes, similar to schemes pioneered in Australia, are being established in sectors where few employers traditionally offer company schemes. The first, negotiated by Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, is expected to be piloted in January. One covering the voluntary sector, should be in place by April. Its administrators said it was supported by the MSF technical union, the TGWU transport union and the Unison general union. The GMB general union is exploring the idea in sectors including retailing, where it has about 40,000 members working for Asda, the supermarket chain. Only about 1,200 members are in the company scheme. The union said that it did not envisage being involved in a scheme before 1995. Mr Bill Day, the union's national pensions officer, said: 'We are involved in construction, engineering, oil rigs and the clothing sector and we are keen on developing schemes in all those areas.' The schemes are being co-ordinated by Jacques Martin Unity, a joint venture company formed by Unity Trust Bank and Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society, the Australian insurance company. Mr Greg McTaggart, Jacques Martin Unity's chief executive, said the schemes would cover whole industry sectors and companies would be asked to contribute on behalf of employees. He said: 'We have talked to a number of small employees who think it's the best thing since sliced bread. The big unknown question at the moment is 'Will employers pay?''. When the first scheme was started in Australia employers agreed to make contributions as an alternative to a wage increase. 'Whether such a trade-off is acceptable to the average man in the street here is anybody's guess,' Mr McTaggart said. The more employers who took part, he said, the more the schemes would have the potential for portability across a sector. A principal objective, he said, was to provide some occupational pension cover for trade union members outside company schemes.</p>

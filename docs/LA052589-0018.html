			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALREADY, SANDINISTAS SET TRAPS FOR NEXT ELECTION  </P> <P> In Latin America, democratic governments are being consolidated; even Chile is  preparing to celebrate a new era of freedom. Only three obstinate dictatorships  remain: that of Castro, fossilized in history, that of Noriega, the self-made  authoritarian, and that of Ortega, exponent of Latin Stalinism mixed with  disguised Somocism.  </P> <P> The Nicaraguan Sandinistas, while presenting themselves wrapped in the mantle  of revolutionary heroism, in fact rule through a Stalinist mass security  apparatus. Like the Somozas before them, they try to preserve the appearance of  respect for democracy by accepting "periodic elections" against a tamed  opposition. In reality, such elections are held not to put power at stake, but  rather, as in Panama, to justify the continuation of the dictatorship. The  Somozas governed Nicaragua in this manner for 40 years, and the Ortegas have  done the same for 10 years.  </P> <P> Ten years of Sandinista rule have forced 2 of every 10 Nicaraguans into exile  and 3 of every 10 into unemployment, and inflation of more than 50,000% per  year has reduced the economy and the solution of the country's economic  problems to an alchemist's formula.  </P> <P> President Daniel Ortega's acceptance of the Esquipulas and San Salvador peace  agreements was an acknowledgement of the historical failure of the Sandinista  experiment and of Nicaragua's isolation. Confronted by the region's aspirations  for democracy, Ortega finally had to accept the necessity for a new social pact  and the resolution of national conflict through national dialogue and  consensus.  </P> <P> However, the new electoral and media laws, approved unilaterally by the  Sandinista-controlled National Assembly, are another demonstration of  Sandinista use of agreements as tactical retreats when faced with overwhelming  pressures.  </P> <P> These laws disregard both the San Salvador agreements and the Nicaraguan  opposition's proposal for balanced representation in the electoral system, as  well as the recommendations of the electoral commissions of Costa Rica and  Venezuela.  </P> <P> The majority in the Electoral Council remains assigned to the Sandinistas, and  approval of opposition members rests with the Assembly, where the Sandinista  party holds a controlling majority. This law does not recognize the right of  access by the opposition to the list of registered voters, thereby enabling a  manipulation of electoral mathematics by the party that controls the process:  the Sandinistas. This legislation brings to life the political axiom long  practiced by Latin American dictators: "He who counts the votes wins."  </P> <P> The new media law further restricts freedom of the press, despite the  Sandinistas' claims of being guided by similar legislation in democratic  countries. Jail sentences and closure of the offending medium can be imposed  for dissemination of information that "threatens public security and the  national economy."  </P> <P> Ortega's strategy, which was evident during his recent trip to Europe, is to  create the illusion of a democratic electoral process in Nicaragua, one in  which opposition rights appear to be respected. Meanwhile, the Sandinistas'  total control over the system leaves the opposition at present with two grim  alternatives: collaborating with the regime in fraudulent elections or  challenging the persuasion of bayonets.  </P> <P> The opposition in Nicaragua is pluralistic, a broad alliance formed by 16  political parties, ranging from the Communists to the Conservatives and  including the Resistance. It constitutes a democratic alternative to the  Sandinista front. And in truly free and honest elections, it is capable of  winning, with the objective of forming a government of unity and  reconstruction.  </P> <P> Democratic elections in Nicaragua would inspire confidence in political  solutions and be a measure of the success of the Central American peace plan.  The brutal violence of Gen. Manuel Noriega against the opposition in Panama may  be a harbinger of what could occur again in Nicaragua. Already, supporters of  the opposition have been beaten by security forces, and thousands of  Nicaraguans remain in detention as political prisoners. The situation in these  two countries signals the broader problems that today have the region at the  crossroads between democracy and peace or dictatorial polarization and armed  conflict.  </P> <P> In Esquipulas and elsewhere, the Sandinistas made a commitment to extend the  regional movement toward democracy to the people of Nicaragua. Elections are  set for next February. We Nicaraguans look to the Organization of American  States, the Latin democracies and the international community for action that  will ensure respect for the electoral process.  </P> <P> Nicaraguans are willing to take the risks and bear the responsibility for  democracy. We do not want others to carry out our struggle. Throughout history,  Latin Americans have paid the price for U.S. failure to resolve internal debate  over its own policy and for its vacillation between splendid isolation and  unpredictable actions. Now we ask the international community, including the  United States, to give consistent support to efforts to achieve democracy in  our region.  </P></p>

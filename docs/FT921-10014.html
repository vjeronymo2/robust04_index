			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Remy Cointreau Only in France, perhaps, could a company announce with a straight face that it was issuing 6m shares to improve the marketability of the stock and simultaneously disclose that the controlling family shareholder has raised its stake to just above 50 per cent. Perhaps the Perrier and Au Printemps affaires will ultimately improve the lot of minority shareholders. But in Remy Cointreau's case, memories of the controversial terms of last year's merger are presumably still fresh in the mind. The more interesting question, though, is the likely response to 20 per cent of the stock being offered to the public over the next few months. Inevitably there may be some drag on the price in the short term, but it is also arguable that conditions are in place for Remy Cointreau to mount a serious challenge to the dominance of the big four in worldwide spirits distribution. The company can boast a portfolio of premium products, including a tie with Highland Distilleries and control of the Krug and Piper Heidsieck champagnes. It has a good distribution network; and as far as one can see, the family squabbles have been sorted out.</p>

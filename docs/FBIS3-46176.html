			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 27 (XINHUA) -- The current China  visit by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is expected to  inject renewed vigor into the economic and trade relations  between the two countries.    The Russian foreign minister arrived here Wednesday [26  January], taking with him quite a number of officials and  business people from various parts of the country, indicating  that Russia is ready to further its economic and trade  cooperation, including border trade, with China.    Sino-Russian trade volume in 1993 hit a record 7.68 billion  U.S. dollars, an increase of some 30 percent over the previous  year.    Of this, Russia's import from China amounted to 2.69 billion  U.S. dollars and its export to China was 4.99 billion U.S.  dollars, remaining the seventh biggest trading partner of China.    China mainly exported to Russia grain, food, light  industrial  goods and textiles, household electrical appliances and raw  materials, and imported Russian power plant equipment, vehicles,  steel, chemical fertilizer and electronics and machinery.    The economies of China and Russia are mutually  complementary,  and economic and trade exchanges between the two countries,  which is in the interest of both, will cater to the needs of  each other's economic development and life of the two peoples.    China supports, as always, positive development of  Sino-Russian cooperation in trade, economy and technology based  on equality and mutual benefit and encourages its companies and  enterprises to cooperate with Russia in various fields, a trade  official said.    At present, bilateral economic and trade cooperation are  being diversified to cover traditional barter trade,  over-the-counter trade and compensation trade.    During the first 10 months of 1993, China signed 420  contracts with Russia for providing labor services, involving  470 million U.S. dollars.    China also invested some 82 million U.S. dollars in nearly  500 joint ventures in Russia.    China and Russia agreed at a meeting held in March last year  that the two countries would cooperate in the fields of building  materials, information technology, instrument making,  metallurgy, agriculture, chemicals, and micro-electronics.    By the end of last June, China had imported a dozen Russian  technological projects for aviation, power and metal processing,  with a total value of 400 million U.S. dollars, while exporting  to Russia some 50 technological projects valued at 120 million  U.S. dollars.    However, there are some snags in the Sino-Russian trade,  such  as poor transportation facilities.    A trade official with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation said that China is willing to make  concerted efforts with Russia in 1994 to consolidate what had  been achieved in trade and cooperation between the two countries.    He hoped that both China and Russia would take some measures  to strengthen management of each other's enterprises dealing  with foreign trade and improve investment environment, so as to  further bilateral co-operation.</p>

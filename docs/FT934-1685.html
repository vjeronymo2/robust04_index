			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Defective cure for unemployment Sir, Professor Richard Layard's diagnosis (Personal View: 'An offer the unemployed cannot refuse', December 7) is that unemployment is likely to be high if benefits are available indefinitely, and his cure is to draft the unemployed into the workforce at no cost to the employer. His diagnosis depends on statistics that show long-term unemployment in the US and Japan at 1 per cent or less compared with 5 per cent in the European Union and his assertion that this is due to the cessation of benefits in the US and Japan after six months. His diagnosis is defective because: 1. In the US, men do not qualify for unemployment benefit after six months. So, after that period, jobless men have little incentive to describe themselves as actively looking for work and thus be counted as unemployed (Economic Eye, by Edward Balls, December 6). 2. In Japan the social security fund is available indefinitely (and is generous compared with Britain's system). The reasons for low unemployment in Japan are that there is work for anyone who is willing and able to do it, and the Japanese have a great reluctance to accept state help, and will therefore hurry back to work as quickly as possible. 3) He takes no account of the level of benefit available (which in Britain is so low as to drive most recipients to despair). However, not only is his diagnosis wrong. His cure would dump the employed on to the dole queue to make way for the slave labour introduced by the cure itself, and at the same time subsidise the employer while promoting inefficiency. The real problem is competitiveness and the cure lies with those in work, not with those denied it. Don Pitman, 2 Moor View Road, Oakdale, Poole, Dorset BH15 3LS</p>

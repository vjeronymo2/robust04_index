			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Recruitment: Officers on the march into new careers - Tapping management potential in the armed forces is an option for change in the business world Do officers leaving the armed forces make good managers? About 3,500 came onto the UK jobs market last year and while yesterday's Defence White Paper did not specify further cuts in personnel, the rate of retirements is unlikely to tail off for some time. Not so long ago a commission in the forces was considered a good stepping stone into a management career. But is the right stuff for the forces necessarily right for today's businesses, when so many organisations are undergoing radical changes in the way they run their workforces? Officers who have taken the leap to civvy street under Options for Change, the defence manpower reduction programme, say the transition is far from easy and suggest the best way to succeed is to find some qualification to give a competitive edge in job applications. Once the change is made, however, the surprise for many has been how similar the role of management has been out of uniform. Often the differences have been cultural. Colin Gordon, a former major in the Gloucestershire regiment, resigned his commission two years ago to take a one-year Master of Business Administration course at Cranfield School of Management. Even though he had passed through Staff College, the army fast track to higher rank, his ambition to command a battalion on the way to gaining the coveted pips of a brigadier had been effectively thwarted by plans to merge the Gloucesters with the Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment. He said: 'I was told quite candidly there wasn't going to be a battalion to command.' At 40 he could have ambled on in the services as a lieutenant colonel but decided to choose his own ground for leaving. 'I didn't want to be cannon fodder for someone else's redundancy plans,' he said. The services have a system of resettlement training running over two years from the time that servicemen and women opt to leave. It offers a wide range of courses and briefings, running from a half day to 28 days. Some of these are company placements. Gordon spent a month with Mercedes Benz while continuing to draw his army salary. As a fluent German speaker, he was able to help the company with translation work as it established a new contract and hire operation. 'At the same time I learned a great deal about how a large organisation functions.' None of this, however, prepared him for the MBA, which he said was demanding and expensive but worth the outlay. 'Getting a job is bloody tough and something that you have to retrain for. If you have the time you should take a course that is well regarded and that will differentiate you from everyone else coming out of the forces,' he says. Today he is working on a short-term contract, heading the restructuring of BIAS, part of the P and G Bland Group of commercial insurance brokers in Leicester. This is one more step, he says, in compiling a commercial track record. The next stage is to find a job that demands a combination of his latest experience, language abilities, MBA qualification and the command experience gained in the services. Grasping modern management-speak, says Gordon, has not been difficult. 'Human resources management has familiar ideas using different terminology. It is another sort of jargon and once you know the language you find you have been doing these things for umpteen years,' he said. The message should not be lost on Mike Bett, the former deputy chairman of BT, who is less than a month into heading a review that aims to make armed service structures and terms and conditions 'appropriate to the needs of the 21st century'. It is focusing on the relationship between responsibility, rank, trade and pay, including the concept of performance pay. Bett has hinted at what might be in store. In an interview with Personnel Plus Magazine, he said: 'If civilian organisations are developing flatter structures with fewer layers, perhaps we should be asking whether the same should be happening in the forces.' The comment might find some sympathy in the German army. Gordon said that when he served for a time as executive assistant to the German chief of staff in Nato's Northern Army Group in Europe, a German major-general had confessed to being staggered at the number of generals in the British army. 'I would think there would be scope to cut at the top, but they should not meddle around with the lower ranks,' said Gordon. The 30-man structure of the platoon had proved to be an ideal team size in military and civilian structures. Bett could find many of the new practices envisaged by the review akin to reinventing the wheel. The armed forces, whether in the UK or elsewhere, have been the source of many management techniques used in business today. Psychometric testing was a product of the US armed forces going back to the second world war. Assessment centres, administering a series of tests and interviews, which are becoming increasingly popular for employee selection among large companies, have been used to choose commissioned officers for years. One of the difficulties facing officers leaving the forces is that their service role is not well understood in business. Stereotyped images in film and television have not helped. This lack of perception, even, perhaps, fear of the officer class among civilian managers, has not helped. Even the most able officers have sometimes found difficulty finding work. Sir Jeremy Moore, who commanded the British land forces in the Falklands war, spent 18 months looking for work after leaving the service life in March 1983. Today he is a defence consultant. Brigadier Neville White, who left the Army in 1987 with considerable management but no commercial experience, said that he sent his CV to 60 companies and public organisations, with three showing interest. He was offered the job of managing the external affairs at Slough Estates, the property company, and now combines the role with managing administration. He said: 'I was able to transfer all my communications skills, but if I had entered as a marketing manager or gone into the professional property area I would not have made it to first base.' Like Gordon, he encountered management systems that had been developed first in the forces but noticed that, applied commercially, many had increased in sophistication. 'I found we no longer had an edge,' he said One of the biggest differences between the military and commercial sectors, suggests White, is that military life is 95 per cent training and 5 per cent 'for real'. 'One has to remember that in the forces you are training for one fundamental basic thing, which is killing the enemy. You are training for war.' It may be that preparedness for the sort of wars the British fought in the Falklands or in the Gulf is becoming less of a priority. The evolving peacekeeping role of mixed forces not yet fully defined by the UN and Nato in Bosnia may emerge as the most consistent military function of developed nations in the future. In that case the structure of the services could well change. Whatever happens, there is no denying that the military still provides some of the most effective training to be found in the UK and that its people are a valuable potential resource for the corporate sector. At present some 80 per cent of those who leave have jobs within three months of leaving and 55 per cent have jobs the day they leave.

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: US computer groups call off merger plan The merger of Electronic Arts and Broderbund Software, two leading developers of personal computer games software, has been called off. The merger would have created the world's largest consumer software company. The two companies said the recent trading prices of both companies' shares led the board of directors at Broderbund to conclude that 'a combination under the terms of the current agreement did not appropriately reflect the relative values of the two companies'. Since February, when the companies announced their merger plans, Electronic Arts share price has fallen from Dollars 26 1/4 to close at a low of Dollars 21 3/4 on Monday while Broderbund fell from Dollars 37 1/2 to Dollars 34 3/4. The companies said they were unable to reach agreement on revised terms for the merger. Electronic Arts was to have acquired Broderbund in a stock swap initially valued at Dollars 400m. Broderbund has agreed to make a one-time payment to Electronic Arts of Dollars 10m in connection with the ending of the agreement. In heavy trading in New York yesterday, Broderbund's share price closed at Dollars 41 1/4 up from Dollars 34 3/4. Electronic Arts closed at Dollars 20 1/16, down from Dollars 21 3/4. Analysts said that Broderbund appeared to have been undervalued by Electronic Arts, particularly in comparison with the Dollars 462m that Pearson of the UK, publisher of the Financial Times, is paying for Software Toolworks, a smaller computer games developer that the publishing group recently agreed to acquire for cash.</p>

For example, this  is the case with the Le Natal printing shop and Nicks Taxi.    Others have decided to reduce the hours they work daily,  such  as the National Brewing Company and the Port-au-Prince Custom  Service. The managers of other companies say they will be able  to function until the end of January. The manager of the  National Oil Works company asserts that the company is no longer  able to plan for the future, as now we work on a day-to day  basis. The same story applies to the Four C laboratory company.  The manager did not want to make public the options that will  be considered at the end of the month.    The Adventist hospital in Diquini will no longer be able to  function by the end of the week if the 1,500 gallons promised by  the administrative committee handling the humanitarian fuel  supply are not delivered. Even this fuel will not allow a  normal functioning of the hospital. One of the hospital  officials, contacted by Signal FM, asserts that a new schedule  will have to be adopted which will have some consequences for  the patients. Other companies such as Electricity of Haiti,  CAMEP [drinking water company], and TELECO [telephone company]  cannot function normally due to the extreme fuel scarcity.</p>

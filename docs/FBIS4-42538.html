			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jacques Fleury: "Balladur's `Different Society'"] </F>   [Text] In the Paris Conference Center yesterday, Edouard  Balladur delivered the closing speech at the colloquium  organized by the Polytechnic to celebrate the school's  bicentenary. Asked to imagine the future and develop a few  prospects for the 21st century, the prime minister above all  transposed his policy into the future, thus giving the broad  outlines of a presidential program.    "The march toward a different society has started." Without  wishing to reopen the debate on change, Edouard Balladur is  taking advantage of all his public speeches to show that his  arrival at the Hotel Matignon [office of the prime minister]  marked a break with the "old-fashioned" society he inherited  after the March 1993 parliamentary elections. These statements  have an increasingly presidential tone which certainly irritates  the friends of Jacques Chirac, the mayor of Paris. Last summer,  this projection into the future of the prime minister's action  caused a strong reaction among Chirac's supporters. Jean-Louis  Debre, deputy secretary general of the RPR [Rally for the  Republic], and Bernard Pons, president of the RPR caucus in the  National Assembly, had no hesitation in bringing out the big  guns and firing point blank at this government chief who was  simply placed in the Matignon to run everyday business until the  presidential election. "The real change," they maintained with  anger, "can only come after the crucial election." In other  words, in their thinking, once Jacques Chirac has been installed  within the Elysee. "Wrong," the Matignon retorted. "The real  change came in March 1993 with the French people's choice of a  different majority and a different society."    The debate then became bogged down, with nobody standing to  gain from provoking a sudden split in the majority. However,  each camp was on the alert, keeping one eye permanently on the  fluctuations in the opinion polls. To calm things down, Edouard  Balladur firmly urged his ministers to respect a strict duty of  restraint: There was no question of publicly discussing the  presidential election before the end of 1994. "The French  people have other concerns and expect something different from  you," he stressed.  <H5>  Trial Run </H5>   And yet it is he who for several weeks now has launched into  the trial run of a possible presidential candidate. First, by  little comments, tackling the subject of the "new society" which  was quickly turned (to avoid being reminiscent of Jacques  Chaban-Delmas' campaign) into a "different society." Yesterday,  speaking to the "RPR elite" assembled to celebrate the  bicentenary of the Polytechnic School, he clearly took a further  step. Increasingly specific in his statements, he outlined the  "different society" he is now establishing in order to open the  doors to the next century. Who but he could be at the helm to  continue this trajectory?    "Globalization is a challenge to the state and I want to  explain how I conceive of the state's necessary evolution faced  with this challenge," he said. "In a world which has changed  everything, the state can no longer have the same goals, nor can  it centralize all the powers and make all the decisions. Its  mission is to structure a different society which makes it  possible for all to progress, and which makes possible the  solidarity and defense of the nation. This is a huge task."    First, there is peacekeeping. "Immigration, separatism,  ethnic and religious conflicts are undermining national unity on  all sides and call democracy into question." It is therefore  necessary to establish an "trade organization which ensures  respect for the rules of international competition, and does not  give too prominent a role to the countries which are least  concerned with social justice. That is why it is necessary to  set up a stable international monetary system.... This is why I  took the initiative of the pact for stability in Europe."    What about employment and social protection? "We must invent  a different society which is not a reproduction of past models.  We must renew the social contract of the Age of Enlightenment  by inventing new forms of solidarity." This is the whole  meaning of regional development policy, urban policy, and social  policy. "Guaranteeing solidarity depends on a social policy  which reverses the current demographic trend, by more effective  social security, but one which is better organized and whose  costs are better controlled in terms of retirement and health  care. French society must be able to benefit from medical  advances without the social security system being threatened.  Work must be better organized, more effectively distributed,  for instance by easing administrative constraints."    It is therefore a whole long-term program which Edouard  Balladur set out. He did so in the name of the government and  the whole majority which supports him. His outlook is the year  2010. Although he still denies -- but increasingly weakly --  that he is officially a presidential candidate, he is  nonetheless taking every opportunity to show himself to be one.</p>

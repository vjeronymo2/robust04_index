			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup: Anhui Province Becoming New Economic Giant"] </F>   [Text] Hefei, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Anhui Province is  emerging as a new economic giant in China by seizing every  opportunity for development, exploiting its advantages in  natural resources and opening wider to the outside world.    Government statistics show that Anhui's gross national  product (GNP) -- the total value of goods and services produced  -- amounted to 94 billion yuan in 1993, up 22 percent over the  previous year.    That was nine percentage points higher than the nation's  average growth rate, according to an official of the provincial  statistics bureau.    In 1993 Anhui ranked 12th in China in terms of industrial  output value and eighth in terms of agricultural output value,  compared to tenth on both counts in 1992.    The official said that during the first quarter of 1994  Anhui  scored a 25-percent increase in industrial output value.    Anhui, a pioneer in introducing the initiative-based  responsibility system in China's rural areas, has always paid  close attention to agricultural production and has tried to  expand the production of township-run factories in a bid to  increase farmers' incomes.    As a result, six million farmers have left the fields to  find  jobs in the manufacturing and service sectors. Meanwhile, rural  industry has become a major driving force behind Anhui's  economic growth.    The output of rural industries topped 110 billion yuan-worth  and the per-capita income of rural residents rose by 150 yuan in  1993.    The official said that Anhui has become a national  pacesetter  in converting state owned enterprises into joint stock companies.    By issuing shares, the Meiling Co. Ltd and the Maanshan Iron  and Steel Company have raised 7.2 billion yuan, about one  seventh of the total raised nationwide in this way.    To date, Anhui has set up 15 stock trading centers, more  than  any other province-level area in China. It currently has 416  joint stock companies.    The official said that the provincial government has decided  to convert 20 percent of major state-owned enterprises into  stock companies and try the institution of the modern  enterprises system or corporation system in 50 selected  state-owned companies.    Anhui has also speeded up its construction of roads, harbors  and airports over the past few years, in an effort to provide a  better investment environment for overseas firms, he said.    For example, new wharves have been built and existing ones  upgraded in the port cities of Wuhan and tongling on the Chang  Jiang River.    Airports opened last year at Wuhan and anqing and an  expressway linking the provincial capital of Hefei to Wuhu is  being built.    Anhui exported 960 million U.S. dollar-worth of goods in  1993, up 16 percent over the previous year, he said.    It approved the establishment of 1,040 foreign-funded  businesses in 1993, involving 703 million dollars in overseas  investment.    In the first quarter of this year six international  consortiums, including the Sanyo Company of Japan, the Merrill  Lynch Group of the United States and U.P.I. (Hong Kong) Ltd,  invested a total of 15 billion yuan in infrastructure projects  in cities and in upgrading existing companies in other parts of  Anhui, he said.</p>

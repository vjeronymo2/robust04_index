			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Glaxo drug challenged by cheap rival PROSPECTS OF a cheap rival to Glaxo's new migraine drug sent the share price sharply lower yesterday. Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corporation, the US subsidiary of the Swiss drugs group, announced preliminary results of clinical trials for DHE 45, an old product no longer covered by patents and therefore extremely cheap. They showed that a single injection relieved pain in nearly half of patients within 30 minutes, and in most within an hour, according to the subsidiary. Studies have shown Glaxo's Imigran is more effective but it costs about Pounds 10 for each pill and about Pounds 20 for every injection. DHE 45 costs less than Pounds 1 an injection. Imigran is thought by some analysts to be capable of eventually generating sales of more than Dollars 1bn a year. Glaxo's share price dropped 22p yesterday, closing at 689p in a falling market. Full details of Sandoz's DHE 45 study, involving 311 patients at 38 US clinics, will be announced next week. However, the drug has been associated with adverse side-effects in the past. Mr Robin Gilbert, pharmaceuticals analyst at James Capel, said: 'There is no doubt the drug works to some extent. The main question is the side-effect profile.' Analysts also raised doubts about the design of Sandoz's study. It was 'open', meaning it was not compared with a placebo nor alternative therapies. Glaxo's trials for Imigran were far larger than those for DHE 45 and were placebo-controlled and double-blind - meaning the clinicians did not know which patient received which medicine until after the results were compiled. Sandoz's US arm was spurred into financing the trials after Glaxo's substantial efforts for Imigran, known in the US as Imitrex, appeared to be creating a new market for migraine treatments. Glaxo claims there is no effective alternative. DHE 45 has been available since the 1950s. Imigran has been licensed in 18 countries but is yet to receive a licence in the US where there are about 11.2m migraine sufferers a year, according to figures given to the International Headache Congress last year. The US Food and Drug Administration asked last autumn for additional data from studies currently under way to demonstrate the long-term safety of Imigran.</p>

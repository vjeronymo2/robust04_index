			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Antonio Cassia, General Confederation of </F> Labor, CGT, secretary general, by Ricardo Rios, entitled "I Am  Not Servile" -- place and date not given]    [Text] Oil worker Antonio Cassia was elected CGT secretary  general on Thursday. He got his job thanks to Carlos Menem,  although he hastens to explain, "I am not servile." The new  trade union leader also claims that 90 percent of labor  organizations agree with the Menem model. Regarding the  Radicals, he says he holds Cesar Jaroslavsky and Jesus Rodriguez  in great esteem. And he confesses that he wears a suit and tie  instead of the traditional windbreaker of the trade unions, out  of "respect" for his interlocutors.    [Rios] Why does everyone ask if Carlos Menem got you your  job  as head of the CGT?    [Cassia] I know that people are saying that, but my  conscience is clear. I was elected by the workers. It is true  that I am a friend of Menem, and it is also true that the  president may prefer one leader over another. But my friendship  with Menem has nothing to do with the roles that everyone must  play.    [Rios] But you cannot deny that Menem's nod toward your  candidacy gave you a certain edge over other candidates for the  leadership of the CGT.    [Cassia] Maybe the president likes this style of leadership  that is coming to the CGT. But I am not servile. The CGT will  operate completely independently of whatever maneuvering the  government does.    [Rios] What role did Diego Ibanez play to help you achieve  the highest rank in the CGT?    [Cassia] He is happy, because he devoted all of his good  will  to bringing this about. I am sitting here thanks to Diego's  magnanimity, since he stepped aside from the union leadership.  But to go from there to say that my comrade Ibanez interceded  with the president to make me secretary general of the CGT is a  lie.    [Rios] Nonetheless, it is not difficult to imagine that  Diego  Ibanez's presence on the presidential staff makes Menem's office  more accessible....    [Cassia] Of course, on the occasions when we need him to  help  us with something, Diego is always willing. But we also have  direct mechanisms at our disposal for talking to the president.    [Rios] Some sources say that Eduardo Bauza did not want you  to be leader of the CGT because at one point you were one of the  driving forces behind Jose Octavio Bordon's political  aspirations. Is that true?    [Cassia] I have great affection for Bauza, so that story  strikes me as mindless speculation. We started working with  Bordon before 1983 on a new internal line, and we were elected  national deputies. But today, Bordon knows that we want Menem to  be reelected and that he must choose his advisers more carefully  to avoid political blunders.    [Rios] Apparently you have friends only in politics or in  the  labor movement....    [Cassia] Well, I want to be everyone's friend. Even among  the  Radicals, I hold Cesar Jaroslavsky and Jesus Rodriguez, among  others, in great esteem. But I also have many enemies in the  field of ideas, and I always invite them to debate with me. That  is why I am proposing a CGT with open doors.    [Rios] Are you a businessman-unionist?    [Cassia] No, I am a unionist who began working when  Government Oil Deposits (YPF) was first founded. I have no  businesses. Of course, if you consider that the leader of a  union that set up businesses for the workers to take charge of  is a businessman, then I am a businessman. But I feel that the  word has a different meaning.    [Rios] But there is no doubt that you, always impeccably  dressed in a suit and tie, have the "look" of a businessman. Do  you not like windbreakers?    [Cassia] Everyone is free to dress the way he likes  (laughs).  I tend to wear a suit and tie out of respect for my  interlocutors. I do not do so for the sake of elegance or  attractiveness.    [Rios] As far as the CGT is concerned, is it good or bad for  you that many people do not really know who you are?    [Cassia] I do not know, I have always liked to keep a low  profile. I do not like to be a publicity hound. One thing I am  certain of is that the best way to help the CGT will be for us  leaders to get in step with the times and bring the labor  movement back into the leading role it should have in society.    [Rios] Cassia, you talk about supporting the model, but it  does not appear to give the trade unions a starring role.    [Cassia] The government knows full well that the changes  were  made possible by the workers' efforts. Now it is time for  business to pay its fair share. Business cannot expect to just  earn profits and live like kings.    [Rios] In fact, some trade unionists are accused of living  like kings....    [Cassia] I am not aware of that. That is a defamation  campaign against the union leadership.  <H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5> <H5>  "It Is Not My Style To Threaten Strikes" </H5>   A member of the "friendship club" of unionists who support  the government, and now the incoming secretary general of the  CGT, Antonio "Coco" Cassia has held the reins of the United  Trade Union of State Petroleum Workers (SUPE) since 1982 [as  published], when the veteran Diego Ibanez delegated authority  over the organization to become a full-time adviser to Carlos  Menem.    Back then, Cassia was already a natural member of the oil  workers union hierarchy, fully involved in the transformation of  YPF that resulted in the firing of some 30,000 workers.    In view of that situation, Cassia and company engineered the  creation of approximately 200 cooperatives and small businesses  that were built on the money obtained from severance packages.     -  YPF Adjustment: "Of the $10 billion paid on the foreign  debt, nearly $8 billion came from the petroleum sector. We  contributed to the country, not to a government. Today, YPF has  8,000 actual employees and another 9,000 who were laid off but  are in these business ventures."    -  Labor Flexibility: "I did not  assume the leadership of the CGT to remain silent on labor  reform. The proposal, as it stands now, favors only business.  Any labor legislation will have to provide guarantees of  investment, and we will not allow the workers' demands to be  relegated to supplementary documents."    -  Social Programs: "We have  commissioned a very serious survey that reveals that 70 percent  of the system's beneficiaries want the unions to continue  managing social programs, and they reject  deregulation."    -  Unemployment: "The day we announce a drastic  measure is the day we will carry it out. People are sick of  hearing that there will be a strike, and then it is canceled. It  is not my style to threaten strikes and not carry them  out."</p>

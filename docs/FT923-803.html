			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Residential Property: Great houses, even better prices - Top-range homes, whether London penthouse or country retreat, are historically 'cheap' THERE has never been a better time to pick up bargains in the property market. At best, UK homes are worth some 5 per cent less than they were a year ago - and much less than they were three years ago. This is depressing news for property-owners with large mortgages, but it is extremely encouraging for any would be buyers unencumbered by a property bought in the late-80s. In counties such as Devon, some property is changing hands at about half 1989 values. Distress sales, coupled with a general loss of confidence and fears of redundancy, are to blame. Both estate agents and builders of new homes are cursing building society valuers, most of whom are down-valuing everything from semi-detached houses to castles and basing their judgment on forced sales and repossessions. While there is good value to be found at every level of the market, it seems the bigger the house the bigger the bargain; castles and great houses are relatively cheap today. Take, for instance, Heveningham Hall, in Suffolk. Just to build it, were such a task possible, would cost more than three times the Pounds 4.5m asking price - and that excludes the value of outbuildings and the Capability Brown estate. The floor area of the mansion is more than 30,000 sq ft. If you estimate Pounds 500 a sq ft as the cost of rebuilding, you would be getting Pounds 15m worth of mansion for your money. Herstmonceux Castle, the moated Sussex mansion that housed the Royal Greenwich Observatory until four years ago, is on the market again. The castle has nearly 50,000 sq ft of floor area. There are also farms, offices, lodges and the domed equatorial telescope buildings so beloved of Patrick Moore and other astronomers, who tried to buy them three years ago. Two years ago, Ian Tegg's company, James Developments, paid well in excess of Pounds 20m for the castle; now, according to Strutt and Parker with Savills, it could be yours for a quarter of that. So, who is in the market for these great houses? Geoffrey van Cutsem, of Savills, says: 'There are overseas buyers around, from the Pacific basin, some Scandinavians and a few Americans - art patrons who want somewhere to show their collections. There are multi-national corporations who may see the house as the perfect place for business entertaining. 'Then again, in the case of Heveningham, there might be some form of heritage solution whereby the government might give tacit support to some money-raising scheme to keep the house for the nation. It is in good order and there is bound to be some way of producing an income from it, perhaps with corporate hospitality such as that provided by Broadland Property at Hever Castle.' In London, only the very best property is attracting wealthy buyers. According to Tony Lassman, of Lassmans, clients from Europe (especially Italy and Scandinavia) and the Middle East will spend money only if the house is special - say, something like a Nash terrace in Regent's Park or perhaps a Mayfair property. It must, of course, have accommodation for the butler. If the property is in a prime location, there are wealthy individuals willing to pay big money. John D. Wood and Savills have just sold Foliejon, a mansion with 550 acres on the edge of Windsor Great Park, west of London. The guide price was Pounds 12m, realistic a year ago in view of the Pounds 15m thought to have been paid for nearby Ascot Place and its 370 acres. Knight Frank and Rutley introduced the Foliejon buyer, said to be an international businessman who is planning to use it as a family home. But the sum paid is rumoured to be not much more than half the guide price. Several parties viewed the Grade II mansion and its estate, which is just 20 minutes from Heathrow airport. Among them were Middle Eastern families, one or two wealthy Britons, and an English consortium representing a US client who wanted to build two or more golf courses on the estate. Most planned to demolish the 20,000 sq ft of laboratories adjacent to the house which were built by the previous owners. But the new owner could have a bargain on his hands because consents have now been given for a golf course and converting the mansion into a club-house. In central London, several houses sold for prices above Pounds 1,000 a sq ft in the peak years of the late 1980s. If the property is exceptional, it could still realise such a price, although a more realistic figure is Pounds 600. Lassman recently sold what he described as the 'flagship of the Grosvenor estate' - a large, first-floor flat with balconies on the north side of Eaton Square, Belgravia. The price worked out at nearly Pounds 1,250 a sq ft even though the lease had only about 20 years left. The company also sold Ionic Villa in Regent's Park for the Crown Estates and that, too, represented more than Pounds 1,000 a sq ft. Flats at the Kensington Palace Green development by Regalian, which includes a Pounds 13m penthouse, were being offered at more than Pounds 1,500 a sq ft but prices have been reduced considerably. All these figures make Belgravia's 22 Wilton Crescent sound positively cheap. Built in the 1820s by Thomas Cubitt, and used in recent years by the French consulate, the house has been painstakingly restored. Solland Properties had the property - in one of the capital's finest Regency stone-fronted crescents - gutted completely; at one time, only the facade and party walls remained standing. Now, the finished product would appeal to the most fastidious viewer. John C. Vaughan, who is joint agent with Savills, says the house has a floor area of around 8,000 sq ft. The price of the 44-year lease is Pounds 4.85m, or about Pounds 600 a sq ft, and that includes most furnishings.</p>

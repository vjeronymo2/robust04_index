			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / A Roller is still the choice of chairmen, says poll IN a greener and more frugal world, is the Rolls-Royce an endangered species? Despite yesterday's grim sales figures for 1991, Rolls-Royce Motors argues that its extremely expensive and rather old-fashioned vehicles still have a future and it seems many UK company chairmen agree. A straw poll published yesterday found that those who have traditionally been chauffeured behind the Spirit of Ecstasy mascot intend to continue. No one admitted to trading down on grounds of cost, while loyalty to the marque and all it stands for remains high. The majority of company chairmen remain loyal to their chosen make of car, whatever it is, and most still buy British, many of them opting for Jaguar or Daimler. Sir John Quinton of Barclays Bank is a long-term Jaguar driver and Lord King of British Airways chooses Daimlers. The big change enforced by the recession is that people are forced to postpone trading-in an older model of Rolls for a new one. However given the car's reputation for reliability, this is not generally regarded as a great hardship. Of the 116,000 cars produced since the company was founded in 1904, more than 60 per cent are still on the road. A spokesman for Vickers, Rolls-Royce's parent company said: 'They are the most ecologically sound car you can buy.' A Rolls-Royce spokesman said: 'Unlike volume carmakers we can keep in close touch with our customers and there is a great loyalty, but because of the recession now is not the time to be changing their cars. However, we feel there is a pent-up demand out there and this will come through in sales once the recession is over.' An area where demand for Rolls-Royce cars may have dropped is in the luxury chauffeur-driven business. Camelot Barthropp, a subsidiary of the Savoy hotel group used to run five Rolls-Royce Spirits, but now has only two. 'In the changing market Rolls are no longer as popular as they were. People prefer Jaguars, Mercedes, something a little smaller,' a company spokesman said. Rolls-Royce is still a significant government choice to carry the ambassador in more important postings like Washington, Moscow, Paris, Bonn and Tokyo. Embassies with less prestige use Range Rovers, Jaguars and Rovers. Recent reports have suggested that embassy Rolls were being sold off as a cost-cutting measure, but a Foreign Office spokesman said that cars that had been sold had been replaced. 'There has been no change in the number of Rolls-Royce vehicles in recent years,' he said, but did not rule out reductions in the medium term. Rolls-Royce blames the recession and the luxury car tax in the US, which has hit foreign imports badly, for its current problems . It believes the top models of Mercedes and BMW have been hit as badly by the two factors. Editorial commentPage 18 Vickers to cut dividend after lossPage 21</p>

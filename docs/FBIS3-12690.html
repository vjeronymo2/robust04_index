			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Khalid Salah, 'Abd-al-Fattah 'Abd-al-Mun'im, and </F> Hisham Fu'ad]    [Excerpt] AL-'ARABI has learned that two of those charged  with attempting to assassinate President Mubarak by bombing Sidi  Barrani airport and the presidential guest house in Marsa Matruh  were executed by a firing squad Monday. The families of the two  were notified to receive the bodies last Thursday. On 17  February, the military court sentenced to death three people:  Midhat al-Tahhawi, Hamadah Lutfi, and Muhammad Ahmad Sa'id  Salih (fugitive). The court also sentenced Fathi Muhammad  Khattab, Khalid Faraj, and Khalid Rashad to 10 years in prison.    Observers have noted that the indictment and trial were  carried out quickly, with the whole case taking no more than one  month. It all began when security services, in an inspection  campaign in Abu Za'bal in mid-January, accidentally arrested one  of the suspects. After that, the military prosecution prepared  the indictment and the military court began its hearings on 30  January. Three court sessions were held in 10 days, and  families of the suspects were not allowed to contact their sons  or appoint lawyers to defend them. The court appointed the  defense lawyers.    Najar al-'Arabi, secretary of the Egyptian Human Rights  Organization, commented on the military court ruling by saying:  The trial was extremely hasty, and the defense could not  perform its duty. The new executions only exacerbate the  phenomenon of political executions; law organizations have  repeatedly called for halting them and for the defendants to be  allowed to appear before civilian judges.

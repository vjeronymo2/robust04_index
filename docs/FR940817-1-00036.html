			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The majority of requests for exemption, FAA policy letters, and legal interpretations regarding mechanics pertained to inspection authorization renewal or the general eligibility and experience requirements. The majority of actions concerning repairmen involved certificate privileges and limitations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA also conducted a survey of FAA regional offices on the certification of mechanics, holders of inspection authorizations, and repairmen during 1991. A copy of this survey has been placed in docket number 27863. The survey questions were derived from issues that surfaced during FAA participation in listening sessions with aviation industry associations and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Aircraft Maintenance Engineer Licensing Panel and from issues identified in legal interpretations, petitions for exemption, petitions for rulemaking, and enforcement actions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Results of this survey showed clear support for: (1) replacing the term ``mechanic'' with ``aviation maintenance technician''; (2) developing a system for granting additional privileges and limitations for mechanics; (3) encouraging additional FAA participation with ICAO and other aviation authorities to standardize training and certification of maintenance personnel; (4) using aviation maintenance instructor experience to satisfy recent experience requirements; (5) clarifying &sect;65.75(b), written test requirements; (6) adding ``facsimile'' to &sect;65.16; and (7) developing a separate certificate or rating for balloon repairmen. The majority of the respondents supported changes in the English-language requirements for both mechanics and repairmen, the continued acceptance of military aircraft maintenance experience as the basis for airframe and powerplant mechanic certification, and changing the units of time used in &sect;65.77 to designate experience requirements for mechanics from months to hours. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> General Discussion of the Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposals developed during phase I of the Part 65 regulatory review and set forth in this NPRM cover a broad range of issues affecting the certification of aviation maintenance personnel. The proposals included in this NPRM would: (1) establish a separate part for aviation maintenance personnel; (2) remove gender-specific terms from the current regulation; (3) change the term ``mechanic'' to ``aviation maintenance technician''; (4) change the term ``repairman'' to ``aviation repair specialist''; (5) establish the equivalency of the aviation maintenance technician and aviation repair specialist certificates with current certificates; (6) allow facsimiles to be used in the process of replacing lost or destroyed aviation maintenance technician and aviation repair specialist certificates; (7) require applicants to demonstrate English-language proficiency by reading and explaining appropriate maintenance publications and by writing defect and repair statements; (8) discontinue the certification of aviation maintenance personnel who are employed outside the United States and are not proficient in the English language; (9) require all aviation maintenance technician applicants to pass a written test that would examine their knowledge of all applicable maintenance regulations; (10) clarify the requirement that each applicant for an aviation maintenance technician certificate pass all sections of the written test before applying for oral and practical tests; (11) recognize new computer-based testing methods; (12) specify all experience requirements in hours instead of months; (13) establish a basic competency requirement for aviation maintenance technicians; (14) allow aviation maintenance technicians to use equipment-specific training as an additional means to qualify for the exercise of certificate privileges; (15) permit aviation maintenance instructors to use instructional time to satisfy currency requirements; (16) establish training requirements for aviation maintenance technicians who desire to use their certificates for compensation or hire; (17) extend the duration of an inspection authorization from 1 to 2 years; and (18) expand the renewal options available to the holder of an inspection authorization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This preamble addresses the proposed changes through a discussion of the principal issues and in a section-by-section general analysis of the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

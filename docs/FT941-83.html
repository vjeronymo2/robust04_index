			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Attack results in best defence - The future for Westland as part of GKN Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN, is today expected to leave the engineering group's London headquarters and walk a few hundred yards past St James' Palace to the offices of his new subsidiary - Westland Group. He will invite Mr Alan Jones, chairman of Westland, to join the GKN board and continue his plans to develop the company as one of Europe's leading helicopter manufacturers. There is some uncertainty whether Mr Jones will accept, having waged a seven-week campaign against GKN's hostile takeover bid and hinted that some senior Westland managers would not want to work for a group dominated by automotive components and pallet hire business. Sir David, however, yesterday indicated he was going to Westland's offices to praise Mr Jones, not to bury him. Although he has criticised the Westland chairman for inflating Westland's order prospects and exaggerating potential profits, he now wants him to stay with the company and turn estimated orders for more than 150 helicopters into reality over the next six years. Potential profits could be boosted by pay-outs from the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation, which was last year ordered to pay Pounds 385m in damages over cancelled orders. Westland has already received Pounds 25m in compensation and GKN is keen to find out how much could be forthcoming. If the settlement results in a pay-out of more than Pounds 200m, along with the promise of goodwill orders from the Arab governments involved, Westland may have lost its independence too cheaply. In his meeting with Mr Jones, Sir David is also expected to reiterate the industrial logic which GKN has touted from the start, namely the synergy between its defence business - manufacturing armoured vehicles  - and helicopter production. Pointing to changing patterns of warfare around the world, Sir David believes that regional conflicts such as in Bosnia or Somalia will increase demand for rapid-response vehicles, whether in the air or on the ground. Westland's directors will be urged to exploit that potential by stepping up production at the Yeovil plant. The future, however, of all the Westland board is not secure. Mr Christopher Bunker, the group finance director, may find it hard to stay on following the arrival at Yeovil in the next few days of two senior GKN executives, who will want to go over the books. Their attention will focus on Westland's profit forecasts for the next three years and how much they will enhance GKN's tax position. Arguably, it was the likely tax benefits to GKN which first prompted the bid and fuelled Sir David's determination to succeed. Combining Westland's lucrative spares and overhaul business with its defence and engineering operations would enable GKN to increase the proportion of sales in the UK sales to 40 per cent. In turn, the Yeovil-based group's pre-tax profits - up 22 per cent to Pounds 30.5m in the 12 months to October 1 last year - would enable GKN to recover advance corporation tax that it has written off in the past. While GKN is confident that Westland's core helicopter business is vital to improving its own tax position, it is not so sure about the group's other divisions - notably Westland Technologies, the components business which has suffered from fewer aircraft orders and delays in government defence programmes. Sir David winces at talk of rationalisation and restructuring. Having made a proposal and seemingly won consent, he wants to carry Westland over the threshold before deciding which members of the extended family are disposable. For the moment, he is content to savour the prospect of enlarging his defence division to a Pounds 570m sales a year business, which aims to dominate the European market for armoured vehicles and helicopters.</p>

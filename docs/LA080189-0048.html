			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Utah officials voted to free nearly half of a $5-million legislative  appropriation to fund research into the University of Utah's cold fusion  findings. An executive committee of the state's Fusion-Energy Advisory Council  endorsed the university's request for nearly $2.5 million for the first year of  cold fusion research. The goal of the research is to develop a cheap,  relatively safe and virtually inexhaustible source of electrical energy. Next  Monday, the full council is expected to approve the budget.  </P></p>

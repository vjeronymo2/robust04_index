			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Belsky] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 18 TASS -- The international "Reforma"  foundation, headed by eminent economist Stanislav Shatalin,  today came out against Russia's accession to the NATO  "Partnership for Peace" programme. The foundation called on  political leaders to "study carefully and thoroughly all the  possible consequences of this action and to abstain from hasty  decisions".    Corroborating their point of view, the authors of the  released statement note, among other things, that participation  in military blocs "perpetuates suspicion and interferes with the  development of normal international relations". Full-blooded  international partnership and cooperation, the document says,  should be developed on a foundamentally different basis -- "on a  realistic and effective policy of peace, on a new comprehension  of the role and place of leading states in the world community".    "Moreover," the eminent Russian economists and politicians  stress, "the economic consequences of Russia's accession to the  North Atlantic Treaty Organisation would be burdensome for our  country". "The reorganisation of the armaments industry will  require huge spendings," the statement says, "because there are  single standards and unified requirements to all the types of  armaments in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. In fact,  we shall have to re-equip our army with foreign weapons, drawing  our own industry into a long and expensive process of  reconstruction."</p>

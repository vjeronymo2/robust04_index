			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Song-su and Song Hyon-sung] </F>   [Text] Moscow, June 2 (YONHAP) -- The most welcome result  of the two-day South Korea-Russia summit was their establishment  of close cooperation in handling the North Korean nuclear  problem that is fast approaching a crisis level. Presidents Kim  and Yeltsin reaffirmed that North Korea must abide by the  inter-Korean agreement on denuclearization and that its nuclear  program must be deterred.    During the first summit session Wednesday evening, Kim  received a Russian promise of participation if the U.N. Security  Council decided to impose sanctions on North Korea as a last  recourse. Such pledges are reassuring, especially because  Russia is one of the five permanent members of the Security  Council and can still exert influence on North Korea.    The degree of sanctions Russia would support remained  unclear, but Moscow's stance will certainly pressure China,  which is the last remaining uncertain variable.    In a show of growing partnership, Kim and Yeltsin agreed to  open a hot line between their offices for around-the-clock  consultations on urgent situations including the North Korean  nuclear matter.    The hot line, reserved previously for close security allies  such as Japan and the United States, is symbolic of the  transformation in bilateral relations that were once  confrontational during the cold war days but are now based on  mutual cooperation.    President Kim raised the issue of the North Korea-Russia  Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance,  especially the clause in which Russia is obligated to  automatically intervene on North Korea's side in case of war.  He made clear that any supply of military equipment and  technology to North Korea, which has not yet given up hope of  national unification by force, is inappropriate.    Yeltsin suggested that a line has been drawn in  Pyongyang-Moscow relations, explaining diplomatically that the  treaty with North Korea is virtually dead in practice.    The summit cast light on future bilateral relations, the  spirit of which was embodied in the 13-clause joint declaration  released after Thursday's summit. The two presidents championed  democracy and a market economy as shared values and vowed to  build a relationship on these principles.    They accented cooperation in trade, science and technology,  hoping to wed South Korea's industrial technology and experience  in free competition with Russia's advanced science and natural  resources.    Seoul-Moscow economic relations remain marred by the  unrepaid  South Korean loan to Russia. But Seoul officials decided to  separate this issue from other economic projects and expect it  will not get in the way of bilateral trade promotion. Further  helping to thrust forward Seoul-Moscow ties, Yeltsin handed  over, as promised, Russian documents on the 1950-53 Korean war  in a gesture aimed at sweeping away the cold war past when  Moscow had aided Pyongyang during the fratricidal clash.    Kim has now wound up his summit diplomacy with all four  surrounding powers, with each providing confirmation of strong  bilateral ties.    The summit with Yeltsin was no exception.</p>

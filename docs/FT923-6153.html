			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Letter: Lottery will be national gambol Sir, No serious gambler worth his ace of clubs would play to win a game in which the odds are a distant million to one. But that is not the view of Dr Emanuel Moran of the National Council on Gambling, writing on the UK national lottery (Personal View, August 14). Apparently, the national lottery, a flutter for good causes, with just these long odds, will encourage in people the 'dangers of excess which characterise all forms of gambling'. Dr Moran's assertion is one often made by opponents of the national lottery and it is highly questionable for the things it fails to explain. Obviously no one wants a socially damaging national lottery. But precisely what would its harmful social effects be? A national lottery for good causes is entertainment, not gambling. To paint it into some ill-defined picture of society's modern social malaise is extremely emotive. National lotteries have been a commonplace on the Continent for decades and, almost invariably, the proceeds are used to fund community projects ranging from opera houses to club houses and environmental initiatives. This is the purpose of a UK national lottery, as it appears in the government's Lottery White Paper. Richard Ogier, The Lottery Promotion Company, 41 Floral Street, London WC2E 9DG</p>

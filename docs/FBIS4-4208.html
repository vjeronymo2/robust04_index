			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report; Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in </F> Chinese at 1421 GMT on 26 April transmits a service message  canceling the following item and asking that it be replaced with  another version; differences between the two items are noted  below]    [Text] Beijing, 26 Apr (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of  the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC], and who will visit Finland,  Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Belgium soon, met with ambassadors  and ministers from the five countries in the Great Hall of the  People this afternoon. During the meeting, Li and the diplomats  exchanged views on furthering China's ties with these five  countries.    Li Ruihuan first thanked the Governments of Finland, Sweden,  Norway, and Denmark and the Chamber of Representatives and the  Senate of Belgium for inviting him to visit, and he expressed  his satisfaction over their careful arrangements for the visits.  He said: This will be my first trip to Europe in the capacity  of CPPCC chairman. It will also be a trip to fulfill the late  Chairman Li Xiannian's unfulfilled wish to visit northwest  Europe. I am looking forward to visiting your beautiful  countries and establishing wide contacts with the leaders of the  governments and parliaments, as well as the peoples from all  walks of life, of your countries. I hope that the visits will  achieve the goal of enhancing mutual understanding, expanding  exchanges, and strengthening cooperation between China and your  countries.    Li Ruihuan said: China and your five countries maintain good  ties, which have been furthered in the past few years.  High-level contacts have been constantly on the increase, and  economic, trade, scientific, and technological cooperation and  cultural exchanges have borne new fruit. The volume of two-way  trade between China and your five countries has increased by a  fairly big margin. [The preceding sentence is omitted in the  variant version] Your countries have plenty of advanced science  and technology and management expertise that China should draw  on. The economies of the two sides are mutually complementary  to a great extent, and there exist good conditions for the two  sides to further develop their relations. I hope that the two  sides will tap potentials and actively promote trade and  economic cooperation and exchanges. [variant version reads:  ...two sides will make concerted efforts, tap potentials, and  ... (adding "make concerted efforts")]    Li Ruihuan said: China is deepening reforms, opening itself  up wider, and promoting development. It needs not only a stable  and harmonious domestic environment but also a peaceful and  friendly international environment. China is in Asia while your  countries are in Europe. Our national conditions and social  system are different from yours, but China and your five  countries have no conflicts of fundamental interests and share  much common ground on the maintenance of world peace and  promoting common development. This is a very good basis for our  friendship and cooperation. China is ready to further develop  its ties with your five countries on the principles of seeking  common ground while reserving differences and of mutual respect,  noninterference in each other's internal affairs, and equality  and mutual benefit.    Li Ruihuan briefed the diplomatic envoys of the five  countries on the CPPCC. He expressed the belief that the CPPCC  will make new contributions to promoting the existing friendly  ties between China and the five countries.    Danish Ambassador to China William Friis-Moller expressed  his  welcome of Chairman Li Ruihuan's visit on behalf of the five  countries' diplomats. He said that the governments and peoples  of the five countries attach great importance to Chairman Li  Ruihuan's visit. He expressed the hope that the visit will  deepen mutual understanding, promote the development of  bilateral ties, and provide a chance for the five governments  and parliaments to learn more about China.    Present at the meeting were Zhu Xun, deputy secretary  general  of the CPPCC National Committee, and Vice Foreign Minister Jiang  Enzhu.</p>

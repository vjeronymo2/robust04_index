			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA CLARA;  </P> <P> VOTE ON STADIUM FOR GIANTS' MOVE PUT OFF  </P> <P> The Santa Clara City Council has decided to wait until November, rather than  June, to test voter opinion on whether the city should become the new home of  baseball's San Francisco Giants. Council members voted 5 to 2 against a June  ballot issue on whether to go ahead with plans for a new baseball stadium.  </P> <P> The Giants and Santa Clara Mayor Everett Souza wanted a June vote, but those  who favor November said the extra time is needed so specific plans can be  developed. Last November, San Francisco voters rejected by a slim margin a  measure calling for construction of a downtown ballpark for the National League  team, which lost to the Oakland A's in last year's World Series. Team owner Bob  Lurie has said he would commit himself to playing only one more season at  Candlestick Park.  </P></p>

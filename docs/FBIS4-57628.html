			<p>Panama,   U.S.   <F P=102> PA2105200094 Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 21 May 94 p 2A </F> <F P=103> PA2105200094 </F> <F P=104>  Panama City LA PRENSA </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Quintero De Leon] </F>   [Text] Panama's President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares,  speaking in San Jose, Costa Rica, declared that fulfillment of  the Panama Canal Treaties is in the best interests of Panama and  the United States and that no U.S. representative has indicated  to him that the provisions of the Canal Treaties should be  change.    Perez Balladares was accompanied by his future Foreign  Minister Gabriel Lewis Galindo, his adviser Jose Luis Sosa, and  Samuel Lewis Navarro at a joint news conference with Costa Rican  President Jose Maria Figueres, with whom he met at the  government palace during a visit in which they discussed  bilateral topics.    Referring to the Treaty's fulfillment, he explained that the  U.S. military presence will end on 31 December 1999 and that the  bases will cease to exist on Panamanian territory. "For  Panamanians, the return of the Canal and surrounding areas, as  well as the administration of the Canal, are not open for  discussion," Perez said.    But he did admit that the United States and Panama could  associate for other purposes. "We could say that the United  States, Panama, and the world have a common enemy in  narcotraffickers."    According to Perez, the new Panamanian Government will be  willing to discuss associating with other world nations in the  antinarcotics struggle but noted that this does not mean  retaining the military bases.    Regarding the elimination of the Army's existence from the  text of the Constitution, he made it clear that he is determined  to end any chance that military regimes could recur.    He told journalists that he had agreed with President  Guillermo Endara on introducing into the Legislative Assembly a  list of constitutional reforms, which includes eliminating any  vestige of the National Guard (Army) from the Constitution.    On the topic of Central American integration, he said that  although there are common points of agreement between the two  countries, from an economic standpoint Panama harbors some fears  regarding its possible integration with Central America.    In Perez's opinion, undoubtedly very good intentions will  prompt a continuation of the dialogue with President Figueres to  strengthen ties between the two countries. He said he would  leave this topic, which he described as "very technical," for  future Planning Minister Guillermo Chapman to study.</p>

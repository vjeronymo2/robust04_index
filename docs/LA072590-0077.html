			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA KILLS 135-ACRE HOUSING PLAN  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita City Council, ending the most divisive and bitter dispute in  the young city's history, on Tuesday night voted to kill a proposal that would  have netted the city millions of dollars in new roads in exchange for the  council's approval of a controversial housing project.  </P> <P> The council voted 4 to 1 to deny without prejudice the Santa Catarina project  proposed by G.H. Palmer Associates. Councilman Carl Boyer III dissented.  </P> <P> Mayor Jo Anne Darcy, who had long tried to forge a compromise to let Santa  Catarina proceed, said she could no longer support the project because of its  potential impact on the environment, particularly a nearby stream.  </P> <P> Darcy, repeating concerns raised by critics of the proposal during months of  public hearings, also said the 135-acre site in Canyon Country was not suited  to high-density development. Homeowners living near the proposed Santa Catarina  site had waged a vociferous, high-profile campaign against the Santa Catarina  project for months.  </P> <P> Darcy had been viewed as the swing vote on the council. Councilwomen Jan Heidt  and Jill Klajic had opposed the project earlier.  </P> <P> The proposal was modified many times during the past six months as city  planners and representatives from Palmer Associates tried to hammer out a deal  that would let the company build a condominium project in return for  substantial contributions to roads badly needed in a city choked by traffic.  </P> <P> One proposal would have let Palmer Associates build 1,452 units in return for  more than $55 million in road projects in and around the proposed development.  The Santa Catarina site is north of Soledad Canyon Road and southwest of Ermine  Street.  </P> <P> Developer Dan Palmer offered yet another compromise to the council Tuesday  night. Among other things, he offered to build no more than 800 units and said  he would redesign the project to protect the nearby stream.  </P> <P> But Heidt, saying Santa Clarita should not even consider such a giant project  until the city has completed its general plan, made a motion that the project  be denied.  </P> <P> Boyer tried to save the project, moving that the city retain an outside  mediator to work with Palmer, the council and homeowners to find a solution.  His motion died without a second.  </P> <P> Critics and supporters of the project, however, agreed on one point Tuesday:  The debate over Santa Catarina destroyed the sense of civic unity that  prevailed in Santa Clarita shortly after it incorporated on Dec. 15, 1987.  </P> <P> Darcy said there have been 10 council meetings and three Planning Commission  hearings on the project. "It has literally torn this community apart," Darcy  said.  </P> <P> "This is a community sharply divided," Palmer said. He added: "I think it's  time for this community to heal its wounds and lay down its swords."  </P> <P> Boyer and Darcy said Tuesday that in recent weeks they had received increasing  amounts of hate mail and threatening phone calls from opponents. "I have  received slashed pictures of myself -- eight of them," Darcy said.  </P> <P> Darcy said she disliked those tactics but they did not influence her vote.  </P></p>

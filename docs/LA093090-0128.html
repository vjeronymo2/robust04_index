			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STORM DOESN'T DAMPEN REIGN OF REDS' PARADE  </P> <P> It was like a scene out of a Woody Allen movie. The fans were celebrating. The  scoreboard was flashing. The TV cameras were ready.  </P> <P> The field, with the exception of a wet tarp, was empty.  </P> <P> Perhaps it was only fitting that the Cincinnati Reds -- the team that since the  first of June had lost one game more than it had won but watched everyone fall  apart trying to catch them -- learned that they won the National League West  Saturday while sitting in the clubhouse during a rain delay.  </P> <P> The Reds, trailing, 3-1, in the seventh inning to the San Diego Padres, were  watching the Boston-Toronto game on television when it happened. Someone, no  one remembers who, was listening to the Reds' broadcast during the rain delay  when the announcement came across the airwaves.  </P> <P> San Francisco 4, Dodgers 3.  </P> <P> The Reds, at 6:05 p.m. local time, were champions.  </P> <P> "Hey, no one said it was going to be pretty, and maybe the way we won it was  pretty ugly," Red pitcher Jose Rijo said. "But we won it. We finally won it.  </P> <P> "And you know, no one's going to remember how we won it 50 years from now  anyway."  </P> <P> The news spread quickly through the crowd of 37,133, most of whom were under  cover near the concession stands. Soon, fans emerged, tipping plastic cups of  beer at one another. Shrieks of glee could be heard throughout the stands.  </P> <P> Yet there still was no official word on the Riverfront Stadium scoreboard,  which was showing highlights of the 1970 World Series. The last Dodger score  shown on the scoreboard was in the sixth, with the Giants leading, 4-2.  </P> <P> The delay apparently had been orchestrated by Marge Schott, the Reds' owner.  She instructed stadium officials before the game to delay updates of the Dodger  game for several innings. If the Reds were going to win the title, she said,  they were going to win it in style.  </P> <P> When the rain began at 5:27, and when home-plate umpire Dana DeMuth ordered the  tarp to be placed on the field, Schott had no choice. You can hold back history  only so long.  </P> <P> Finally, at 6:09, the scoreboard let everyone in on the news, showing the  linescore of the Dodger game.  </P> <P> And just in case there was a soul in this town who didn't understand the  implications, one minute later, it came across the board: 1990 National League  Western Division Champions.  </P> <P> The leader, as they say on the PGA Tour, was in the clubhouse.  </P> <P> It hardly mattered to Red fans, who have been awaiting this celebration for 11  years. They simply stood in the rain, laughing, cheering an empty tarp.  </P> <P> Three minutes later, some Reds appeared on the field, with Rob Dibble and Herm  Winningham leading the entourage.  </P> <P> The only element missing from the Reds' celebration was Schott. Where was the  woman who has turned this town upside down?  </P> <P> She finally was discovered outside the press box, kicking the daylights out of  the elevator door and screaming: "Where's the . . . I want to be on the field  now!"  </P> <P> Finally, the elevator door opened, she got in and moments later, at 6:16, there  was Scott and her dog, Schottzie, parading around the field. Soon, reliever  Randy Myers emerged, hugging Schott and patting Schottzie. There was Manager  Lou Piniella, hugging the owner, but trying to ignore Schottzie. There was  Schott leading her manager by the hand around the stadium, blowing kisses to  the crowd. And there was Schottzie, holding up the procession, pausing by the  Padre dugout to relieve herself.  </P> <P> Ah, yes, it was quite an afternoon.  </P> <P> Fortunately for the Reds, who couldn't wait to wrap their hands around the  bottles of champagne, they didn't have to go out and finish the game. At 6:42  the game was called and the celebrating began in earnest.  </P> <P> Although the division championship seemed inevitable for the Reds in mid-summer  after they had led since opening day, the anxiety was a painful burden to carry  to the finish line.  </P> <P> "It was tough, we struggled for so long," Rijo said. "San Francisco and L.A.  were on our tail the whole way, it scared me. But it was like a dream for all  of us, a Cinderella season."  </P> <P> Rijo is one of 14 members of the Reds playoff roster who are castoffs from  other teams, excluding Piniella. But they jelled into a championship team.  </P> <P> One of those castoffs was Mariano Duncan, traded by the Dodgers along with Tim  Leary for Kal Daniels and Lenny Harris.  </P> <P> "You know what the difference is this year," Duncan said. "I'll tell you the  difference. I hit .240 for them, but I know I'm not a .240 hitter all my life.  But with the Dodgers, they have five or six guys that mix up your head.  Everyone tell you what to do when you go to the plate, and every one of them is  telling you something different.  </P> <P> "Here, there's only one guy who helps me with my hitting, Tony Perez. That's  all I need, one guy. If the Dodgers had Tony Perez, they might be winning too."  </P> <P> Said Rob Dibble: "You look at this team, and you won't find a better clubhouse  atmosphere than this one. We don't have the best talent, everyone in baseball  knows the Padres have the most in this division. But we play together. We go  out together. We lived for this together."  </P> <P> The Reds were laughing and scoffing at any questions about the Pittsburgh  Pirates, who clinched at least a tie in the National League East.  </P> <P> Then someone mentioned the Big Red Machine, the dynasty that ruled all of  baseball, responsible for the Reds' last division championship in 1979.  </P> <P> Then someone mentioned a player from that era, the same one for whom a street  had been named in front of Riverfront Stadium. The same one who is residing in  the Marion, Ill., federal penitentiary.  </P> <P> Someone brought up the name, Pete Rose.  </P> <P> "I don't know how anyone else is feeling around here," said infielder Ron  Oester, who has been with the Reds since being drafted in 1974. "But I've been  thinking about him. I've been thinking about him a lot.  </P> <P> "I wish Pete could be a part of this. I really wish he could be here, because  he deserves as much credit as anyone. In his heart, I think Pete Rose knows he  has something to do with it."  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITANS HOLD OFF AUSSIES IN BASKETBALL OPENER  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton took the wraps off the 1990-91 basketball season with an  88-83 exhibition victory over the Illiwarra Hawks, an Australian club team,  Saturday night at Titan Gym.  </P> <P> All things considered, the victory was a break from dire preseason predictions.  </P> <P> At Wednesday's media day, Big West Conference coaches picked Fullerton for last  place.  </P> <P> Fullerton survived a late run by Illiwarra, letting a 14-point lead midway  through the second half dwindle to 82-80 with less than two minutes left.  </P> <P> But the Titans didn't panic. Agee Ward made a 10-foot jumper for an 84-80 lead  with 1:20 to play. Illiwarra's Norman Taylor dribbled off his foot at the other  end. Wayne Williams made three free throws and Joe Small had one down the  stretch for the Titans.  </P> <P> "What pleased me more than anything else was when someone makes a run at you,  and you hold them," Fullerton Coach John Sneed said. "Winning builds  confidence, helps morale and makes you believe in what you're doing out on the  practice floor."  </P> <P> Fullerton had trouble defending Taylor, the Hawks' 6-foot-6, 230-pound center,  who had a game-high 30 points.  </P> <P> He had eight points in the final six minutes and was setting up for a short  jumper when he bounced the ball of his shoe and into Small's hands.  </P> <P> Ward had 21 points off the bench to lead the Titans. Williams, a senior point  guard who is Fullerton's only returning starter, had a steady opener with 20  points and eight assists, including a behind-the-head flip to Ward for a dunk  on a fast break.  </P> <P> Small, from Bolsa Grande High School and College of the Sequoias, had 19  points.  </P></p>

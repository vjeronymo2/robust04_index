			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / International Company News: Mobil earnings jump 29% in fourth quarter MOBIL, one of the biggest US oil and natural gas groups, yesterday posted a 29 per cent gain in fourth-quarter net earnings to Dollars 514m compared with Dollars 400m a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to Dollars 1.25 from 97 cents. Stripping out special items, Mobil said fourth-quarter earnings rose 50 per cent to Dollars 583m. Revenues in the last three months stood at Dollars 17.24bn compared with Dollars 17.17bn in the same period of 1991. For all 1992, net earnings fell 55 per cent to Dollars 863m or Dollars 2.01, from 1991's Dollars 1.92bn, or Dollars 4.65. Revenues rose to Dollars 63.82bn from Dollars 63.22bn. Mobil took a non-cash charge in 1992 for the adoption of new accounting standards. Excluding special items, Mobil said its earnings fell 21 per cent to Dollars 1.49bn in the year. Pressures of weak economies and soft industry demand hurt operating earnings from downstream and chemical operations in 1992. Underlying marketing and refining earnings fell to Dollars 354m for the year from Dollars 1.02bn. Those of the chemical business fell to Dollars 76m from Dollars 217m. Stripping out special items, earnings from exploration and producing rose 20 per cent to Dollars 1.48bn in the year. Restructuring charges of Dollars 49m in the quarter brought 1992's worldwide restructuring charges to Dollars 203m.</p>

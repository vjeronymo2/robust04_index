Makarov, candidate of technical </F> sciences]    [Text] An aircraft with an acquisition radar for early  warning of the appearance of airborne targets was used for the  first time 50 years ago during World War II. This small U.S.  aircraft, the TBM-3W Avenger, was based on aircraft carriers. A  year later PB-1W land-based aircraft, developed on the basis of  the B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber, began to be used in  support of fleet combat operations. One and the same radar  (later designated AN/APS-20), operating in the 10 cm waveband,  was installed in both aircraft. In the 1950's several other  radar early warning aircraft were created with different  versions of that radar with a dish antenna and housed in a dome  beneath the fuselage--Guardian, Skyraider, Gannet, EC-12 and  Shackleton. They were intended for operations over the sea. One  (the British Shackleton-AEW.2) was used right up until 1991.    Subsequently, the capabilities of these aircraft were  reduced  considerably in connection with increased speeds of strike  aircraft using low flight altitudes and with mass employment of  aviation. Airborne radar early warning and control systems with  pulse-Doppler radars capable of providing vast areas of  surveillance of low-flying targets and performing functions as  air control centers came to replace them during the  1960's-1970's.    At the present time preference is given abroad to two types  of radar early warning and control systems based on the E-2C  Hawkeye and E-3 AWACS system aircraft. In recent years new ones  -- P-3 AEW Sentinel and C-130 AEW with the radar used on the  E-2C Hawkeye, and the Defender with Skymaster radar -- also have  begun to arrive.    In contrast to radar early warning aircraft of the 1940's  and  1950's, they have more sophisticated radars which acquire  airborne and surface targets at long ranges against a background  of ground clutter, and high-capacity onboard data processing,  display and exchange equipment. The latter permits successfully  acquiring and automatically tracking a large number of targets  and guiding friendly aircraft to them. In addition to radars,  the makeup of radar early warning and control system equipment  includes sets for ELINT collection and identification of  nationality; communications and data exchange equipment;  navigation, flight control and landing gear; various control  consoles; a central computer; and data processors.    Characteristics of radar early warning and control  systems are given in the table.

The antenna consists of a two-tier array of "wave duct" type radiators.   2. Tentative cost of onboard system less ground equipment.         Hawkeye aircraft, created in the United States in the early  1960's for deck-based naval aviation, have become widespread  abroad. The first of them (E-2A and E-2B) subsequently were  refitted as the more modern E-2C, which became operational in  1972. At the present time around 200 aircraft already have been  produced. In the United States they are basically used by the  Navy in the deck-based version with folding outboard wing  panels. In other countries (Israel, Egypt, Japan, Singapore),  they are employed from shore airfields. The U.S. Navy presently  plans to stop purchasing new Hawkeye aircraft, but several other  foreign states attracted by their relatively low cost are  showing interest in them.    Equipment was constantly upgraded in the process of Hawkeye  radar early warning and control aircraft production. The radar  underwent an especially significant modernization -- six  versions were created. This was explained above all by the  radar's poor noise rejection and limited capabilities for  discriminating targets against the background of ground clutter  (but not reflections from the sea). Work presently is being  completed on the radar's latest modernization, which U.S.  specialists believe will permit effectively using the E-2C even  in the 21st century. The effective range of the radar and of  equipment for identifying nationality will be increased by 40  percent, the number of targets tracked will increase fourfold  (it was 250), and targets displayed on the screen of  multifunctional control consoles will increase by 9.6 times.    It is planned to upgrade the new radar (designated  AN/APS-145) by use of high-speed digital processors with great  capabilities, introduction of an automatic frequency change  under the effect of interference, and use of three pulse  repetition frequencies of emitted signals, increasing the  effectiveness of tracking targets during flight operations over  land. Installation of modern seven-color displays (the screen  size rose from 25x25 cm to 27.5x27.5 cm) will enable displaying  over 2,000 targets. A NAVSTAR satellite radionavigation  receiver, which will increase accuracy of determining the  aircraft's position, and improved equipment of the JTIDS joint  tactical communications and information distribution system also  are being introduced to the equipment makeup. Production of the  E-2C Hawkeye with new onboard equipment is planned for  1993-1994, and modernization of the old ones is to be completed  by 1998.    One deficiency of the aforementioned aircraft is limited  endurance. Proposals for equipping it with additional fuel tanks  or an aerial refueling system have not been supported, since  this precludes substitution of crew members for rest. They  operate under difficult conditions of cramped space and high  noise.    Capabilities of the E-3 AWACS airborne early warning and  control system aircraft, created in the United States to support  command and control of air defense forces and assets over large  territories, is considerably broader. It began to become  operational in 1977, and 68 aircraft were produced in five  different versions before its production stopped in 1991. Of  these, the E-3B and C are used in the U.S. Air Force, the E-3A  in the NATO Allied Air Defense System in Europe and Saudi  Arabia, and the E-3D and E-3F in the UK and French air forces  respectively.    The E-3B and C radar early warning and control systems have  a  greater amount of communications equipment compared with the  E-3A NATO-AWACS and E-3D and F. AN/APY-1 radars are installed in  the E-3A (Saudi Arabia) and E-3B, and the more modern AN/APY-2  radars in the others. E-3A aircraft of the Saudi Arabian Air  Force as well as the E-3D and F use new engines of the French  firm of SNECMA and their power is approximately ten percent  higher. Other differences are unimportant and consist, for  example, of the installation of an aerial refueling system  different from the U.S. system and, on the British version, use  of an ELINT set of their own development housed in wingtip pods.    E-3 AWACS systems are constantly being upgraded in the  process of production. In particular, it is possible to note  modernization of the AN/APY-1 radar as the AN/APY-2 version  chiefly by introducing to it a supplementary operating mode  against surface targets, and also an increase in central  computer capabilities, which permitted increasing the number of  targets being tracked automatically. In addition, expansion of  the system equipment mix was provided for in advance. An  increase in the number of multifunctional control consoles from  9 to 14 also should be included among the most important  improvements. Since 1993 the AN/AYR-1 ELINT set has been  installed in E-3A NATO-AWACS and E-3C aircraft. The latter will  permit determining the type of radar or other electronic sets,  their operating mode and their location by an analysis of  signals being received. A high data processing rate supports  identification of up to 100 targets in 10 seconds. A signal  source and platform characteristics data bank stored in the  central computer memory is used. The station weighs 860 kg and  consists of 23 units. U.S. radar early warning and control  aircraft and those belonging to NATO are to be outfitted with it  during 1997-1998. France also is showing an interest in the set.    It is also planned to outfit E-3 aircraft with NAVSTAR  satellite radionavigation system receivers, upgraded JTIDS  system data transmission equipment in the 2H modification, a  more powerful central computer, and subsequently with MILSTAR  space communications system gear. Much attention is being given  to fulfilling the program for modernizing the radar of AWACS  systems to improve its capabilities in acquiring low-signature  targets. The set's effective range will almost double through  improved signal processing quality (with the help of a new  high-powered processor) and through a change in the structure of  emitted signals with inclusion of a signal spectrum analyzer in  the gear with a display located at the radar control console. It  is proposed to complete modification of the radar under this  program in the late 1990's, which in the opinion of U.S.  specialists will permit successfully using E-3 AWACS radar early  warning and control systems until 2010-2015.    The E-3 aircraft is costly and operates from runways of  great  length, and so its purchase is accessible only to certain  countries. The E-2C is approximately three times cheaper than  the E-3, but has half the patrol time and worse radar  characteristics. In view of this, in organizing zones of lengthy  patrolling, it is necessary to activate at the very least two  E-2C's in place of one E-3. Foreign specialists realize the  requirement for the appearance of a radar early warning and  control aircraft occupying an intermediate position in  capabilities and cost between the E-3 and E-2C.    In Great Britain, the Nimrod with AN/APY-920 radar could  have  become that aircraft, but after lengthy work and expenditure of  considerable funds the country's Ministry of Defence in 1986  (already in the process of acceptance tests) was forced to give  up further development and make the decision to purchase the  U.S. E-3 Sentry. This was due to the fact that the radar (two  antenna systems installed in the fuselage nose and tail to  provide a circular scan) and data processing equipment did not  meet demands being placed on them.    In the 1980's, the U.S. firm Lockheed began to study  versions  of installing the E-2C Hawkeye aircraft system radar in its own  medium-size aircraft intended for other missions. In 1981 a  model of the C-130 military transport aircraft (reduced 10  times), with the fairing of this radar antenna located on a  shortened tail fin, underwent wind-tunnel testing. A version of  the airborne early warning and control system was created in  1984 on a P-3 Orion land-based patrol aircraft with the dome of  the AN/APS-125 radar, rotating together with the antenna,  accommodated on a pedestal above the fuselage (similar to the  E-2C and E-3). In 1985 this aircraft with dome, but without  radar gear, was demonstrated at an aerospace exhibition in  France.    After unsuccessful tests of the radar early warning and  control system on the Nimrod-AEW.3, Lockheed suggested  installing its radar on a C-130, which would permit a 40 percent  increase in payload weight and a 25 percent increase in volume  of space for the operations team (compared with the Nimrod).    In 1988 development was completed on the radar early warning  and control system with AN/APS-125 radar for the P-3 AEW  aircraft (Fig. 1 [figure not reproduced]), given the company  designation of Sentinel. It was handed over to the U.S. Customs  Service, which decided to purchase four such aircraft for  detecting aircraft and vessels of smugglers/drug suppliers over  the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Three aircraft already  have been transferred to this service and it is planned to  deliver the fourth in late 1993. A more modern version of the  Hawkeye radar early warning and control system radar, the  AN/APS-138, is installed in all aircraft except the first, and  standard P-3 Orion aircraft equipment is used. Software was  developed by Lockheed. The work of refitting the P-3 Orion as a  radar early warning and control version is valued at  approximately $10 million, and on the whole it will cost the  client almost $35 million.    The EC-130 AEW aircraft (Fig. 2 [figure not reproduced]),  with the newest version of the Hawkeye aircraft radar  (AN/APS-145) and its other equipment, made the first test flight  in 1991 and subsequently became operational with the U.S. Coast  Guard.    The P-3 AEW and EC-130 AEW have communications gear  supporting transmission of data obtained with their help to air  defense command and control centers; it is proposed to export  them to other countries. Lockheed is undertaking to create new  aircraft with the AN/APS-145 radar and Grumman is undertaking to  refit the C-130, with installation of all E-2C Hawkeye aircraft  gear. The new radar early warning and control systems using P-3  and C-130 aircraft cost approximately half that of the AWACS  system E-3, but 1.5 times more than the E-2C Hawkeye. But  expenses for their purchase and operation can be reduced by  refitting aircraft which are in the order of battle and also  using already deployed equipment and elements of the  infrastructure for servicing them. At the present time 62  countries have C-130 transport aircraft and 9 have P-3 Orion  land-based patrol aircraft in the inventory. Government circles  of Japan and Australia were discussing questions of purchasing  such radar early warning and control systems.    Along with the radar early warning and control systems  described above, proposals of firms are published periodically  in the press for refitting G.222 and other aircraft for these  purposes, but most often the essence of this work consists of  creating inexpensive systems with limited capabilities  accommodated in small aircraft. The Defender is the most  well-known system of this type and already has found use. The  BN-2B light passenger aircraft served as its basis (Fig. 3  [figure not reproduced]). Its cost is 2-5 times lower (depending  on the equipment mix) than for the E-2C Hawkeye. The Skymaster  radar antenna, providing a circular scan, is installed in a dome  in the fuselage nose. This pulse-Doppler radar was developed  based on the Searchwater radar being used on land-based patrol  aircraft. The system makeup includes one or two multifunctional  control consoles with color displays. The system's computer  equipment is capable of supporting automatic tracking of up to  100 airborne and 32 surface targets.    During 1987-1988 the Defender radar early warning and  control  aircraft was demonstrated at various exhibitions and offered for  sale. The press reported that three systems were purchased for  Great Britain in 1989.    In the early 1990's the U.S. firm Westinghouse proposed to  outfit radar early warning aircraft with a modified AN/APG-66  radar of the F-16 fighter with a new antenna (1.3x0.8 m) and  infrared acquisition system for use by the U.S. National Guard  and for sale to other countries. Various foreign firms have also  proposed installing similar radars and other equipment in  existing small aircraft, but there is presently no information  about adoption of these proposals and purchase of such systems.    For a long time the U.S. Air Force and Navy have been  developing new-generation radar early warning and control  systems which will use radars with large antennas in the form of  phased arrays with fully electronic scanning of the surveillance  zone space. These qualitatively new assets will permit detecting  such low-signature targets as cruise missiles at great  distances, but U.S. specialists believe they will appear in the  inventory only during the next century. Simplified versions of  similar systems--Erieye and Falcon--presently are being created  in Sweden and Israel respectively, but it is not clear for now  whether they will be able to compete with already existing  models. At the same time, the most widespread systems installed  in E-2C Hawkeye and E-3 AWACS aircraft already have demonstrated  their high capabilities in the course of combat operations in  the Arab-Israeli conflicts and in the Persian Gulf War.    Thus, different versions of radar early warning and control  systems have been created abroad differing in characteristics  and cost. Thanks to good survivability and the capability of  detecting low-flying targets, their role in supporting air  defense will grow (especially on territories not having a ground  radar network); and so one can expect them to spread throughout  the world in the future.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Government statement delivered by Foreign Minister Klaus </F> Kinkel to the Bundestag in Bonn -- live]    [Text] Madame President, Ladies and Gentlemen:    The European Union [EU] Council in Corfu made some  additional  progress with European unification, even though it was not  possible to agree on a new Commission president. The signing of  the membership treaties with Austria, Finland, Sweden, and  Norway, and the signing of the partnership and cooperation  agreement with Russia made one thing clear: The EU has begun to  successfully tackle the shaping of Europe, shaping a common  future of the European peoples in an EU that is linked in  partnership with Russia and which includes the Baltic Sea just  as it does the Mediterranean. [applause]    After the Austrians' impressive yes to Europe, I am  confident  that our Nordic neighbors will also vote for this community,  because never before has it been clearer in Europe that there is  no future in acting on one's own account. [applause]    With this appeal to its partners, the Federal Government,  which will hold the presidency as of 1 July, will now try to  achieve a consensus on the succession of Jacques Delors, who has  indeed gained great merit with his work for Europe. [applause]    If necessary, it will convene an extraordinary European  Council for this matter in Brussels on 15 July.    The EU needs a strong European figure at the head of the  Commission, and this decision must be made quickly. The last  thing the EU needs at this decisive landmark is a lack of  decisionmaking power and a lack of the ability to achieve  consensus.    Ladies and Gentlemen, in two days reunited Germany will for  the first time take over the chairmanship in the EU Council. We  will do everything in our power to make progress in the cause of  Europe within this limited period of six months -- in closest  coordination with France, which will follow us in the presidency  and with which we will subsequently be in the troika, but also  with the later presidencies of Spain and Italy.    I am currently in the process of visiting all 12 European  countries to prepare for that. We Germans see our future in the  common European path. This must be our compass. [applause]    And we do not want to make any promises that we cannot keep.  We must dedicate ourselves to solid, consistent management.  Very specific issues must be tackled, such as the employment  situation, unemployment, and crime, which are truly burning  problems for the people in Europe. At the same time, however,  the issue is also the further shaping of our continent, that is,  the deepening and enlargement of the nucleus of Europe that the  EU constitutes today.    In all this we must take our citizens, the people, along.  Despite a turnout of only 56 percent in the European elections,  I am convinced that the large majority of the people in Europe  have indeed understood that no one in Europe can go it alone  anymore. Solidarity in moving toward each other and standing  side by side is indispensable for all peoples, whether large or  small.    However, the people expect Europe to contribute with  determination to overcoming unemployment and to promoting peace  and, above all, internal peace. These are the issues that were  the focus in Corfu and will be the main points of emphasis  during the German presidency as of 1 July. If we make progress  in these fields, we need not worry about the citizens' support.  [applause]    The Europe of the citizens and democratic parliamentary  legitimation -- these are inseparable elements.    Certain things apply already: Without the approval of the  European Parliament no commissions can be appointed, no budget  adopted, and no accessions effected. During our presidency the  Federal Government will take particular care to ensure close  cooperation among the Council, the Commission, and the  Parliament. And we know that we have the support of the  Bundestag in this. [applause] Right from the beginning, we  Germans have spoken out for increasing the powers of the  European Parliament, and we will continue to do so after the  Maastricht Treaty. [applause] The participation of two European  Parliament representatives in the 1996 government conference,  which has been strongly supported by the Federal Government and  was agreed in Corfu, is a right signal. The report on enforcing  the principle of subsidiarity, which is due at the European  Council in Essen, is also of great importance for a sound  balance of the different levels. Enforcing the principle of  subsidiarity, also by getting back European decisions, has to be  a top priority on our agenda. [applause]    Ladies and Gentlemen, the preservation of our European way  of  life and our culture, and the securing of our social network  decisively depend on our international competitiveness. With  the aim of giving modernization an impetus, and removing  obstacles to growth and employment, a number of important  measures were agreed in Corfu. The projects to extend  trans-European traffic, energy, and communication networks are a  top priority in this connection. This includes two high-speed  train links in Germany. For the Federal Government sound  financing is an absolute must, and we have stated this clearly.  What is needed in the member countries also applies to Brussels  -- strictest budget discipline. [applause]    The second important sector is the reform of the labor  market, the creation of jobs in services, the promotion of  medium-size companies, and concentration of resources in  research. Everyone agreed in Corfu that the reform of the  European employment sector, which is urgently required, must not  be postponed just because the economy shows signs of recovering.  That would be threatening the existence of Germany as a  business location. [applause] It is against this background  that the Federal Government sees the independent group of  experts that is to help the Commission with deregulation. And  we will also work toward participation by the social partners in  this task.    Modernizing Europe as a business location also means further  ecological development of the European market. Environmental  technology is the main growth sector of the future. We Germans  are very far advanced and are international leaders in this  field. [applause] It is clear for the German presidency that a  carbon dioxide tax needs a European solution.    In the field of domestic and legal policy, Ladies and  Gentlemen, a report on the prevention of international crime,  terrorism, and the drug Mafia will be presented at the Essen  Council. These issues, as well as asylum and immigration  policy, touch central points of national sovereignty, which  makes specific measures very difficult. But in no other field  is decisive action, that means effective protection of citizens,  more urgent and expected. The new Europe has given its citizens  more freedom, more opportunities. Now the necessary measures  must be taken to ensure the personal security of citizens. The  Franco-German initiative against racism and xenophobia has been  welcomed by our partners. And this problem, this has to be  pointed out clearly, concerns all the member countries. At the  European Council in Essen we will present a common strategy on  that.    Ladies and Gentlemen, to overcome old, deep national  rivalries in Europe and to face the major, vital questions of  the European nation together and with great determination --  this was the motive that guided our founding fathers of the  European Community. Five years after the fall of the Berlin  Wall and the beginning of the major changes in Europe and the  world, this is true more than ever. However, it is true in a  new, pan-European framework. Today we have a clearer image of  the challenges that we have to tackle, the risks that we have to  avoid, and the specters of the past that we have to ward off.  If there is a special German responsibility in terms of foreign  policy in the context of history then it is this: To build the  Europe that we are seeking together with the new democracies in  Central and East Europe. [applause]    The FRG remains an advocate for a whole Europe. The signing  of the accession treaties with Austria and the Scandinavian  countries, the resolutions on bringing the neighbors in Central  and East Europe, the Baltic states, and Slovenia closer to the  EU, confirm that Germany's picture of Europe is identical with  that of our partners in the EU. Our partners also know that, in  the long run, the West cannot do well if the East does not do  well, too. [applause]    The law on the accession of Austria and the Scandinavian  countries has been submitted to the Bundestag today for  discussion and a vote. This speedy procedure, which is  supported by a wide majority, will be a clear political signal  to the citizens in these countries, a signal saying: You are  cordially welcome. [applause]    Ladies and Gentlemen, new, concrete proposals are to be  presented to the European Council in Essen for bridging the  difficult transition phase in which the reformist states will be  until they can join the EU. A further opening of markets and  closer political cooperation even in a preliminary stage are  important for us and, as Germans, we will make special efforts  in this connection. Prior to the Essen meeting, we will also  have to work on the idea, which came up in Corfu, of a  conference between the EU and all countries on the shores of the  Mediterranean, and to conclude the customs union with Turkey.    The two agreements that were concluded with Moscow last week  -- the agreement on Partnership for Peace with NATO, and the  partnership and cooperation agreement of Corfu -- make it clear  that Russia, too, has its place in the European home as a friend  and partner. [applause] President Yeltsin is right when he  says that this marks an important step for achieving unity on  our continent.    Ladies and Gentlemen, the Franco-German initiative for the  prevention of a new Chernobyl, the consequences of which we  dread even to think of, was also discussed in Corfu. It must be  our objective to shut down this dangerous reactor type as soon  as possible. [applause] This will require alternative energy  sources, which, will, of course, cost money, but this money  would be well invested in the interest of all people in Europe.  At the world economic summit in Naples, the EU will ask the  other G-7 partners to help solve the problem. This issue  affects everybody -- the industrial nations, and, first and  foremost, of course, the Ukrainian Government.    The German presidency will take advantage of President  Clinton's visit to Berlin on 12 July to reaffirm the friendly  ties across the Atlantic. Without these, Europe can find  neither its internal nor its external balance. [applause]    Ladies and Gentlemen, the ghastly television images from  Bosnia or from our neighboring continent, Africa, which we see  on television day after day, demonstrate that peace and freedom  have not become a matter of course after the end of the  East-West conflict -- not even on our European continent, which  today numbers 36 states, not including the CIS members. This  means that we need a joint foreign and security policy that  really deserves this title. [applause]    This needs time, but the decisions of Corfu confirm the  will to be serious about it. The talks with the parties to the  conflict in the former Yugoslavia have entered a decisive stage.  The Federal Government is involved in these talks within the  framework of the contact group. Yesterday the contact group met  and I think and know that it achieved good results. The EU, the  United States, and Russia must offer a peace solution and make  it clear that the patience of the international community is  exhausted. This must be made clear to all three parties to the  conflict. Decisive and cohesive action by the EU, Russia, and  the United States is necessary. For us Europeans, taking over  the administration of Mostar, headed by Administrator Hans  Koschnick, is of particular importance. [applause]    The Federal Government hopes that a model for the peaceful  coexistence of various ethnic groups can be implemented there.  This is the only way to ensure the reconciliation of the people  in the former Yugoslavia. It is necessary more urgently than  ever but it is still extremely difficult to achieve it --  unfortunately.    Ladies and Gentlemen, the first presidency of reunited  Germany means a particular political opportunity but also a  particular obligation. Not only the eyes of the Europeans are  directed at Germany and at this presidency. The Federal  Government wants to make progress with the pending decisions.  In addition, however, it wants to make clear that European  integration continues to be a central issue also in reunited  Germany. [applause]    We have the largest number of neighbors in Europe. For the  first time in German history relations with all our neighbors  are characterized by mutual will for lasting friendship and  cooperation under one common roof. We must and will make good  use of this opportunity. Germany's future lies in Europe.  [applause]</p>

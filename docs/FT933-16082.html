			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: MP accused after BCCI protest MR KEITH VAZ, Labour MP for Leicester East, was accused by the Bank of England last night of 'being intent upon making mischief' after he led depositors in the collapsed bank Bank of Credit and Commerce International delivering a wreath to mark the second anniversary of its closure. Mr Vaz said he was punched three times by a security man, but said later he accepted an apology from the man. A Bank spokesman denied the claim, saying it was not supported by an official present at the time - or by a security video which had been checked.</p>

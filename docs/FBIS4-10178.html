			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with FSLN, Sandinist National Liberation Front, </F> leader Sergio Ramirez Mercado with unidentified correspondents  and audience members; place and date not given; on radio program  "60 Minutes With Xavier Reyes Alba"; first paragraph EL  SEMANARIO introduction]    [Text] In the midst of what has perhaps been the greatest  public debate ever generated in the Sandinist Front's history,  Dr. Sergio Ramirez Mercado, leader of the party's bench in  Parliament and of the recently emerging faction known as "For a  Sandinism of the Majorities," appeared on the radio program "60  Minutes With Xavier Reyes Alba" to present his political views.  The following is the edited, condensed transcription of  questions posed by the newsman and his audience, along with  Ramirez Mercado's replies.    [Question] Why should Sergio Ramirez sign a document of one  faction of the FSLN? I have heard people say that the DN  [National Directorate] should stay out of it and then, later on,  act as a "grand judge" and hand down a final ruling.    [Ramirez] That view is now history. The FSLN is going  through  a very important phase of evolution and transformation during  which differing points of view must be expressed in order to  enrich debate. I have always thought that ideas and thought were  the only thing that could change the world--along with action,  naturally--since no change takes place without thought behind it.    I am a member of the DN, elected on the 1991 ticket, and we  were supposed to remain on the Directorate until 1995, but we  have not been protected by history. If a special congress is to  be held, it is because the party leadership comes up for  election. In other words, starting now and until May, I consider  myself a provisional leader of the FSLN because that congress  will decide whether or not I continue to occupy a post of  leadership. Based on that freedom of action and thought, I felt  authorized to sign a document expressing a nonconfrontational  position, a document that is an attempt to contribute to the  debate. When a group of FSLN comrades met to draft the document,  we discussed whether Major Luis Carrion, who is also a member of  the DN, and I should sign or not. We decided that the most  honest and most transparent thing was for us to sign since we  were involved in the drafting. We could not fall back on the old  trick of throwing the stone and then hiding our hand.    [Question] How can you win power when some think that the  Front is not yet prepared to be unified, not just because  factions exist, but because of an entire culture, different  styles of work and leadership, that seem to stand in the way of  any possibility of unity?    [Ramirez] That is precisely what we must change. The FSLN  must face up to a process of transformation because it has never  been afraid of change. Far worse would be to imagine a  conservative Sandinism afraid of taking a chance, of moving  forward, of thinking. If the Sandinists were able to put an end  to the Somoza dictatorship, it was because they moved ahead, not  just with military action, but also with new political ideas, by  joining forces and forming alliances. The creation of the Group  of the Twelve was a key move enabling the FSLN to take power by  calling upon social sectors which, at the time, did not yet  envision the FSLN as a government alternative and which in 1979  did so despite the fact that the FSLN proposed the option of  armed struggle. Now, if what the FSLN is presenting is the  option of civil, electoral struggle, then I believe all the more  strongly that we can once again summon thousands of Nicaraguans  who believe that this country deserves a better fate and that  the FSLN can provide it.    [Question] The crux of the matter is how to unite the  so-called "majorities." What must the Sandinists offer in order  to win them back?    [Ramirez] A very clear message. I think the Sandinists lost  the 1990 elections because many Nicaraguans began to harbor many  prejudices in their minds. The people thought the FSLN was a  symbol of war, that it would not solve the country's economic  problems.    [Question] But it continues to project that image at times.    [Ramirez] That is what we want and need to change at all  costs. I maintain that if the FSLN does not get to the  majorities with the image of a civilian party, removed from  violence, removed from any confrontation, one that wants harmony  and reconciliation for this country, then it will be very  difficult for us to rally the votes we need to win because we  are indeed talking about votes here. Furthermore, it neither  frightens me nor makes me ashamed to say that the FSLN is a  revolutionary, electoral party because it has to go into the  elections and win. One wins elections by rallying the will of  all those who go into the little booth and who then, alone with  their conscience, place a mark under a flag and decide for whom  they will vote. That is the decisive, definitive time for a  political party, far from the noise of the crowds and the  demonstrations. I hope that a new, transparent FSLN, an FSLN  that is very clear and firm about what it says, about doing what  it says and saying what it does, can convince the voters that we  are once again a viable alternative for the country.    [Question] I would like you to define what you mean when you  say, "We oppose violence," what kind of weapons the working  people still have, people who, because of the Sandinism of the  majorities, accused the group of being social democratic.    [Ramirez] I do not think the FSLN has any weapons left.  Those  weapons are now in the hands of the Army and the Police, which  are the only institutions allowed to have weapons in this  country. This must be stated quite clearly and without fear. The  FSLN is a party that must use all the paths of civic struggle  that are open to it, not lending themselves to confusion. The  FSLN must fight from the perspective of the majorities, their  conquests and their rights. The right to strike, marches, and  social pressure are legitimate instruments. What is not  legitimate is resorting to violence in a strike, attacking those  who do not agree with what is being done.    In addition, certain terms are deliberately used to confuse  the people. I am referring to the notorious "social democracy."  As a result of a decision by the Sandinist Assembly, the FSLN  appealed to the Socialist International, an international  organization of social democratic parties, to admit it as a full  member, but the IS decided to admit the FSLN as an observer. The  request was a party decision, not a decision by individuals in  the party. Before that, as we prepared for the World  Interparliamentary meeting, we decided, following the  assassination of Olof Palme, one of the outstanding social  democratic leaders in the world, to give his name to the  convention center. Major Daniel Ortega, secretary general of the  party, personally attended the funeral of Willy Brandt, another  of the foremost social democratic leaders in the world, in order  to pay homage to him on behalf of the Sandinists. The Sandinists  have always been a friend of social democrats and continue to  be. I am not an enemy of any social democratic leader. Next week  I will meet in Spain with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, a  great friend of Nicaragua and the Nicaraguan revolution. He is a  social democrat and does not go around denying it. I am not a  social democrat, but I am not their enemy either and see nothing  wrong with being one. I am a democratic Sandinist who believes  that the only possible Sandinism is democratic Sandinism because  if someone were to tell me that there is a type of Sandinism  that is potentially totalitarian, I would not believe it.    [Question] Why is there no definition of the left anywhere  in  the document?    [Ramirez] It is stated in the document, a leftist document.  It is not, in my view, a rightist document, nor is the one  drafted by our other comrades in the FSLN rightist because the  FSLN is not a party of the right. The Nicaraguan political  spectrum has a right and a left and the political space occupied  by the latter is filled by the FSLN. However, it is necessarily  a democratic left and I find it unnecessary to speak of a  democratic left. The left is the left, the left of today.  Perhaps there was a totalitarian left before, but it disappeared  and one cannot say "I belong to the democratic left" because  this would amount to agreeing that there is also a left that is  not democratic and for me such a thing is impossible. If I  belong to the left, I am democratic.    [Question] How convinced is the entire FSLN and all its  members that they do indeed no longer represent the majority,  that they cannot lay claim to representing the nation or  thinking for it, that we must have a change in style, method,  and thought in order for the FSLN to return to power in the 1996  elections?    [Ramirez] I believe there are many more people convinced of  that than would appear. An attempt is often made to give a false  image of radicalism in the ranks of Sandinism, as if it were  enclosed in a radicalism with no way out and as if ideas about  transformation, change, and renewal existed only in the heads of  a handful of intellectuals. I am labeled an intellectual as if  it were an offense, and it seems to me to be somewhat odd that  anyone who thinks or who is an intellectual should be treated in  a pejorative manner. All of us who think are in some way  intellectuals, but the term "intellectual" is used to denote an  elite that is unaware of what is happening among the rank and  file, that only thinks about things unrelated to Nicaragua, as  if to renew Sandinism, to transform its ideas, to go back to the  majorities, were social democratic, European notions removed  from this society. I have even been accused of having a European  education, as if that were somehow negative.    [Listener fromn Boaco] Why do you not have access to  broadcasting stations such as "Radio Ya," "Radio Sandino,"  "Channel 4," and all the supposedly Sandinist media? That  worries the rank and file because while the leaders say there is  no split, we see different groups. What is happening within the  party?    [Ramirez] I share your concerns, comrade. They are  well-founded, but you should not be worried about finding  different ways of thinking within the FSLN. Thought must be  heterogeneous in order to enrich debate, provided we are still  speaking the same language. What we should be concerned about is  silence, particularly when one is not allowed to express  oneself. I would be very happy to speak on "Radio Ya," but I do  not have access to that station. About three months ago, I  participated in a debate on the constitution on Channel 4, but I  would not say that I have access to that television or radio  time. I think we must be honest in stating that this is an  internal problem of the FSLN that we must air publicly. I prefer  not to have time on certain radio stations, but I hope they will  not mention me or my late brother at all! I prefer it that way  because I have always opposed insults, slander or lies, which I  cannot accept as a Sandinist. Your concern is well-founded  because all Sandinists should have access to all the media. It  is a great pleasure to be on Xavier Reyes's program because he  invited me and has never denied me access. It was I who delayed  coming for reasons of time.    [Question] The emergence of currents of thought with  well-defined positions has "shifted the ground" under the feet  of those traditionally accustomed to "the line," to the fact  that such matters were not debated publicly. They say they are  confused, that the party is split and is falling apart.    [Ramirez] That is a concern which must be removed from the  thinking of people who truly believe in the strength of the  party. The FSLN continues to be a very strong party and will be  strengthened even further the more we debate, the more we think.  You do not have to worry about me. If the ideas I present do not  find acceptance among the majority of the FSLN and the latter  makes a different decision, then, in a disciplined manner, I  will yield to what the party says. That is why I belong to a  party. I will continue to be a member of the FSLN. I would never  switch to another party, nor would I fit into any political or  ideological faction other than my FSLN. If the majority decides  that the methods of struggle that we must choose are precisely  those which I view as the wrong ones, then I shall continue to  criticize such positions if they are taken by the majority, but  I would not leave the party. I have complete confidence that a  revolutionary party must evolve constantly. Every tree must shed  its leaves in order to have new green ones; that is one of  life's laws.    [The same listener] I am concerned about the split in the  party and I wish you would explain why, when you continue to be  a member of the DN, Mr. Guadamuz denies you access to his  program. What is going on? I wish you would be more explicit.    [Ramirez] It is not that I am avoiding responding because  that is not appropriate for a leader, but I think the question  should be put to the person who is denying me space. He should  reveal his reasons for doing so. However, it should also be put  to those who are insulting and slandering me and the memory of  my brother Rogelio. Let them explain why they act as they do.  That radio station does not belong to the party. I asked for a  clarification from the DN, and Major Henry Ruiz, who is  treasurer, responded that the radio does not belong to the FSLN.  Consequently, I assume that it is a private radio station and  that its owners--I do not know who they are--are the proper ones  to answer for what the radio station says. Consequently, if it  takes a divisionist attitude, an attitude that does not  contribute to party unity, then that is the responsibility of  the owners, not the DN or the FSLN, because they do not own it.  That must be made quite clear.    [Carlos Guadamuz, director of "Radio Ya"] I was happy to  hear  Dr. Sergio Ramirez say he would like to be on "Radio Ya." For  several days now, I have been trying to start a debate between  the different factions and I am inviting him to come tomorrow or  the day after tomorrow during prime time. It would be an  enormous pleasure and source of pride to have Dr. Ramirez with  us on "Radio Ya."    [Ramirez] I am truly very happy to hear that tone of voice  because it is not the same (perhaps it is not the same person)  as the one that for days has been directing insults, lies, and  slander at me. As a Christian, I forgive them because the  Christian faith teaches us to forgive. I would merely ask Carlos  Guadamuz to allow me to go first to Masatepe Cemetery to consult  with my brother Rogelio, with whom I sometimes talk at his tomb  because he continues to be my faithful adviser, about whether I  should accept the invitation to speak on "Radio Ya." I will  reply when I have spoken with Rogelio.    I do not refuse to speak on any broadcasting station,  particularly those claiming to be identified with my party.  However, what I refuse to accept is that an invitation to speak  on a station that previously heaped insults on me should then  serve as a justification without first uttering a word of  apology for those lies and insults. For example, it has been  said that I betrayed Carlos Fonseca, something I cannot accept  as mere words or verbal excesses. These are very heavy charges  that wound me deeply because I have always defended my political  honesty. I cannot therefore yield to such schemes or, as we say  in Nicaragua, use such "ways out."</p>

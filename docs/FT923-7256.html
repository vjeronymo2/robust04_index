			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Observer: Holiday reading Nervous Eurocrats, crossing their fingers until France's Maastricht referendum on September 20, can relax a little. France may be on holiday, but its population does seem to be taking the matter seriously judging by the latest surprise entrant to the republic's best-seller lists. Despite weighing in at a daunting 600 pages, 35,000 copies of the paperback version of Maastricht have been sold so far. The easy reading version is selling even better. The French have already snapped up 40,000 copies of the treaty in a more palatable 40-page format. And sales are still going strong, say the publishers.</p>

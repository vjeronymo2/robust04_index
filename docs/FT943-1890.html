			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Clinton loses Congress ally in primary President Bill Clinton yesterday lost one of his few reliable allies in Congress in a stunning primary defeat for Congressman Mike Synar of Oklahoma. Although Mr Synar had won 47 per cent of the vote in a first Democratic primary ballot four weeks ago, he barely improved his score to 49 per cent in losing to a 71-year-old retired school teacher in a run-off election on Tuesday. Mr Virgil Cooper had spent just Dollars 9,053 (Pounds 5,840) on his campaign by the end of August, compared with Mr Synar's campaign spending of Dollars 227,543 so far this year. His campaign spokesman said the former head teacher 'did nothing but drive his pick-up around and put business cards in people's windows'. He will now face Mr Tom Coburn, a Republican doctor from Muskogee, in the November 8 general election. Mr Synar is the most prominent incumbent to lose a bid for re-election so far this year. His defeat sounds a warning not only for members who have been close to Mr Clinton but also for relatively left-wing members in the conservative south. Besides backing Mr Clinton on issues such as raising taxes on tobacco and raising grazing fees on government land, Mr Synar has a voting record which is, according to the Almanac of American Politics, 'by far the most liberal of any white member from the South, more liberal than most Democrats from the North'. Perhaps his most fatal political stance is his support for gun control, wildly unpopular in Oklahoma. But Mr Synar is not the only prominent incumbent to receive a setback in Tuesday's primary voting. Mr Thomas Foley, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, won only 36 per cent of the vote in his district in Washington state, a weak showing that could hint at a very tough campaign for November's general election. Under Washington state's peculiar election rules, all candidates run in the same primary, and the best-placed from each party advances to the general election. Since no other Democrat was running, Mr Foley won his party's nomination, but his score represents a sharp fall in popularity from 1992, when he won 53 per cent in the primary. Even then, Mr Foley's 55 per cent in the subsequent general election was the lowest vote recorded for a sitting House Speaker in over a century, and Republicans are licking their lips at the chance of claiming such an illustrious scalp. Congressman Bill McCollum of Florida, one of two members contending to be the Republican whip next year when Congressman Newt Gingrich becomes the party's leader in the House, spent Dollars 30,000 on television advertisements in the district in an effort to embarrass the Speaker. Republican leaders say they are expecting to win 20-30 seats from the Democrats on November 8. They would need to win 40 to take control of the 435-member House, but even a smaller gain would put them in a strong position to control the congressional agenda in alliance with right-wing nominal Democrats from the South.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Cala at Pounds 337,000 and calls for Pounds 7.9m Cala, the Edinburgh-based housebuilder and property developer, is raising Pounds 7.9m through a 1-for-5 rights issue of up to 7.16m new ordinary shares at 116p. At the same time, the company announced a continuation in the recovery seen in the second half last year with pre-tax profits of Pounds 337,000 for the six months to December 31 against losses of Pounds 2.85m. Mr Geoffrey Ball, the chairman, said the return to profitability had been helped by lower interest rates and improved trading conditions in the UK housing market. It had also been helped by action taken, including running down the joint venture housebuilding business in southern England, closing the commercial property division in England, reducing the housebuilding divisions from seven to two, reducing overheads and improving site operations. Turnover for the six months rose by 31 per cent to Pounds 27.1m (Pounds 20.6m) generating operating profits of Pounds 755,000 (Pounds 1.38m losses). Interest charges took Pounds 402,000 (Pounds 1.24m). Earnings per share emerged at 0.63p (5.39p losses) and the interim dividend is stepped up to 0.9p (0.75p). The directors are hoping to recommend a final of not less than 1.8p. Mr Ball said that since the beginning of 1994 Cala's trading experience in Scotland had been consistently good while that in England remained patchy. The proceeds of the rights issue will be used to increase Cala Homes (Scotland)'s growth and enable Cala (South) to build up its land bank over the next two years. It is fully underwritten by Kleinwort Benson Securities. The shares fell 5p to 137p.</p>

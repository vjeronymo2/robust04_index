An application also will not be accepted from a unit of general local government which has an outstanding audit finding or monetary obligation for any HUD program. Additionally, applications will not be accepted from any entity which proposes an activity in a unit of general local government that has an outstanding audit finding or monetary obligation for any HUD program. The Director of the Community Planning and Development Division of the HUD field office may provide waivers to this prohibition, but in no instance will a waiver be provided where funds are due HUD, unless a satisfactory arrangement for repayment of the debt has been made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Performance Assessment Reports. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under 24 CFR 570.507, Small Cities CDBG grantees are required to submit Performance Assessment Reports (PARs) annually on the date when the grant was originally executed. For an application for FY 1995 funds to be considered for funding, the applicant must be current in its submission of Performance Assessment Reports. Failure to submit a PAR is not a curable technical deficiency under Section V of this NOFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Four Factor Rating <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted in subsections 1 and 3 of this Section E, all applications are rated and scored against four factors. These four factors are:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Need based on absolute number of persons in poverty;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Need based on the percent of persons in poverty;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Program Impact; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Outstanding performance in fair housing and equal opportunity.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A maximum of 615 points is possible under this system with the maximum points for each factor being:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s50,xs48 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Need_absolute number of persons in poverty  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 75 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Need_percent of persons in poverty  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 75 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program Impact  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 400 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=22 g=1 f=1 --> Outstanding performance_FHEO:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=02 g=1 f=1 --> Provision of fair housing choice  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 20 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fair Housing Programs  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 20 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Minority contracting  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 15 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Equal opportunity employment  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 10 points. <!-- PJG 007 0162 intable --> n,s <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Total  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 615 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each of the four factors is outlined below. All points for each factor are rounded to the nearest whole number. Applicants should note that there is a distinct difference in the methods used to evaluate Program Impact for Single Purpose grants versus Program Impact for Comprehensive grants. These differences are more fully discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Need_Absolute number of persons in poverty. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HUD uses 1990 census data to determine the absolute number of persons in poverty residing within the applicant unit of general local government. Comprehensive and Single Purpose grant applicants are grouped and rated separately for this factor. Applicants which are county governments are rated separately from all other applicants. Applicants in each group are compared in terms of the number of persons whose incomes are below the poverty level. Individual scores are obtained by dividing each applicant's absolute number of persons in poverty by the greatest number of persons in poverty of any applicant and multiplying by 75.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

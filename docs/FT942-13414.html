			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / International Company News: Italcementi seeks to raise L550bn via issue Italcementi, Italy's biggest cement group, is to seek shareholder approval for an issue of shares and warrants which could raise nearly L550bn (Dollars 340m) for the company. The group, headed by the Italian industrialist Mr Giampiero Pesenti, owns Ciments Francais of France. It said it would use the cash to take advantage of 'some good opportunities' for acquisitions in an enfeebled European market. Separately, Italcementi is going to ask shareholders, at their meeting on June 9, for authority to raise its capital by up to L650bn nominal over the next five years, and to issue convertible and ordinary bonds up to the same amount. 'This company prefers to have the funds in-house to carry out certain operations,' said a spokesman on Friday, when the issue was announced. Italcementi will seek permission for the issue of 37.5m new ordinary shares, and 23.4m savings shares, at between L7,000 and L8,000 per share. The issue will raise between L426bn and L487bn. A further L60.9bn could be raised through the conversion of warrants attached to each new share, on the basis of one more new share, priced at L10,000, for each 10 warrants. Italmobiliare, the holding company which controls 51 per cent of Italcementi, announced a similarly complex capital increase last September to raise L260bn. This will help cover its entitlement in the Italcementi issue.</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Core business strength behind Mersey Docks' 40% advance THE MERSEY Docks and Harbour Company continued to progress in the first half of 1992, unveiling a 40 per cent pre-tax profits advance to Pounds 7.63m. Unlike last time's outcome of Pounds 5.46m which included Pounds 218,000 from the company's property developments, the current result contained no such contribution, said Mr Bill Slater, chairman. Instead, it reflected the strength of the core business, he said. Turnover grew 44 per cent to Pounds 42m (Pounds 29.2m) enhanced by the inclusion of Merlin Stevedores, the general and bulk cargo handler, and Coastal Container Line, which trades to Belfast. The cargo handled by the Port of Liverpool rose by 15 per cent, or almost 2m tonnes, to 13m tonnes. Mr Slater said that the company was happy handling both imports and exports, and both full and empty containers - all contributed to turnover. The company had increased its trade share (shippers were reducing the number of ports ships docked in, to MDH's advantage), and had secured new business, from the now closed Ellesmere Port and at the expense of ports in the south-east. Mr Slater said that MDH had sold a minority stake in Coastal Container to Cawoods of Northern Ireland, which had closed its operation in Ellesmere Port and had transferred the trade to MDH's Royal Seaforth Container Terminal. This should add to MDH's Irish Sea trade. The construction by PowerGen of the bulk coal terminal on MDH land at Gladstone Dock was proceeding. Mr Slater said that up to 6m tonnes of coal a year should land in the port en route for Fiddler's Ferry power stat-ion. Also, Liverpool Freeport has been expanded to include Birkenhead, thereby boosting bonded warehousing. Earnings per share advanced only 16 per cent to 8.12p (6.99p) after a full tax charge. The interim dividend is lifted 25 per cent to 2.5p. The government still holds a 20 per cent stake in MDH.</p>

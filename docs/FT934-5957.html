			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (10): Villagers recognise the benefits but still want fewer tourists One of the prettiest villages in the Cotswolds is Bourton-on-the-Water, and therefore it is one of the most popular. For that reason, Cotswold district council has carried out a year-long investigation to assess the impact of tourism and to devise a visitor management plan. The plan's aim will be 'to maximise the economic benefits of tourism to Bourton and its environs, while minimising any adverse environmental impact.' Nearly 2,200 visitor were interviewed and a questionaire was sent to all 1,000 households, and returned by half of these. Among the residents, the study says, 'there was a general acceptance that tourism had brought benefits to Bourton, but that the village was not flourising, merely surviving. 'This may be a reflection of local views in the light of the current recession. However, when asked how they would like to see tourism change over the next 10 years, by far the most common answer was 'less tourists'. In a way, there is a contradiction in these two views.' The study comments that the desire among locals to see fewer tourists 'is a surprising statement when compared to the employment provided to local people in Bourton. . . The economic importance of tourism to Bourton families is undoubted and, perhaps, should be better appreciated by local residents.' The survey found that fewer than one in 10 visitors stayed overnight in Bourton, 40 per cent returned home at the end of the day, and the remaining 50 per cent were touring and staying elsewhere, typically in Bath or Stratford-upon-Avon. The visitors' most popular suggestion for improvements to Bourton was traffic controls. 'From the visitors' point of view,' the study says, 'Bourton offers all the features we would wish to be seen as indicative of the Cotswolds, rather than a village that has lost some of its character through commercialisation of tourism - yet the more crowded it becomes, the less able they are to appreciate it.'</p>

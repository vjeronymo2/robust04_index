			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Toys R Us to buy back Dollars 1bn of shares and open 115 new stores Toys R Us, the biggest US toy retailer, yesterday announced it would open 45 new toy stores in the US and 70 stores overseas this year in what it described as its biggest expansion programme yet. It has also signed franchise agreements to move into Saudi Arabia and the Gulf emirates, and is to buy back up to Dollars 1bn worth of its shares over the next several years. The shares, however, rose by a modest Dollars  1/2 to 38 7/8 yesterday morning. Analysts said the store-opening programme was in line with expectations and the share buy-back plan would have a relatively small impact on earnings per share. Toys R Us has 581 stores in the US and 234 overseas, so the number of overseas stores will increase proportionally much more this year than the number of domestic stores. Mr Charles Lazarus, chairman, said he saw 'a tremendous opportunity' for Toys R Us to build world market share over the next few years, and the company planned to exploit the opportunity. Part of the plan consists of signing franchise agreements which will bring the Toys R Us name to markets that would not otherwise have been entered for many years. Two agreements have been signed: one with an unnamed Saudi Arabian company for toy stores in Saudi Arabia, and another with Al Futtain Sons, a company based in the United Arab Emirates, for the operation of stores in the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and Kuwait. Mr Lazarus said that in spite of the expansion plans - which one analyst estimated would result in total capital spending of about Dollars 650m this year - the company was generating substantial excess cash flow. The share repurchase plan had therefore been adopted to increase shareholder value.</p>

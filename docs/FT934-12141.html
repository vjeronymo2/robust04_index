			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Court backs warehouse club THE proposed warehouse club to be built in Essex by Costco is a genuine wholesale operation and not a 'sham' designed to circumvent planning restrictions on retail outlets, a High Court judge ruled yesterday. Giving his judgment, Mr Justice Schiemann upheld the planning permission given by Thurrock Borough Council for Costco to build the 12,881 sq m discount store near Grays town centre. He rejected the legal challenge brought by three supermarket companies, J. Sainsbury, Safeway and Tesco, all of which had argued that planning permission for the store should be overturned because the proposed club would be a retail outlet rather than a wholesale one as claimed by Costco. The judge ruled that the council was correct in deciding that restrictions on Costco's operations meant that the warehouse club would be a wholesale operation aimed at local businesses, rather than a general retail outlet aimed at the general public. Costco would only allow bulk-purchases - such as a minimum of 20lbs of potatoes - and offer only a limited range of goods in any product range. This amounted to a deliberate attempt to exclude ordinary members of the public wanting to buy a few small items, he said. The criteria for joining the club - restricting shoppers to either business users or those from specified employment groups - also supported its intention to operate as a wholesaler, he said. Concerns that Costco might develop the store into a retail outlet on the 'thin end of the wedge' principle had been addressed by an agreement between the company and Thurrock planners, who restricted sales to the general public. The judge rejected claims by the supermarkets that this agreement was too vague to be enforceable. The scheme could be taken at face value rather than as a sham designed to circumvent planning rules, he said. Mr Justice Schiemann also rejected the supermarkets' argument that the council should have considered a letter from the Department of the Environment, which recommended that warehouse clubs should be treated as retailers rather than wholesalers. The supermarkets were refused leave to appeal and ordered to pay the costs of both Costco and the council.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Redefining the boundaries of expansion - With dominance in chemicals cemented, the group is diversifying When the Indian prime minister Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao launched pro-market economic reforms three years ago, Reliance Industries, the country's largest company, was busy draining a 700-acre marsh on the coast north of Bombay. Today, workmen are building a Rs50bn (Dollars 1.59bn) petrochemicals complex on the site - India's largest single industrial investment and Indian industry's biggest act of faith in Mr Rao's policies. Reliance, which this week reported record interim sales and profits for the six months to the end of September, has overtaken long-established groups such as Tata Iron and Steel, the leading privately-owned steelmaker, as India's biggest company. Once its current expansion is complete, in about three years, it will rank among the world's largest chemicals groups. With its output of petrochemical products from Hazira and an older complex at Patalganga, nearer Bombay, set to rise from 1.4m tonnes this year to 6m, Reliance estimates it will become one of the top 10 makers of polyester, a basic fibre for the artificial textiles industry. It also expects to be the second largest manufacturer of paraxylene, an intermediate chemical in making fibres, and the biggest producer of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a plastic. Reliance is already planning its next stage of development - a Rs30bn (Dollars 956.3m)investment in a third petrochemicals complex at Jamnagar, inland from Hazira, where Reliance Petroleum, a 21 per cent-owned affiliate company, is building a Rs76bn oil refinery. The group is also diversifying from its core business in textiles and chemicals into oil and gas production, power, telecommunications and financial services. The programme is particularly ambitious, given general caution about investing in India. Reliance, however, is confident. 'We have faith in India's future,' says Mr Anil Ambani, managing director. Reliance has already moved some way towards its target of raising turnover from Rs53.4bn last year to Rs120bn in three or four years. In the first six months of the current financial year, sales rose 33 per cent to Rs33.9bn, pushing net profits up 146 per cent to Rs5.1bn. Reliance was founded in 1977 by Mr Dhirubhai Ambani, the chairman, who runs the company with his sons Mr Anil Ambani and Mr Mukesh Ambani, also a managing director. Mr Ambani senior, 62, started his working life as a petrol pump attendant before setting up a business trading textiles. From his early days, Mr Ambani relied on raising funds from outside investors, tapping the stock market with repeated share offers and building a group of 2.4m shareholders. In 1992, Reliance became the first Indian company to tap the euromarkets, and has since made two further issues. The group also holds the record for the largest domestic offering - a Rs21.7bn convertible bond issue for Reliance Petroleum, the associate company which is building the Jamnagar refinery. The raising and management of capital has become one of Reliance's greatest strengths, earning it a reputation for paying as much attention to financial operations as to its basic business. Along the way, it has occasionally embroiled itself in controversy. Reliance was named in last year's parliamentary report into the Rs40bn Bombay securities market scandal. The company was accused of circumventing rules governing the amount of credit a borrower can raise from banks by discounting bills through non-bank finance companies to raise additional money. Reliance denied breaking any rules. Rivals also alleged the company benefited from Mr Dhirubhai Ambani's friendship with politicians, including the late Mr Rajiv Gandhi, saying the relationship was exploited to help securegovernment investment licences essential for business expansion in the controlled economy in the years before 1991. Mr Anil Ambani says Reliance operated in the same environment as other groups. 'People can say what they like. I don't think we gained any particular advantage.' He says Reliance's growth after 1991, when liberalisation began and the need for licences diminished, has been even faster than before. The Ambanis, who have retained a stake of about 30 per cent in Reliance Industries, have relied for technology mainly on multinationals such as ICI of the UK and Du Pont of the US. But maturity has bought its own expertise, particularly in project management. It is also planning to build a research and development centre near Bombay in partnership with an international group. Mr Anil Ambani believes it is important for Reliance to have up-to-date technology to keep costs down and quality high. If India's import barriers come down as expected, Reliance believes it will remain competitive with international groups. Its success has been based on sticking to one industry, starting with textiles trading and integrating backwards into petrochemicals production. This single-mindedness has distinguished Reliance from most other large Indian groups, which have spread themselves over several industries. As a result, Reliance enjoys better economies of scale than most of its domestic rivals. Nevertheless, Mr Ambani says it is time for the company to look outside its core business, because it already dominates production in that area, and there are limits to growth. Reliance is the first private-sector Indian company to secure licences for the development of oil and gas fields; it is bidding to build and operate two power stations at a cost of Rs30bn, as well as developing captive power stations at its plants; and it is considering a Rs200bn investment in telecommunications. The group is not worried by the thought venturing into telecommunications and power, as these are new fields for all entrepreneurs, having only recently been opened to private investment. As Mr Dhirubhai Ambani told shareholders at the annual meeting this year: 'Economic liberalisation has given your company unprecedented freedom to set new and even more ambitious goals and targets.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- The office of Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said Friday [22 April] Hosokawa has  failed to report investment profits of 29 million yen but denied  there was any illegality.    Hosokawa made a surprise announcement of his intention to  resign April 8 to take "moral and political responsibility" for  a fresh financial scandal and the current stalemate in the Diet.    "A new problem has come to light. New suspicions emerged  that my political office entrusted a certain person with  managing my personal financial means, raking in profits for a  few years since 1981," the premier said.    "The suspicion is that his management may have involved some  illegalities, although the person, who is my old friend, asked  for permission to manage my personal money, saying it would  definitely be invested in a profitable manner," he said.    On April 13, a former publisher of an economic magazine, to  whom Hosokawa entrusted the funds, told reporters that Hosokawa  lied about the investments in his resignation announcement.    Yusei Kuwahata, 60, said at a news conference, "Hosokawa's  office made me out to be like a criminal, using me as a tool to  make Prime Minister Hosokawa look clean."    From around 1981 to 1985, Kuwahata invested Hosokawa's funds  and made profits for Hosokawa of 20 to 30 million yen, according  to Kuwahata.    Kuwahata denied any illegality in his use of the funds in  spite of Hosokawa citing "new suspicions" over the legality of  his financial deals as one of the reasons for his resignation.    He said he did not invest the funds on the black market.</p>

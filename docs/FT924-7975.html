			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Comment: Last throw of the dice for the government - If the Tories' fortunes have turned, it may not be for long It will only work if it works. The autumn mini-budget announced by Mr Norman Lamont yesterday brought instant cheer to the Conservative benches, but if there is no quick response in the real economy the effect will soon wear off. Much depends upon whether the chancellor's interventionist package of direct measures really does lead to new orders in the construction industry, restart the housing market, and sell a few more motor cars. Yesterday's news sounded promising. So it should. It is born of the government's desperation. No promise, no government. This explains the abandonment of some of the ideology of the 1980s. After a decade of being told that attempts to fine tune demand had been consigned to the dustbin of economics, along with schemes for kick-starting growth, Conservatives are now being asked to believe in some of the familiar nostrums of stop-go once more. What was anathema during the Reagan-Thatcher years is being attempted under duress by Mr John Major's government. It is a remarkable turnround. Before the president-elect of the United States has had time even to rearrange the Oval Room furniture Mr Lamont has introduced Clintonomics to Britain. Thus money will be spent on roads, railways, the Jubilee Line and new public housing (reversing Mrs Thatcher's drive for privatisation of home ownership). Car tax is abandoned to help automobile sales. Capital receipts are to be released. There is one important difference from the 1960s. Real growth in spending in 1993-94, the only year of which we can be sure, is held to a mere 4 per cent. The cash limit set in November 1991, with an election in the offing, is maintained. Some of the extra spending is to be funded by cuts, particularly in defence; by a welcome near-freeze on public sector incomes; and by ingeniously accounting for expected fresh injections of private capital as if it were not being used for public purposes. The items on the list sound very like the gimmicks, different in detail but similar in spirit, peddled to American voters by the Democratic candidate during the recent election. Throw in the one-point interest rate cut and you quickly detect an echo of Labour's plans for engineering a recovery. Most Conservative MPs are unlikely to quibble about this. Their constituents have for some time been asking about what concerns them most: jobs. The recession has created a widespread and understandable fear of unemployment, among all classes and in all businesses. It is the single most important reason why the government is so unpopular. The slump in the housing market has frightened many voters who have been caught with mortgage debts greater than the value of their properties. Will a loss of job mean a loss of house? At first sight yesterday's package appears to address these fears. That in itself should win the government a plaudit or two. It needs every manifestation of support it can get. Mr Lamont's package constitutes a last throw of the dice by a chancellor whose job has been in jeopardy since Black Wednesday and a prime minister who has since the same date lost much of his authority. The parliamentary occasion was therefore carefully prepared, partly by the Treasury's familiar device of intimating in advance that there would be greater horrors (such as an increase in national insurance payments) than there actually were on the day, and partly by what is quaintly called a 'charm offensive'. This series of meetings at which Treasury ministers pre-sold the autumn statement to backbenchers was a no doubt necessary exercise. We shall have to wait to see if the net effect is to do more than get the government through the night. It is perhaps too much to expect that what was said yesterday will put a stop to the run of political accidents that has hit the prime minister since September 16. The latest is still running. Mr Major came to question time prepared for an assault on his and certain of his colleagues' integrity over the sale of machine tools to Iraq in spite of an arms embargo. The extent of his homework, visible in the civil-service folder he held before him, is a measure of the danger he perceives. In the event questions put by the Labour leader, Mr John Smith, were parried, but the game is not over. The more level-headed of Mr Major's ministers know that there is no quick way of restoring his administration's reputation, let alone its authority. They merely hope that the chancellor's economic statement will constitute a first step in what will be a long campaign. The idea is that the government will at last be seen to be doing something about the economy. It will insist, with a little more justification than it could before Mr Lamont sat down, that it has an economic strategy, that there is no longer a vacuum in Downing Street. We will soon know if this scheme is working. If it is, people will say that at last the cabinet is getting a grip; that it is no longer the plaything of events. The chances are that it will go wrong, but this is not certain. The limit on public sector pay increases may produce marching nurses on the evening TV news. That would hurt the Tories. But not all public sector workers can so easily win sympathy. Some of the worst-paid - auxiliary workers, local authority employees and others - belong to unions whose track record is to use methods that quickly turn opinion against them. A squeeze on public employees' pay is always going to be unpopular on the left of politics. The reaction of the conservative, middle-class heartland of England is not so predictable. The upsurge of sympathy for miners threatened with dismissal when the pit closures were announced may have been due to poor timing. The national mood was nearing a nadir. Contempt for the government was rising. This may change. Cuts as part of a recovery package are quite different from cuts when there is no hope. There is, in short, a slim prospect that the mini-budget will bring about a turn in the government's political fortunes. It may not, however, be much of a turn, nor will it necessarily last. Mr Lamont's latest forecasts are cautious, which is hardly surprising. If he is right for once, there will be only the slightest relief from economic gloom during 1993, with the prospect of further cuts, or tax increases, thereafter. As his Labour shadow, Mr Gordon Brown, says, unemployment and bankruptcies will continue to rise. In those all too easily imaginable circumstances, yesterday's Autumn Statement could come to be seen as this government's political epitaph.</p>

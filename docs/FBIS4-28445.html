			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- Foreign state and party  leaders supported the struggle of the Korean people for national  reunification and solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula.    Mozambican President Joaquim Alberto Chissano, when he met  the Korean ambassador to his country on May 27, said the nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula should be resolved through  peaceful talks, not by means of pressure and war.    Hoping that Korea would be reunified at an early date  according to the confederacy formula put forward by the great  President Kim Il-song, he wished the Korean people greater  success in their efforts for the reunification of the country.    Emile Kibala Bey a Nsien, national chairman of the Workers'  Party of Zaire, when he met the Korean ambassador to Zaire on  May 24, expressed positive support to the realistic and  principled stand and proposals of the DPRK for a fair solution  to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula and for its  peaceful reunification.    Tridib Chouduri, general secretary of the Revolutionary  Socialist Party of India, in a statement on May 25 strongly  demanded that the United States stop its hostile policy and  pressure campaign against Korea and honestly fulfill its  obligation to guarantee a durable peace and security in the  Korean peninsula through the DPRK-USA talks.</p>

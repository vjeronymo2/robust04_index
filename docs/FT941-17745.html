			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Board of Independent divided over options for new funding The company which owns Britain's Independent and Independent on Sunday newspapers yesterday admitted publicly for the first time that its board is split over future funding. Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Newspaper Publishing, said in a letter to staff that there were two competing options for bringing in new equity capital. The company lost Pounds 486,000 before tax in the year to September, and both of its titles have lost significant circulation in the past six months. Before Christmas, the Independent - which began publication in 1986 - was struggling with a daily circulation of just over 300,000 and may have sunk further since. Shareholders together accounting for about 45 per cent of the unquoted company's stock plan to propose an additional trade partner. Those shareholders are the Spanish newspaper El Pais and Italy's La Repubblica, backed by three directors, Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, Mr Matthew Symonds and Mr Adrian O'Neill, and all the signs are that their preferred candidate for a new partner is Mr Conrad Black, who controls the Telegraph Group, publisher of The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph. Such a deal, involving a stake of between 20-30 per cent, could lead to merging of non-editorial functions. The Telegraph would print The Independent and Independent on Sunday in London and the Newspaper Publishing staff might join the Telegraph in its Canary Wharf offices. Mr Hay Davison, supported by other independent directors, believe they have a legal obligation to explore all alternative sources of funding. 'We are now doing this with a view to proposing arrangements that will produce the best solution for all our shareholders, our readers and staff,' Mr Hay Davison wrote. One of his concerns is believed to be the future of non-editorial staff. There are 130 staff shareholders holding in aggregate about 7 per cent of the company, a similar proportion to that held by the main founder, Mr Whittam Smith. Most are not journalists and many could lose their jobs as a result of a deal with another British newspaper. Mr Hay Davison's letter followed an attack by the National Union of Journalists chapel (branch) on what it said was the 'Dutch auction' of titles and lack of consultation.</p>

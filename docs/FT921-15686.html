			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: Debt downgrade underlines Chrysler finance struggle THE SEVERE financial difficulties facing Chrysler, the smallest of the big three US motor groups, was underscored yesterday when Standard and Poor's, the credit rating agency, lowered the company's debt rating. S&amp;P said the reasons included the weakness of the US car market and the fact that Chrysler had not taken action to improve access to the capital markets for its important and profitable finance arm, Chrysler Financial. The leading credit rating agencies reduced Chrysler's debt from investment grade to 'junk bond' status about a year ago, which made it far more difficult for the company to raise debt capital on reasonable terms. Yesterday's move by S&amp;P will reinforce that position. The agency said it had cut the ratings of both Chrysler and Chrysler Financial to single-B-plus from double-B-minus. Chrysler said it was disappointed at the move, which was 'not warranted by the current financial outlook'. Chrysler, in common with Detroit rivals General Motors and Ford, is suffering heavy losses because the US recession has cut demand for cars at a time when the US industry faces intense competition from Japanese rivals. S&amp;P said that Chrysler's cash reserves, saleable assets and access to bank credit should give it adequate financial flexibility at least for 1992. However, it added that 'negative cash flow this year due to persisting weak auto markets would leave Chrysler ill-prepared to meet the challenges it will face thereafter in the intensely competitive North American automobile industry.' Chrysler Financial, which plays a central role in supporting the sale of the company's vehicles and has large non-auto interests, has been shut out of the traditional credit markets because of the problems of its parent. For much of the past year Chrysler has been considering ways of raising the unit's ratings by distancing it from Chrysler.</p>

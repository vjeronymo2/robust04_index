			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / IBM aims to unify software development in 'Workplace' International Business Machines is realigning its worldwide software development operations following a management review ordered by Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman and chief executive. IBM, which spends about Dollars 1bn a year developing software in several product divisions, plans to co-ordinate these efforts behind a set of technologies called 'Workplace'. The shift is part of Mr Gerstner's plans to unify IBM's product development work, eliminating contention between divisions. Workplace technologies are designed to create a common core for IBM's computer operating systems. Similarly, the company has fixed on a common hardware technology, the PowerPC microprocessor, for a broad range of products ranging from hand-held units computers to powerful multi-processor units. The software strategy shift will achieve several goals, according to a memo sent to senior IBM managers by Mr John Thompson, senior vice president, who headed a taskforce formed by Mr Gerstner to evaluate Workplaces technologies. The aims include shortening software development cycles and cutting costs. Mr Thompson said the new technologies would enable IBM software products to work together better in distributed computing systems. This addresses one of the 'strategic imperatives' established by Mr Gerstner to increase IBM's share of the fast-growing market for computers linked to networks. During the overhaul, Mr Thompson stressed that the company aimed to enhance, rather than replace, its existing software. 'Our customers' investments (in software) will be protected,' he said.

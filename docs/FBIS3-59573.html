This technology,  which carries the reference ECLP07, is designed for circuits  operating at 3.3 volt and presenting an integration density of  1,300 gates per square millimeter for logical functions (7,000  gates per square millimeter for memory functions). The  technology also features a frequency of 150 MHz (identical to  that of current 0.7-micron 5-V CMOS technology) for a  consumption cut by a factor of 2.3 (1.5 microwatt per gate and  per megaHertz).</p>

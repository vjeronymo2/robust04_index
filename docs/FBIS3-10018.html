Cardoso, noting that the creation  of the Real Value Unit (URV) will not lead to a price freeze,  warned that "if prices begin to abusively stray from their  historic path, we might decide we need to control them."    Minister Cardoso said the provisional measure that will  create the URV will not merely be designed to convert salaries.  "We are going to make several decisions by respecting contracts  as much as possible; therefore, no private contracts will be  broken," he asserted. The minister said the economic team's  idea is to create some rules to convert some of the workers'  expenditures, such as rent and school fees, because salaries  will be converted compulsorily into the new unit.    The minister said the longer private prices take to be  converted into the URV, the better it will be for salary  earners. "Salaries will be modified automatically according to  the inflation rate."    Action will be taken within 90 days against those  enterprises  that mark up prices abusively and will be forced to mark down  prices to those on a date determined by the government.

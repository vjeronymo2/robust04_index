			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Tax on felling forests urged The European Union should introduce a tax on timber to reflect the environmental cost of cutting down forests, according to Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, environment commissioner. 'Timber is a resource we could price more correctly,' he said. 'If we carry on as we are, forests will be decimated.' A timber tax would be graded according to the origin of the timber, he said in London last week. Timber from old, native forests would be taxed more heavily than that from replanted forests. The tax would apply both to imports and to wood from Europe. He denied it would conflict with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. His comments drew a sharp response from Brazilian timber exporters. Mr Claes Hall, European spokesman for Brazil's Cellulose Exporters' Association (Abecel), said: 'We grow timber in plantations like a crop - any tax should recognise the difference between this and wood from native forests, and plantation timber or products made from it should not be taxed.' Finland's ministry of external economic relations said such a tax could affect timber exports, though Finland believed that it managed its forest better than many other countries. Finland, one of the largest timber exporters in Europe, is negotiating EU membership. However, Mr Paleokrassas's plan is an at an embryonic stage. He has yet to decide a timetable for turning the tree tax idea into a formal proposal. Even if he were to table the plan it would have to navigate obstacles which have stalled other proposed European 'eco-taxes', notably a tax on energy and its carbon content. Member countries have complained that such taxes are a handicap to industrial competitiveness. The Commission, which has been criticised by member countries for failing to enforce its extensive environmental regulations and directives, has said recently that it prefers to use 'financial instruments' such as taxes to pursue environmental aims.</p>

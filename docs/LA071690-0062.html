			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> STUDY WILL PINPOINT ACCIDENT AREAS  </P> <P> City officials will pay $24,000 for a computer study that will track traffic  accidents in the city and pinpoint problem areas.  </P> <P> Police and public works officials say the program will help them develop  strategy to reduce the 1,200 accidents reported in Mission Viejo last year.  </P> <P> In addition to accumulating statistics, the program "tells you how the  accidents are happening," said Lt. George Johnson of the Sheriff's Department.  "For instance, it tells you things like whether the sun is interfering with  seeing the signal and shows whether the (light) cycle is too long or short."  </P> <P> Along with approving the funds, the city also picked Kimley-Horn and Associates  Inc. as consultant for the project, known as the Accident Identification and  Surveillance Program. The firm has indicated that the program will be on-line  in approximately two months.  </P> <P> The program will also recommend ways that the city Public Works Department can  improve sites with high accident rates. The consultant will also develop a  priority list for needed street improvements.  </P> <P> "I'm very excited by this program," said Johnson, who is in charge of the  sheriff's deputies assigned to Mission Viejo. "I think it's going to be very  helpful. The information we get will identify those areas where I need to  concentrate enforcement."  </P> <P> Councilman Norman P. Murray said the project is part of an effort by Mission  Viejo to update its computer system. Last month, the City Council approved a  $200,000 for new personal computers, computer programs and a central data  storage unit.  </P> <P> "This is not an expensive program, and if it saves one life or prevents two or  three injuries this year, it's worth it," Murray said. "It's another tool for  us to use, and I think this program can be very effective." FRANK MESSINA  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As requested by the Estonian delegation, the Russian  delegation will hand over a detailed plan for the Russian troop  withdrawal from Estonia, from January to August 1994, during the  talks round on 1 and 2 [dates as heard] February. This was said  by Vasiliy Svirin, leader of the Russian talks delegation.    According to Svirin, the plan details when one or another  unit will depart and how many men are in it. Another incident  of Russia voluntarily accommodating Estonia's requests will  hopefully urge the Estonian delegation toward constructive  steps, Svirin said.    As already reported, the Russian side presented a general  troop withdrawal schedule to Estonia during the previous round  of talks at the end of last year, at Lohusalu in Estonia. In  Svirin's opinion Estonia recently tried to conclude a short  protocol which covers only a deadline and a schedule for the  troop withdrawal instead of a basic agreement on the troop  withdrawal and their temporary presence. Svirin emphasized that  such an attitude is not acceptable because several issues  concerning the Russian troops' presence, withdrawal, and  property would thus remain unresolved.    Russia looks kindly, and with readiness to cooperate, on  Vaino Reinart's appointment as the new leader of the Estonian  delegation, Svirin said. As is known, Reinart claimed on 20  January at the Council of Europe meeting in Strasbourg that  Russia [words indistinct] and is not particularly worried about  human rights protection. Svirin emphasized that such claims are  the fantasies of Estonian politicians' .    This was reported by the BALTIC NEWS SERVICE.</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL CAMINO'S NEW COACH SEES TEAM AS COMPETITIVE  </P> <P> After compiling a 153-97 record in six years as El Camino's head baseball  coach, Tom Hicks is taking a season off for personal reasons. Glen LeVier, a  former assistant at Long Beach City College, has taken over the coaching job  from Hicks, who is still teaching full time.  </P> <P> LeVier, 32, was an assistant coach for two years at Cal State Los Angeles  before going to Long Beach in 1988. Before that he was head coach at St.  Anthony High (1984 to 1987), where he compiled a 61-27 record and led all his  teams to the playoffs.  </P> <P> Post-season action will be tougher to get at El Camino, however. The Warriors,  though rich with sophomores, are inconsistent in all areas. Only two starters  return from last year's team, which placed third in the five-member South Coast  Conference with an 8-12 mark (27-18 overall).  </P> <P> "The sophomores give us good experience," LeVier said, "but we need to play  catch-up on defense. We're making a lot of unnecessary errors."  </P> <P> Pitching is the team's biggest strength, LeVier said, although four players are  hitting in the mid-to-high .300s.  </P> <P> Three sophomores anchor the starting rotation. The Warriors' top man on the  mound is Jon Newville (Bishop Montgomery). The other two, Jason Butcher (South  Torrance) and Greg Davis (North Torrance), were key relievers last year, and  LeVier is looking for someone to take their places in the bullpen.  </P> <P> El Camino's infield includes the two returning starters: catcher Frank Pena and  shortstop Denny Hocking. Power hitter Cesar Rivas (.350) starts at third.  </P> <P> Freshman Brian Wixom (North Torrance) and sophomore Mark Holcomb are still  competing for the starting spot at first base. "They've both done good things  offensively," LeVier said. "Now we're just looking for one of them to be  consistent."  </P> <P> Sophomore Steve Allyn, a powerful left-handed line-drive hitter, starts at  right field and sophomore John Otte in center field. Left field is a toss-up  between freshman Howie Kingsmill (Torrance High) and sophomore Gil McDonough.  </P> <P> "I expect (defending state champion) Cerritos to win the league," LeVier said,  "but I expect to be in the playoffs. We're capable of competing with any team  in this conference."  </P> <P> The Warriors opened league play against Long Beach on March 1. So far, they are  0-2 in the SCC and 7-7 overall.  </P></p>

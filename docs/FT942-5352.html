			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Books: A writer and a fighter THE HISTORY OF THE GINGER MAN By J P Donleavy Viking, Pounds 17, 517 pages There are two stories here. The first is of the life, loves and friendships of J P Donleavy, an Irish American in his 20s, who left the US Navy at the end of the second world war and used his entitlement of a free education under the GI Bill to enrol as a law student at Trinity College, Dublin. The energy released by his new freedom went on a variety of activities in the Irish capital, of which heavy drinking, fights in bars and the pursuit of innumerable women were a high - and the academic study of law a low - priority. The second, and the more absorbing story is of how his first book The Ginger Man came to be published by the Olympia Press in Paris in 1955 and of his subsequent bitter legal battle to extricate it from their 'Travellers' Library' (a list of pornography) and get it brought out in England by a reputable publisher where it could be taken seriously. Its rampageous foul-mouthed hero Sebastian Dangerfield and its brutal candour about sex, pioneered a new approach in fiction. It was both hilarious farce and wonderfully evocative of location. Donleavy had been a painter before becoming a writer. Story one describes Don- leavy's life as a recently married man whose wife showed saintly forebearance at his violent antics and frequent absences. His gregarious love of male company derives from a childhood in the Bronx, where his Irish immigrant background set him apart from the other children at his school. His aggressive nature was apparent even then. One of his victim's mothers intervened during a scrap with another boy pinioning him so that her son could punch Donleavy with impunity. He was rescued by his own mother who told the other woman: 'You are going to have to do that for the rest of (your son's) life'. In Donleavy's adult life rescue from imminent danger is a recurring theme. It might take the form of a timely loan from from a friend; or the fortuitous presence of a bruiser-pal who would keep angry pursuers at bay while Donleavy made his escape through a side-exit of the pub. More often it is Donleavy, pugilist as well as literary artist, who has to perform a rescue for one of his cronies. He re-creates the drunken chivalries and verbal jousting of a male set whose fame, unlike his, has not survived post-war Dublin. Apart of course from Brendan Behan, a firm friend who recognised Donleavy's powers early on, and whose skill as a mimic, persistence as a lecher and outrageous behaviour as a guest, are all hilariously noted. But the exploits of such as Gallagher, McKernan, Craig, and even one Gainor Stephen Crist who was the model for the Ginger Man are rather less entertaining to read about here than were those of the fictional counterparts they inspired. The novel still reads well thanks to its lively prose. Donleavy learned a lot from the thought processes of Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom. But now, approaching 70, the ginger in Donleavy's writing has given way to a blander flavour; a maturity that has unfortunately been accompanied by the onset of prolixity. Eventually we move from Ireland to other places where Donleavy has lived - the Isle of Man, Boston, London, Paris, where, from time to time, the former fine descriptive touch returns. It is to Paris that he goes to confront Girodias, publisher of Olympia Press. Letters exchanged between author and publisher, gastronomic lunches followed by fraught meetings in the office, then the shock of the early copies of the book with the company's porn-titles emblazoned on the fly-leaf, are the opening rounds in a costly legal battle that culminated in an auction many years later at which the Olympia Press came wholly into Donleavy's possession. He was now a rich man thanks to the success of the rescued Ginger Man and of later books. Page 400 onwards should be read by anyone who is about to sign an agreement to publish a first novel. That Donleavy won his battle to rescue his book says much for his courage; it also shows that his training in law was not wasted time.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (IV)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The institution must clearly designate all optional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charges as ``optional'' in all published schedules and related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Charges that are mandatory and charges that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> optional must be plainly differentiated in all printed materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statements accompanying the schedule may include institutional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endorsements of the optional program or service. The institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must state clearly in its schedule if a charge is optional for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some students but required for others.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (V)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The institution must clearly identify charges and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposits that are nonrefundable as ``nonrefundable'' on all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published schedules.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Institutions determine on an individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis which of their charges are refundable or nonrefundable. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general, admission fees, application fees, laboratory fees,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility and student activity fees, and other similar charges are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not refundable. These fees are generally charged to cover the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of activities such as processing applications and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student information, reserving academic positions and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing the limits of institutional programs and services,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reserving housing space, and otherwise setting the fixed costs of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution for the coming academic periods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institutions determine on an individual basis which of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposits are refundable or nonrefundable. Some deposits will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonrefundable or will be credited to a student's account (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tuition deposits). Others are refundable according to the terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the deposit agreement (e.g., deposits for breakage).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (VI)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The institution must refund housing rental charges,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less a deposit, as long as written notification of cancellation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is made prior to a well-publicized date that provides reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to make the space available to other students. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written notification on or before the beginning of the term of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the contract is necessary to ensure utilization of housing units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the term of the contract, room charges are generally not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refundable. However, based on the program offered, space  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> availability, debt service requirements, State and local laws,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and other individual circumstances, institutions may provide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some more flexible refund guideline for housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (VII)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The institution must refund board charges in full,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less a deposit, if written notification of cancellation is made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to a well-publicized date that falls on or before the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning of the term of the contract.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Subsequent board charges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be refunded on a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> basis. It is reasonable to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a refund for those goods and services not consumed. The deposit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should reflect that portion of an institution's costs that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fixed for the term of the contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (VIII)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The institutional refund policy must include the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following requirements:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. The institution must refund 100 percent of the tuition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charges, less an administrative fee that does not exceed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lesser of $100 or 5 percent of the tuition, if the student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submits written notice of cancellation on or before one week  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preceding the first day of classes for the period of enrollment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for which the student was charged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. The institution must refund at least 90 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tuition charges if the student submits written notice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancellation between the end of the period of time specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (VIII) A. and the end of the first 10 percent (in time) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of enrollment for which the student was charged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. The institution must refund at least 50 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tuition charges if the student submits written notice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancellation between the end of the first 10 percent (in time) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the period of enrollment for which the student was charged and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the end of the first 25 percent (in time) of that period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrollment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. The institution must refund at least 25 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tuition charges if the student submits written notice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancellation between the end of the first 25 percent (in time) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the period of enrollment for which the student was charged and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the end of the first 50 percent (in time) of the period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrollment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. The institution may deduct from the refund owed under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this paragraph the documented cost to the institution of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment issued to the student if the institution specifies in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the enrollment agreement a separate charge for equipment that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student actually obtains or if the institution refers the student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a vendor operated by an affiliated or related entity and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student does not return the equipment in good condition, allowing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for reasonable wear and tear, within 20 days following the date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the student's withdrawal. The student shall be liable for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount, if any, by which the documented cost for equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeds the refund under this paragraph. Equipment is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered to be returned in good condition if the equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot be reused because of clearly recognized health and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanitary reasons, and this fact is clearly and conspicuously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclosed in the enrollment agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (IX)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The institution must assess no penalty charges where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution, as opposed to the student, is in error.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Penalty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charges, such as those involving late registration fees,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change-of-schedule fees, and late payment fees, must not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessed if it is determined that the student is not responsible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the action causing the charges to be levied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> One of a group of undocumented workers who allegedly were kidnaped and robbed  last year by two San Diego police officers was sentenced Friday to three years  in prison on two counts of auto burglary and one count of possession of  hashish.  </P> <P> Craig Rooten, the deputy district attorney prosecuting the two officers, said  he does not think the sentence imposed against Rolando Carrera Reyes will hurt  his case against the policemen when it goes to trial April 16.  </P> <P> The prosecutor said Carrera Reyes was awaiting sentencing in August when he  allegedly was kidnaped and robbed by Officers Lloyd J. Hoff and Richard P.  Schaaf. "We knew he had these convictions all along," Rooten said.  </P> <P> Hoff and Schaaf are charged with felony counts of kidnaping three Latino men in  the downtown area, including Carrera Reyes, and then driving them to isolated  areas. Two of the Latinos, including Carrera Reyes, were then robbed and  abandoned by the officers, according to prosecutors.  </P> <P> With the trial set to begin in nine days, and concerns that the Latinos might  flee the country before then, Rooten said the sentence for Carrera Reyes  ensures his appearance at the trial.  </P> <P> "At least now we'll know where he is," Rooten said.  </P></p>

In April of the following year, under  the provision of the Technopolis Law, it was designated as  Technopolis No. 1.    Located at the foot of the majestic Mount Gairin, the  "techno  research park," adjacent to Kumamoto International Airport, is  where the Technopolis Center, Electromechanical Engineering  Research Laboratory and Kumamoto University's Joint Regional  Research Center, together with 12 companies, including  leading-edge research laboratories and software developers, are  pursuing R&amp;D activities.    The principal undertakings and characteristics of this  foundation are as follows:    The Electromechanical Engineering Research Laboratory was  established in April 1985 as a research organ of this  third-sector foundation. The laboratory, staffed by 12  researchers specializing in the fields of automation, computer,  and data processing, conducts joint research with local colleges  and businesses. It also undertakes both commissioned and its own  independent research. The results of its work are reflected in  improved technological capabilities, as well as new product  development, of local companies. The laboratory, moreover,  provides small and medium-sized businesses with technical  guidance and consulting utilizing its technical know-how.    In order to assist in the development of technical personnel  for local industries, the laboratory began giving a lecture  series at Kumamoto University, providing "Tahara School," aimed  at development of business executives, as well as a range of  management and technical training courses designed for different  levels of personnel. The laboratory, furthermore, is conducting  a two-year technical training program with a one-to-one  student-teacher (laboratory's research staff) ratio. The program  already has produced 35 graduates, all of whom are currently  active in local businesses.    As for the financial support essential to any R&amp;D  activities,  using the yield on the foundation endowment, several financial  schemes, offering a guarantee of obligation or low interest  financing, financial assistance to R&amp;D (no interest  financing)  and to joint industrial, academic, and governmental research  (funding assistance), are being made available.    The regional technical exchange is being promoted through  the  organization and vigorous activities mounted by various research  forums involving industrial, academic, and governmental efforts.  Especially the "Kumamoto Intelligent System Technology Research  Forum" (an abbreviated designation: RIST), whose membership is  subscribed by 56 local companies and some 50 professors from  universities and technical colleges, has contributed  substantially in raising technical levels through annual  symposiums on introduction of intelligent technology to regional  industries, monthly technical forums, various types of seminars  held several times a month, as well as through joint research.  Moreover, when a bio endowment was established in 1993, the  biotechnical R&amp;D enterprise was undertaken.    Information services offered to regional industries consist  of online search of various commercial databases, including  industries, manpower resources, technical papers, and patents,  and the publication of a PR magazine covering the laboratory's  activities.    The foundation has been active since October 1985, serving  as  an executive office of Japan Technomart. In July 1993, in order  to strengthen the foundation's communication functions with its  members, an advisor was appointed.    Since its inception 10 years ago, the foundation has  contributed to the accumulation of technologies at  Electromechanical Engineering Research Laboratory, the raising  of local industries' technical sophistication levels, and the  promotion of industries.    While further improving unique technologies and creating new  ones, using as a basis the accumulation of technologies and  construction of the industrial foundation achieved during the  first phase, the Kumamoto Technopolis Program is proceeding with  its second phase at the same time, undertaking construction of  the second Technopark, whose aim is to create the "incubation  field" complete with the "housing and recreational" environment  and city functions which will be appealing to working people.    In the future, together with the promotion of regional  industries by further strengthening ties with the Prefectural  Industrial Technology Center and through the promotion of the  joint project involving industry, academics, and government  closely connected to the region, and vigorous support to the  promotion of local businesses, the foundation will work on  specific policies which will prove effective in the construction  of the technopolis.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Crown refinancing deal close to completion A FINANCIAL restructuring of Crown Communications, the broadcasting company which owns LBC, the London radio station, could be completed before the end of this month. Chelverton Investments, a company set up by Mr Matthew Cartisser and Mr John Porter, son of Sir Leslie Porter, the former head of Tesco, has signed a memo of understanding. Final detailed negotiations are now under way on the precise level of investment needed to secure LBC's future, although it is certain to be several million pounds. As a result of the deal it is believed that Chelverton and the LBC management will hold a majority of the London radio station. Much of the rest of the equity will be owned by Crown's banks in exchange for debt. Little will then be left of Crown. The investment is likely to come in two tranches. The first will be risk capital designed to secure LBC's future until the re-advertising of its franchise next year. The most substantial amount will be in the form of longer term commitments to enable the station to retain its franchise. It is also possible that other members of the Porter family may invest in LBC. Mr Christopher Chataway would remain chairman of LBC for the foreseeable future but Mr Porter's mother, the controversial politician Dame Shirley Porter, might eventually succeed him. The main thrust behind the injection of new money into LBC, which has been increasing its market share in London, is coming from Mr Porter. The LBC deal is expected to leave the present management team in place including Mr David Haynes as chief executive. If LBC regains its franchise the Porter family may decide to use it as a base from which to bid for the third national commercial radio licence. This will be a speech station.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jaroslav Spurny: "The Director General of the </F> Arms Consortium Has Fallen From Grace"]    [Text] The RDP Group, the Czech consortium of arms  companies, has been waiting six weeks to find out whether it  will obtain permission from the government to trade in arms. It  seems that it is waiting in vain. In accordance with the new  law on foreign trade in military hardware, four  ministries--Industry, Interior, Defense, and Foreign--have been  making their views known on such requests since April.  Meanwhile, it is apparent from unofficial reports that at least  three of the aforementioned departments--Defense, Foreign, and  Interior--do not approve of granting a license to the RDP Group.  The Cernin Palace obviously cannot overlook the scandal last  December when the chairman of the RDP Group board, Lubomir  Soudek, offered Iranian fundamentalists not only conventional  weapons but also components for their nuclear program. And,  [Defense Minister] Baudys's department again has unsettled  accounts with the consortium's director general, Jan Vlcek.    A definitive decision should be made next week. A great deal  of money is at stake for the RDP Group's top brass, and,  therefore, anxiety is increasing with the approaching date. The  most recent development indicates that the company is still  trying at the last moment to improve its image before state  officials: On Friday, 27 May, Director Vlcek was recalled.  <H5>  Half a Billion Dollars Into the Bargain </H5>   At the end of January 1994, Jan Vlcek turned to Industry  Minister Dlouhy with a request for support in a lucrative order  for Iran: The RDP Group wanted to export a repair assembly line  for tanks for $0.5 billion. Vladimir Dlouhy asked [Interior  Minister] Jan Ruml, [Foreign Minister] Josef Zieleniec, and  Antonin Baudys for their opinions on the contract. Of course,  Vlcek's letter came at a time when the worldwide reaction to  Lubomir Soudek's Teheran "atomic mission" had still not died  down, so the ministers were very constrained and all of them  objected to the deal. The Army was most acerbic: It was  astounded that the RDP Group director had proposed a state  military enterprise as the final supplier for the order without  even consulting the Defense Ministry first. Thus, Vlcek, and  his company along with him, acquired yet another inauspicious  reputation on top of the incommodious contract: "In view of the  consortium's reckless business activities, I consider its  participation in Czech Army projects to be completely out of the  question," wrote Antonin Baudys to his colleague Dlouhy. An  arms company that cannot sell its products and services to the  army of its own country has, of course, according to the  experts, absolutely no chance in the market.    At roughly the same time that the RDP Group received a  negative response from the Industry Ministry to its Iranian  request, the consortium's management founded the RDP Group  Marketing subsidiary limited company. "The explanation is  simple," claims Jaroslav Skrobanek from the company's  management. "Our founding documents were very vague about  trading in arms, and this may not be enough in possible  negotiations on a license for a specific order. Therefore, a  subsidiary company was founded whose main function is commercial  activity." According to the economic experts, however, another  explanation is also possible: The subsidiary company is  intended to detract attention from the RDP Group itself; its  reckless activities "spread" among the public, and the  consortium was faced with the risk that it would not obtain any  license for trade in military material. In view of the fact that  the RDP Group board alone controls the Marketing company and not  the general assembly, possible business deals will become, on  top of this, "more unintelligible" to the shareholders. There  are now more than 40 of them; altogether, these are enterprises  involved--to a greater or lesser extent--in arms production.  <H5>  Cherchez la Femme </H5>   So, instead of the RDP Group, its subsidiary company applied  for general permission to conduct trade, as the new law  prescribes for military hardware. Then, within the framework of  other "purgative" measures, along came the aforementioned recall  of Director General Vlcek. He was replaced by Viktorie Hradska,  the former chairwoman of the Liberal Democratic Party and an  unsuccessful candidate for the post of ambassador to Hungary.  RDP Group representatives have described her "ability to  conduct negotiations" as the new director's main qualification  for the job.    Whether these modifications to improve the company's  battered  reputation will suffice will become apparent in the very near  future. The head of the department for special materials at the  Industry Ministry, Josef Gregr, who is responsible for granting  licenses, already has at his disposal all of the points of view  from the key departments. At the moment, in view of the  continuing administrative proceedings, he is refusing to divulge  any information about the future of the RDP Group Marketing  limited company.</p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OCEANSIDE WOMAN KILLED IN CHAIN-REACTION CRASH  </P> <P> A fast-moving car attempting to avoid stopped traffic along Interstate 5 near  the U.S. immigration checkpoint at San Onofre rammed into the rear of another  car early Monday, triggering a chain-reaction crash that left one person dead,  two injured and northbound traffic backed up for several miles, authorities  said.  </P> <P> Harriet Jane Meyer, 22, of Oceanside died after the collision. She was on her  way to work when her car was hit from behind at 6:40 a.m., authorities said.  </P> <P> Meyer's vehicle was rear-ended by a sports car driven by Gregory Morgan, a  Marine stationed at Camp Pendleton, according to Officer Allen Wilkerson,  spokesman for the California Highway Patrol in San Diego.  </P> <P> No charges had been filed late Monday. The CHP was continuing its  investigation. Meyer's and Morgan's cars were totaled.  </P> <P> Wilkerson would not estimate the speed of Morgan's car at the time of the crash  but said it was traveling at a "high rate of speed."  </P> <P> Morgan suffered minor injuries and was taken to Camp Pendleton Naval Hospital,  authorities said.  </P> <P> The accident occurred about 1 mile south of the U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint,  which was in operation at the time, authorities said.  </P> <P> Meyer was declared dead at the scene at 7:31 a.m., the medical examiner's  office said.  </P> <P> According to the CHP account, Morgan was driving his car in the right-hand lane  when he came upon stopped traffic awaiting inspection at the immigration  checkpoint, which is situated along northbound I-5 north of Oceanside. Morgan's  vehicle swerved into the left lane, the CHP said, eventually crashing into the  rear of the car driven by Meyer.  </P> <P> Meyer's car was pushed forward into a third vehicle and stopped after colliding  with the cable barrier in the center median, the CHP said.  </P> <P> Elizabeth Holts, 46, of Oceanside, a passenger in the third vehicle, was taken  to Good Samaritan Hospital in San Clemente for observation with slight  injuries, the CHP said.  </P> <P> After rear-ending Meyer's car, Morgan's vehicle swerved back to the right lane,  where it struck a tractor-trailer before stopping.  </P> <P> Traffic was backed up for several miles miles along the northbound lanes of  I-5, south of the checkpoint, delaying the heavy rush-hour traffic headed for  Orange County.  </P> <P> All northbound traffic was stopped for at least 10 minutes as a Life Flight  helicopter landed on the northbound lanes of the freeway.  </P></p>

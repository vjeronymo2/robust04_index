			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / French business chiefs 'believe corruption rife' Two out of three French company chairmen suspect that illegal practices are rife in many companies, according to a poll published in today's Le Monde newspaper. More than half of businessmen believe France should launch an Italian-style crackdown on white collar crime, the poll finds. Its publication follows Tuesday's news that Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman of the Saint-Gobain glass group, has become the latest prominent French industrialist to be placed under judicial investigation. Mr Beffa was questioned by a magistrate looking into claims that in 1988 Pont-a-Mousson, a pipemaking subsidiary of Saint-Gobain, paid FFr4.4m (Pounds 520,000) to a Nantes businessman to secure a water supply contract. It is claimed the money was then given to an official of the Republican party, which is led by Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister, and Mr Francois Leotard, defence minister. Mr Longuet, on French radio, praised Mr Beffa as 'an extraordinary man' and said the party had 'nothing to do' with the investigation. The Beffa probe comes at a time when France's investigating magistrates are taking a tougher line on corporate fraud. Mr Pierre Blayau, who worked at Pont-a-Mousson in 1988 but now heads Pinault-Printemps, France's largest retail group, has been under investigation in the same case since May. Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of the Alcatel-Alsthom electronics concern, faces accusations of using corporate money for work on his home. Mr Pierre Berge, head of the Yves Saint-Laurent fashion house, was investigated for insider trading. Earlier this summer, Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of the Schneider electric engineering group, was held in custody in Brussels while being questioned in a fraud probe. Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial entrepreneur and Euro-MP, faces a battery of charges ranging from tax evasion to trying to cover up a bribery scandal at his football club. At least 100 less newsworthy businessmen are also believed to be under investigation. Publicly, most French businessmen and politicians claim to favour a clean-up. The Le Monde poll backs a similar poll in the latest Enjeux Les Echos magazine, which found that 56 per cent of chairmen advocated a crackdown. Mr Patrick Devedjian, a Gaullist MP, yesterday called on French radio for the company heads under investigation to resign. Yet there is growing concern about the ferocity of the recent probes and the adverse publicity they generate. The news of the Beffa probe on Tuesday took a heavy toll on Saint-Gobain's shares and the entire Paris stock market. However, Saint-Gobain's shares yesterday rallied by 1.1 per cent to FFr645. Mr Louis Giral, a candidate for the chair of the Patronat, the representative body of France's industrialists, yesterday called for a halt to 'this massacre game'. Justice must be done, he said 'but I wish that the judges were aware of the implications of hauling in the head of a company'.</p>

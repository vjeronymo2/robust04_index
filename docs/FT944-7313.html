			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / SIB aids clients of Knight Williams The Securities and Investments Board, the chief City watchdog, has agreed to become closely involved in monitoring complaints against Knight Williams, one of the UK's largest independent financial advisers. The new complaints procedure offers Knight Williams' clients an alternative to the existing system. The firm has agreed to analyse each complaint brought, including those already rejected or failed at arbitration. Personal interviews between the complainant and a Knight Williams employee will be recorded for SIB's benefit. If an investor does not want to talk to the firm, SIB will pay for a third party - Ernst &amp; Young, chartered accountants - to interview them instead. SIB will inform Knight Williams of cases where it believes the firm's handling of the complaint falls short of regulatory standards. Complaints against an independent adviser are normally handled by the firm involved and then by Fimbra, its self-regulatory body. SIB confirmed yesterday that it was 'fairly unusual' for it to be involved so closely in the complaints procedure of a member of another body, but said it was partly as a result of Fimbra staffing shortages. Fimbra closed for new business at the end of September in the wake of the creation of the Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect the private investor. Mr Kenneth Jordan, chairman of the Knight Williams Investors Action Group, said the new procedure indicated there were problems for small investors wishing to complain against an independent adviser. 'However, now is the opportunity for these problems to be resolved on the basis of reconciliation and mutual trust,' he said. Knight Williams attracted considerable publicity when MPs, including Sir David Steel, former Liberal leader, tabled an early-day motion voicing concern at the number of complaints against the firm. It was fined Pounds 50,000 by Fimbra in August for breaching 10 Fimbra rules, including issuing misleading advertisements and failing to maintain proper client records. Knight Williams said it welcomed the SIB move 'unreservedly'. Its application to become a member of the PIA, lodged in April, has still not been processed but it can continue to conduct business until the end of September next year when SIB's recognition of Fimbra terminates.</p>

			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS SHIFT A-ARMS FROM TENSE REGIONS  </P> <P> The Soviet Union is moving some nuclear warheads from the Baltic states and  other regions where nationalist tensions have flared to the more stable Russian  republic, Bush Administration officials and private experts said Friday.  </P> <P> "It's the prudent thing to do," said an Administration official, noting that  upheaval in the Baltics and the southern republics in recent months has stirred  concern in Moscow that a nuclear weapons storage site could be overrun by  rebels.  </P> <P> The official discussed the matter on condition he not be identified.  </P> <P> Two Administration officials said the Soviets were moving short-range nuclear  weapons -- those capable of reaching neighboring countries but not the United  States -- out of storage depots in the Baltics and some southern republics.  </P> <P> Private experts on the Soviet military said the United States should view the  development as reassuring because it indicates that Kremlin authorities are  taking precautions in the face of political instability in the Baltics, which  are pressing Moscow for independence, and in other republics torn by ethnic  strife.  </P> <P> Georgi V. Shchekochikhin, a Soviet Embassy spokesman, said he had no  information on the subject.  </P> <P> U.S. officials declined to say how many of the Soviets' estimated 33,000  nuclear warheads are being moved.  </P> <P> Private experts said the transfer of weapons does not affect the deployment of  long-range nuclear arms capable of striking the United States. Thus, the shift  has little, if any, effect on the military balance, although it does mean some  Soviet weapons are farther from possible targets in Western Europe.  </P></p>

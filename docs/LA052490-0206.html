			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LEVERAGED BUYOUT OF JERRICO INC. SUCCEEDS IN A SEA OF INDUSTRY FAILURES;  </P> <P> INVESTMENT: WHEN TWO GROUPS BOUGHT THE PARENT COMPANY OF LONG JOHN SILVER'S,  THEY FOLLOWED A PROVEN RECIPE: BUY SOUND COMPANIES AND EXPLOIT THEIR  POTENTIALS.  </P> <P> Decked out in a light-blue shirt and navy pants, Leonard Harlan, financier, was  a regular member of the fast-food crew.  </P> <P> He cut fish, prepared salads, did some frying and assisted at the front counter  during a six-hour shift at a Long John Silver's Seafood Shoppe in south  Lexington.  </P> <P> But it wasn't a regular workday for Harlan. As president of one of the  investment firms that took the fast-food company private last September, Harlan  was working in the trenches as part of the company's plan for keeping in touch  with the troops.  </P> <P> "I'm impressed with the way the team operates," said Harlan, 53, who wore a  Seaman Apprentice name tag with "Len" printed on it. "It gives me an  appreciation into what you do in one of these shops."  </P> <P> Castle Harlan Inc. is one of two New York investment firms involved in the  management-led leveraged buyout of Jerrico Inc., the parent company of Long  John Silver's. The other owner is DJS-Inverness &amp; Co.  </P> <P> In contrast to other takeovers that have succumbed to heavy debts,  Lexington-based Jerrico has thrived since its $620-million buyout.  </P> <P> "We take fundamentally sound companies and expand from that base," said Harlan,  who added that operating cash flow is up 20% over last year. "Our philosophy is  we build companies. We get the energy released inside the company. We take the  lid off."  </P> <P> Harlan Castle also owns Peasant Restaurants of Atlanta and Morton's of Chicago,  Ethan Allen furniture company, Delaware Management Co., a money-management  firm; and Reagan Outdoor, a billboard company.  </P> <P> Jerrico has streamlined operations, reducing costs by $16 million in corporate  administration and $14 million at the restaurants since the buyout. It also  eliminated about 200 regional and corporate jobs.  </P> <P> "We didn't look for the quick buck," said Jerrico President John E. Tobe, who  also worked a shift at a Long John Silver's in Atlanta. "We had long-term  planning. I think that's what made this LBO a success."  </P> <P> Leveraged buyouts work best when operations are trimmed to the best performers  and other assets are sold off to cover financing costs. In Jerrico's case, the  company recently announced agreements to sell two restaurant chains, Jerry's to  Great American Restaurants, Inc. of Atlanta and Fazoli's to Seed Restaurant  Group Inc., a Japanese-owned firm. The prices were not disclosed.  </P> <P> Jerrico also owns two family-style Italian restaurants called Florenz, which it  plans to sell.  </P> <P> "We want to focus solely on Long John Silver's," said Tobe, who has been with  Jerrico for 16 years, the past six as president and chief executive officer.  </P> <P> Long John Silver's has about 62% of the $1.2-billion quick-service seafood  restaurant business. Jerrico owns about two-thirds of the 1,500 restaurants,  and the rest are franchised.  </P> <P> The chain operates in 35 states, the District of Columbia, Canada and  Singapore.  </P> <P> Since the buyout, there has been an aggressive management campaign to give Long  John Silver's a more contemporary image.  </P> <P> Television ads began Feb. 26 to promote the restaurants as "Makin' a Splash"  with its seafood products.  </P> <P> "It is a theme that employed the upbeat nature of the business," said Harlan.  "We are an upbeat business."  </P> <P> The restaurants are being remodeled, giving the buildings fresh appearances  with bright yellow on dark-blue paint and large cupolas with beacons to attract  customers.  </P> <P> "The buildings were historically gray like (Kentucky) state police cruisers,"  said Tobe. "State police cruisers are gray so they can go unnoticed. Our  buildings ended up doing the same. We want to have the units pop out at you."  </P> <P> The menu has been expanded to include baked and broiled seafood for the  health-conscious consumer and finger foods. Several items will be introduced  for a limited time this summer.  </P> <P> The company also plans to increase the percentage of its restaurants with  drive-through service from the current 35% to 65%; install large, bright menu  boards and improve plates and packaging.  </P> <P> "The company went from very traditional, very methodical to one, overnight, of  innovation," said Bill Mahony, executive vice president, operations.  </P> <P> Jerrico recently sold four Long John Silver's in Phoenix to American Seafood  Partners, one of its largest franchisees. The agreement also calls for the  buyer to develop 16 new franchised units in the Phoenix area within the next  three years, and another 16 in markets yet to be chosen.  </P> <P> The company also is looking to add 200 franchised units within five years in  established markets and expand into the Northeast and Northwest, where it has  almost no presence, Tobe said.  </P> <P> "We're aggressively going after new franchisees," he said. "We also hope  company employees can become franchisees."  </P> <P> The company recently offered stock appreciation rights to 3,000 employees,  starting with assistant managers, which will let them benefit from the  appreciation of the value of Jerrico's stock, now held by senior managers and  investors in the buyout.  </P> <P> "The company is theirs," said Harlan. "We want an entrepreneurial spirit. We  want to produce independent thought."  </P> <P> In 1989, before the buyout, Jerrico had a different focus in remembering the  20th year of Long John Silver's.  </P> <P> "On the 20th anniversary, we celebrated our age," said Anthony M. Lavely,  executive vice president for marketing. "Now, eight months later, we're  celebrating our future, our youth and our desire to do new things."  </P></p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Caracas' hopes of joining Caricom rise VENEZUELA'S efforts to become a member of the Caribbean Economic Community (Caricom) have been given a fillip with a trade agreement which will open the Venezuelan market to duty-free imports from members of the community. Under the agreement, Venezuela will allow one-way preferential access to its market for imports from the 13 Caricom countries. Tariffs will be reduced gradually over five years until a duty-free entry has been agreed for the imports. After five years, the Caricom members will start a phased reduction of tariffs, also over five years. By then, the community and Venezuela will have totally free trade, except for exclusions to be agreed within the community. The agreement, signed in Caracas by Mr Carlos Andres Perez, the president of Venezuela, and Mr Patrick Manning, prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, who is also chairman of Caricom, will come into force on January 1 next year. Caricom members have agreed to grant Venezuela Most Favoured Nation status in the application of customs tariffs and have also agreed not to apply any new quantitative restrictions on imports from Venezuela. The products which will be traded duty free between Venezuela and Caricom include iron and steel, spices, industrial gases and electronic items. There will be a phased reduction of tariffs on agricultural products, including livestock, furniture and other consumer durables. The list of derogations includes beef, milk, rice, cement and television sets. Mr Manning said the pact with Venezuela, proposed by President Perez 15 months ago, is the first which Caricom had negotiated and signed as a community. The agreement was historic and would test uncharted waters as it involved a group of developing countries, he added. Venezuela is currently an observer to the community, but is hoping to become the first Latin American member of the English speaking group, which has a combined market of 5.5m people. The Venezuelan application for full membership was filed a year ago, but the community's leaders have not yet considered it. The pact is expected significantly to increase the value and volume of trade between Venezuela and Caricom. Figures from the Caricom Secretariat value the community's imports from Venezuela at about Dollars 360m (Pounds 209m) a year, while Venezuela spends about Dollars 90m on imports from the group.</p>

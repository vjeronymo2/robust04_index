			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / International Company News: Cross Border M&amp;A Deals Activity in the Asia-Pacific region was a feature of last week's international mergers and acquisitions, writes Brian Bollen. The sale of Australian merchant bank Dominguez Barry Samuel Montagu continues Midland Bank's strategy of selling non-core assets outside Europe and enables purchaser Swiss Bank Corp to expand its international investment banking business. Morgan Grenfell furthered its ambition to establish a strong independent presence in the south east Asian securities market, taking a 30 per cent stake in Malaysian stockbroker K&amp;N Kenanga. Laporte of the UK is expanding its business in printed wiring board chemicals into a fast growing market for electronics, through the acquisition of Taipei-based Taiwan Spechem. Elsewhere, the tender offer by South African-controlled Oceana for a stake in UK fashion retailer Etam confirms the suspicions of some market players that the UK retailing sector has bottomed out. While Oceana said it is considering an offer for the whole company and is using the tender to gauge shareholder response, Etam attacked it as an attempt to gain back door control at an unacceptably low price. In the ongoing restructuring of the global car industry, Japan's car assembly presence will increase when Mitsubishi Motors completes its purchase of one third of Volvo Cars, joining the Dutch government and Volvo as an equal partner. The horticultural division of UK group Fisons is making its first significant move into continental Europe with the purchase of DSM Agro Specialties of Holland.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     CROSS BORDER M&amp;A DEALS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BIDDER/INVESTOR       TARGET       SECTOR        VALUE       COMMENT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Viag (Germany)      Continental   Packaging    Pounds490m    Viag now                     Can-Europe                    est      Europe's 2nd                     (US-owned)                                biggest  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Minorco (S Africa)  Hudson Bay    Base Metals  Pounds51m    Cash resue                     Mining &amp;                                   offer                     Smelting  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Oceana Investment   Etam (UK)     Fashion      Pounds 22m     Unwelcome Corp (S Africa)                   retailing                 tender offer  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Thorn EMI (UK)      SBK Records   Recorded     Pounds 18.3m  Thorn buys                        (US)        music                    outstanding                                                                  50%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Volkswagen          Volkswagen    Vehicle     Pounds 16.3m   VW's second (Germany)/BAZia)    Bratislava   manufacture                   Czech jv (Czechoslovakia)      (jv)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fisons (UK)         DSM Agro     Horticulture   Pounds 10m    Move into                    Specialities                                Europe                    (Holland)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Laporte)(UK)      Taiwan Spechem   Speciality   Pounds 2.3m    Expansion                      (Taiwan)      chemicals                   into                                                                SE Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Swiss Bank Corp   Dominguez Barry  Financial     N/A           SBC buys (Switzerland)     Samuel Montagu   Services                      60%;                   (Australia/UK)                              employees                                                                  buy                                                                balance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mitsubishi         Volvo Car        Vehicle      NA         Mitsubishi (Japan)          (Holland/Sweden)  manufacture                 takes a                                                                 third  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Siemens            Unit of Texas     Computer    NA            Texas (Germany)         Instruments (US)   software                  sharpens                                                                 focus  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: FT Mergers &amp; Acquisitions International  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

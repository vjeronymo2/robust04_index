			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: UK accounting Rank Organisation's annual report showed this week why investors should be on their toes. Even though Rank was adhering to the letter of the law in its restatement of last year's figures under the new accounting rules, it also included a deft Pounds 57m property revaluation provision that would not otherwise have appeared in the profit and loss. It hardly helps that half the market will still be reporting under the old system during the coming results season. The City could ease the confusion by agreeing some standard definitions of normalised earnings, although that goes against the spirit of the reforms. There is merit in adjusting the volatile new earnings figure by subtracting disposals, closures and other one-off costs. That should leave a rump of sustainable earnings. But BZW wants to deduct preference dividends, too, while NatWest Markets will put costs relating to failed bids above the line. The onus is clearly on companies to be as transparent as possible. The Accounting Standards Board has already read the riot act to companies bending the new rules. The new legal status of accounting standards should encourage company directors and auditors to stick to the rules. The ASB's victory over Trafalgar House last year showed it has real teeth. But even companies with a clean record on compliance may use the opportunity to slip bad news into the market under the cover of confusion.</p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FREAKED-OUT FLIERS FIND THERE'S HOPE  </P> <P> Dana Mendenhall has a problem. She has a chance to vacation in the Bahamas, but  she hasn't been able to set foot on an airplane in 21 years.  </P> <P> "I used to fly everywhere, and then one day we'd gotten on a plane in Las Vegas  to fly back to Orange County, and I had a panic attack," said Mendenhall, 45,  of Yorba Linda.  </P> <P> "The only thing I remember is standing up screaming, 'I've got to get off this  plane.' They turned around and went back to the gate. I haven't flown since."  </P> <P> But determined at long last to conquer her fear of flying, Mendenhall joined a  small group of other similarly afflicted folk one recent evening in the  classroom of a flight school at John Wayne Airport. Instrument panel mock-ups  graced the walls. The noise of jets roaring into the air drifted in through the  door.  </P> <P> Mendenhall and eight others sat grim-faced, their heads nodding rapidly in  recognition as the various flying fears were listed on a chart.  </P> <P> Fear of takeoffs. Of turbulence. Of claustrophobia. Of panicking. Of being  embarrassed. Of dying.  </P> <P> The long list complete, seminar leader Glen Arnold set to work reassuring the  fearful travelers that it's OK to be freaked out by flying.  </P> <P> "A Gallup poll found that half of all Americans express some concern about  flying. None of us chooses to have problems. They just arrive on our doorstep,"  Arnold says.  </P> <P> For 12 years, Arnold has been helping fliers send their fears packing. A pilot  and clinical social worker, Arnold, 47, founded Thairapy flight relaxation  training service in 1978.  </P> <P> "People knew I was a therapist and involved with aviation, and they kept asking  me for advice on dealing with their flying problems, so I decided to give it  more formally."  </P> <P> Arnold, who also is on the counseling staff at UCI Medical Center, has Thairapy  offices in Newport Beach and Santa Monica. He holds three-hour seminars, such  as the recent one at John Wayne Airport, as well as group and individual  therapy sessions.  </P> <P> Arnold said his goal is to get people to at least tolerate flying, if not enjoy  it.  </P> <P> "A lot of people use the New York subway, and they don't feel they have to  enjoy the experience."  </P> <P> Arnold led the seminar participants in a discussion of why some people fear  flying.  </P> <P> "Flying, first of all, is vividly three-dimensional. We live in pretty much a  two-dimensional world -- all our other transportation is forward and back, side  to side. In a plane you experience very intense up and down sensations."  </P> <P> Arnold said that most people with flying problems had parents with similar  phobias. Children can either learn their fears or acquire the inclination  toward them through heredity.  </P> <P> For others, he said, "their experiences have made them view flying as  dangerous."  </P> <P> Anita Berresse, 49, of El Toro said she knows exactly when and why her fear  began.  </P> <P> "Jan. 6, 1988, on a flight from Dallas to Detroit. One of the engines exploded  right after takeoff. I sat there frozen with fear.  </P> <P> "Now I feel that when I get on a plane, I'm relinquishing all control. I'm  handing somebody my life."  </P> <P> She flies about six times a year, but each flight is filled with the terror of  waiting for something to happen.  </P> <P> "On my last flight I talked to myself all through the turbulence. You don't  want to be on a plane with me."  </P> <P> The way to begin dealing with flying fear, no matter what its origin, Arnold  said, is to identify the most troublesome part of the flight and realize that  usually it accounts for a very small part of an hours-long journey. Takeoffs,  for instance, last only 40 seconds. Turbulence may last only a few minutes.  </P> <P> "If you figure out which part bothers you the most, you already have a much  greater sense of control and are able to manage the rest of the flight much  more smoothly."  </P> <P> Once the main source of fear is identified, Arnold recommends attacking it with  the following four-pronged strategy, setting a goal of small improvement with  each flight:  </P> <P> * Relaxation. Arnold suggested deep-breathing and visualization techniques for  getting in a relaxed frame of mind before the troubling part of the flight.  "Imagine yourself in some restful, peaceful place with the sun soaking into  your body."  </P> <P> * Mental armor. Think positively, Arnold said. "Welcome the takeoff or  turbulence or whatever. Tell yourself, 'I'm here to learn. This is an outdoor  laboratory.' That's the attitude you need."  </P> <P> If that resolve begins to crumble, use various sensual distraction techniques,  he suggested, such as applying a drop of perfume to a shirt cuff, turning up  the volume on the audio headset or chewing on something crunchy. Arnold  provided the seminar participants with a list of 32 anxiety-reducing ploys.  </P> <P> * Nutrition. For 12 to 24 hours before a flight, minimize or eliminate foods  that interfere with relaxation, Arnold said. The main offenders are sugar,  caffeine, alcohol and nicotine.  </P> <P> The most common mistake anxious fliers make is using alcohol, he said.  "Eighty-five percent of people with flying problems are hindered by the use of  alcohol. It actually heightens their anxiety."  </P> <P> * Knowledge of aircraft operations. "Air takes a bad rap," Arnold said. "We  can't see it, so we think there's nothing between us and the ground. But there  is great power in the air."  </P> <P> One woman in the group said she panics when she thinks that there are too many  people on one side of the plane and fears the plane will flip over.  </P> <P> "We forget how long the wings of a plane are and the tremendous upward pressure  exerted on the wings. It really makes no difference where people are standing  in the cabin. The plane can't keel over from a shift in weight."  </P> <P> The more fliers know about airplanes the more secure they should feel, Arnold  said. It helps to know not only the statistical safety record ("Driving is 25  times more dangerous than flying to the same destination," Arnold says), but  also why and how the plane flies.  </P> <P> "A plane on the ground is kind of an ungainly thing, rolling around on its  little wheels. But in the air it's where it was designed to be, operating in  every sort of weather in all parts of the world," Arnold said.  </P> <P> To illustrate his fear-reducing strategy, Arnold led the group through a  discussion of how to cope with turbulence.  </P> <P> "Expect it. Ten percent of flying time will be mildly or moderately turbulent.  We try to use magic. We tell ourselves if we do this or that anxious behavior  then maybe we'll be spared. And then when we're not, we can't deal with it."  </P> <P> Accepting that turbulence will occur is a major part of handling it.  </P> <P> Keep seat belts tightly fastened during turbulence, Arnold said. "People make  the mistake of keeping their belts too loose in turbulence. Your body can then  bounce around worse than it has to and make the sensation worse."  </P> <P> Arnold said many fliers have had success relaxing during turbulence by  visualizing themselves as Jell-O, gently yielding to the forces at work on the  plane. "The more you tighten your muscles and clutch things, the more you  exaggerate the effect of turbulence. If your body is relaxed, you will feel  relaxed."  </P> <P> Sharon Hjeltness, 47, of La Mesa in San Diego County, said Arnold's words about  the physics of flight made a big impression on her.  </P> <P> "I'll think more about the idea of flying in an ocean of air and how the plane  is operating in its own environment. I do well when I'm in my environment, so  the plane will do the same. I'll trust that," said Hjeltness, who sported an "I  Love to Fly" button in a bit of positive thinking.  </P> <P> But, just in case, she still has a coping repertoire of her own to fall back  on:  </P> <P> "I try to find someone to talk to more scared than I am. Makes me feel better."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By L. Varebrus and Ye. Chukovskiy; from the "Vesti" </F> newscast]    [Excerpt] [Announcer] A contract under the  intergovernmental agreement between the United States and the  Russian Federation on the sale of highly enriched uranium was  signed today at the Russian Ministry of Atomic Power and  Industry.    [Varebrus over video of nuclear explosion and signing  ceremony] Most people have probably seen a nuclear explosion,  on television of course, but few will know that the decisions to  start producing nuclear weapons--and who was to do it, at what  plants, and what type of technology was to be used--were adopted  in precisely these premises, in downtown Moscow, on Ordynka  Street.    Now the people against whom these weapons were built, the  Americans, are right here to sign an agreement to ensure that  Russia's nuclear weapon potential is used for the benefit of our  peaceful life. And these objects, even if they look a bit like  missiles, are just pens which will be used in a few minutes to  sign a Russian-U.S. contract on reprocessing weapons-grade  uranium into fuel for nuclear power stations. Over a period of  20 years more than 20,000 nuclear charges totaling almost 500  tonnes of uranium are to be processed. The cost of the contract  is $12 billion. If everything goes according to plan, the plant  to be built under this contract in the United States will be  using Russian technology and Russian raw material.

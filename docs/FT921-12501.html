			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Halifax will charge on low funds HALIFAX, Britain's largest building society, confirmed yesterday that it is to impose charges on February 1 on customers with low balances in their savings accounts, but said its decision was fair to most of its customers. The society, which made pre-tax profits of Pounds 593m last year, said its margin on interest earned from mortgage-lending and interest paid to its 3.6m savers was being squeezed. Customers with balances of less than Pounds 250 can have two free withdrawals a month, but will have to pay 60p for further cash withdrawals and Pounds 1 for cheques. People with balances of less than Pounds 50 for 30 days or more in each quarter will also have to pay a quarterly charge of Pounds 2.50. Account holders aged 21 or below are exempt. Halifax said low-balance savings accounts used frequently were run at a loss. Abbey National, one of Halifax's main rivals, said it had no plans to make a similar move.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 31 Dec (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic,  president of the republic of Srpska, sent a letter today to  Willy Claes, chairman of the European Union's council, in reply  to his claim that the responsibility for the continuation of the  conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina lay with the Serb side.    The letter says that this truce was being violated by Muslim  extremists who, in Karadzic's words, are intolerant of Christian  holidays.    "Dear Mr. Claes, I am deeply moved by your concern about the  violations of the Christmas truce," President Radovan Karadzic  says in his letter. He further stresses that, in this civil  war, as in the previous two World Wars, the Serbs are exposed to  vicious attacks by their neighbors of different denominations,  especially during Orthodox Christian holidays.    Underlining that the Serbs would be thrilled if the Muslims  ceased their military activities, the republic of Srpska  president expressed his hope that Willy Claes, as chairman of  the European Union's council, could influence the Muslim side to  accept the peace plan drawn up thanks to Serb concessions.</p>

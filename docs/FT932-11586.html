			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Hong Kong (10): The deals keep flowing in - Property company / Profile of New World Development CONTACTS and capital are the key pre-requisites for getting deals in Southern China, and New World Development has both in abundance. The Hong Kong property developer has already committed to 51 separate projects in China with a total value of more than Dollars HK50 bn. Pouring this amount of capital into a politically-volatile emerging market such as China might be considered rash, but to New World's managing director Henry Cheng Kar-shun, the strategy holds compelling logic. He claims: 'If you don't have confidence in China, you shouldn't invest in Hong Kong,' arguing that the risk profile of the two 'countries' has become broadly similar, as a result of their continuing economic inter-dependence. Like most elder businessmen in Hong Kong, Henry Cheng's father, Mr Cheng Yu-tung, should understand the concept of China risk; at the age of 14 he was forced to flee to the Portuguese colony of Macau, to escape the turmoil of the Sino-Japanese war. But as with many refugees from the mainland, New World's founder and chairman shows no qualms about returning home. But he is doing so cautiously. In spite of the growing list of deals, New World has invested less than Dollars HK2bn so far, and the company has moved away from its traditional core business of property, into less risky areas such as power stations and roads. The China push is effectively a combination of opportunity and necessity. New World is Hong Kong's third largest property developer, owning more than 4m sq. ft. of property in the world's second most expensive property market. But the company lacks a sizeable local land bank for future development, leaving it without the basic raw material for its prime business. Like Hong Kong's manufacturers in the 1980s, New World has therefore decided to make use of cheap resources across the border, and in just two years of fervent negotiation, it has built up a China land bank which is ten times the size of that in Hong Kong. A few of the mass residential developments for which it is known in Hong Kong are being replicated in China, but most of its property projects are to be constructed in phases over a lengthy periods of time. In addition, the ability to pre-sell flats before construction has even started, allows the company to launch projects which are effectively self-finance. The other main prong of the company's China strategy is infra-structural projects, such as roads and power stations. There are three keys to investment in China, according to Mr Henry Cheng: 'You have to understand the thinking of the Chinese people, you have to have good relations with Chinese officials, and you must want to invest there as a long-term investor, rather than attempting to make quick money and then running away." Relations with local officialdom are probably the key factor, and competitors claim that Mr Cheng Yu-tung is exceptionally well-connected. Mr Cheng hails from the city of Shunde, near the provincial capital of Guangzhou. Like most Hong Kong businessmen, he has taken care to foster local goodwill through the standard funding of hospitals and schools. This has been a shrewd strategy, since the mayor of Guangzhou (Canton) Mr Li Ziliu happens to share Mr Cheng's birthplace. New World's first big China projects were a Dollars HK2.4bn deal to construct a 600 MegaWatt power station and a section of the Guangzhou ring road; both are joint ventures with Mr Li's Guangzhou municipal Government. Fortunately for the company, it is investing in projects which have already progressed beyond the planning stage, but which need capital support and some project management expertise; the company can easily provide this. The power stations have a guaranteed rate of return, and the highways have fixed pre-arranged tolls. The key variable is the traffic, but on the company's Guangzhou ring road project, vehicle flow is already three times the projections in a 1990 feasibility study. Mr Michael Green, research analyst at SG Warburg Securities, says: 'It is a very sound strategy. The only real risk that they face is a currency risk, but they have significant protection against that.' Unlike other China investors such as Hopewell Holdings and Wharf, the Cheng's have not gilded their expansion strategies with visionary terms; they admit their only motive is profit, but the deals keep flowing in. It took Hopewell Holdings more than a decade to negotiate its Super-highway. But in two years, New World was able to sign up five highway projects; and with the planning already undertaken by local government, the pay-back period is shorter. However, Mr Henry Cheng agrees that projects in Guangdong are becoming more competitive - an example is the fact that his own company is already constructing a 129-kms toll road alongside the proposed Phase II of Hopewell's Super-Highway, from Guangzhou to Zhuhai. So New World is already turning its attention northwards. It is to construct a power station in Guangxi Province, and has signed property deals in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan and Tianjin. Hong Kong companies have a poor track record for investing outside the restricted but cozy borders of the colony, and New World is no exception, with its poorly-timed Dollars US540m purchase of the Ramada Hotel group in 1989. China represents the first real opportunity for Hong Kong companies to expand into a business environment which they understand and recognise, albeit through an excess of corruption and bureaucratic red tape. Mr Cheng argues that 'Hong Kong needs the support of China, and China needs the help of Hong Kong. It is mutually beneficial, but ultimately, China can grow without Hong Kong.' He intends to ensure that China has no choice.</p>

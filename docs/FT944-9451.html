			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (16): A fixed-price contract to control costs - Facilities management/Outsourcing The world's first multilateral foreign exchange netting and settlement service is about to become a reality and - in a coup for the outsourcing world - has decided to outsource its entire data processing operation from scratch. The Exchange Clearing House, Echo, co-operatively funded by more than a dozen banks worldwide, as a 'green field site' is far from a typical facilities management (FM) deal because the FM partner - the Hoskyns Group - will be involved in the development of the systems as well as the maintenance and day-to-day running of it. Concern for security was a crucial factor in the decision to take the outsourcing route. Uninterrupted, secure, 24-hour trading was so important that Echo needed at least one secure computer site for its information technology (IT), an expense that few in-house operations could bear. Another unusual aspect was the amount of work put in during the early stages. The five bidders on the shortlist for the contract had to work out in detail how they would develop the systems and exactly what resources would be needed, before Echo was even sure of its financial backing. In spite of the unusual nature of the deal, Echo's chief executive Graham Duncan cites the classic reasons for choosing an outsourced deal rather than 'growing in-house expertise.' He was looking for a fixed-price contract that would make IT costs controllable and he wanted a ready-made team, well-versed in the world of finance, that could work well together from day one. He also wanted the security of a partner large enough to offer backup expertise and systems, running parallel sites for disaster recovery. 'This was a unique project: no-one had tried to do this before. It had to go out to tender before we could be sure of the finance, and for that reason the venture would only work if we found outsourcing partners who really understood the business,' he says. Banks participating in Echo will be able to pool the amounts due to each other from foreign exchange (FX) deals. A single payment of the net amount due in each currency is then made between each bank and Echo. As well as drastically reducing the expense of FX trading, and cutting the volume and administration of transactions, the netting system also reduces settlement and replacement risks for the participating banks. During the five-year gestation period, Mr Duncan worked out how to extend the low-risk ethos to his IT strategy - 'we look on outsourcing as a risk reduction strategy. We had not a desk nor a paper clip, and what I wanted was a short cut to quality and to competence, so that all our time and team-building could be focused on doing the business.' The value of business to be handled by the system (about Dollars 1,000bn daily) dwarfed the run-of-the mill IT security problems - 'we focused at the beginning on two concerns: air crashes and bombs. Bombs in a financial centre offer a short cut for terrorists, and an air crash can wipe out an entire facility.' Within two years, evidence justified this approach, with bombs being planted in the City of London, and a Jumbo jet crashing outside Amsterdam, within a half-mile of two trading sites. Echo only looked at software houses that could offer FM facilities as well as development skills. Hoskyns, in partnership with one of the UK's most experienced financial software houses, Logica, was chosen as one of only two bids remaining (and the only European company) from a shortlist of five, which itself had been whittled down from an original invitation to tender to 17 worldwide FM providers. Hoskyns is providing two data sites, and through the sub-contractor Logica, development services for software based on IBM AS400s and a network of Vax computers, Sun workstations and Apple Mac servers. The entire contract is worth Pounds 14m over five years. To reach this figure, both sides in the deal had to be sure of exactly what could be delivered, what resources would be needed, and exactly how delivery could be measured. Mr Duncan dismisses the argument that IT is too precious to cede control to another source: IT, he says, is difficult to control in any case, and having a service level agreement offers more control than many organisations have over their in-house IT. 'I've always been a fan of outsourcing because the financial service industry ought to concentrate on being the financial services industry. For many institutions, it's a drain on their resources and a distraction from their main business.' Fixed-price contracts generally profit both parties. FM is the direct heir of the bureau services used 20 years ago in assuming that a user is able to put a value (not just a price) on IT services. Often, outsourcing is associated with old mainframe based 'legacy' systems, freeing the user to concentrate on core business. However, partnerships, rather than mere client/provider relationships are now in vogue. Recent trends have been to 'split the profit' between client and provider, where real savings have been made. Andersen Consulting was awarded the contract for the London Stock Exchange (LSE) computer operations, which employed 400 staff, costing Pounds 50m a year in 1991. The contract (awarded without tender, due to the preparatory work) has been running since early 1992, with the target of reducing staff by 24 per cent in the first year - 'our aim was to reduce the total running costs by Pounds 10m a year, in two years, and by Pounds 20m per annum in five years. We're already ahead of target,' says Vernon Ellis, the managing partner for Andersen Consulting in Europe in charge of the LSE project. 'We proposed taking the entire operation over, and reducing the cost of running and maintaining to free up LSE resources to develop new market trading systems.' But not everyone is convinced. Brian Periera, manager of information systems for Pricoa Relocation Management, is talking to several potential partners, all FM suppliers, in a project to re-vamp the core systems of the company. Pricoa is the London Region of Prudential Resources Management of America, which manages large clients such as IBM and its parent, the Prudential Insurance Co of America, in staff relocation schemes. 'Facilities management just isn't an option for the relocation division. We feel that by outsourcing, you're putting too many valuable resources in the hands of people outside our own company. If we wanted to go back, to take control again, it would be a difficult move, and that's a major fear for any company to whom systems are important. In-house control has to be assured.'</p>

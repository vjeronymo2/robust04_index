			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Arjo Wiggins Appleton The wobbles in the exchange rate mechanism have caused a scratching of heads in the City and a reshuffling of portfolios. UK companies with a big exposure to mainland Europe are swinging back into fashion in anticipation of interest rate cuts. One of the most striking beneficiaries has been Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British paper company, which derives more than half its sales from mainland Europe. This is appealing but, in AWA's case at least, the benefits may take a long time to materialise. Despite the currency turmoil, neither the French franc nor interest rates have yet fallen much. Even if they do, the paper market is likely to remain rough. The European industry is still plagued by overcapacity. The D-Mark price of many paper grades fell again last month. The Nordic producers, which have become far more cost competitive following currency devaluations, appear more inclined to add volume than widen margins. This pricing vice has particularly squeezed the French paper industry: Finnish paper exports to France shot up by two-thirds in the first five months of the year. This competitive position may soon change; the pricing pressures, though, are unlikely to abate. AWA has proved more resilient than most manufacturers due to its higher value papers and strong distribution network. Yet the resilience suggests its earnings recovery will be less pronounced than those of commodity producers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Sotnikova: ``Businessmen Also in the </F> 'Risk Group''']    [Text] KOMMERSANT-DAILY has addressed the problem of  growth of the incidence of diphtheria in Moscow several times,  but yesterday Moscow's Main Medical Administration communicated  to a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that the diphtheria epidemic  has reached threatening proportions in the city. Last week 147  persons infected by this disease were brought to the hospital.  The diphtheria situation is no less complex in the Moscow  suburbs.    According to specialists the growth of the incidence of  diphtheria is explained on one hand by the fact that ``a total  victory over diphtheria by medical personnel in the USSR'' was  officially announced in the mid-1970s, which led to an  unexcusable decrease in attention toward this disease. On the  other hand the debate that arose several years ago in the press  on vaccinations forced many to avoid precautionary measures  which they felt to be unsafe. As a result a rise began in the  disease in countries of the former USSR in the mid-1980s.    Moscow is one of the most dangerous regions from the  standpoint of development of a diphtheria epidemic. Since the  beginning of this year 1,140 cases of illness were recorded,  including 234 among children. (For comparison: In all of last  year 774 diphtheria patients, including 123 children, were  registered by institutions of the city's Main Medical  Administration.) At first glance the situation in the Moscow  suburbs does not seem so frightening--316 patients in 8 months;  however, even this figure is double that for all of 1992.    According to specialists of the city's Main Medical  Administration a certain decline in the epidemic was noted in  July-August, associated primarily with the vacation season;  however, growth of the number of patients was registered in late  August. A total of 56 persons succumbed to this infectious  disease in Moscow; four of them were children. According to  unofficial data each week an average of two or three persons die  from diphtheria in Moscow. In the opinion of medical personnel  death is guaranteed almost 100 percent for anyone who falls ill  and is not immunized against diphtheria.    The social status of diphtheria patients has changed  considerably: While last year 100 percent of persons dying from  diphtheria were chronic alcoholic patients, now this disaster  has fallen upon new social groups. The risk carried by those  whose professional responsibilities include communicating with  broad strata of people is greater than that of others.  Specialists agree unanimously that the sole solution to the  situation is diphtheria immunization, which may be obtained in  both a rayon polyclinic and in hard-currency clinics and medical  centers.</p>

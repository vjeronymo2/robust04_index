However, this only shows the mood at the moment, which  might be different in a few days.    This is the result of a flash poll that was carried out by  the OGM on Wednesday evening (500 telephone contacts that are  representative of the whole of Austria): Extrapolating from  these results, 42 percent of the population would vote for  Austria's entry into the EU in the June referendum, 25 percent  against, and 32 percent undecided.

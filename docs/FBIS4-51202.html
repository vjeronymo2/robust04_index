			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's Article: "Resolutely Dealing Blows at </F> Crimes, and Preserving Social Stability"]    [Text] Courts in our province have openly announced court  judgments on a number of criminal cases, and some criminal  elements guilty of seriously breaking the criminal law and  harming the society have been duly punished by the law. This is  an important measure for implementing the relevant spirit of the  central authorities in our province and strengthening the attack  on severe crimes. It is of great significance to preserving  social stability, consolidating and developing the present  favorable situation of stability and unity, ensuring smooth  progress in reform, opening up, and economic construction, and  protecting the lives, property, and safety of the masses.    At present, a handful of criminal elements in society are  swollen with arrogance and feel reassured and emboldened. Some  of them waylay or kill persons to seize their goods. Stealing  has become second nature. Some rape women, or form criminal  gangs to ride roughshod in their home villages and towns. Some  criminal elements commit all manner of crimes which make one's  hair stand on end. Some are economic criminal elements who are  blinded by greed. They abuse their posts to wantonly practice  corruption, take bribes, and harm the interests of the state and  collectives. All this criminal activity has severely  jeopardized society and obstructed the smooth progress of  reform, opening up and economic construction. They are a social  hindrance to deepening reform and speeding up development. The  masses clap and cheer when these criminal elements are  prosecuted and heavily punished according to law.    We need a fine social environment to carry out reform and  opening up and to develop our socialist market economy. Social  stability is the foundation for smooth progress in all work.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping points out: "Without a stable  environment, we can achieve nothing. We will even lose those  achievements which have been scored." Recently, central leading  comrades have repeatedly stressed that we must pay attention to  the overall situation of the work of the entire party, correctly  handle relations between reform, development and stability, and  ensure social and political stability. With the continuous  deepening of reform and opening up, our task of preserving  social stability has become increasingly important. Party  organizations at all levels throughout the province must  conscientiously implement our strategic guidelines of "doing two  types of work simultaneously and attaching equal importance to  both." They must proceed from the overall situation of the  great cause of modernization to understand the importance of  maintaining social stability. On the one hand, we must continue  to uphold the principle of "dealing heavy blows to crime" to  severely and promptly crack those unrepentant criminals guilty  of crimes for which even death is insufficient punishment,  criminal gangs which severely harm the society, serious economic  crimes, and arch criminal elements who despise social morality  and laws and wantonly trample on our residents' life and  property. This will embody the deterrent role of our laws and  the great power of our people's democratic dictatorship. On the  other hand, we must persist in doing well in comprehensive  management of public security, and attach importance to cracking  and preventing crimes and bringing about temporary and permanent  solutions with emphasis on permanent solutions.    Establishing a socialist market economic system is a new  undertaking and a magnificent, systematic project as well. It  needs coordination and cooperation from various quarters. It  needs a fine social environment and effective legal protection.  The faster we speed up the pace of reform and opening up, the  greater efforts we must exert to crack various kinds of criminal  activities and preserve social stability and unity. As long as  we make unremitting efforts and truly "do two types of work  simultaneously and attach equal importance to both," our reform,  opening up, and modernization will progress in a still faster  and better manner.</p>

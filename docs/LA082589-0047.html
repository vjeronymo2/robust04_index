			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Club-wielding police attacked demonstrators in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev,  injuring dozens of them, to break up a protest marking the 50th anniversary of  a secret Nazi-Soviet pact, activists said in Moscow, where a smaller  demonstration was staged a few hours earlier. Parts of the western Ukraine as  well as Moldavia and all three Baltic republics were annexed by Soviet dictator  Josef Stalin under secret terms of his 1939 pact with Adolf Hitler on the eve  of World War II. One of the Kiev activists said several thousand people were  involved in the protest, waving yellow-and-blue Ukrainian national flags.  Officials confirmed the demonstration but denied reports of arrests or  injuries.  </P></p>

The Fourth District judge was  unable to enter the National Palace because of the crowd outside  the building. Tight security measures have been implemented and  the doors to the building have been closed. Meanwhile, the  government minister, along with several of his associates,  remains in his office inside the building.    The workers, Fenasep members, announced a few minutes ago  that the president of the Republic has authorized the attorney  general and government minister to hold talks with them.  Nevertheless, this is opposed by the majority of the workers.  Here is government worker Armando Sanchez who is outside the  palace.    [Sanchez] [passage indistinct]    [Reporter] In addition, we also want to report that besides  the five diplomats we mentioned in an earlier report who are  inside the National Palace, the Paraguayan Ambassador Gilberto  Caniza also finds himself trapped inside. These diplomats,  along with those people who went to the National Palace today to  carry out normal business and reporters who normally cover  events at the palace, have been prevented from leaving. This is  also true of officials who went to the Foreign Relations  Ministry today to attend a diplomatic event that has been  canceled in the wake of this situation.</p>

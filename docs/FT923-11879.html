			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Police authority agrees Halford settlement MERSEYSIDE Police Authority yesterday agreed to the early retirement on health grounds of Ms Alison Halford, an assistant chief constable who said she had been the victim of sex discrimination. The authority said that Ms Halford, 52, would get 'the usual pension, to which she has contributed, payable in such circumstances'. She will receive a lump sum of Pounds 142,600 and an annual pension of Pounds 35,836. As a result of the settlement, Ms Halford will withdraw allegations of sex discrimination against Sir Philip Myers, inspector of constabulary for the north-west; Mr James Sharples, chief constable of Merseyside; Northamptonshire Police Authority and the home secretary. It is expected that the sex discrimination case - which has been supported by the Equal Opportunities Commission - will be formally withdrawn when the industrial tribunal hearing it meets in Manchester today. Mr David Henshaw, clerk of Merseyside Police Authority, said disciplinary proceedings against Ms Halford would automatically cease as a result of her retirement. She has been suspended from duty for the past 19 months after allegations of misconduct arising from a swimming incident at the home of a Merseyside businessman while she was duty officer in charge of the force. A meeting of the police authority last Friday that had been expected to approve terms for ending the case was adjourned, and yesterday the authority agreed to the settlement only by 10-8 with three abstentions. Some members left the meeting saying they believed the disciplinary process against Ms Halford should have gone ahead. Others were concerned that the effect on the EOC's budget may have been a factor in pressure for a settlement. Pressure for a negotiated settlement to the case had grown with the knowledge that Home Office ministers were becoming concerned about its cost. They were referring to the financial cost - at least Pounds 1m and set to double if the industrial tribunal hearing which started in May had continued. Ministers must, however, have been even more anxious about the police service, already damaged by a series of miscarriages of justice. Evidence from the opening weeks of the tribunal hearing left an impression of police life at extreme variance to the professionally managed public service that the government and senior officers are trying to create. Ms Halford, the first woman to reach the rank of assistant chief constable when appointed to the Merseyside force eight years ago, failed in nine subsequent attempts for further promotion. She claimed that the failures were a result of sex discrimination and began her industrial tribunal action. Mr Eldred Tabachnik QC, for Ms Halford, told the opening of the tribunal that her professional competence and commitment to the job were beyond challenge. But the 'woefully inadequate and ramshackle' promotion system to which Ms Halford was subjected, suggested Mr Tabachnik, provided fertile ground for 'personal dislike, prejudice, hostility and personal discrimination to flourish'. The tribunal then heard Ms Halford describe Sir Kenneth Oxford, her former chief constable at Merseyside, as having a management style that was 'plain outright rude'. She claimed he had treated her like a dog, describing him as aggressive and dogmatic. Mr Sharples, the present chief constable, was described by Ms Halford as having been devious and two-faced. It is not unknown for industrial tribunals to hear such antagonistic evidence after a breakdown in workplace relationships. Some of the evidence in the Halford case, however, was on a different level - claims of a conspiracy involving the special branch and the home secretary to bug Ms Halford's office and home telephone. Ministers will be relieved that yesterday's agreement removes the prospect of further such allegations. The settlement will not please those in the police service who saw the tribunal as an opportunity for its promotion procedures, particularly as they affect women, to be exposed to public examination. Women officers complain that they were until recently prevented from undertaking many operational roles - denying them the full range of experience needed for the highest posts - and that they are disadvantaged by the service's macho values. The state of relationships between Ms Halford and her Merseyside colleagues, whatever the cause, always made it unlikely that the tribunal could become a forum for the calm examination of such topics. Even before the case reached the tribunal, Ms Halford had been suspended from duty on disciplinary grounds - an action later set aside by the High Court - and subsequently suspended again. The question of whether sex discrimination prevented one of the most senior women ever to have served in the British police getting to the very top remains unanswered.</p>

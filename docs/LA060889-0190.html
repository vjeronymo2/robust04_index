			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> 3% RENT INCREASE APPROVED  </P> <P> The Santa Monica Rent Control Board has reversed itself and increased the  amount by which landlords can raise their rents.  </P> <P> Voting 3 to 2, the board last week rejected its own earlier decision to  authorize a 2% rent increase and instead will allow rents to go up by 3%.  </P> <P> Some members of the board, hearing bitter complaints from landlords, apparently  became convinced that a 2% increase was unfair and proposed the higher rate.  Board Chairwoman Susan Packer Davis and member Wayne Bauer stuck to the 2%  raise but were outvoted.  </P> <P> The increase will take effect in September. Under Santa Monica's stiff rent  control law, landlords are permitted to raise rents once a year by the amount  the board decides based on a formula.  </P> <P> A 2% raise would have been the lowest in the 10-year history of the city's rent  control. Increases have averaged at 4.5% annually for the last decade.  </P></p>

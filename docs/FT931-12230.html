			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Technology: A flash for sore eyes - Worth Watching Stewart Spinks, manager of a Norwich photographic store, got so upset about the number of customers complaining that their compact cameras caused 'red eyes' that he decided to do something about it. His solution is a clip-on flash unit in which the flash bulb is far enough from the lens to prevent the problem - caused by light bouncing off the back of the subject's retina. The Spinks unit, which is to be manufactured and distributed by Jessop of Leicester, clips on to the camera case and a cover fits over the camera's integral flash unit. A photo-electric cell in the cover senses when the integral flash goes off and then triggers the attached flash unit. Jessop: UK, 0533 320033.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Vietnam opens up more oil exploration blocks VIETNAM has opened up four more oil blocks off its southern coast to exploration by foreign companies, PetroVietnam, the state oil company, said yesterday. Mitsubishi of Japan, the Astra Group of Indonesia and British Gas are the latest companies to reach provisional accords in a region which is attracting increasing interest from foreign oil producers, as they seek to replace their reserves. Bidding for the final block was still going on, PetroVietnam said. Lasmo, the independent UK oil producer, announced last week that it had won a joint tender with C. Itoh, the Japanese trading company, in the same area. That was followed this week by an announcement from British Petroleum and Statoil, the Norwegian state-owned oil company, that they had formally confirmed a production-sharing contract with PetroVietnam for a concession offered in the first licensing round. Vietnam has now allocated nine of the 10 blocks south-east of the southern coastal town of Vung Tau to foreign bidders. The blocks were originally to be explored by Vietsovpetro, a joint venture with the Soviet Union, but were handed back to Vietnamese control a year ago, after Hanoi complained that Moscow lacked the technology to develop them.</p>

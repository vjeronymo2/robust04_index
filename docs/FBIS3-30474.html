Under the pretext of looking for arms, the  Serbian police maltreated Shaip Avdullahu and his nephew, Aziz  Arifi, from the Prelez village, though they had no arms. The  Serbian police inspectors questioned the DLK [Democratic League  of Kosova] activist, Mustafe Aliaj, asking him on how the DLK  spends its money and if the DLK is buying arms. The DLK  Information Commission in Mirash reported that Serbian police  has recently searched 10 houses and confiscated the arms for  which the owners had a permit. The Human Rights and Freedom  Defence Commission in Ferizaj reported that a Serbian couple,  Petar and Mira Gavriloviq, has broken into the house of Pajazit  Gjoni although he has a contract for it since 1984.</p>

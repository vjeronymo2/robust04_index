			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: T&amp;N shows 56% advance to Pounds 63m WITH UK performance bouncing back thanks to increased efficiency, T&amp;N increased pre-tax profits by 56 per cent from Pounds 40.4m to Pounds 63m in the year to end-December. Trading profit gains of nearly two thirds in the UK and 30 per cent in the US lay behind the improvement. Turnover in the motor components and engineering group rose slightly to Pounds 1.39bn (Pounds 1.36bn). T&amp;N held an uncovered dividend for the second year running. A final of 7.25p kept the total at 10.85p compared with earnings per share of 6p (2.75p). The retained loss after the Pounds 47.5m dividend bill was Pounds 21.3m (Pounds 36.3m). Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive, confirmed the likelihood of nearly Pounds 40m being raised in a share placing this spring. This would pay the first DM90m (Pounds 38m) instalment on the DM250m acquisition of Goetze, a German components maker. As Goetze, which is trading at about break-even on Pounds 300m-plus sales, will bring in nearly Pounds 50m debt, T&amp;N's gearing is set to rise from 45 per cent to about 60 per cent this year. Mr Hope said that with the German market 'facing a dramatic downturn for two years or so', the outlook was darker than when the decision was taken to buy Goetze. However, 'our ability to put the company right increases as the market gets worse,' he said, referring to the humbling effect on the German workforce. T&amp;N is already losing money in Germany, although Pounds 2m of the Pounds 2.8m deficit last year was related to redundancies and other rationalisation costs. Losses of Pounds 1.5m were also made in Italy. Suppliers were caught between government-induced wage rises and a squeeze on prices by Fiat. Overall continental trading profit slipped to Pounds 8.9m (Pounds 9.2m), made mainly in France. The UK provided a contrast, with trading profit up from Pounds 27m to Pounds 43.9m on flat turnover of Pounds 531m (Pounds 534m), of which nearly half was exported. In North America, where T&amp;N acquired JPI in 1990, trading profit advanced from Pounds 15.7m to Pounds 20.4m on sales of Pounds 333m (Pounds 318m). That region's profitability still fell short of the Pounds 21.5m (Pounds 20.7m) achieved in Zimbabwe. South Africa also improved, from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 9.6m. COMMENT The step towards better margins was a welcome one as T&amp;N continues to spend on many fronts: acquisitions, plant, R&amp;D and dividends, with the last still attracting the most criticism. It would do remarkably well to reach its target of 10 per cent return on sales by 1994 with Goetze bringing little short-term profit. Counting in the whole purchase price sends gearing to more than 70 per cent. Even if T&amp;N succeeds in selling off Goetze's flats and forests, a rights issue looks on the cards for 1994. After all, Mr Hope can still see gaps in the global empire, and last year's deterioration in net debt of Pounds 36m (or Pounds 70m after the adverse currency swing) was a bit disappointing. This year's pluses should include further US and UK recovery and rationalisation benefits to offset the continental downturn. A pre-tax profit forecast of about Pounds 75m, earnings of 9p, gives a prospective p/e of 21 reflecting recovery hopes. The attractive yield of 7.7 per cent may be tempered later in the year if doubts grow about its maintenance.</p>

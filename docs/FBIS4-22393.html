			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [ARMENPRESS report: "NKR Has Always Shown Good Will"] </F>   [Text] Commenting on the reports being disseminated in the  mass media of Azerbaijan concerning 4,000 Azeri prisoners of war  and hostages and gross violations of international laws  committed against them by the Armenians, the chairman of the NKR  [Nagorno-Karabakh Republic] commission for such questions,  Aleksandr Agasaryan, noted that all of them, especially the  statement from the chairman of the State Commission of the  Azerbaijan Republic, Namik Abbasov, concerning experiments  conducted on Azeri prisoners, were untrue.    This can be attested to by delegations from the  International  Red Cross organization "Physicians Without Borders," legal  defenders, and jurists who had free access to all the places  where the prisoners of war and hostages were kept. They can also  confirm that all the Azeris who were released were in normal  psychological and physical condition. Letters from their  relatives were even delivered to them.    Incidentally, as A. Agasaryan noted, previously the NKR  commission had suggested to its Azeri colleagues that it send  the aforementioned commission to Karabakh to find out the real  state of affairs.    The Azerbaijan side currently has about 1,000 Armenian  prisoners of war and hostages who are mainly citizens of Russia,  Ukraine, Belarus, and other CIS countries who were captured in  the conflict zone. Many of them are being kept in nonstate  institutions or are in the hands of private individuals, which  extremely complicates the process of exchange. At the same time,  representatives of international organizations accredited by the  NKR are certainly not always given an opportunity to visit  Armenian prisoners of war and hostages.    But, A. Agasaryan noted, in spite of all kinds of  difficulties caused by the corresponding structures of the  neighboring republic, the NKR government has repeatedly shown  good will and adherence to the principles of coordination and  compromise in solving problems of this area. This is also shown  by the unilateral transfer of 69 prisoners of war and hostages  to the Azerbaijan side.</p>

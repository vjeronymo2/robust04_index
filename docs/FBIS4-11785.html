			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen] </F>   [Excerpts] Sources in Jerusalem are concerned that the  entrance of the international force into Hebron will create  difficulties, but Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin this evening said  he hopes this is an exceptional and one-time arrangement.

[passage omitted]    The PLO gains three things from the international presence:  international recognition in the special problems of Hebron;  interference with Israeli activities in the city; and receiving  something that Israel sharply opposed from the beginning. The  PLO also received a promise to accelerate the withdrawal process  from the Gaza Strip. [passage omitted]</p>

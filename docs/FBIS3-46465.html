			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Fanny Wong] </F>   [Text] Outgoing Secretary for Constitutional Affairs,  Michael Sze Cho-cheung, said yesterday he would have no regrets  if his support for political reform cost him his job after 1997.  Speaking on the day that he stepped down from the  constitutional post, a hot seat which made him a constant target  for mainland criticism, Mr Sze said he had a clear conscience  about everything he had done. He played down the personal  attack on him by top Chinese official Lu Ping.    Mr Lu, the Director of Chinese State Council's Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office, questioned Mr Sze's legitimacy to  represent the people of Hong Kong at the British parliamentary  Foreign Affairs Select Committee hearing. Mr Lu said: "How  many people in Hong Kong regard this `loyal' follower (of  Patten) as a Hong Kong person?"    But Mr Sze said yesterday that he had never claimed to  represent Hong Kong people at the meeting. "But I am a Hong  Kong person. I have a Hong Kong identity card, and I am a  permanent resident here. I have a clear conscience, and it is  perfectly legitimate that I say that I am a Hong Kong person,"  he said.    Mr Sze said the criticisms levelled against him did not  bother him because he believed he was only doing his duty as a  civil servant. "I think I have done nothing against my  conscience, and I will continue to try my best to fulfill my  duty as a civil servant.    "I believe that. after 1997, the central Government and the  Special Administrative Region (SAR) government will also want  their civil servants to have the same work attitude instead of  having officers looking over their shoulders while doing their  work."    Asked how he would feel if his comments led to him being out  of a job after 1 997, Mr Sze said: "I wouldn't feel it's such a  pity. I will continue to try my best to fulfill my duty.    "From now to 1997, there are more than 1,200 days. There's a  saying that a week is a long time in politics, and I think 1,200  days is a very, very long time indeed," said Mr Sze.    He said the attack on former executive councillor Sir  Sze-yuen Chung by patriarch Deng Xiaoping in the early 1980s was  much more serious than that against him. "If the attack on Sir  Sze-yuen was equivalent to typhoon signal No 10, mine is just  about No 3. Now Sir Sze-yuen is highly regarded by both the  Chinese Government and the Hong Kong administration."    Mr Sze takes up the post as Secretary for the Civil Service  on Tuesday. He will be succeeded by Nicholas Ng Wing-fui. Mr  Sze said it was important the Government soon begin to discuss  with China the arrangements for top officials to serve beyond  1997.    Turning to the 1994-95 elections, Mr Sze said he felt  frustrated that he was not able to see the partial electoral  bill through the Legislative Council [Legco] before stepping  down as constitutional chief. It is expected that the remainder  of the bill will be tabled to Legco on March 9 at the earliest,  but Mr Sze declined to confirm that. Instead, he noted that the  tabling of the rest of the bill would be an extremely difficult  task. He also declined to be specific on which version of the  electoral package would be tabled to legislators.</p>

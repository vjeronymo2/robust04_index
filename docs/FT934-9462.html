			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan slides on decline in telecoms sector BOURSES remained nervous at the beginning of yesterday's session, but expectations of further consolidation in German stocks were not borne out at the end of the day, writes Our Markets Staff. On the credit side, bargain hunting lifted Paris after last week's losses, and unexpectedly low producer price inflation figures from the US gave sentiment a boost in the afternoon. MILAN was unnerved by a sharp early fall in Sip, the domestic telephone operator, and the Comit index finished 10.22 or 1.8 per cent lower at 546.38. Sip was briefly marked down 10 per cent in early trading before picking up to finish L156 or 4.7 per cent lower at L3,140. Stet, the state holding company, lost L170 or 4.4 per cent to L3,699. Mr Roberto Condulmari of Giubergia Warburg commented that the sector appeared to have been depressed by reports that AT &amp; T was seeking a pact with French and German telecommunications groups, and that Italian companies were not involved, together with EC pressure on the Italian government to speed the granting of a licence to a second mobile telephone operator. However, Mr Condulmari doubted that this was enough to account for Sip's sharp early fall, which he thought was more likely to be the result of an error in pricing a block of 50,000 shares which were offered by a brokerage. FRANKFURT's DAX index fell to 2,005.82 during trading, the third session in a row where the blue chip indicator had dropped to within a few points of the 2,000 level. However, it recovered to close 12.02 higher at 2,022.83, and the Ibis indicated Dax rose further to 2,040.74 by the end of the post-bourse. Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt said that after the DAX held again above 2,005, some funds bought futures, and then the impetus moved into the cash market. The reason was a rally in the bond markets in both the US and Germany following the US PPI figures. Turnover rose from DM7.4bn to DM7.8bn. Ms Altmann said that, just as stock did not appear when the market was falling early in the day, there was no really big buying during the recovery after hours. Short covering, she said, was having more effect on share prices. ZURICH bounced higher, the SMI index adding 51.8 or 1.9 per cent to 2,727.1, with an already positive tone improved by Wall Street's firm opening. Mr Frederick Hasslauer of Bank Oppenheim in Zurich said that strong foreign demand had re-emerged from the US, Britain and Germany for blue chip issues at their lower levels after the market's recent correction. Chemical stocks, hard hit last week, were among the main gainers. Roche certificates added SFr170 or 3 per cent to SFr5,900, matching their record close. Sandoz added SFr150 or 4.1 per cent to SFr3,850 and Ciba-Geigy bearers were SFr20 higher at SFr825. Motor-Columbus added SFr95 or 6.5 per cent to SFr1,550. Kleinwort Benson, rating the stock a buy, commented last week that the group's radical restructuring was set for completion six months ahead of schedule, in mid-1994, and the process was driving a financial turnaround, with the company now refocused on its energy business. Kleinwort valued the new Motor Columbus stock at SFr2,020, which implies a rise of 30 per cent from current levels. PARIS was also boosted by the release of US data after languishing without much enthusiasm at the opening. The CAC-40 index finished up 28.10 or 1.3 per cent at 2,112.89. Turnover was a moderate FFr3.3bn. There was interest in stocks which have been adrift of recent general gains, while LVMH was helped FFr10 higher to FFr3,551 after Remy-Cointreau, up FFr8.90 to FFr210.40, announced better-than-expected first half figures. UAP put on FFr15 to FFr642 helped by the appointment of a new chairman in the lead up to privatisation, as well as favourable brokers' reports. AMSTERDAM strengthened on good rises in major issues and in spite of a further decline in Akzo which shed Fl 4.80 to Fl 180.30. The CBS Tendency index put on 0.3 to 136.0. The speciality chemicals group closed just above its placing price of Fl 180 which wasannounced in the morning. Akzo has announced that it will place the new shares with a total value of some Fl 1.3bn to finance its acquisition of Nobel industries of Sweden. Unilever remained strong ahead of results later this week, the stock attracting buy recommendations in the meantime, and it closed Fl 4.70 stronger at Fl 216.00.

Vice-Minister of Justice Wang Julu said at a news conference  today that the move is aimed to promote the cooperation and  exchange between the mainland lawyers and lawyers from those  areas.    "This will provide legal service for the economic exchange  and cooperation between the mainland and areas of Taiwan, Hong  Kong and Macao," Wang said.    It is also a reform measure for China's lawyer system, he  added.    This measure is responding to requests by lawyers and legal  experts from those places to know the mainland legal system and  legal background, he said.    The requests come as China is to resume its sovereignty over  Hong Kong and Macao, and the pace of unification across the  straits is being stepped up, Wang said.    They asked for permits to take part in the national lawyer  qualification test and obtain mainland certificates, so that  they can defend "certain cases under certain regulations,"  according to Wang.    Residents from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao must meet the  same  requirements as residents on the mainland to participate in the  test, the vice-minister said.    They include that the candidates must endorse the  Constitution of the People's Republic, have no criminal record,  no serious mental illness or other serious illness, and are  above the age of 23.    One exception was made on credential qualifications due to  the different legal and educational systems in these areas.    The Justice Ministry decided that those with college  credentials issued by China's State Educational Commission are  allowed to take part in the test.    Wang said that his ministry will run training seminars for  residents from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao to enable them to  have a systematic knowledge of China's legal system.    He said a "Chinese lawyer training class" will be held in  Hong Kong on January 17 this year jointly by the National  Examination Center on Lawyer Qualification, the Law School of  the People's University of China from Beijing and Shu Yan  College of Hong Kong.    He said that people from those areas who passed the test  will  be licensed to practise after the required practical experience  and passing proficiency assessments.</p>

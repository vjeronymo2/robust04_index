			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed reply to reader's letter under the ``Briefing </F> for the Readers'' rubric: ``The 1,641th Underground Hiroshima'']    [Text] Will China's recent underground nuclear explosion  not encourage Russia and the United States to carry out new  nuclear tests?    [Signed] S. Boychenko, Lipetsk    The underground test in the PRC of a nuclear explosive  device  with a yield of 80-90 kilotonnes carried out 5 October last year  has indeed complicated the situation. So far the leading  nuclear powers have abided by their voluntary unilateral  commitments to refrain from such actions ideally until the  signing in 1996 of an agreement on a complete ban on underground  nuclear explosions. Tests in the atmosphere, in space, and under  water were banned earlier by the international treaty of 1963.    However, the members of the ``nuclear club'' decided not to  follow China's example and will continue to observe the  moratorium on underground explosions although both Russia and  the United States proclaimed a little over four months ago their  readiness not to hold such tests only so long as the other great  powers refrained from them. So far only the leadership of  France has expressed the theoretical possibility of staging a  series of tests in the period up to 1996.    As of now the nuclear powers have officially given notice of  2,166 nuclear test explosions (954 by the United States, 936 by  the USSR, 192 by France, 44 by Britain, 39 by China, and one by  India). Of that number the 1,641th nuclear device has now been  detonated underground at the test sites shown on the attached  map. [Note: A map accompanies the article showing test  sites at Nevada, Mururoa, Novaya Zemlya, Semipalatinsk, Lopnor,  and the Tar desert]    As far as is known, neither Russia nor Britain intends to  detonate even those test charges that they have stored in  underground galleries: In Russia's case at the test site in  Semipalatinsk, in Britain's at the U.S. site in Nevada. So let  us hope that 1994 becomes nuclear-free at least on the territory  of the main nuclear countries.</p>

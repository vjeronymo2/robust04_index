			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [RITZAUS BUREAU report: "Iceland Hits Out at Norway in </F> Fisheries Conflict"]    [Text] Reykjavik -- The Icelandic Government decided at a  cabinet meeting yesterday "to condemn in the strongest terms"  the Norwegian coast guard's methods used against Icelandic  fishing vessels inside the so-called protection zone around  Svalbard.    A press statement from the Prime Minister's Office says,  among other things, that instead of taking the Icelandic boats  into port and bringing Icelandic seamen before Norwegian courts  -- or taking the Svalbard conflict before an international court  -- the Norwegian coast guard is resorting to the same methods  which have so far only been used by Greenpeace.    This was a reference to the international environmental  organization's at times militant methods at sea.    At the cabinet meeting the government also decided to ask  foreign experts in international law to evaluate Iceland's and  Norway's legal positions in the so-called protection zone off  Svalbard.    On the basis of their investigation the Icelandic Government  will reach a decision on a possible complaint to the  International Court in The Hague.    The decision for a legal investigation, the statement goes  on  to say, was made because so far the Norwegian Government has  refused all negotiations about Iceland being granted fishing  rights off Svalbard.    The Icelandic Government also promises to assist those  fishing boat companies which want to bring actions against the  Norwegian authorities for the loss of fishing equipment off  Svalbard because Norwegian coast guard vessels have cut trawl  cables.    The Icelandic Foreign Ministry will, for example, help the  national association of fishing boat companies, LIU [expansion  unknown], to employ a lawyer to prepare the cases.</p>

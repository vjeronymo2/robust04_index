			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed RKX: "Tobback Criticizes New Netherlands </F> Asylum Policy"]    [Text] The Hague, 1 Apr (ANP) -- The tightened-up  Netherlands policy on asylum amounts to a panic measure. These  were the crushing words aimed at the Netherlands Cabinet by  Belgian Interior Minister Louis Tobback on Friday [1 April] in  an interview with Netherlands radio. Tobback, who is the  Belgian coordinator for asylum-related policy, does not believe  it is realistic on the part of the Netherlands Cabinet to try  and send asylum seekers back to the respective country which  first took them in, which is often Belgium. Moreover, he says  that he is certainly prepared to consult with both the  Netherlands and Germany on the possibility of an early entry  into force of the Schengen Accord. In the Netherlands, the  population appears to be convinced that the government cannot  cope with the asylum problem any longer, that the government no  longer has the situation under control, and that the problem is  getting out of hand, claims Tobback. Consequently, he warns the  Netherlands Government about this, saying: "If that is the  case, then you are lost, because that is when panic reactions  occur; then you will have extremist reactions."    Tobback claims that sending asylum seekers back to the  country which first took them in is neither a tenable nor a  workable solution. Furthermore, he does not want to let himself  to be tied down to such an approach by the Netherlands. "Anyone  who reaches Belgium via an overland route comes from either  France or Germany, or from the Netherlands or Luxembourg. So, I  can send all those asylum seekers back again straight away,  because only 5 percent of all asylum seekers arrive at Zaventem  Airport. No more than that. So you see, that is one extreme of  the argument. In this way, we will always only be passing them  on to the next country."    The plan drawn up by Netherlands Secretary of State for  Justice Kosto to have flying brigades operating behind the  borders, was also forcefully rejected by Tobback. According to  him, such flying brigades will not help matters. "If one of us  takes action against illegal immigrants, then the other will  merely find themselves saddled with more illegal immigrants."    Tobback's criticism comes a few days after Netherlands  Development Aid Minister Pronk -- albeit in slightly less  caustic tones -- openly criticized the policy of the Netherlands  Cabinet. Pronk also spoke of a panicky policy, saying that  although he appreciated that the more foreigners come to the  Netherlands, the more supervision is required, "if you suddenly  start talking about much more than just 1,000 extra policemen,  then you are going to give rise to the impression of some sort  of panic that definitely will occur."</p>

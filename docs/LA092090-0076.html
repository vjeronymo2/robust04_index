			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: LOS ANGELES;  </P> <P> ARTS COUNCIL PROGRAMS  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Arts Council, a nonprofit organization dedicated to filling  cultural needs in the city, has created several programs for local artists who  are not represented by commercial galleries.  </P> <P> Citing the lack of venues for little-known artists, the council has invited  local artists to submit samples of their work for possible display in its  programs.  </P> <P> These include art-in-business spaces, which places art in and near where people  work; an annual art auction; a sculpture walk; an upcoming exhibit featuring  women artists from culturally diverse backgrounds, and a gallery space in the  Century City Shopping Center.  </P> <P> Artists who would like to be considered should submit a minimum of 10 slides  and a resume to the council at 10250 Santa Monica Blvd., Suite 194, Los Angeles  90067. For further information, call (213) 552-3539.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT HUENEME;  </P> <P> SEARCHERS UNABLE TO FIND DIVER, 27  </P> <P> U.S. Coast Guard and Navy officials suspended at sundown Sunday a search for a  scuba diver reported missing from a boat four miles off Port Hueneme.  </P> <P> The 27-year-old Oregon man, whose identity was not released pending  notification of relatives, was with friends on a 26-foot pleasure boat when he  made the dive about 11:30 a.m., apparently to search for pieces of a sunken  boat in 80 feet of water, said Petty Officer Robert Beals of the Coast Guard's  Long Beach station.  </P> <P> The man's diving tank contained enough air for a 30-minute dive, Beals said. A  companion on the boat sent out a distress signal when the diver failed to  surface after 1 1/2 hours, Coast Guard officials said.  </P> <P> A Coast Guard helicopter and two cutters were joined by a helicopter from the  Point Mugu naval station in the search, which was hampered by three- to  four-foot waves and winds up to 25 knots, Beals said.  </P> <P> Coast Guard Petty Officer Jim Schweikhardt said officials "searched the area  thoroughly and we couldn't locate him." There were no plans to resume the  search today, he said. ADRIANNE GOODMAN  </P></p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Decline at Micro Focus prompts 18% share fall Shares in Micro Focus, the Berkshire-based computer software company, fell 18 per cent - from Pounds 10.63p to 865p - after first-half figures well below both market expectations and last year's result. Profits before tax for the six months to July 31 fell from Pounds 7.8m to Pounds 4.7m. Earnings per share came out at 32.9p, against 53.5p. Analysts yesterday cut pre-tax profit estimates for the full year from more than Pounds 22m to about Pounds 15.5m, giving a prospective p/e of about 12. Opinions in the City differed on whether the company should have flagged the extent of the shortfall earlier. In May, it had taken the unusual step of issuing an encouraging first-quarter statement. Mr Paul O'Grady, chairman, said that no warning had been made because the company did not know the full extent of the profits decline until the end of the half year. Historically, the company finishes the first half with a surge, but this had not taken place this year. He said: 'The overall revenue growth of 6 per cent, combined with a planned increase in costs of 23 per cent, resulted in a decrease in earnings for the half.' Revenues were Pounds 42.9m, compared with Pounds 40.8m. Total costs and expenses, however, rose to Pounds 36.9m compared with Pounds 30.1m. No dividend will be paid, in line with company policy. Micro Focus is undergoing a painful transition. Its early success was based on software which made it simpler for programmers to write Cobol, the most common mainframe computer language. At one time its shares reached Pounds 30, driven by US investment. The mainframe market is in decline, however and, following an adverse brokers' report last year, US interest waned. Only about 20 per cent of the stock is now held as American Depositary Receipts, compared with 40 per cent two years ago. The company has been investing heavily to take advantage of new markets for networked computer systems. Mr O'Grady said that more than half the company's revenues now came from products for the more modern technologies. He agreed, however, that the current year was unlikely to improve or match the Pounds 21.7m pre-tax achieved last year. Mr O'Grady said investment would be maintained, but moves were in progress to tighten financial controls. Mr Brian Reynolds, a co-founder, had returned to an active role in the company. Few, if any, companies can change their technological raison d'etre without damage. Mr O'Grady promised to give investors an update on progress at the end of the third quarter.</p>

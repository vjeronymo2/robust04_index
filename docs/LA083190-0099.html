			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FASHION ISLAND MALL WILL GET NEW MANAGERS;  </P> <P> RETAIL: THE OPERATOR OF FANEUIL HALL MARKETPLACE IN BOSTON AND SOUTH STREET  SEAPORT IN NEW YORK CITY WILL RUN THE COMPLEX FOR THE IRVINE CO.  </P> <P> The Rouse Co., which operates Faneuil Hall Marketplace in Boston, South Street  Seaport in New York City and other well-known shopping venues, will manage the  Irvine Co.'s Fashion Island mall in Newport Beach, the companies said Thursday.  </P> <P> The companies recently signed a 10-year management contract with options to  renew. Rouse replaces Donahue Schriber, a Newport Beach developer that oversaw  the recent renovation of the mall. How much Rouse will be paid was not  disclosed.  </P> <P> Rouse, of Baltimore, has also worked for several years with the Irvine Co. to  develop a big mall at the company's Spectrum industrial park at the junction of  the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways in Irvine. But the mall project has been  delayed because the Irvine Co. has been unable to sign up enough department  stores for anchor tenants.  </P> <P> Donahue Schriber is a developer of shopping centers and malls around Southern  California, including two centers in Tustin that the company is developing for  the Irvine Co.  </P> <P> Donahue Schriber officials say the company is no longer interested in managing  the Fashion Island mall because it generally does not like to manage other  firms' properties on a long-term basis. And, the developer says, it's busy with  its other development projects, including the Irvine Co.'s Tustin Marketplace  shopping center, which is still expanding.  </P> <P> Rouse, the largest publicly held developer in the nation, operates 78 malls and  shopping centers.  </P> <P> It specializes, though, in splashy retail centers such as Faneuil Hall and  South Street Seaport, in which old downtown buildings are renovated and filled  with stylish shops that appeal to tourists as well as local residents.  </P> <P> Rouse will assume management of Fashion Island on Sept. 1. The company named  Richard Oliver, the general manager of the company's Owings Mills, Md.,  shopping center, to manage Fashion Island.  </P> <P> The 200-store Fashion Island, built in 1967, had been losing sales to the newer  and glitzier South Coast Plaza mall in Costa Mesa for years. Both of the malls  cater to affluent shoppers with stores such as Neiman Marcus at Fashion Island  and Tiffany's at South Coast Plaza.  </P> <P> The Irvine Co., a giant Newport Beach-based landowner, began renovating Fashion  Island several years ago, and the new version recently opened.  </P></p>

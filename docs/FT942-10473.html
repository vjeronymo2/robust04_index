			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (11): A spanner in AVA's works Dave Williamson gives short shrift to the 'briefcase merchants' of the International Monetary Fund, and other advocates of Kenya's recent switch towards the economic liberalisation which he believes has helped to undermine his company. 'They are quite happy to travel here first class and sit in a five-star hotel in Nairobi where they can get good meals and draught beer without ever seeing the country,' he says. 'They're totally divorced from what Kenya actually needs.' It is a criticism he also levels at some Kenyan politicians, who he feels have often been reluctant to come and see the effects of their policies and practices on the operations of Associated Vehicle Assemblers (AVA), a part government-owned and entirely Kenyan-based vehicle assembly plant. Mr Williamson is works director of AVA, based in Mombasa, which assembles up to 40 different types of car and truck on contract. The company was founded in 1977 with shareholdings from the state-controlled Industrial Development Bank, the treasury, Lonrho and Inchcape (which later sold its stake to Marshalls). Production volume peaked in 1987 with just over 9,000 units assembled. Last year it had slumped to fewer than 1,500, with staff numbers cut from a high of nearly 700 in 1979 to 152. 'If we go any lower, we're in serious trouble,' he says. Yet AVA says it is still making a profit. It has done so primarily by cutting staff and maintaining a pay freeze for three years. In the past few months the plant has also been closed for weeks at a time to save costs. However, the company's combined bill of corporation, pay-as-you-earn, local authority taxes, duty and VAT has in many years equalled or exceeded the recorded level of pre-tax profits. What Mr Williamson most objects to is the fact that, while AVA produces locally with Kenyan staff and Kenyan investors cars tailored for the local market, what he calls 'the disaster' of liberalisation seems primarily to have benefited car importers. He resents the 'privateers' in the informal sector who, he believes, avoid paying any duties or taxes on cars. Some claim imported cars are for personal use, and others that the vehicles are secondhand, making them subject to lower duties. 'There are an awful lot of new-looking Mercedes driving around with old number plates on,' he says. 'On the day in the budget last year when they changed the duty structure to allow the importation of commercial vehicles, the ro-ro ships started arriving,' he says. 'There was a dramatic change. The cake was suddenly divided into a million pieces rather than a thousand.' Equally, he says that very few Kenyans have sufficient income to buy cars, while those that can tend to favour anything built overseas to local manufactures. Attempts to export to African countries have proved equally frustrating with reluctance by its neighbours to buy from a direct rival. AVA encompasses a number of low-technology approaches. It has refused to switch from packing crates to container boxes for parts arriving by sea, for example. He says crates are more flexible, cheaper to freight, and can be simply stored outside at the factory. To meet the demands of the car manufacturers, AVA has computerised storage of the 40,000 components which arrive each day. 'The only other thing computerised is payroll - and I still think we could do that as easily by hand,' he says. Periodic electricity shortages during the afternoon means that the company has now shifted all working hours into the morning and lunchtime to avoid power cuts. While it takes five times as many staff-hours to assemble a car in Kenya than a western assembler, Mr Williamson is sceptical of the value of automation - particularly when he says he can obtain and train high quality staff to do the work unhurriedly.</p>

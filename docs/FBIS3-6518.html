			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] In the page one article of SAIGON GIAI PHONG  entitled The Struggle Against Corruption Must Be More  Resolute and Well-Coordinated, author Huynh Thanh Lam  revealed that after 230 inspections and 282 investigations  carried out in the anticorruption campaigns in Ho Chi Minh City,  losses due to corruption have been pegged at 150.39 billion dong  and $757,730; 824 ounces of gold; and 353,000 square meters of  land.    The Anticorruption Steering Committee of the city, however,  affirms that the number of corruption cases which have been  uncovered is still far below its actual number. The noteworthy  points drawn from the uncovered cases so far are that corruption  activities nowadays do not exclude any particular areas, and  that bad elements in various levels cooperate and protect each  other. Many new forms of corruption have emerged, transforming  state-owned property into private ones.    The City Anticorruption Steering Committee admits that there  have been cases where corruption suppression activities were not  timely, resolute, and just. The recovery of property, which had  been lost to corruption, is still inadequate. Meanwhile the  handling of complaints and denunciation is too slow, and the  rectification and consolidation of the state management  structure to prevent corruption are unable to match the demands  of the new situation.    Generally, comprehensive measures to effectively detect,  handle, and prevent corruption in Ho Chi Minh City have yet to  develop. We cannot solve the problem hastily since the battle  against corruption is a long and complicated one. But, we need  more resolute and well-coordinated measures right from the  beginning. We need to eliminate conditions that nurture  corruption such as authoritativeness, and we need to constantly  improve our structure, policies, and legal systems as our  economy changes to a market-oriented one.</p>

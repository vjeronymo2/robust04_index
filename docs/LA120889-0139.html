			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> GRAD RETURNS WITH PEP TALK FOR LATINOS  </P> <P> It has been 18 years since Jess Araujo was a student at Rancho Santiago  College, in what he called his jeans-and-tennis-shoes days.  </P> <P> Araujo, this time wearing a tailored, dark blue suit, returned to the campus  Wednesday for a reception in his honor. Araujo is now a successful Santa Ana  attorney, businessman and author of a newly published book titled, "The Law and  Your Legal Rights." The book, in both Spanish and English, offers practical  advice on issues including immigration, housing and renter's rights.  </P> <P> "I wanted something that Spanish-speaking people could use as a simple source  of information for helping them out," Araujo said.  </P> <P> While the reception was to introduce the book, Araujo directed his comments to  the college students, most of them Latino.  </P> <P> "Although I was born in El Paso, my barrio was no different than yours, and if  I can become successful at what I do, so can you," he told the students. "You  remember all those dichos (axioms) your parents and grandparents used to tell  you in Spanish? You know, that stuff they told you about working hard now when  you're young? Well, they're true. Hard work does pay off."  </P> <P> It also helps to find a mentor such as Araujo found in former tennis coach Lee  Ramirez, who now teaches English at Rancho Santiago.  </P> <P> Araujo said that in Ramirez he found someone he could talk to about personal  things.  </P> <P> "Because of Lee, I want to make a promise to you," Araujo told the students.  "If you ever need anyone to talk to, for whatever reason, please call me.  That's the least I can do for you because I owe it to this college and Lee  Ramirez."  </P> <P> One student, Amelia Melgoza, a mother of two, walked up to Araujo, introduced  herself and asked him a question that had been puzzling her.  </P> <P> "I wanted to know how hard it was for somebody like me, who is bilingual, to  succeed in law school. He laughed. He told me I'm fortunate because I can speak  both languages and not to worry, I'll succeed."  </P> <P> Another student, Veronica Garza, 21, said she copied down Araujo's telephone  number and intends to call him when she needs to talk to someone.  </P> <P> "We're in the middle of finals (exams) right now, and I needed to hear a  Chicano speaker like him. I needed to hear someone tell me that if he did it,  then I can do it," Garza said.  </P> <P> Proceeds from Thursday's sale of Araujo's book will help establish a student  scholarship.

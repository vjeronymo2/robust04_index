This airplane has a novel or unusual design feature associated with the main cabin aisle arrangement. Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 were issued on July 9, 1991, addressing this unusual arrangement, and included a limitation on passenger capacity. The applicant has requested that the special conditions be amended to increase the passenger capacity limit from 29 to 30 passengers. Since the special conditions were issued the applicant has changed the company name and revised the model number of the airplane. This amendment of the special conditions should also reflect these changes. Since the applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this particular design feature, this notice contains the additional safety standards which the Administrator finds necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before October 3, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on this proposal may be mailed in triplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Transport Airplane Directorate (ANM&hyph;100), Attn: Docket No. NM&hyph;53, 1601 Lind Avenue SW, Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; or delivered in triplicate to the Transport Airplane Directorate at the above address.

The Model 4100 was to be a derivative of the Model 3100, which is a small airplane and is certificated under the provisions of part 23. Like the Model 3100, the Model 4100 was a low wing, twin engine turbo-prop design. The fuselage was stretched, however, to seat 29 passengers in a three-abreast arrangement. Since the Model 4100 airplane had the same fuselage cross section as the Model 3100, it did not have a traditional main cabin aisle arrangement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 25.815 species the minimum aisle width dimensions for transport category airplanes based on the passenger capacity. For airplanes with 20 or more passenger seats, a minimum 15-inch width at heights 25 inches or less above the main aisle floor and a minimum 20-inch width at heights greater than 25 inches above the floor must be maintained. Aisle width is measured at any point along the aisle, normal to the centerline of the aisle. The main aisle envisioned by the regulations would run in a straight line from one end of the passenger cabin to the other and would satisfy these width criteria. Long standing FAA policy has permitted slight deviation from a straight line where there is a transition from one cabin section to another, or where there are interior features which dictate that the aisle move laterally. For example, from tourist class to first class there may be a change from five-abreast seating to four-abreast seating which moves the aisle centerline laterally. This has been accepted provided the required widths are maintained at all heights normal to the path that an individual would take. This type of offset normally occurs at one or two points in a main cabin aisle. In addition, there is no offset permitted in the aisle vertically; that is, the required 15-inch dimension must lie completely below the projected 20-inch dimension at all points along the aisle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Jetstream main cabin aisle arrangement utilizes an offset at each seat row. The left and right seat assemblies are offset from one another longitudinally such that the seatbacks are not opposite each other across the aisle. This arrangement permits a 20-inch measurement between seatbacks (at an angle to the airplane centerline) and the required 15-inch dimension is maintained within the projected 20-inch dimension vertically. Thus the ``required aisle'' is not a straight line from one end of the cabin to the other, but a series of alternating angular segments from seatback to seatback. Nonetheless, there  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> is <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a straight path along the cabin length, and the aisle floor does not deviate from side to side at all. The projected aisle width along this straight path reaches 20 inches at a height of 43 inches above the floor, which is the typical seatback height for transport airplanes. Another feature of the design includes the use of overwing exits which are offset longitudinally, corresponding to the seat positions on the left and right of the airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to provide design standards for the novel and unusual aisle configuration in the BAe Model 4100 airplanes, the FAA issued Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 on July 9, 1991. The criteria used to develop Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 utilized the existing regulations, and made certain favorable design features in the Model 4100 mandatory. Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 are summarized as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. There are no more than 29 passenger seats with no more than ten seat rows on either side of the aisle; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. The interior arrangement includes one pair of Type II and one pair of Type III passenger emergency exits; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. In addition to the requirements of &sect;25.815, the projected aisle width is at least 20 inches measured at a height of 43 inches above the aisle floor; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

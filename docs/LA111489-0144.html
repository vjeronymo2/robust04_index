			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POST-BUYOUT CUTS PUT MICOM BACK IN THE BLACK;  </P> <P> COMPUTERS: THE SIMI VALLEY-BASED MAKER OF COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT SAYS LAYOFFS  AND COST-CUTTING LED TO PROFIT.  </P> <P> Last year, Micom Communications was a company in trouble. The Simi Valley-based  concern was losing money and employed too many managers for its needs, yet was  still uncertain about its strategy for the future.  </P> <P> But in the past year, Micom, which makes devices that allow computers to "talk"  to each other and share information, has been overhauled.  </P> <P> New management took over, 36% of Micom's work force was laid off and overhead  costs were slashed. Micom, with sales expected to total $85 million this year,  says it's profitable again and expects growth with some new products, even  though its parent company showed a loss in the quarter that ended June 30.  </P> <P> The changes were triggered when Micom Communications was taken private as part  of a $334-million leveraged buyout of the former Micom Systems in September,  1988, by the New York investment firm Odyssey Partners.  </P> <P> Micom also has a new corporate parent, Black Box Inc., which Odyssey Partners  named for Black Box Corp., a Lawrence, Penn., mail-order business for data  communications products that was Micom Systems' most profitable company.  </P> <P> Under the Black Box umbrella, the Black Box catalogue business and Micom  Communications are the only remaining operations. Three other former Micom  Systems units were sold by Odyssey Partners for a total of $82.4 million.  </P> <P> Micom Communications had no choice but to scale down. In a leveraged buyout, an  acquisition is paid for with borrowed money and the debt is paid off with cash  from the acquired company's operations or by selling off pieces of the firm.  Black Box still has about $200 million in debt left from the buyout, Micom  said, requiring interest payments of $21 million this year. But Micom asserted  that cash generated from its business and that of the catalogue company should  cover that bill.  </P> <P> Even though Micom was losing $2 million to $4 million a year when it was  acquired, Odyssey held onto it because "they felt if we could get this business  under control and manage it efficiently, this could be a real turnaround," said  Gilbert Cabral, Micom's president and chief executive. Cabral, who formerly  headed Micom's manufacturing operations, is the only remaining member of the  previous management team.  </P> <P> After the buyout, Cabral cut the work force by more than 400 -- the company  presently employs 711 -- and disbanded the firm's direct sales force. He closed  manufacturing plants in Mexico and the Far East, consolidated manufacturing in  California and Puerto Rico and is in the process of selling and leasing back  the company's Simi Valley headquarters. In all, he reduced costs by about $17  million a year.  </P> <P> "It was ugly," Cabral said of the cutbacks. "But a cost structure had been  built up that was too excessive for the company." He said he expects Micom to  earn 7 or 8 cents per dollar of sales before taxes in the current fiscal year.  </P> <P> Yet despite trimming down, the company faces a more daunting challenge: It must  continue to bring out new products that will allow it to compete in a  marketplace where technological innovations happen so fast that products  introduced just a few years ago might already be obsolete.  </P> <P> "There's this evolution, so if you don't have a product, somebody else is going  to get the business," said Steven D. Levy, an analyst with the investment firm  Hambrecht &amp; Quist in New York. "If everyone's going to diet soda, you'd  better have a diet soda."  </P> <P> Micom's main product lines include devices that allow companies to save phone  line costs by squeezing more data onto one line and equipment that lets  computers "talk" to each other electronically. Micom aims for the less  expensive end of those markets with about 300 products ranging from $80 to  $250,000.  </P> <P> But overall demand for Micom's bread-and-butter products has leveled off as new  technologies have been developed. While Micom is still holding onto its  traditional product lines, which Cabral says still produce steady sales, he  hopes the company's growth will come from new products that it plans to begin  shipping next month.  </P> <P> These include equipment that transmits voices and data on the same phone line  and products that save money by allowing data to flow through one of several  alternative routes.  </P> <P> The voice-data technology, which can cut a company's phone bills by half or  more, has already taken hold among Fortune 500 companies. But Micom is gearing  its versions of the products, priced at $4,000 to $6,500, to smaller companies  that use phones extensively. It is a new market in which Republic Telcom in  Boulder, Colo., is the biggest player.  </P> <P> Jennifer Sleek, a marketing and communications specialist for Republic, said  Republic doesn't fear Micom. "They're still back at square one," she said.  </P> <P> Still, Larry Cynar, an analyst at Dataquest, a market research firm in San  Jose, said Micom might have latched on to a growing market in the early stages.  "It's got more risk associated with it than going into a business that's  known," he said. "But then again, the potential for them is to grab a big  market share if it turns out to be a bigger market than I can foresee right  now."  </P> <P> Mark Vonarx, Micom's vice president of sales and marketing who left the company  in 1985 but returned last year after the buyout, projected sales of Micom's new  voice-data products will total $5 million this year and $10 million next year.  </P> <P> How did Micom foul up in the first place? In the late 1970s and early 1980s,  Micom captured a large share of the low-capacity, low-priced end of the market  for computer communications equipment. But in 1985, "a wall was hit and the  business started declining," Cabral said. Part of the decline was due to an  overall market slowdown, but it also was because the company had diversified  into higher-end products and was not paying enough attention to its main  business, he said.  </P> <P> The previous management "was basically milking the core business" to pay for  the new product lines, said Barry Phelps, a Micom employee since 1987 who was  elevated to chief financial officer after the buyout.  </P> <P> Micom Systems' earnings declined from $22.1 million on $194 million in revenue  in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1985, to $9.8 million on revenue of $218  million in the fiscal year ended April 3, 1988, the last full year the company  was public. Its stock fell from a record high of $49.75 in 1983 to $6.50 in  late-1987. When a dispute erupted among directors over the company's direction,  the decision was made to find a buyer.  </P> <P> After the buyout, Odyssey immediately sold Micom Digital, a Herndon, Va.-based  data communications products firm that was Micom's biggest money-loser, to  Telematix for $9.65 million. Interlan, a Boxborough, Mass., manufacturer of  high-speed communications equipment that links computers in one building, was  sold to Racal Interlan in May for $58 million. Micom Borer, the firm's United  Kingdom subsidiary, was purchased by Tricom Group in May for $15 million.  </P> <P> Odyssey split the remaining subsidiaries into two independently run businesses.  Black Box, the catalogue company, is considered the industry standard for  mail-order computer parts and was consistently profitable even through Micom's  bad times. Gene Yost, Black Box's president, said he expects the company to  post more than $100 million in sales this year, a 20% gain from last year.  </P> <P> According to documents filed last summer with the Securities and Exchange  Commission in connection with an offering of debt and equity, the parent  company, Black Box Inc., lost $2.6 million on revenue of $169 million in the  fiscal year ended March 31, and lost another $732,000 on $46 million in revenue  in its fiscal first quarter ended June 30.  </P> <P> Though Phelps said Odyssey is satisfied with Micom's performance so far, a  former Micom executive, who asked not to be identified, said it's likely that  Micom Communications will be sold within a few years. "The guys that bought it  are basically financial buyers," he said. "In general, those buyers aren't long  term."  </P> <P> Brian D. Young, Black Box's president and an Odyssey general parter, did not  return phone calls seeking comment.  </P> <P> Cabral is concentrating on trying to bring the company back to a sense of  normalcy after the upheaval of the past few years. He's instituted such  programs as quality education classes, paid out companywide bonuses and calls  all employees "team members."  </P> <P> These efforts have helped to improve morale, Cabral said. "People are back to  work in this company, whereas before they were more concerned about what was  going to happen to Micom," he said.  </P></p>

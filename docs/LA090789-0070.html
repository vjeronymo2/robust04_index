			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BORDER PATROL AGENT KILLED, PARTNER HURT IN SHOOT-OUT  </P> <P> An undercover Border Patrol agent was shot to death and his partner wounded  early Wednesday as they tried to arrest four suspects involved in smuggling  illegal aliens from Mexico, police said.  </P> <P> A police SWAT team surrounded a residential neighborhood near the shooting  scene and captured the four suspects, one by one, with the last apprehended  after dawn.  </P> <P> Keith Connelly, 42, an 18-year veteran of the Border Patrol, died shortly after  arriving at Valley Medical Center. Agent Ted Jordan, 42, a 17-year veteran,  underwent surgery for a bullet wound to the chest and was in critical but  stable condition at the same hospital.  </P> <P> Connelly and Jordan were Border Patrol special agents and members of a U.S.  Immigration and Naturalization Service anti-smuggling unit. They were posing as  employers willing to pay cash in exchange for an undocumented worker, said Alan  Dwelley, deputy chief Border Patrol agent.  </P> <P> The undercover agents, who claimed that they needed a farm worker, had agreed  to pay the suspects about $500, authorities said.  </P> <P> An informant introduced the agents to the suspects, one of whom was a woman, on  Saturday. They set up a meeting for Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Connelly and Jordan met the suspects at 1:30 a.m. Wednesday in the parking lot  of a service station-convenience store. Two other agents were parked nearby as  backup, Dwelley said.  </P> <P> "As the agents were in the process of making the arrests, things went sour,"  Dwelley said. "The suspects began firing, and both agents were shot."  </P> <P> The two backup agents exchanged fire with the suspects as they fled, two on  foot and the others in a car, which they abandoned a few blocks away.  </P> <P> A Fresno Police Department SWAT team and Kern County sheriff's deputies sealed  off a four-block area and began searching house to house.  </P> <P> The female suspect was found about an hour after the shootings, and two others  were found shortly before dawn. The final suspect was discovered about 7 a.m.  </P></p>

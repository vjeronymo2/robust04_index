[end recording]    Silva Cimma met President Patricio Aylwin for more than an  hour to discuss the issue. Asked if the Argentine publication  somehow constitutes undue Argentine pressure on the judges who  will decide the Laguna del Desierto dispute, Silva Cimma said:    [Begin Silva Cimma recording] It does not really represent  pressure, perhaps a precedent. We thought it was our duty to  note it officially, despite the fact that the brochure was not  really published by the Argentine Government, as you all know.  The document was issued by a provincial authority, the  equivalent of a Chilean intendant or governor. We are  investigating it. It seems that it is not even an official  document but something published by the province without that  character. In any case we are investigating the problem, and we  already have presented a note describing the situation to the  Arbitration Tribunal. [end recording]    So far the government has not received any answer, which is  obviously expected. [passage omitted]</p>

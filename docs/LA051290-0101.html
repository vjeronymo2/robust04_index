			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA PLAN BLASTED AS DONOR 'EGO TRIP';  </P> <P> EDUCATION: STATE BOARD PRESIDENT SAYS MOST AT CAMPUS DO NOT WANT TO MOVE  ELEMENTARY LAB SCHOOL TO SANTA MONICA. LAND WOULD BE USED FOR GRADUATE SCHOOL  FINANCED BY $15-MILLION GIFT.  </P> <P> The president of the State Board of Education said Friday that UCLA's  controversial plan to move its on-campus laboratory elementary school to Santa  Monica results from an "ego trip" by Los Angeles attorney and businessman John  E. Anderson.  </P> <P> Anderson has given the university $15 million to build a new Graduate School of  Management on the lab school site on Sunset Boulevard.  </P> <P> Board President Joseph D. Carrabino, who is an emeritus professor at UCLA's  management school, told the monthly meeting of the state board that most  teachers, parents and alumni do not want the lab school to be moved but that  Anderson insisted on a "choice location on Sunset Boulevard" for the graduate  school that bears his name.  </P> <P> To make this possible, Carrabino said, UCLA officials decided to move the lab  school to Ocean Park, at the southern end of the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified  School District.  </P> <P> "It's a big ego thing, nothing more," Carrabino said.  </P> <P> Attempts to reach Anderson were unsuccessful.  </P> <P> The State Board of Education was discussing the matter because some state  policy issues might be involved if the Corinne A. Seeds University Elementary  School is transferred from the UCLA campus to a public school district.  </P> <P> UCLA Executive Vice Chancellor Murray L. Schwartz said, "It's not true that we  are moving UES (University Elementary School) in order to make room for the  Graduate School of Management."  </P> <P> In a telephone interview, Schwartz said, "This is not a done deal, but we are  contemplating it" because UCLA education researchers could do more to solve  American public education problems in a regular school setting than in the  secluded campus lab school.  </P> <P> If UCLA and the Santa Monica-Malibu district reach an agreement, the UCLA  Graduate School of Education faculty will continue to run the school but it  will be financed by the state.  </P> <P> If the deal falls through, "we can continue UES on the present site," Schwartz  said.  </P> <P> However, he warned that eventually the crowded, 450-acre UCLA campus will not  be able to afford the luxury of operating an elementary school for only 450  youngsters on a nine-acre site.  </P> <P> Dean J. Clayburn La Force of the Graduate School of Management said "there's  not a shred of truth to the claim that we're eliminating the elementary  school." He said "only a part of the southern edge of the (UES) campus" would  be needed for the new buildings.  </P> <P> La Force also denied that Anderson had insisted on a "choice location" on  Sunset Boulevard for the school.  </P> <P> When Anderson gave the $15 million in 1987, it was the largest single gift from  an individual to any University of California campus.  </P> <P> La Force said he "could not imagine" why Carrabino made his remarks.  </P> <P> State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said UCLA Chancellor Charles E.  Young called him to ask if there were legal barriers or other problems involved  in shifting the lab school to Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Honig directed staff members to look into it because, "if the university,  regardless of the right or wrong of it, makes a request, then we have an  obligation to help clear the way."  </P> <P> But Honig and state board members soon ran into a hornet's nest of criticism,  in letters and phone calls, from opponents of the lab school move.  </P></p>

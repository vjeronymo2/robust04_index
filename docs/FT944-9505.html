			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Bonds: EIB finds firm retail demand for Dollars 200m of four-year paper With the market occupied by the outcome of today's US FOMC meeting, there were only a few small-sized new eurobond issues yesterday, aimed mainly at retail investors. Attention this week is likely to be focused on the Republic of Italy's Y400bn three-tranche offering of bonds, of three-, 10-and 20-year maturities, expected to be launched mid-week. In the dollar sector, the European Investment Bank launched a Dollars 200m offering of four-year paper priced to yield seven basis points over US government bonds. Syndicate managers said that the offering was expensive compared with existing four-year paper, such as the EIB July 1998 which is currently trading in the secondary market at around 17 basis points over the yield curve. However, lead manager ABN Amro reported firm demand from retail investors in Switzerland and the Benelux countries. The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate pesetas, market sources said. In the yen sector, INI Finance launched a Y30bn issuer of five-year bonds targeted mainly at Japanese institutional investors. The bonds offered a spread of 29 basis points over Japanese government bonds. After completing a series of roadshows in Asia, Germany's Bayerische Landesbank is poised to launch either a dragon bond or eurobond, Lehman Brothers said. Lehman has been mandated to lead a deal of up to Dollars 500m, although the exact terms will depend on market conditions following the FOMC meeting, syndicate officials said. The Australian and Canadian dollar sectors saw continued activity yesterday. New South Wales Treasury Corporation launched a ADollars 100m offering of three-year bonds, which were sold mainly to Japanese retail investors, lead manager Nomura said. Nomura said it was promoting Australian dollar debt to Japanese investors. The coupon of 4.5 per cent offered particularly good value compared with three-year Japanese bank deposits, which currently offer 2 per cent, it said. Rabobank Nederland launched a CDollars 125m offering of six-year bonds priced to yield 11 basis points over Canadian government bonds. Lead manager Wood Gundy expects most of the bonds to be taken up by Swiss and Benelux retail investors. The proceeds were swapped into floating rate US dollars, sources said. JP Morgan led a multi-currency offering of collateralised two-year floating-rate notes denominated in dollars, D-Marks and Swiss francs, for SMM and reported demand from investors across Europe. There is strong demand for floating-rate D-Mark assets in particular, an official said. Ceske Energeticke Zavody (CEZ), a Czech power utility, is said to be planning a debut Dollars 100m to Dollars 150m eurobond, in a deal lead-managed by JP Morgan. CEZ, the largest company listed on the Czech stock exchange, is rated BBB- by Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>

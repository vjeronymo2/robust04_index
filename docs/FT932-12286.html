			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Superdrug intensifies high street price war SUPERDRUG intensified its price war against rival high street retailers yesterday by announcing an immediate 25 per cent price cut on two thirds of all branded sun-care products sold in its 680 shops. Prices of the remaining third of such products will be reduced by a quarter in the next few weeks. The price cuts will remain in force through the summer. This latest shot in the battle for the sun-care products market - worth Pounds 110m at retail prices - follows Boots' April 24 attempt to obtain an injunction preventing Superdrug, a part of the Kingfisher group, from selling its new Solait range of products. Boots said that Superdrug's Solait was in several respects an imitation of its own sun-care range, called Soltan. A legal hearing is likely in the next few weeks. The sun-care price war extends the battle between Superdrug and Boots over fragrances. Superdrug said it achieved a 1.5 per cent market share in the fine fragrance market - worth a total Pounds 450m at retail prices - last year.</p>

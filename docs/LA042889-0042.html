			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'STEALING HEAVEN' UPDATES HELOISE AND ABELARD  </P> <P> There is something fascinatingly retrograde about the movie "Stealing Heaven,"  (Westside Pavilion). Set in 12th-Century France, it's based on the legendary  affair of Heloise and Abelard. But instead of the year 1118, or yesterday, the  movie suggests the '60s: decade of turbulence, idealism, sex and riot.  </P> <P> The film, shot in Yugoslavia, apes the style of the big '60s costume pictures.  And writer Chris Bryant paints the lovers as a quintessentially '60s pair:  long-haired beauties trapped in a cloistered society, battling the hypocrites  and meanies, the crooked parents, frigid nuns, cops, sneering churchmen, who  want to stifle their passion.  </P> <P> "Heaven's" Peter Abelard (Derek de Lint) is a charismatic teacher who drinks  with his students and encourages them to question orthodoxy. And Heloise (Kim  Thompson) looks like a pseudo-hippie rich girl, Burne-Jones mixed with  Haight-Ashbury, blasting convention at every opportunity, twitting her  twitching uncle Fulbert (Denholm Elliott) about his phony religious relics.  </P> <P> One thing that doesn't peg this film as a '60s product is the unblinkered  sexuality. The eroticism and the ideas get overripe early on. Bryant has the  pair getting hot for each other by discussing philosophy; they leer over  theological ripostes, as if each juicy premise were a chicken thigh from Tom  Jones' banquet seduction. There are more bad ideas: such as the scene where  Abelard's rascally students plant a naked prostitute in his bed. And another  where a group of nuns is thrown out of the convent by a heartless bishop; as  they go struggling up a hillside in the rain, one of them lugs a 6-foot wooden  cross. (Couldn't they wait and pick up a cross at the next convent?)  </P> <P> By the time we get to the crucial episode, Abelard's castration by the  hirelings of crazy Canon Fulbert, it's played with incongruous (for here)  restraint, as if the mutilation purged him of passion, making him a photogenic  male saint, like Gregory Peck in "The Keys of the Kingdom."  </P> <P> All of the characterizations are hard to swallow, but the actors are easy to  watch. De Lint glows with dedication, Thompson tosses her great Cosmo  cover-girl mane ravishingly. Elliott is a fine, squirrelly, sweating villain;  he seems capable not just of castration, but of sneaking in and pulling hairs  out of your nose in the dark.  </P> <P> The director of "Stealing Heaven," Clive Donner, may be nostalgic. He made his  best known and most admired films in the '60s: "The Caretaker," "Nothing But  the Best" and "What's New, Pussycat?" -- which, unfortunately, may have typed  him as a king of high-style naughty camp. But, here, Donner shows some feeling  and style. There is a grating soft-rock score, but the images look  incongruously rich. The clever production designer Voytek, who did Polanski's  "Cul De Sac," shows us Notre Dame in mid-construction, and Mikael Salomon's  cinematography is crisp, burnished and deep; full of plush interiors,  mist-draped forests and hills.  </P> <P> True to '60s type, "Stealing Heaven" (MPAA rated R for copious nudity, sex and  strong language) attacks repression as evil. But, what's beautiful about the  story is the fruit of repression: the letters the lovers wrote after their  passion was frustrated and which the movie rarely bothers to quote. In a  different key, made with either the chaste austerity of a Robert Bresson or the  flamboyant screwiness of a Ken Russell, the film might have worked. In this  middle ground, it becomes over-pretty, comic. The lovers turn into  scamp-saints, exiled from a Zeffirelli movie into one by Zinnemann: "The Nun's  Story" with an emasculated theologian as suffering swain. MICHAEL WILMINGTON  </P></p>

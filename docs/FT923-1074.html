			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Ford UK and Rolls-Royce announce 2,500 job cuts BRITISH carmakers added to the government's economic woes yesterday with the announcement of a further 2,500 redundancies. Ford, the leading UK vehicle maker, announced plans to cut 1,487 hourly paid jobs at its British car assembly and engine plants and forecast that its European operations would make a loss for the year, after struggling back into profit in the first half of 1992. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the heavily lossmaking luxury car subsidiary of Vickers, the engineering group, is cutting 950 jobs, or nearly a third of the workforce, at its plant at Crewe, Cheshire. The latest round of redundancies at Rolls-Royce, which should be completed during December, will have reduced its UK workforce by 57 per cent, from 4,850 at the end of 1990 to 2,100. The company said compulsory redundancies appeared inevitable. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said yesterday that 70,000 jobs had been lost in the British motor industry, including vehicle makers, dealers and component suppliers, by spring of this year since the start of the recession. Yesterday's job cuts 'show that our worst fears have been realised', Mr Geoffrey Pelling, general manager of the SMMT said last night. The latest job cuts come as Honda and Toyota, the Japanese carmakers, are poised to open their first European car assembly plants, both located in the UK, and as Nissan is doubling its annual UK car production capacity to 300,000. Ford warned that it was planning further action to reduce production and cut jobs throughout its European operations because of weakening demand, not only in the UK but also in Spain, France and Italy. In the UK around another 60 salaried jobs are expected to be shed. The company is cutting daily production volumes at its Dagenham and Halewood car assembly plants by 17 and 23 per cent respectively in addition to measures for three- and four-day working weeks already announced to run to the end of October. Ford's UK workforce had fallen from a peak of 80,000 in early 1980 to 39,500 by late last year. It is expected to have shrunk to less than 34,900 by the end of 1992. The job cuts at Ford and Rolls-Royce follow other big reductions announced recently by Jaguar, Aston Martin and Group Lotus and the loss of more than 500 jobs at AWD, the UK truckmaker which went into receivership in the summer. Unions reacted angrily last night to the fact that compulsory redundancies appear inevitable at Ford for the first time. The company offered a tough alternative package, including a six-month delay in pay increases, in return for making the redundancies purely voluntary. Mr Jimmy Airlie, chief Ford negotiator for the AEEU electrical and engineering union, said: 'Ford workers are paying the price for the government's criminal economic incompetence.' The Ford package called for a six-month deferment of the 5 per cent wage rise due in November, a reduction in lay-off pay from 100 per cent of the basic wage to 60 per cent from November 1 to the end of 1994, and a delay in increased funding of non-work related employee training. Mr Jack Adams, deputy general secretary of the TGWU general union, said: 'They have had a proud boast for 25 years or so that nobody has been compulsorily laid off. This comes on the back of huge efficiency gains by the British car workers.' Honda workforce, Page 7 Lex, Page 18 Vickers payout cut, Page 19</p>

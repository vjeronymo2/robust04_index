			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 REBEL FORCES ADVANCE AGAINST DOE IN LIBERIA  </P> <P> Competing Liberian rebel groups advanced on two fronts against President Samuel  K. Doe's executive mansion Friday, and one group claimed it narrowly missed  killing him in an ambush.  </P> <P> Rebels led by Prince Johnson fortified positions in Monrovia's city center  while men under command of his rival, Charles Taylor, advanced in the capital's  eastern suburbs.  </P> <P> Both groups were maneuvering in a last-ditch bid to topple Doe before West  African peacekeepers arrive to impose a cease-fire.  </P> <P> Johnson claimed his men narrowly missed assassinating Doe on Thursday when they  ambushed his car less than a mile from the mansion, the report said.  </P> <P> "I saw Doe with my own eyes," said a rebel who gave his name as Battlefield. He  said he fired at Doe's blue Peugeot near the Defense Ministry.  </P> <P> Doe on Thursday accused U.S. Marines of trying to assassinate him, but the  State Department in Washington denied the charge.  </P> <P> Journalists saw Taylor's soldiers push through Monrovia's eastern suburbs  toward the fortress-like mansion where the besieged president is clinging to  power.  </P> <P> Johnson also was quoted as saying his men had beaten back an attack by 100  Taylor rebels on his rear flank near Monrovia Free Port.  </P> <P> "If Taylor brings 50 million men, I don't care," Johnson said. "If they are not  tactically trained, they run away."  </P> <P> Taylor, whose 10,000 fighters represent the largest army in the country, is  opposed to intervention by the West African force.  </P> <P> The peacekeepers, meanwhile, were mobilizing in five countries. They planned to  sail into Monrovia from neighboring Sierra Leone, but no date for their arrival  has been announced. Nigerian forces were expected to leave for Sierra Leone  today.  </P> <P> In Monrovia's Congo Town suburb on Friday, two rockets hit St. Joseph's  Catholic Hospital, according to a radio communication from relief workers. It  was not known if anyone was hurt.  </P> <P> More than 100 ambulatory patients fled the hospital, according to a spokesman  for a European relief agency.  </P> <P> Doctors in Monrovia said Taylor has ordered everyone to leave the hospital.  </P></p>

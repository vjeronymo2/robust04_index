			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington--It has been ascertained that the United  States, which regards Turkey's contacts with Iraq as a violation  of the embargo on that country, has purchased oil from Iraq  because it is cheaper. The records held by the U.S. Congress  contain information that confirms that the United States and  Jordan have violated the UN sanctions against Iraq in order to  provide humanitarian aid to northern Iraq. A statement by Lee  Hamilton, head of the House Subcommittee on Europe and Middle  East Affairs, has been placed on record. It is as follows: "It  is all right for Jordan and the United States to violate the  embargo, but it seems that we do not want anyone else to do the  same."    While the officials of the U.S. Defense and State  Departments  briefed the subcommittee on the U.S. policy on Iraq, Hamilton  asked: "The Accounting Office, which is affiliated with the  Congress, has claimed that we acquire oil from Iraq. Is that  right?"    Ronald Newman, head of the State Department's office for  Iran  and Iraq affairs, replied to Hamilton. He said: "We acquire  the oil through mediators in northern Iraq. That is more  economic."    The views Hamilton and Newman exchanged are as follows:    [Hamilton] I was informed a short while ago that the  sanctions are important and that they should be maintained. As  far as I can see, the United States allows Jordan to acquire oil  from Iraq. Does that not conflict with our policy?    [Newman] I do not believe that it conflicts with our general  policy. The terminology we use should be clear. I do not deny  the source which supplies the oil.    [Hamilton] We are maintaining the sanctions together with  the  rest of the world. However, we have acquired oil from Iraq. Do  you disagree?    [Newman] The UN Security Council Resolution 689 contains  humanitarian provisions. We work with a limited budget."    [Hamilton] We also allow Jordan to acquire the oil it needs  from Iraq. Is that not so?    [Newman] Yes, that is right. Jordan has been receiving oil  from Iraq in return for that country's debts for some time now.  The UN Sanctions Committee has placed that on record.    [Hamilton] It is alright for Jordan and the United States to  violate the embargo, but it seems that we do not want anyone  else to do the same.    [Newman] We do not believe that we have violated the  embargo.  What we have done was for humanitarian purposes.    Hamilton also asked why they have asked for $15 million for  their aid operations in northern Iraq from the budget for 1995.  A State Department official said that the cash was required for  the basic needs of the people in northern Iraq.    Meanwhile, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Christine  Shelly  has disclosed that U.S. officials are holding talks with the  Turkish Government on the question of retrieving the oil in the  pipeline between Turkey and Iraq. Stressing that she realizes  how important the lifting of the embargo on Iraq is for Turkey,  Shelly said: "However, Washington is opposed to any initiative  against the embargo."</p>

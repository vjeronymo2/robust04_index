			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / International Company News: Puerto Rican telecoms sale approved by US THE US Federal Commun-ications Commission has approved the sale of a majority holding in Puerto Rico's long-distance telephone company to Telefonica de Espana, 10 months after the island's government said it had concluded the deal. The sale of 80 per cent of Puerto Rico's government-owned Telefonica Larga Distancia for Dollars 141.6m needed FCC approval because it breached regulations prohibiting foreign companies from owning more than 40 per cent of any US telephone company. Puerto Rico is a Caribbean possession of the US and is subject to federal regulations. The FCC reported that its approval of the sale to the Spanish company was based on the Puerto Rican administration's failure to obtain reasonable offers from US companies, and because the privatisation of the carrier promised a more competitive service. The government is retaining a 20 per cent stake.</p>

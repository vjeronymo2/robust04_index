			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOTE PROTEST HEATS UP IN SOUTH AFRICA;  </P> <P> TUTU DETAINED, STUDENTS FIRED ON AS ELECTIONS NEAR  </P> <P> Riot police fired shotguns and tear gas at demonstrating college students in  Durban, arrested and briefly detained Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu and other  leading anti-apartheid clergymen in Cape Town and halted a march on  Johannesburg's City Hall on Monday. The increasingly heated clashes with  defiant blacks came only two days before nationwide elections that exclude the  black majority.  </P> <P> While his government was cracking down on dissenters, acting President Frederik  W. de Klerk told a political meeting in Johannesburg that "discrimination must  be eliminated" and pledged his ruling National Party to "a new South Africa  which will be just and strong."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Difficult Challenge  </P> <P> It was De Klerk's final campaign speech before Wednesday's parliamentary  elections, which are considered one of his party's most difficult challenges in  nearly half a century of rule.  </P> <P> The election has been all but overshadowed, however, by a nationwide campaign  of civil disobedience, which has gathered momentum and world attention since it  began Aug. 2. Police have arrested 1,600 activists, detained 240 others without  charge, banned 14 meetings and broken up at least 46 political gatherings in  the past month, according to the independent Human Rights Commission, which  issued a report on the defiance campaign Monday.  </P> <P> As part of the defiance action, major anti-apartheid groups and the country's  two largest black labor federations have called for a two-day general strike  beginning today, and hundreds of thousands of black workers and students are  expected to join the work stoppage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Follows Rally Ban  </P> <P> The arrest Monday of Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace laureate, followed the banning  of a "free and fair elections" rally at the City Hall in downtown Cape Town,  where police and demonstrators have clashed several times in recent days.  Police have sweeping powers to ban political gatherings under the country's  three-year-old state of emergency.  </P> <P> The rally was rescheduled for a nearby Methodist church, and at least 100  officers in riot gear blocked the church doors with armored trucks and turned  activists away.  </P> <P> Tutu, the Rev. Beyers Naude, a white anti-apartheid campaigner, and the Rev.  Allan Boesak, mixed-race president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches,  were among 11 leaders who arrived at the church and "made it clear they  objected to a police vehicle blocking a church in a Christian country,"  according to Tutu's press aide, John Allen.  </P> <P> Concerned that people were trapped inside the church, the clergymen refused to  leave and were arrested. They were taken to the police station, held in jail  cells and released 90 minutes later. It was the second arrest in less than a  week for Tutu and Boesak, who have been prominent in the defiance campaign.  </P> <P> "They have gone berserk," Tutu said after being released. "They are clearly no  longer in charge, and they are aware of it. I want to say to the world that the  terrorists in South Africa are the South African government."  </P> <P> In Durban, several thousand students at the multiracial University of Natal  defied a police ban on an anti-election rally. Police arrested 13 people after  firing on the crowd with tear gas and bullets, unidentified witnesses told news  agencies. About 10 people were injured in the melee.  </P> <P> At the nearby University of Durban-Westville, police broke up a group of 500  demonstrators using batons and tear gas and arrested 11.  </P> <P> Shortly before De Klerk's speech to National Party supporters at City Hall in  Johannesburg, about 125 blacks carrying placards attempted to march to the  building and present a letter to De Klerk, "detailing our views about the  elections and the system of apartheid in this country," said Cyril Ramaphosa,  general secretary of the nation's largest union, the National Union of  Mineworkers.  </P> <P> Ordered by police to disperse, the marchers refused and sat down on the  pavement. After a 15-minute standoff, a police officer accepted the group's  letter and the crowd left.  </P> <P> The government believes the defiance campaign is aimed at triggering violence  and disrupting the elections.  </P> <P> "We are prepared to come down mercilessly and hard on anyone who wishes to  disrupt the elections," Brig. Leon Mellet, a police spokesman, said. Polling  stations already are under guard, he added.  </P> <P> </P> <P> University Closes  </P> <P> The University of Cape Town, a multiracial institution that has been the  frequent site of anti-apartheid protests, announced Monday that it is closing  its doors today and Wednesday.  </P> <P> "For the university to adopt an attitude of business as usual in the context of  the tensions surrounding the elections and the denial of fundamental freedoms .  . . would be neither principled nor possible," Vice Chancellor Stuart Saunders  said.  </P> <P> The extent of the government's attempt to crush the defiance campaign was  outlined Monday in a special report by the Johannesburg-based Human Rights  Commission.  </P> <P> "As the election nears, the government has responded with the full thrust of  its brutality and repressive machinery" to win votes, the commission said in  its report, "Days of Defiance."  </P> <P> In recent weeks, defiance campaigners have attempted to highlight apartheid  laws and severe restrictions on political expression by staging protests at  whites-only schools, beaches and bus stops and by attempting to hold peaceful  demonstrations in city centers.  </P> <P> Some of the protests, such as a march by 5,000 people on whites-only beaches in  Durban on Sunday, have been largely peaceful. But others, including an attempt  by 1,000 people to march in Cape Town on Saturday, have been broken up by  police with tear gas and water cannons in violent confrontations that have left  dozens injured.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Kochetkov] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi, 2 Apr -- Eduard Shevardnadze, as head of  Georgia and commander in chief of its Armed Forces, who at the  same time assumed the responsibilities of the country's defense  minister, held an expanded sitting of the military department in  Tbilisi today. According to information, alongside organization  and cadre matters involved in military construction, the  situation in Abkhazia was discussed.    Local observers -- comparing this report with information  received from Abkhazian sources today that there is an unusual  concentration of Georgian manpower and combat equipment on the  Inguri river separating the warring sides -- think it is  possible that a wide-scale offensive on Sukhumi might be  launched in the next few days.    It is not ruled out that the final objective will be to  reach  the border with Russia along the Psou river and take control of  the whole territory of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia.</p>

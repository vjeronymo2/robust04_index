			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Accountancy Column: Close relationships produce successful audits ON APRIL 25 this column carried a series of proposals for change in the auditing regime suggested by Mr James Leek of Caparo Industries. Similar proposals have in recent months been put forward with renewed enthusiasm by various individuals, including Mr Austin Mitchell, the indefatigable Labour MP for Great Grimsby. If we are to improve auditing rather than run the risk of destroying much that is good, we must identify the real problems, their causes and the actions needed to address them. There are three real issues. Companies occasionally fail soon after the publication of accounts that give no warning of impending disaster. Estimates and values reported in accounts are on occasion found to be badly wrong. Those suffering loss are sometimes frustrated by their inability to gain restitution. The third complaint is different in nature from the other two; any allocation of loss is properly a matter for resolution by the courts. We firmly believe that auditor independence, or rather a supposed lack of it, does not lie at the root of these ills. We are not aware of any cases in which the auditor of a public company has been found not to be acting independently of management. The strength of the UK accounting profession, its very high ethical standards, the independence and scepticism inculcated through the auditor's training - and awareness of the public need - ensure that concerns over independence are of no practical significance except in the rarest of cases. We are not alone in that view. Successive commissions and congressional hearings in the US have considered and rejected precisely those proposals for change in the audit regime which are re-emerging from some quarters. We must work together, however, to deal with the real troubles, which we identify as follows. First, and of most significance, there are difficulties in reflecting the realities of modern, complex and rapidly changing businesses in the snapshot provided by the annual report. Uncertainties over the ultimate outcome of unfinished business are often at the root of those handicaps. Some of the obstacles stem from limitations in the accounting process. The Accounting Standards Board is pursuing improvement vigorously. In particular, it is placing greater emphasis on the value of accounts for forward-looking decision makers. Management and auditors need to work together in determining how best to portray the realities of complex businesses in the annual report. The auditor faces a challenge of needing to get a close knowledge of the business and the confidence of its senior management, while retaining independence of viewpoint. Distancing the auditors from the business and replacing them regularly would only increase the likelihood that they would fail to understand and spot any shortcomings. There is a second, and far less common, problem: deliberate misrepresentation on the part of management. We cannot build an audit regime around the assumption that all management is crooked just to try to catch the tiny minority that is. In the nature of management fraud, there is rarely much to be gained by discovering it after the event. The loss will have already been incurred. What is required is to work with the corporate sector in developing a control environment that minimises the opportunities for fraud. Getting close to, but not cosy with, the company is the answer because the last thing the fraudster wants is someone of integrity getting close to his or her operations. Companies with a weak control environment are exposed to undue risk and the shareholders should be told. So much for the general nature of the issues. What specific actions can be taken to respond? Two constructive proposals were made in the Dell report sponsored by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte in 1987, entitled The Audit Judgment and its Communication. First, in response to the need to give as much warning as possible of impending trouble, we recommended that the directors' report should contain a formal statement that the directors have reviewed properly prepared internal budgets and other relevant information, and are reasonably satisfied that the company will be able to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. The auditors should be required to review that statement and to report if they believe it to be unjustified. Second, in order to ensure a control environment that minimises the risk of fraud, the directors and auditors could report on the adequacy of all the company's key financial information systems used in planning and managing the business. Care would be needed to establish a practical yet worthwhile regime. Developments on those lines are being pursued in the US. That leaves the third difficulty of those people who have suffered a loss and are seeking restitution. That is a different case because there is an important distinction between the confidence to rely on a good audit having been done and the ability to sue in the rare event that it has not. Auditors will continue to pursue the highest standards both because of the damage to their reputation if they do not and because it is open to the company to sue them for any negligence. The question of who else may be able to sue auditors if they have also suffered loss should be considered and decided in the light of developments generally in civil law. It has long been established that it would be unreasonable to expose providers of services to negligence claims from anyone and everyone who may be able to argue that a loss could in part be traced back to faulty provision of that service. There must be boundaries, and those may change with time and circumstance, but the value of the audit is in no way dependent on who can sue to recover loss in the rare event of shortcomings in the provisions of that service. I conclude that in facing up to the questions of inadequate accounts, far from distancing auditors from the company, we need a close working relationship between auditors and senior management. In the vast majority of cases, both are seeking to improve reporting, and the accounts will be better for working together. In those few where management misrepresent, the auditors will discover that more easily the closer they are to the company's affairs. Professional auditors are specifically trained to handle such relationships properly and positively - the evidence shows that, overwhelmingly, they succeed.

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Business advice bodies are criticised: Heseltine deplores 'low' standards THE QUALITY of much advice to businesses is 'too low', Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday. He added at a conference in Birmingham of Training and Enterprise Councils that providers of advice should aim for much higher standards and greater professionalism. 'Nowhere near enough Tecs, chambers of commerce, local enterprise agencies or other support agencies come close to meeting these tough criteria at present,' he said. 'Standards are simply too low across the network as a whole, and I see it very much as our joint responsibility to take the necessary action to bring these new networks into a more effective partnership.' He said the government intended to boost the establishment of 'first-stop shops' to give advice to businesses by setting up a pilot network of 15 'shops' in the autumn. He was keen to speed up the establishment of the 'shops' and iron out conflicts between some Tecs and other providers of advice including chambers of commerce. Tecs, which operate throughout England and Wales, have a role in providing advice, particularly to small businesses. Some work with chambers, but others have set up their own membership schemes, raising fears among local chambers of an erosion of their own membership income. Chambers believe Mr Heseltine's department is seeking to play a mediating role in conflicts between Tecs and chambers. The DTI has taken over some business advisory work previously carried out by the Department of Employment. The 'first-stop shops' are designed to provide central points at which businesses can seek advice on issues such as export procedures, capital-raising and compliance with health, safety and employment laws. They will also be expected to bring together the small-business responsibilities of the DTI and the Department of Employment.</p>

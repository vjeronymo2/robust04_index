			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Hague, Jan 20 (AFP) -- A French container ship  has been seized and its owners asked to pay $2.6 million  compensation after thousands of sachets of toxic pesticide were  washed up on Dutch beaches, officials said Thursday [20 January].    Transport ministry officials said the French-registered  Sherbro (eds: correct) had been docked at Amsterdam since  Wednesday evening following the discovery of the sachets during  the day Wednesday.    The sachets, which the ministry said were lost overboard in  December, contained two highly toxic agricultural fungicides.  The substances can be fatal if inhaled or ingested and can  seriously damage the eyes in case of contact.    A ministry spokesman said the Sherbro was identified with  the  help of the Lloyd's register of ships. The Sherbro is owned by  SCAC Delmas-Vieljeux, based in Dunkirk, and is insured by the  British company P and I.    The Sherbro lost 88 containers containing 500,000 sachets  last December 8 and 9, while weathering an overnight storm off  the French coast. Thousands of sachets have already been washed  up on French and Belgian beaches.    Delmas's representative here said the ministry was claiming  five million florins (about $2.6 million) in compensation to pay  for the clean up operation.    The worst of the pollution discovered Wednesday occurred  near  Amsterdam, the ministry said. Most beaches along the Dutch  coast were affected but most of the sachets were found at Velsen  and Ijmuiden near Amsterdam.    Police sealed off the beaches on Wednesday night and  clean-up  teams, equipped with protective clothing and goggles, began  cleaning up the beaches on Thursday morning.    In some spots there were six sachets per square meter  (yard),  the ministry spokesman said.    Clean up work should take two days, the spokesman said,  declining to estimate the cost. He added that two cigarette-box  size objects had also been found near Amsterdam, also from the  Sherbro.    They were being investigated to determine whether they were  detonators, he said.    The Dutch subsidiary of Swiss chemicals giant Ciba-Geigy  offered to cooperate in the operation, offering to transport the  recovered sachets and dispose of them in a specialised plant  near Rotterdam.    It said it too would seek payment for its services from the  container ship's owners, or their insurers.</p>

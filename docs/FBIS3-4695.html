Advocacy for a new strategic trade policy  is surfacing to protect high-tech industry. High-tech industry  where research and development play a major role is susceptible  to monopolies and is said to hold special significance for the  economy of any nation.    2. However, it is neither a case where firms that were  first in entering the high-tech industry realize permanent high  profits nor a case where the economic impact of such industry is  particularly significant. Accordingly, even if success were to  be realized in the development of high-tech industry through  strategic trade policies, we cannot say that such policies lead  to significant advantages for industry as a whole of the nation  in question.    3. Rather than a nationalistic approach responsive to  strategic trade policies, there is a need to take action in  terms of overall growth for the world economy. International  cooperation is important in the attainment of such a goal  through competitive policies, enhancement of market opening  measures, protection of intellectual property rights, and  research and development policies.  <H3>  National Interests Are Being Pushed to the Forefront With  Active Government Involvement </H3>   Competition under free trade served as the engine for world  economic growth in the postwar period. However, on the one hand,  there was frequent trade friction with Europe and the United  States and on several occasions controlled trade measures were  taken through self-imposed export restrictions.    Of special note is that in recent years a new movement has  surfaced in such nations as the United States in the form of  proposals for "strategic trade policies" under which they demand  the establishment of numerical goals under which they seek  expanded imports by the target nation.    Strategic trade policies place special emphasis on high-tech  industry and active involvement of the government in the  protection and development of such industries. The economic  premise for such policies rests with the belief that the rise  and fall of a nation's economy are significantly influenced by  the viewpoint that research and development play a major role in  high-tech industry.    In essence, to begin with, fixed costs in the high-tech  industry tend to be large because they require huge outlays in  research and development, and the industry is affected by  economies of scale in which average production costs are lowered  through mass production (advantage of scale). Further, as is  often said of the production of such items as semiconductors,  sustained production processes lead to increased yields and  lower production costs.    Because of such perceptions, it is thought that markets are  susceptible to being monopolized, that importance should be  placed on taking the initiative in producing high-tech items to  establish international competitiveness, and that firms taking  the lead will realize high profits as monopolistic suppliers.    Second, technology created through research and development  can be leaked to sources outside the source firm without going  through open market transactions in a variety of ways such as  interchanges among researchers at academic conferences,  departing technicians, and research based on reverse engineering.    As a result, rather than limited benefits derived by a  single  firm initiating any given research, it is felt that much greater  benefits are gained by society as a whole through so-called  external economic factors. Further, although we now address a  feature that departs from the effects derived from technical  peculiarities, we can mention the dynamic mechanism whereby we  enjoy the economic ripple effect on related industries that use  high-tech products as parts or production facilities as well as  the development of new products leading to other new products  and new technologies in other fields of manufacturing.    As an example, enhanced performance and price cuts in  semiconductors have led to improved performance and lower prices  for computers. The performance of automobiles and domestic  appliances has also been improved through the use of numerous  electronic parts. Further, progress in financial systems and the  introduction of point-of-sale systems in the distribution system  were both greatly dependent on developments in the computer  field.    The question now arises of what advantages can be derived  from the protection and development of high-tech industry.  <H5>  Need for Prolonged Subsidies Accompanied by Negative Effects </H5>   First, in addressing the monopolistic nature of the market,  we note that in much of the high-tech industry, such as  semiconductors and computers, 10 leading firms monopolize more  than 80 percent of international markets. However, firms that  took the lead in developing their respective industries do not  necessarily maintain their high initial market share  permanently. The rise and fall of new market participants occur  rapidly, thus creating many markets where competitive forces  clash intensively and dispelling any notion that early entry  into the market place is the only way to ensure competitiveness.    When competition is intense, new market entrants or the  threat of new market entrants bars the maintenance of high  profits on a long-term basis. Even the sharp drop in prices in  the semiconductor market, owing to expanded production and a  competitive market environment that calls for a drop in prices  and lower production costs, demonstrates that high profits  cannot be sustained.    In other words, even if high profits are enjoyed in the form  of creative profits by firms that succeed in developing new  products, they cannot be sustained permanently; and we see the  repetition of the cycle wherein efforts are made to create new  technologies that provide innovative, creative profits. We can  probably label the high-tech industry as one in which dynamic  competition takes place in the form of "creative destruction" as  coined by Joseph A. Schumpeter. Accordingly, even if a nation  succeeds in developing a high-tech industry, nothing guarantees  the long-term maintenance of such an advantage.    Further, some assert that the appearance of a competitor is  inspired by protection and development of industries by other  nations. However, maintaining long-term competitiveness in the  high-tech industry calls for comparative superiority of  production elements such as a good quality labor force, capital  facilities, and research and development capabilities.    As an example, it is thought that the United States is adept  at giving birth to creative new products because of its  superiority in product innovation (new product development) and  that Asian nations such as Japan are highly competitive in  producing universal products because of their superiority in  process innovation (improvements in production processes). If  such production factors did not exist, development of high-tech  industries would require subsidies forever and would negatively  affect economic efficiency of nations concerned on a long-term  basis.    Next, it is said that the social benefits of research and  development by high-tech industry are significant, but one  questions whether this is the case. If one were to assume that  the leakage of new technology leads to the creation of similar  technology in an identical industry, contributions made in terms  of technical progress (comprehensive productivity growth) will  be comparatively significant in terms of research and  development investments made in a given industry, in those cases  where the social benefits are especially broad.    No significant differences can be noted in research and  development input and output between Japan and the United States  in the areas of electronic, electrical, and precision equipment.  This fact would indicate that neither nation necessarily enjoys  any major social benefits in the area of research and  development for high-tech industries relative to other  industries.    And, as is evident in the higher utilization of high-tech  products in other industries as reflected in charts showing use  of such products among various industries, major benefits are  being realized by other industries through economic ripple  effects emanating from the use of manufactured products.  However, such effects can be realized through imported products  if low-priced, efficient products can be purchased from among  imports. As an example, during the 1980's rapid improvements in  financial systems were realized in Europe, which is relatively  backwards in terms of its high-tech industry.    Further, a look at the magnitude of the macroeconomic  influence of high-tech industry shows that the contribution made  by the electronic, electrical, and precision equipment sector to  economic growth during the 1982-1990 period was an annual rate  of 0.71 percent for Japan (with an economic growth rate of 4.69  percent), and 0.14 percent for the United States (with an  economic growth rate of 3.31 percent), both relatively modest  rates. Contributions in terms of job increases were even smaller  because of the highly productive nature of the industry,  standing at 0.13 percent for Japan and -0.01 percent for the  United States.  <H3>  Government Should Expedite Establishment of Provisions for  Private Research </H3>   Based on the foregoing discussion, one would have to admit  that even if strategic trade policies proved successful and a  nation's high-tech industry were successfully developed, the  economic benefits would not necessarily represent a major  economic advantage. Further, strategic trade policies represent  nationalistic policy actions which have been repeated since the  days of mercantilism which sought to deprive benefits  from other nations and to seek benefits for one's own nation.    The problem areas associated with controlled trade have  already been identified by various sources, but now that mutual  relationships in the world economy have deepened, greater  importance must be placed on the search for policy actions  seeking growth in the overall global economy, i.e., economic  efficiency through free competition.    In search of such a goal, it will be important for the sake  of promoting a competitive market environment in response to the  potential for monopolistic abuses 1) for all nations to  reinforce their competitive policies while ensuring  international coordination, and 2) for all nations to reinforce  market opening measures while abandoning protective measures.    As an example, a look at the automobile market in the  European Union (EU) shows that market concentrations of the  respective nations are high because each nation has assumed a  nationalistic policy, but such concentrations have diminished  owing to expansion of trade and mutual market participation  among regional nations accompanying progress made in EU  unification. Such growth in market scale enables enhancement of  competitiveness while conducting a search for the benefits of  scale.    Further, it is difficult to predict which technical sector  will produce major social benefits as a result of research and  development. Globalization of business activities and  international affiliations have increased the potential that  technology will be leaked overseas.    Under such circumstances, it is important for government to  assume a role in reinforcing and providing for conditions to  alleviate risks in the development of human capital to be used  in research and development efforts not restricted to any  specialized field as a means to provide for positive research  and development activities in the private sector.    Further, it is necessary to protect intellectual property  rights to promote research and development in the private  sector, but unreasonably prolonged protection in this area can  result in obstructing growth in the business world. Accordingly,  we should assume a balanced approach in coordinating the  international protection of intellectual ownership rights.    Further, from the standpoint of delegating responsibility  for  applied research to the private sector for commercial products  easily influenced by the profit motive, there is a need to  reinforce research and development policies and international  coordination among all nations.    Finally, in the area of international public interest such  as  academic research and basic research, governments of all nations  should become actively involved for the sake of promoting the  world economy and we should also think of the future in terms of  an international institution to support efforts in this area.</p>

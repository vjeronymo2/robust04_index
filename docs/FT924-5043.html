			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies A week after the latest half-hearted realignment, the ERM is holding together, but only just. Several factors may have helped stave off the new crisis that seemed imminent on Monday. The Irish election was a distraction. Trading was subdued by the US Thanksgiving Day holiday. Countries in the immediate firing line raised short term rates. And the French franc was bolstered in midweek by a large Far Eastern commercial order. None of this is enough, though, to obscure the fact that basic tensions in the system are unresolved. Indeed, without a background of currency strain, the Bundesbank might even have reasons for increasing rates. Money supply growth is in double digits. The latest regional inflation figures are particularly disappointing: the state of Hesse yesterday reported a year-on-year consumer price rise of 4.2 per cent. True, the emphasis could change if next week's industrial output and unemployment figures point to further economic weakness. But the Bundesbank is more concerned with inflation than offsetting the cycle. The trouble is that as long as it persists with tight money, other ERM countries must subject themselves to a deflationary discipline which defies credibility. Small wonder, then, that the French franc is again looking sickly and the Irish punt fell below its floor against the Belgian franc yesterday afternoon. It is just possible that with Christmas approaching and a good year's profits already in the bag, currency traders may decide the party circuit holds more appeal than another bout of nerve-wracking speculation. But sooner or later, something will have to give. The question is one of timing.</p>

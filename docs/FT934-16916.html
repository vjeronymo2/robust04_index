			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Arts: Damp squib Zola - Opera Faced with something as spirit-sappingly dim as Therese Raquin - the new Zola opera by Michael Finnissy which the Garden Venture is this month touring across southern and middle England - the critic committed to encouraging new work and living composers would naturally prefer to draw a veil over the whole subject. But in this case unavoidable issues are raised. After all, the record of the Garden Venture, the Royal Opera's five-year-old forcing-house for (in its own words) 'the writing and performance of new opera and music theatre in all their possibilities', is hardly encouraging; the annual programmes of short operas have regularly aroused criticisms as to overall quality and purpose, and the Venture's previous full-length opera, the 1992 Biko, was a thudder. Now comes this damp squib of a Zola adaptation, which for 90 unbroken minutes - for heaven's sake, why? an interval is desperately needed] - meanders ineffectually along the margins of a melodramatic, rawly effective 19th-century novel. At what point, one begins to wonder, in the generation of new Garden Venture projects should questions of 'quality control' be asked? With hindsight wisdom from Friday's premiere at the deliciously intimate Theatre Royal in Bury St Edmunds, I feel that, in this case, the answer is very early indeed. In the past, one of the more unpredictable, livelier and prolific figures of the English avant-garde, Finnissy (b1946) made a stirring impact with his first opera, The Undivine Comedy (Almeida Theatre, 1988). That was a turbulently original, questing piece of music-theatre. Its idiom, mixing lyrical fluency and expressionist angularity, had an often unadorned vividness that carried one over awkward or verbose patches. If I didn't know better, I would swear that the two works had been written in reverse order - that Therese Raquin was Finnissy juvenilia which deserved to be left in kindly obscurity. The composer has drawn on both the novel and its later play adaptation for his libretto, a seven-movement structure for four singers and piano. The removal of subordinate characters and party scenes and the alteration (for the worse) of Zola's sensational double-suicide ending matters a certain amount - to my mind the novel more readily suggests operatic treatment on a scale comparable to Shostakovich's of Leskov's novella, Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District. But what matters much more is that the 'private' quality of Finnissy's chosen musical idiom comprehensively fails to engage the audience in his chosen dramatic scheme. In the programme he alerts us to its 'period' touches and quotations, and warns us that the piano part is written to exist in a 'parallel universe' to the words, not as their accompaniment. In spite of the tireless playing of Christopher Willis, its effect most of the time was of an enervated pianistic key-tickling while the four singers were left to get on as best they could with their largely colourless, ungrateful, obstinately undramatic vocal writing. The single-set production (by Wilfred Judd, Garden Venture chief) is capable, although the absence of carefully defined breaks between scenes results in awkward pauses for scene-changes. The four singers were the soprano Heather Lorimer in the title role (she needs to press her words home much harder), the mezzo Linda Hirst (Mme Raquin), the counter-tenor Andrew Watts (Camille, who has the work's few moments of vocal interest) and - in the only rounded characterisation on stage - the baritone Richard Jackson as Laurent. Performances in Boston, Norwich, Leighton Buzzard, Hemel Hempstead, St Albans, King's Lynn, Stamford, Bedford, Spalding and - October 26-30 - French Institute, London SW7</p>

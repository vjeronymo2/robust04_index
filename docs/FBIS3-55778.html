Chernomyrdin and V. Kebich on the union of the two states'  monetary systems has whipped up passions even more in Belarus.  Many questions have arisen, but three main ones worry  everybody. What advantages does the republic derive from such a  union? Is it not losing its sovereignty? What will be the  Belarusian coupon's future fate?    It is difficult to answer these questions fully at present.  Let us stop and consider several points only. V. Kebich's  government has for a long time been actively striving to create  an economic and currency union, right to the point of a union of  the two states' monetary systems. When proposing ways of  extricating the republic from the social and economic crisis,  the premier recently stated: It is much easier to stabilize our  state's economy and finances by pooling our resources. All the  more so as Russia is giving us this chance.    Nevertheless a union of the monetary systems is regarded far  from unequivocally in Belarus. Especially in the republic's  parliament. A group of people's deputies, including members of  the parliamentary opposition, recently wrote in an analysis of  the situation in the newspaper NARODNAYA GAZETA that it really  will be a question of Belarus giving up its independence.    But S. Bahdankevich, chairman of the board of the National  Bank of Belarus, considers that the creation of a single ruble  zone does not threaten the republic's sovereignty and that the  danger has been exaggerated. In essence, Bahdankevich says, we  will only coordinate the budget deficit and the volume of credit  issued. But we will have full sovereignty within the framework  of these parameters. Only time will tell to what degree  Belarus's chief banker is right. But now the Belarusian ruble  will exist on the territory of the two states without let or  hindrance. During the negotiations both sides agreed on an  exchange rate of 1:1 for the Belarusian and Russian rubles.    Belarusian economic planners are also in favor of a union of  the monetary systems. Who can tell us where to find more  convenient sources of energy resources for the republic, a  consumer market which is more extensive and adapted to our  commodities output, and where to find such lenders? More than  90 percent of the energy sources and raw materials the republic  requires come from Russia. About 70 percent of Belarus's exports  are delivered to the Russian market.    There are insufficient currency and gold reserves in Belarus  to pursue its economic policy independently of its neighbors.  In short, Belarus's economy is closely linked to Russia. This  cannot be left out of the equation.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CONNORS OUT; LENDL, GRAF BOTH ADVANCE  </P> <P> Jimmy Connors was given an early exit from Wimbledon today, upset by American  Dan Goldie in the second round.  </P> <P> Goldie's 7-6, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 victory was the biggest upset of the tournament's  first three days and marked only the third time in 18 years that the  10th-seeded Connors had failed to make at least the fourth round of the  grass-court Grand Slam tournament.  </P> <P> Top seeds Ivan Lendl and Steffi Graf advanced into the third round at Wimbledon  today, while an unheralded American upset one of the women's seeds.  </P> <P> Shaun Stafford, 20, from Gainesville, Fla., ranked 78th in the world, beat  13th-seeded Helen Kelesi of Canada 7-6, 7-5 in a first-round match.  </P> <P> Also upset was men's No. 11 seed Brad Gilbert of the United States. In the  completion of a first-round match suspended by darkness Tuesday, Gilbert lost  to John Fitzgerald of Australia 6-2, 7-5, 1-6, 3-6, 6-2.  </P> <P> Most other seeds had much less trouble on a day of rain and rail strikes. Fans  struggled to the All England Lawn Tennis Club despite walkouts by subway and  railroad workers, then waited through a 3 1/2-hour rain delay.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sanchez Beats Czech  </P> <P> Arantxa Sanchez, 17, the French Open women's champion and the seventh seed at  Wimbledon, won her opening match, beating Jana Pospisilova of Czechoslovakia  6-2, 7-5.  </P> <P> Eighth-seeded Pam Shriver of the United States beat Carin Bakkum of The  Netherlands 6-2, 6-1, and 12th-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez of the United States  defeated Mary Lou Daniels 6-4, 7-5.  </P> <P> Graf took only 43 minutes to beat American amateur Kim Kessaris 6-2, 6-1. The  defending women's champion lost only five points as she went from 2-2 in the  first set to a 1-0 lead in the second. Kessaris, 16, from Hendersonville, N.C.,  held for 1-1, but Graf then won the last five games with the loss of only six  points.  </P> <P> Lendl, the men's top seed who was stretched to five sets in his opener on  Monday, dropped the first set in a tiebreaker to Sweden's Ronnie Bathman, then  rallied for a 6-7, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 victory on Centre Court.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks are recorded] </F>   [Text] Sugar Industry Minister Nelson Torres has called on  workers in the southeastern region to maintain their pledges to  fulfill their current harvest goals. Heavy rains have been  disrupting the progress of the harvest in this part of the  nation and were the main reason for the poor results achieved in  the last 10 days.    [Torres] "The order is clear: We are to continue fighting  and  have to grind the very last cane to extract the maximum sugar."    In Guantanamo, Torres chaired the 10-day progress meeting in  the southeastern region, where the host province surpassed the  neighboring provinces of Santiago de Cuba and Granma.    Torres acknowledged that the sugar harvest is the most  difficult task within the sugarcane production program. Cuba's  goal is to exceed by several hundred tons last year's harvest,  which failed to produce approximately $450 million of income to  Cuba. The persistent rains have now added to the known  difficulties in the southeastern region.    [Torres] "We can no longer ask for the same results as those  that were expected in other times; but we can look for the  maximum, the variants, to grind with the most efficiency  possible."    In this 10-day harvest progress meeting, Havana Province  cane  harvesters were praised for reaching their sugar production  goal. Also stressed at the meeting was the necessity to maintain  an elevated planting rate to ensure increased production in the  next harvest. Guantanamo Province announced that, by the end of  May, it will be the first to reach its spring planting program  of 180 caballerias.</p>

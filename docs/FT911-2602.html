			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Group of Seven: Lamont to push plan for poor nations' debt MR Norman Lamont, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, will this week seek international backing for a British plan to ease the debt burden of the poorest developing nations. The plan, known as the Trinidad Terms, is designed to cut and make more manageable the debts owed to western governments by poor nations implementing market-oriented economic policies. It was first proposed by Mr John Major, when chancellor, at a conference of Commonwealth finance ministers last autumn, and will be relaunched during the spring meetings today and tomorrow of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank with the aim of reaching agreement at the London Economic Summit in July. Under the Trinidad Terms, members of the Paris Club of creditor governments would forgive two thirds of the qualifying country's official debt and grant extended repayment terms for the remainder. Last week Mr Barber Conable, World Bank president, supported the UK plan. It is expected that the chancellor will argue in tomorrow's session of the joint IMF-World Bank development committee that action to help the poorest countries is urgent in the light of the recent Paris Club decision to forgive 50 per cent of Poland's official debt. The UK is also seeking a more influential role in the committee. The government has proposed that Mr Peter Mountfield, a Treasury undersecretary, should be the committee's next executive secretary. The committee was set up in 1974 and is made up of government representatives from developed and third world countries. Its job is to promote the transfer of resources to the developing world. The executive secretary is responsible for planning, organising and reporting on its work.</p>

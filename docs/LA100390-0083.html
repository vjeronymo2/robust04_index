			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WORLD GREETS UNIFICATION WITH CONGRATULATIONS, TREPIDATION  </P> <P> Germany's reunification was greeted with celebration and some trepidation at  home and around the globe Tuesday.  </P> <P> In a congratulatory statement to the German people, President Bush said that  "45 years of conflict and confrontation between East and West are now behind  us."  </P> <P> "We expect much of our new relations," said Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev, whose new diplomacy made the reunification of Germany possible.  </P> <P> In his message, Gorbachev did not dwell on the immense losses the Soviet Union  suffered at the hands of Germany during World War II but instead referred to it  as a lesson for all.  </P> <P> "Unification could not have taken place if there had not been profound internal  democratic changes in our countries, if the right conclusions from the tragedy  of the most horrible war had not been reflected in real life," Gorbachev said  in a telegram sent to German President Richard von Weizsaecker and Chancellor  Helmut Kohl.  </P> <P> In Brussels, the European Community warmly welcomed 16.4 million new citizens  into the 12-nation grouping.  </P> <P> "The unification of Germany opens the door toward the unity of all of Europe,"  the EC Commission said.  </P> <P> In Warsaw, some Poles expressed concern about the new economic power on their  western border.  </P> <P> "Today, just like Japan, Germany -- because of its economic power -- is more  dangerous than the Wehrmacht (the German army in World War II) or than Japanese  battalions," said Marian Podkowinski, a writer and expert on German issues.  </P> <P> Former Polish Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski said he is uneasy about an  accord with Germany that fixes current borders.  </P> <P> "I would like to be a bad prophet," he said. "But I do not exclude the  appearance, toward the end of this century, of the (renewal of) demands  concerning our western territories."  </P> <P> A poll released Tuesday by the Wickert Institute, a public opinion institute in  western Germany, said that 87.7% of Germans are happy about their country's  unification.  </P> <P> Another large majority, 92.3%, said unification would promote the growing  together of European nations, and 88.3% said it would help reduce tension in  the world.  </P> <P> But Heinz Galinsky, the chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany,  reminded the new nation of its "dreadful past" and demanded that it end "once  and for all" every form of racism, anti-Semitism and neo-Nazism.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by IZVESTIYA correspondent Sergey Zhdakayev: "Are </F> State Enterprises Good for the State? Production Democracy's  Hopes and Disappointments"]    [Text] Tula--Vladimir Dronov and Yuriy Tarasov came  to be plant top managers through the same  scenario--elections.    At the end of the 1980's, in the fashion of the times, the  combine plant was electing a director. Yu. Tarasov, who by then  was already the plant's acting general director, lost the  election. The job went to V. Dronov, deputy director of a  neighboring plant--an outsider, so to say.    Tarasov, however, survived the blow and a year later had his  revanche at the Tula Railroad Machinery Plant, coming in ahead  of seven contenders there.    Apparently, new ideas sound more convincing coming from a  new  person. Or perhaps it is true that no man is a prophet in his  own land.    Now the era of production romanticism is becoming a thing of  the past. Euphoria is being replaced by the rational, and  emotions--by calculations. At recent stockholders meetings of  the Tula Armory Plant [TOZ], for instance, the delegates  expressed no-confidence in outsiders and rather unanimously  voted for the old director, N. Maslennikov.    True, the results of the meeting are currently being  challenged. Opponents contend that the law was violated. But  this no longer incites previous passions. Commenting on these  disputes, a local newspaper offers the conclusion that "the idea  of elected management has exhausted itself. We have left this  stage behind. And democracy does not apply here."    The paper also speaks rather skeptically of privatization,  comparing it with collectivization. As to the stockholders  meeting, it goes so far as to call it "a wake for the old TOZ."  "Now it is a joint-stock company, which is doled out puny crumbs  from the budget, and the collective must look for a way out on  its own."    Does this mean that the longed-for economic independence has  lost value in the eyes of the people and even has become a cause  for condolences?  <H5>  Ruble Equivalent of Freedom </H5>   Generally speaking, the sad fate of a collective which "has  to look for a way out on its own" does not evoke particular  sympathy in the hardened hearts of the public. Therefore a trump  card in the arguments against privatization is that it allegedly  impoverishes the state, depriving it of its riches, the  treasury--of revenue, and the people--of social protection.    This argument seemingly even is supported by the economic  situation. The year 1994 began with delays in payments to  budget-financed organizations.    But is privatization the culprit? In Yu. Tarasov's opinion  the reverse is true. "When I came to Zheldormash [railroad  machinery plant], the plant was nothing but a burden for the  state, producing 11 million rubles [R] of output and not  contributing a kopek to the treasury. Because there was only one  type of tax then--profit tax. At the same time, it received R1  million a year from the treasury in the form of subsidies. Since  converting to joint-stock holding we have not received a kopek  from the budget, while we paid more than R1.5 billion last year  alone in the form of taxes. So I ask: Which is better for the  state?"    It was exactly privatization, in Yu. Tarasov's opinion, that  provided the plant with an incentive to modernize production.  The Zheldormash put into production new track-repair machines,  which the railroad industry has "accepted" and gladly buys, and  opened a new furniture production facility, creating 300 new  jobs in the process. A considerable part of the profit goes into  expansion of production. In the environment of general decline,  Zheldormash increased its output by 20 percent. It managed to  allocate some money for social needs as well: It built a  144-apartment house, purchased two buildings in a recreation  facility on the Oka River, and built a heated stadium and soccer  field.    Of course, the insolvency crisis is affecting Zheldormash,  too, but not to such an extent as, for instance, the combine  plant.  <H5>  The Dead Grab the Living </H5>   The 12,000-employee Tula Combine Plant [TKZ] was officially  considered a flagship of national agricultural machine-building.  Although strictly speaking it built not combines but headers.  Combines were made at Rostselmash [Rostov Agricultural Machinery  Plant], while the Tula flagship supplied header components for  it.    At the beginning of the 1980's the TKZ, following Rostov's  footsteps, began modernization, which cost (according to  official data) R414 million (today the same figure would be  expressed in billions). Tula was supposed to put into production  headers for Don combines--90,000 units a year.    The plant was declared an all-Union shock-labor Komsomol  [All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League] construction  project. Eyewitnesses maintain that the entire oblast  construction complex worked on the TKZ modernization project.  Equipment was brought mostly from Japan and Germany, and  additional workers from Ashkhabad ((Ashgabat)) and Tashkent.  Venerable elders were brought in by plane from far and near  mountain villages.    As the project neared completion, however, it came out that  an error had found its way into the calculations of the  modernization project's authors: The battle for the harvest did  not need 90,000 headers--16,000 would be enough.    After modernization--which, by the way, was never  completed--the plant was left with R45 million worth of unneeded  Western equipment and special-use equipment for the production  of wide-cut headers that cannot be modified. "Good-bye to  people's money invested in modernization," the transformation  plant newspaper KOMBAYNOSTROITEL in the beginning of 1990 summed  up dejectedly.    The discovery was unsettling. New times were already  knocking  on the door, while the plant was firmly positioned to become a  drain on the treasury. And since the treasury was getting  increasingly emptier day by day, the plant, according to its  newspaper, "kept beating on the door of its ministry begging for  another handout."    Correctly appraising the situation, Dronov promised the  collective "to rid ourselves of the demeaning role of  Rostselmash appendage," to retrofit the plant for the production  of profitable and prestigious goods, and gain economic  independence. This earned him victory at the elections.    Some consider it a Pyhrric victory, though. Dronov did break  out of Rostselmash's grip. Instead of harvesters, the plant is  producing hitch-on combines, woodworking benches, electric  motors, carts, and other apparently needed goods which were  expected to ensure profits and hence economic independence.    So far, however, the expected profit--and independence with  it--has proven elusive. The products are not selling well. Some  because of the low purchasing capacity of agricultural  consumers; others are not competitive; still others are not  produced in enough quantity to generate real income. As a  result, the plant today owes banks more than R7 billion, which  is, in expert estimates, equal to almost 70 percent of the value  of its property. Workers have not been paid for four months; the  budget does not get any tax revenue. Unpaid liability amounts to  R730 million. "In the current economic situation," admits  Dronov, "we cannot do without credits." He means, of course,  preferential credits, which strictly speaking are budget  subsidies. At the end of last year the situation at the combine  plant was discussed in the government. Dronov was promised R5  billion, which he never got. "It is a paradox," said one of  Dronov's colleagues commenting on the latter's request. "In the  past everybody dreamed of economic independence; now they demand  help from the state. But if you are independent, what right do  you have to ask for it? The price of freedom is business  activities, a new financial strategy, and perhaps even  deprivation."  <H5>  Does History Repeat Itself? </H5>   The first stockholders meeting at the combine plant is  scheduled for May. Dronov is facing elections again. Except that  now the decisive vote will come mainly from buyers, not  stockholders. This is the substance of true economic democracy.  Voting by their hard-earned rubles, consumers have no mercy on  failing producers. And the task of the meeting's participants is  to register and carry out their will.</p>

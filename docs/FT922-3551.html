			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / US Senator urges force to curb Serbia A SENIOR US Senator yesterday warned that military action might be needed to curb Serbia's territorial ambitions, writes Jurek Martin in Washington. Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican from Indiana, urged the Bush administration to take the lead in getting the United Nations and Nato to bring about 'a stern enforcement' of a ceasefire in Yugoslavia and, failing all else, to be ready to use force against the regime in Belgrade. 'The time for drawing the line has come,' he said. 'The UN should authorise nation states to use force. Nato should draw up plans for a comprehensive use of force as thorough as that formulated for air, sea and ground forces in Desert Storm.' 'A final demand,' he went on, 'should be made for a ceasefire followed by diplomatic resolution of claims and boundaries, with the UN or Nato, in some combination, providing peacekeeping forces.' If Serbia did not yield, he said, 'it should face sufficient military force to ensure its certain and swift defeat.' Senator Lugar's intervention is an attempt to break the logjam of US political indifference to events in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The Senate foreign relations committee is to take public discussion further today in special hearings.</p>

			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent starts Christmas week in buoyant form BOURSES were mostly firmer at the start of the Christmas holiday week, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT hit a two-week high, the DAX index closing 23.54 or 1.6 per cent higher at 1,515.58, but professionals were not happy about the foundations for the rally. Turnover fell to DM3.9bn from Friday's DM10.4bn, the latter inflated by the 'triple-witching' expiry of DTB options and futures contracts. Dealers said that the short-covering which took the DAX up by 1.1 per cent on Friday was still a factor yesterday, since December contracts could still be covered until 10 am. The big rises came in stocks which have recently suffered the most. In carmakers, Volkswagen rose DM6.40 to DM244.30, and Daimler by DM14.50 to DM524 after last week's slump on unhappy progress reports. Construction shares recovered after Friday's drop, with Hochtief up DM18 to DM928 and Holzmann DM6 better at DM766. PARIS ended just below the day's high, driven by futures-related buying and window-dressing ahead of the year-end. The CAC-40 index closed up 26.17 or 1.5 per cent at 1,786.29 in turnover of FFr2.5bn. Financial stocks were sought on hopes of a cut in interest rates. Paribas added FFr9.70 to FFr359, Societe Generale rose FFr8 to FFr581 and UAP put on FFr25.1 to FFr469. Peugeot bucked the trend, losing FFr12 to FFr560 on reports that a UK buyer had withdrawn from the market. MILAN was lifted by strong insurers and telecoms as the Comit index added 3.19 to 428.87 in turnover estimated at close to Friday's L151.3bn. A report in an Italian weekly that British Telecom was interested in buying a stake of between 10 and 20 per cent in Stet got the market going, and the shares were fixed L94 higher at L1,779. A press report that the government was considering the partial liberalisation of compulsory car insurance sent insurance stocks higher as Generali rose L255 to L27,450 while Ras put on L315 to L18,500. Sirti rose L399 to L7,899 on news that it had won a L40bn order in Romania. AMSTERDAM was brighter with only Philips, down 40 cents at Fl 19.00, and Royal Dutch, 90 cents lower at Fl 147.60, among major stocks going against the trend. The CBS Tendency index advanced 0.9 to 104.4. DSM rose Fl 2.80 to Fl 73.30 as it recovered some of last week's losses on confirmation of lower fourth-quarter earnings. Heineken was Fl 2.00 stronger at Fl 173.80 while Daf put on another 30 cents to Fl 7.70. Nedlloyd rose 20 cents to Fl 28.70 following news after Friday's close that the supervisory board had asked Mr Torstein Hagen to vacate his seat. STOCKHOLM extended Friday's rally, spearheaded by export-oriented companies. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 21.1 or 2.3 per cent to 921.4 in turnover of SKr920m. Astra accounted for SKr105m of the total, as its A share added SKr17 to SKr750. were unchanged. SKF bucked the trend, dropping SKr0.50 to SKr69.50 on worries that the ball-bearing group faced possible downgradings by credit agencies after last week's official forecast of a pre-tax loss after financial items of SKr1.8bn in 1992. ZURICH was mixed with the SMI index advancing 1.7 to 2,047.7. Nestle and Roche weighed on sentiment with the former's bearers slipping SFr10 to SFr1,125 and the latter's certificates down SFr20 at SFr4,060. But Roche bearers closed up SFr50 at SFr5,750. Ciba registered shares resisted the downward trend towards the end of the session, closing SFr6 higher at SFr632. MADRID's general index gained 2.85 to 218.51 on the back of strong financial stocks. COPENHAGEN's KFX index fell 0.57 to 76.48, as Baltica lost DKr23 to DKr185 on staff cuts in its banking unit. East Asiatic fell DKr5 to DKr79.50 after failing to reach agreement on selling seven Plumrose meat preserve plants to a Danish consortium. VIENNA saw Universale going against the trend with a fall of Sch35 to Sch760, but off the day's low of Sch745, on a foreign sell order. The ATX index gained 6.13 to 722.9 with OMV recovering Sch11 to Sch578, after last week's losses. ISTANBUL's 75-share index closed 8.48 higher at 4,030.76 on demand for cement stocks.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- December 21                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1057.19     1057.40     1057.77     1059.03 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1140.90     1141.68     1142.72     1143.64  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1059.89     1059.78     1058.69     1059.21 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1145.20     1145.37     1145.02     1145.44  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Dec 18    Dec 17    Dec 16    Dec 15    Dec 14  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1050.25   1034.41   1036.62   1038.14   1041.18 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1136.56   1119.02   1117.67   1115.23   1116.33  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1060.48; 200 - 1146.72 Low/day: 100 - 1056.57 200 - 1140.81  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy report: ``Why Russia Is Concerned''] </F>   [Text] The Russian Defense Ministry held a press conference  for Russian and foreign journalists devoted to the  military-political aspects of the Russian and U.S. presidents'  Moscow summit meeting. Leading experts in the nuclear missile  sphere--Colonel General Yevgeniy Maslin, chief of a Russian  Defense Ministry main directorate; Major General Anatoliy  Svetikov, first deputy chief of the Strategic Missile Forces  Main Staff Operational Directorate; Major General Anatoliy  Lukyanov, deputy chief of the Russian Defense Ministry  International Treaty Directorate; and Boris Gorobets, spokesman  for the Ministry of Atomic Energy--answered journalists'  questions.    They all revealed the complexity not only of the  military-political, but also of the military-technical aspects  of the problem of the nuclear potential in Ukraine and once  again underlined not only the political significance of the  tripartite agreement on eliminating these weapons, but also the  considerable contribution it makes to strengthening nuclear  security--provided that the matter is resolved positively. Col.  Gen. Yevgeniy Maslin reminded the press conference that it is a  question of around 1,300 warheads [boyegolovka] for SS-19 and  SS-24 missiles and 600 air-launched cruise missile warheads  [golovnaya boyevaya chast]. The general said that this arsenal  causes most profound concern in Russia.    The point is that the state of these warheads is still  deteriorating. The warranty periods of most of the munitions'  components are expiring and they are not undergoing the  requisite technical maintenance, while maintenance personnel  lack the requisite level of both theoretical and practical  training. The complexity of the situation is indicated not  least by the fact that three warheads were recently delivered to  Russia from Ukraine in a preaccident state.    Our country does indeed have the technology to dismantle and  salvage the nuclear munitions, but time is pressing on. It is  no coincidence that it was specifically said during the summit  meeting that the first consignment of 200 warheads must arrive  at Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy enterprises for elimination  within the next 10 months.    Nor has Kiev's desire for material compensation been  forgotten--in exchange for the aforementioned first [consignment  of] 200 warheads Ukraine will receive 100 fuel assemblies for  nuclear power stations from Russia. Further payments are to be  determined. If that does not seem enough to Ukraine, it was  said at the press conference, the following legitimate question  arises: Perhaps Ukraine does not want to part with its nuclear  arms, contrary to its own declarations?    The press conference did not overlook the problem of mutual  nontargeting of strategic nuclear missiles, enshrined in the  Moscow declaration signed by Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton.  When asked by your KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent whether this  clause contravenes the status of nuclear weapons as a means of  deterring an aggressor (as in the ``Basic Provisions of Russian  Federation Military Doctrine'') Generals Anatoliy Lukyanov and  Anatoliy Svetikov replied that our nuclear arsenal does of  course retain the functions of deterrence and intimidation. The  fact that the missiles will not be targeted at the United States  and Russia respectively in everyday life, a sign of the new  quality of the partnership relations between the two countries,  is another matter. Since the missiles nonetheless remain on  alert duty, we can always resume the possibility of their combat  use if necessary.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / UK Company News: TR Property Benefits emanating from the Pounds 39m purchase earlier this year of a property portfolio from PosTel and a substantial cash raising exercise underpinned the interim revenue account at TR Property Investment Trust. Rises in rents and unfranked investment income, although partly offset by increased administration expenses reflecting the larger portfolio, contributed to a 28 per cent advance in attributable revenue for the six months to September 30, to Pounds 2.48m, against Pounds 1.93m. Earnings per share, however, dipped to 0.61p (0.68p) on capital increased by the C share issue. The interim dividend is maintained at 0.4p. Net asset value at the period end was 38.8p, against 36.2p a year earlier and 42p at March 31 this year.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Japan (3): Beating an orderly retreat - Michiyo Nakamoto studies how industry is adjusting to the painful realities of recession JAPANESE are quick to embrace catchy foreign words to describe trends at home. The latest in their adopted lexicon is 'restra,' or restructuring, as company after company has launched programmes to reorganise its business operations and work its way out of the current economic gloom. After a three-year period of economic growth - the second longest period of expansion since after World War Two - many Japanese companies had lost touch with market realities. The recent fate of Japan's consumer electronics and motor industries, two of the country's most internationally competitive sectors, showthe degree to which corporate strategy and market conditions had drifted apart. Consumer electronics companies, from giants such as Matsushita and Sony to the more specialised concerns such as Pioneer and Aiwa, have been caught with few new products to stimulate demand at a time when interest in mainstay products has slumped. In the motor industry, both Toyota and Nissan, Japan's largest and second largest car makers, recently started production at new state-of-the-art factories just as the domestic market was heading in a downward spiral. 'Car manufacturers have set their investment plans on the understanding that the economy would continue to grow but this is no longer appropriate,' says Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan. Nissan sent shock waves through the country when it announced earlier this year that it would close a car assembly plant in Zama, near Tokyo, and move production to a newer facility in southern Japan. Its decision was forced on it by the recognition that the company cannot expect to use its capacity to build 2.5m cars in Japan to the full under the present circumstances. In addition to such changed circumstances in the domestic market, Japanese companies which depend to a significant degree on exports have been severely battered by the 13 per cent rise in the yen's value this year. It is hardly the first time corporate Japan has had to review seriously the way it operates and readjust costs and business structures to changed market realities. Many businessmen in Japan still remember vividly the painful restructuring needed to overcome the sharp appreciation of the yen after the Group of Five industrial nations agreed in 1985 to strengthen the Japanese currency against the US dollar. Through that experience, Japanese companies emerged stronger and more competitive, establishing a reputation for being fierce and invincible. The question being asked today is whether Japanese companies, faced with one of the worst recessions in post-war history, a strong and rising yen and higher costs of financing, can do the same again. The pressures of a business environment have forced companies to reorder their priorities. As they watch their profits dwindle in the face of the prolonged slump, Japanese executives have begun to grapple with the need to raise profits even if markets are not growing. 'From now on managers have to think about maintaining profits even when revenues are not rising,' says Mr Yasuaki Takano, president of Sanyo Electric. To do so, companies are employing a two-pronged approach of cutting costs and raising productivity. The cost-cutting exercises at Japanese companies have ranged from the conventional steps of reducing capital expenditure and R&amp;D spending, cutting down on overtime work and restricting the hiring of new employees to the more dramatic and controversial measures of closing facilities, such as Nissan did, or introducing early retirement. Fujitsu, the computer company, has said that it would reduce its workforce by 6,000 in two years through natural attrition and voluntary transfers to subsidiaries and affiliated companies many of which it was establishing itself. Early retirement programmes have also become a popular option as a socially less disruptive way of reducing the workforce and have been introduced at companies ranging from Alps, an electrical components manufacturer, to Mitsui, the trading house. A particular feature of these cost-cutting exercises is that Japanese companies are for the first time confronting the need to slim down their white collar, rather than blue-collar, workforce. At the same time many companies have been reviewing their organisational structures in an attempt to raise overall efficiency. MATSUSHITA, which has been criticised for its poor response to defects in its refrigerators and a financial scandal at a subsidiary, is trying to grapple with what is known in Japan as 'the disease of the corporate giant,' or a bloated structure. The administrative staff had become too large and much of the work that is done at head office is necessary only because of the size of the company, points out Mr Jiro Aoki, general manager of the domestic sales planning office. Matsushita has more than 50 subsidiaries in Japan alone, some of which compete with each other in specific product areas. 'We used to think that this competition would lead each company to do better but it was in a way wasteful,' Mr Aoki admits. Now, Matsushita is trying to clarify business areas by company. At the same time as they attempt to slim down and raise productivity in the office, Japanese companies are cutting costs on the factory floor. For example, NEC is working with suppliers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to standardise certain parts of chip manufacturing machines. The target is to reduce the costs of manufacturing new generations of chips by about 20 per cent. Standardisation is also being increasingly adopted at consumer electronics companies and car manufacturers which have found that the wide variety of models they had been offering were a waste - of more than 200 different types of TVs offered by makers in Japan only about 20 per cent really sold, says Mr Aoki - and that consumers were more interested in products which offer value for money. As the yen has risen strongly against the dollar, equally important in their cost-cutting exercise has been the need to move more production overseas and to procure more components from abroad. Japanese manufacturers still have a high level of skills that keeps their products competitive in world markets. They have also actively developed key products for which there are few alternative suppliers. But to maintain that leading edge they will need a clear business strategy that takes into consideration the changed market environment, and that is where the dividing line between those companies that emerge stronger and those that drift is likely to lie. 'In Japan, top management which has been with a company for 30 or 40 years, cannot introduce real change,' says Mr Kuniyoshi Sasaki, a director at the Japan productivity centre. Neither do most executives have enough to provide the strong leadership that is needed in a time of crisis. The benefits of restructuring on the bottom line will begin to filter through in the years ahead. But unless cost-cutting goes hand in hand with a strategy for future growth, those benefits may turn out to be short-lived.</p>

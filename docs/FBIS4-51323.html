			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Li Han (4539 2487): "CPC Steps up Infiltration Into </F> Foreign-Funded Enterprises"]    [Text] At the end of last year, the Secretariat of the CPC  Central Committee approved the transmission of a findings report  submitted to it by the Organization Department of the CPC  Central Committee, which was entitled "The Party's Political  Leadership Over Foreign-Funded [wai zi 1120 6327] Enterprises  Must be Speedily Strengthened." The document urged localities  and management departments of foreign-funded enterprises at all  levels to complete, within a specific time, the work of forming  basic-level party organizations in foreign-funded enterprises,  in particular, wholly foreign-owned [wai shang du zi 1120 0794  3747 6327] enterprises, and ordered them to take measures to  ensure party membership among the employees of wholly  foreign-owned enterprises.  <H5>  It is Difficult to Form Party Organizations in Wholly </H5> Foreign Owned Enterprises    The findings report of the Organization Department, which  was  approved and transmitted by the Secretariat of the CPC Central  Committee with a note, states: In recent years, the Central  Committee has repeatedly transmitted to lower levels special  documents complete with several specific requirements on how to  strengthen the building of party organizations in  foreign-invested [san zi 0005 6327] enterprises. Before and  after the party's 14th National Congress, several principal  central leading comrades specially made clear instructions on  the issue. In terms of their implementation, so long as the  local party organizational departments and the party  organizations in the foreign-funded enterprises management  departments attach adequate importance to the issue, the  formation of basic-level party organizations in Sino-foreign  cooperative and joint-venture enterprises will progress quite  smoothly, and in some of them, the basic-level organizations of  the Chinese Youth League have been set up or revived. A  considerable number of newly formed, revived, or strengthened  basic-level party organizations in Sino-foreign cooperative and  joint-venture enterprises have begun conducting normal  organizational activities and organized their members to play a  relatively good role in political leadership. However, in  wholly foreign-owned enterprises (including enterprises wholly  owned by Hong Kong and Taiwan businessmen, the same below), the  building of basic-level party organizations has been all along  seriously hampered. According to the statistics provided by the  foreign-funded enterprise management departments from 16 large  and mid-sized cities throughout the country, including the three  municipalities directly under the central government, by October  this year (1993), approximately 70 percent of the wholly  foreign-owned enterprises had not yet even had party groups set  up.  <H5>  Foreign Businessmen Resist the Communist Party's </H5> Infiltration Into Employees Ranks    After gathering the reports from various localities, the  survey personnel of the Central Organization Department held  that the reasons behind this state of affairs were as follows:    1. In Sino-foreign cooperative or joint-venture enterprises,  in particular in such enterprises based on former state-owned  enterprises as the Chinese side, among the legal-person  representatives and managerial personnel of the Chinese side  there is a certain proportion of Communist Party members. After  enterprise merging, among the former staff members and workers  of the cooperative enterprises there are still more or fewer  party members. However, in the wholly owned enterprises of the  foreign side, there is no Chinese representation at all. Of the  employees newly recruited by the enterprises of this type after  having themselves registered and starting operation, the  proportion of party members was very meager, and many did not  even employ any party members at all. In the absence of party  members, building basic-level party organizations is out of the  question.    2. When recruiting employees, the bosses of foreign-funded  enterprises make every effort to prevent the Communist Party  members from "penetrating" the ranks of employees by using  various means and excuses, erecting barriers in depth, and  setting up defenses at every step. In an extreme case, when a  foreign businessman found out that there were Communist Party  members among his employees, he dismissed them by inventing all  sorts of excuses.    3. When recommending employees to management, foreign-funded  enterprise management departments in various localities do not  give full consideration in advance to the proportion of party  members in the name lists of their candidates. Some of them  even refuse to recommend party members to work in wholly  foreign-owned enterprises in compliance with management's  unreasonable demands.    The Central Organization Department has received reports  from such cities as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, and Kunming  which showed that the problems revealed were extremely serious  and even had reached intolerable proportions.    For example, in order to smoothly get a job in wholly  foreign-owned enterprises, some Communist Party members went so  far as to go through quit-the-party procedures with their work  units beforehand; some local foreign-funded enterprise  management departments asked party-member candidates recommended  to work in foreign-funded enterprises to withhold their party  membership from management; when recommending technicians to  management, apart from putting in a good word for them about  their professional competence and moral quality, some  foreign-funded enterprise management departments went so far as  to specially announce that these people "are not members of the  CPC"; and moreover, when recruiting employees for wholly  foreign-owned enterprises, some foreign-funded enterprise  management departments openly professed that "party members are  not to be employed" and "no consideration will be given to  members of the CPC."  <H5>  The Organizations of the CPC are Underground Party </H5> Organizations in Foreign-Funded Enterprises    The findings report says: Because of the reasons mentioned  above, there is no way to build basic-level party organizations  in most wholly foreign-owned enterprises, and it is very  difficult for basic-level party organizations which are already  set up in such enterprises to carry out their normal activities.  In the last two years, the Central Organization Department has  received letters from some party members working in wholly  foreign-owned enterprises, reporting that once their membership  in the Communist Party was exposed, this meant endless trouble  for them. Therefore, in their letters they asked if the party  and government had any official documents and decrees or laws  and regulations to ensure that Communist Party members are not  discriminated against and their organizational activities are  "legalized" in foreign-funded enterprises.    In a letter to the Central Organization Department, a  Communist Party member who worked in a foreign-funded enterprise  said grumblingly: After working in foreign-funded enterprises,  innumerable obstacles were put up and discrimination was applied  against us just because we were Communist Party members. This  made us naturally associate with the difficulties, hardships,  and risks which underground party organizations encountered and  endured in the party's history of struggle while working in the  "enemy-occupied areas."    The "note" attached by the Secretariat of the CPC Central  Committee to the findings report states: In the territory of  the People's Republic of China where the Communist Party is a  ruling party, it is right and proper for the Communist Party to  set up organizations at the basic level and its members to carry  out their organizational activities. However, in foreign-funded  enterprises, unexpectedly there was the problem of whether the  Communist Party is "legal" or not, and also unexpectedly,  Communist Party members working in such enterprises poured out  their demand to higher organizations and even the central  organization of the party that they "hope to become just and  honorable Communist Party members." This cannot but attract the  great attention of the Party Central Committee and local  organizations at all levels.  <H5>  Party Organizations Should Be Set Up in Foreign-Funded </H5> Enterprises Within a Specific Time    According to the findings report, the plan worked out by the  Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee to  "complete the work of building basic-level party organizations  in all foreign-funded enterprises within the specific time" was  approved by the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee.    The plan stipulates, in principle, that party committees of  various localities should strengthen political leadership and  offer better work guidance to basic-level party organizations in  wholly foreign-owned enterprises which hire more than 100  employees in our country and ensure that the party organizations  can carry out their normal activities on schedule so that they  will be genuinely able to play the role of a fighting force. As  far as such enterprises where no basic-level party organization  have been set up so far are concerned, the local foreign-funded  enterprise departments in charge of the enterprises must set  about to find out the real political conditions of enterprise  employees, and if there are already three or more party members  in their ranks, urge them to set up a party group or branch as  quickly as possible and carry out organizational activities on  time. In an enterprise whose party membership is large enough to  set up several party branches, a general party branch or a  higher party working committee should be correspondingly set up  to give unified leadership to the party branches.    What remedial measures should be adopted in the days to come  to deal with the case in which a foreign-funded enterprise's  employee ranks, there are just one or two or not any party  members? The Central Committee is studying ways to solve the  problem.  <H5>  Trade Unions in Foreign-Funded Enterprises Must be Put Under </H5> the Leadership of the Communist Party    The instruction of the Secretariat of the CPC Central  Committee also states: The emergence of this new  thing--foreign-invested enterprises--has really brought enormous  results to China's economy. Nevertheless, as the number of such  enterprises is increasingly expanding, the resulting problems  cannot but attract the great attention of our party and  government.    At present the most pronounced problem with foreign-invested  enterprises is the contradiction between management and labor.  In some enterprises, disregarding China's laws, regulations,  and decrees, some management personnel encroached upon the  employees' legitimate rights and interests as they liked and  even ignored the safety of the latter's lives. Therefore, the  party, the government, and the Chinese employees in  foreign-invested enterprises must have a full understanding of  the importance and urgency of setting up trade union  organizations in foreign-invested enterprises.    However, like the trade union organizations in state-owned  enterprises, the trade unions in foreign-invested enterprises  must be put strictly under party leadership. In a  foreign-invested enterprise, in particular a wholly  foreign-owned enterprise, where there is no basic-level party  organization and not even a single party member among the  Chinese employees, how does the trade union, once established in  such enterprise, accept party leadership?    Before the transmission of a new relevant document by the  Central Committee, the organization departments of party  committees of various localities and the party working  committees of foreign-funded enterprise management departments  should adopt some positive remedial measures with regard to the  foreign-funded enterprises where no party members are found in  employee ranks.    According to statistics, in all Sino-foreign cooperative and  joint-venture enterprises, cases in which there are no party  members in the Chinese management personnel and employees are  very rare. It is relatively easier to solve this  problem--sending party members to go in. However, this method  of forcibly sending party members to go in should not be adopted  in regard to the wholly foreign-owned enterprises where there  are no party members among the Chinese management personnel and  employees hired. The relatively stable and safe method to take  is for the party working committees of foreign-funded enterprise  management departments to lead their subordinate personnel  management institutions to look for a number of candidates who  are professionally competent and trusted by management in their  work and give them guidance so that they will actively make  progress politically, and promptly admit them into the party as  conditions are ripe.  <H5>  Foreign Businessmen Should Be Prevented From "Illegal" </H5> Hiring of Labor    While approving the transmission of the findings report of  the Central Organization Department, the Secretariat of the CPC  Central Committee stated: Seeing the very grim situation  recently in which in the course of their formation and  operations, foreign-invested enterprises, in particular wholly  foreign-owned enterprises, hired "illegal [hei 7815] employees"  without permission by bypassing our relevant management  institutions, thus causing a direct drop in the proportion of  party members in foreign-funded enterprises' employee ranks, the  Central Secretariat has suggested that the government take some  practical and effective measures to prevent the abovementioned  phenomenon from continuing to spread. The specific methods to  be taken are that relevant government departments formulate  clear laws and regulations and give appropriate punishment to  the foreign-funded enterprises which hired "illegal employees"  without the permission of our management institutions, personnel  management fees collected from foreign-funded enterprises by  management departments should be reduced appropriately, and a  stipulation should be made that while recommending qualified  people to foreign-funded enterprises, management departments  should ensure high quality to win trustworthiness.    The Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee maintained: So  long as the phenomenon in which foreign-funded enterprise hire  "illegal employees" from among unemployed persons in society is  checked and the employees of wholly foreign-owned enterprises  are all recruited through the recommendation of the Chinese  side, it will be possible to ensure that Communist Party members  will make up a certain portion of employees of these enterprises.</p>

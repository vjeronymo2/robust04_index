			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega; from the "RPC Television News" </F> newscast]    [Text] President Guillermo Endara Galimany has said the  management changes at the Interoceanic Region Authority [ARI]  will not affect the plans of that institution.    For Endara, Juan Blau's resignation from the post of ARI  administrator will not cause a crisis in that institution.    [Begin Endara recording] You must remember the post of  manager is not important in the ARI. What is important are the  directors. The manager is an official who can be changed without  a problem. [end recording]    Endara has said the ARI's priority is devising an action  master plan for the use of the reverted areas. The president of  the Republic has also commented on the structuring of a  constituent assembly.    [Begin Endara recording] Henriquez' [not further identified]  formula is to leave the door open so that in the future, when  one wants to convene a Constituent Assembly, the future  executive and legislative branches could use a special mechanism  to do so without violating the Constitution; this is a great  idea that I support. I did not present it, because I did not  achieve a consensus among the parties that supported me back  then. [end recording]    Endara has also said his administration does not want to  create crises in government institutions to adversely affect the  future administration of Perez Balladares. He has also ruled  out irregular situations in the Social Security Fund.    [Begin Endara recording] During the coming weeks of my  administration, three months, there will be many rumors and  speculation. We are interested--this is very clear--in handing  power over to those elected whom the people elected under the  best possible conditions. [end recording]    The president explained he will not adopt important  decisions  during the remaining months of his administration. He concluded  he will continue to carry out works and administer the  government properly.</p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: The critical factor in population growth Sir, Edward Mortimer ('False alarm in Cairo', September 7) and others at last begin to reveal one of the underlying development messages of the Cairo conference which have been blurred by the more newsy antics of more fanatical priests and mullahs. Women's economic power and consumer choice, where it has been allowed to develop, is already making an impact on the growth of world population and may ultimately prove the most critical factor  -more than education. I visited a women's economic activity development project in Orissa recently on behalf of the international charity Care, and was impressed by the potential earnings and savings power of rural women employed in a variety of small businesses. This scheme is linked directly with a government nutrition programme in which families benefit from a range of health and childcare advice, while mothers have the chance to meet and share ideas for improving their income. It is only within this social and economic structure that women cease to be mere child-bearers and have the opportunity to plan their families in the broadest sense. In many countries they of course start at a considerable disadvantage, but it has been shown that in the least advanced rural economies there is often potential for the most dramatic social change.

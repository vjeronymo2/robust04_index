			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Arts: A perfectly relentless Elektra - David Murray welcomes this revival of Strauss's opera A drab tunnel of corrugated metal, pierced vertically by a tree trunk that seems to be upside-down, with a mechanical double door at the back and a long, shuttered window higher up: not an obvious setting for Richard Strauss's Elektra. Yet in Gotz Friedrich's 1990 production for the Royal Opera - now revived for the first time, by David Massarella and Gerlinde Pelkowski - Hans Schavernoch's grim designs serve very well. Wednesday's first-night performance exerted a steady, properly dismaying grip throughout its unbroken two hours (nearly), and was received with awed appreciation by its well-blanched audience. An Elektra that fails to be seriously disturbing is a failed Elektra; this one succeeds. What is especially striking about it is that the whole is so much more than the sum of its imperfect parts. Judged in the chilly light of long experience, it hardly begins to qualify in detail as a vintage treatment - and yet its whole trajectory is focussed so unwinkingly as to hold our sympathetic attention in thrall. The new conductor is Christian Thielemann, who encouraged a soft, dense attack from his orchestra. There were times when more incisive rhythms would have been better, and the Recognition scene for Electra and Orestes ran dangerously slow in its later part. Little by little, nevertheless, Thielemann's long-sighted view of the score accumulated its own weight and power. For Electra's fatal dance of triumph at the end, we have heard much more violent, 'seismic' orchestral eruptions; but in Thielemann's hands it was continuously lyrical, gently swung and perfectly relentless. The 1990 principals are all back again. The monstrous Electra is Eva Marton, whose hefty soprano is more than ever inclined to spread (it took her a good hour to fine down), but her fervid dramatic commitment carries all before it. Marjana Lipovsek's Clytemnestra is dark, velvety and superbly decadent; Robert Tear's half-comic Aegisthus is more thoroughly sung than any other role here; Nadine Secunde's excellent Chrysothemis suffers only from sounding too close to the Marton model - this hapless creature needs to make a lighter, brighter, fresher contrast to her obsessed sister. The matricidal Orestes is also an American, Robert Hale, who fuels him with a brave, shuddering anxiety beyond the customary stone-faced norm. In smaller parts, Mark Beesley and Alasdair Elliott make disproportionate impressions as Orestes' Tutor and the Young Servant, and Jane Webster's Fifth Maid scores an equal mark. As Clytemnestra's confidantes, Patricia Cameron and Valerie Robinson get little to sing, but look brilliantly reptilian. The First Maid is Elizabeth Bainbridge, who is shortly to retire after singing almost a thousand performances with the Royal Opera. All Covent Garden regulars will remember her with admiration and respect. Far more than just a reliable company hand, she has lent sharp character and musical insight to a huge variety of roles, from Erda and Amneris to the Grandmother in Janacek's Jenufa and Tippett's 'She-Ancient': a fine, invaluable performer. Further performances, in repertory, to February 17</p>

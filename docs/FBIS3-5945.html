The news analyst says:    The Amnesty International in a report March 9 on the lapse  of  one year since the traitor Kim Yong-sam's inauguration said that  although he promised "democratization" under the "civilian"  veil, "new tortures and harsh practices" have appeared in South  Korea. The Kim Yong-sam government has hardly done anything to  put an end to human rights violations, added the report.    When hanging up the signboard of "civilian government," the  traitor Kim Yong-sam waxed eloquent about "liquidation of the  leftovers of the past" and "expansion of human rights." The  last year, however, has witnessed nothing but murderous  strong-arm politics and terror politics in South Korea.    The Kim Yong-sam group relies on the one-party dictatorship  of the military fascist "Democratic Liberal Party." And such  fascist repressive machines as "Security Planning Board" and  "Secret Affairs Command," which should have been thrown into the  dustbin of history, along with the dictatorship of the "Fifth  and Sixth Republics," still stay alive and active in human  rights violations, invoking the "National Security Law" that  should have been scrapped. This is the stark reality of South  Korea.    To expect democratic politics and guarantee of human rights  from the traitor Kim Yong-sam is as foolish as hoping to see a  wolf give birth to a lamb.    Nevertheless, the South Korean puppets at a recent meeting  of  the UN commission on human rights made a tirade about "expansion  of human rights" and "progress in democratization" in South  Korea and even took issue with someone's "human rights problem."  This was the height of shamelessness and a mockery of the  meeting and its participants.    Only after the ouster of the "government" of the traitor Kim  Yong-sam, can true democratic politics and human rights be  expected in South Korea.</p>

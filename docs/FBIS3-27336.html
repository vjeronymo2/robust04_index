			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Over 10,000 Enterprises Have Been </F> Merged in China"]    [Text] Beijing, 16 Feb (LIEN HO PAO) -- According to a  department on the mainland, a national center for the  transaction of property rights -- the China International  Property Rights Transactions Center -- will be set up in Beijing.    The transactions center will be composed of 30 financial  institutions and major enterprise groups on the mainland,  including the China Economic Development, Trust, and Investment  Corporation, the Hangzhou Bund Construction Joint-Stock Company  Limited, the China Everbright International Trust and Investment  Corporation, and the Shenzhen Baoan (Group) Corporation. Prior  to this, there were already 25 property rights transaction  markets set up in various parts of the country, including the  regional markets in Henan, Shanghai, Nanjing, Shandong, Chengdu,  Shenzhen, and Zhejiang.    To promote the rational flow and realignment of enterprise  property rights so as to attain the best formation of resources  and scale, the center will activate stock assets, improve the  pattern of assets operation, make up for the shortfall in  construction fund, and ensure that the value of state-owned  assets can be preserved and increased. Since the early 1980's,  transactions markets focusing on property rights have emerged on  the Chinese mainland. After several years of development,  property rights transactions brought notable results to China's  national economy and increasingly became an important method of  optimizing the allocation of state-owned assets under the  socialist market economic conditions. According to statistics,  in the whole of the 1980's, over 6,900 enterprises were merged  across China, with over 8 billion yuan of stock assets  transferred, and 4,090 enterprises reduced their losses by 522  million yuan. In the 1990's property rights transactions have  further developed. To date, over 10,000 enterprises have been  merged.    With the emergence and ever-growing expansion of property  rights transactions, a series of relevant laws and regulations  have been established and perfected. So far, the Chinese  mainland has promulgated and implemented the "Bankruptcy Law,"  "Company Law," "Interim Regulations on Merger of Enterprises,"  "Interim Regulations on Selling the Property Rights of Small  State-Owned Enterprises," "Regulations on Managing the  Evaluation of State-Owned Assets," "Regulations on Changing the  Operational Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Under Ownership  by the Whole People," and other laws and regulations. Other  laws and regulations, such as the "Securities Law," "Banking  Law," and "Provisions on Unemployment Insurance for Workers and  Staff Members of State-Owned Enterprises" are still being  drafted.</p>

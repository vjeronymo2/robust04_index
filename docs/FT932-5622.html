			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Cambodian Elections: Sihanouk offers mediation after poll PRINCE Norodom Sihanouk, the former Cambodian monarch, has offered to mediate between the two parties which won the most votes in last week's UN-organised election, in an attempt to avert a violent confrontation. With more than four fifths of the ballots counted, the royalist opposition party Funcinpec appears to have beaten the government's communist Cambodian People's Party. So far Funcinpec has 45.7 per cent of the valid votes, against 38.1 per cent for the CPP with smaller parties securing the remainder. The royalists may not have won enough seats in the new 120-member assembly to form a government on their own, but CPP leaders have been stung by the government's apparent defeat and are challenging the election results. Yesterday the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) announced with regret that the CPP had withdrawn party agents from vote-counting centres in the pro-Funcinpec provinces of Kandal, Battambang and Kompong Cham. The CPP has also called for new elections in a further four provinces. Prince Sihanouk said he had invited his son Prince Ranariddh, the Funcinpec leader, and Mr Chea Sim, head of the CPP, to lunch at his palace in Phnom Penh to resolve the problems facing Cambodia, 'given the major dangers which our people, our nation and our country could face in the days and weeks ahead.' Prince Sihanouk said both parties were winners in the poll. His half-brother Prince Sirivudh, who is in charge of Funcinpec's Phnom Penh office, yesterday expressed concern about continuing government attacks on Funcinpec supporters in the provinces. He dismissed CPP threats of insurrection over alleged election fraud as 'blackmail.' Untac, together with the foreign governments supporting its Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) mission to bring peace and democracy to Cambodia, has already rejected the CPP's accusations. 'I hope we don't go back to the jungle,' Prince Sirivudh told reporters. 'I hope we don't go back to fighting again. . . You spend Dollars 2bn on this operation to do what? To see fighting in Cambodia?' Prince Sirivudh said Prince Ranariddh wanted to return to Phnom Penh as soon as possible from a Funcinpec enclave on the Thai border to begin talks. However, he was unable to do so because the outgoing CPP-led government would not allow his aircraft to land at the main airport; Prince Chakrapong, another member of the royal family who is loyal to the CPP and has a feud with Prince Ranariddh, is in charge of civil aviation. While Untac is preparing to spend up to Dollars 7m a month to pay soldiers and civil servants until the new assembly writes a constitution and forms a new government, Cambodian politicians and foreign diplomats are looking to the paternalist but erratic Prince Sihanouk to broker a coalition. 'I think he is still the father of the nation,' said Prince Sirivudh. 'He still sticks to national reconciliation for all his children.'</p>

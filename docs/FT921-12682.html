			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Israel tries to placate US over loan guarantees Israel, anxiuosly awaiting word on its request for dollars 10bn (pounds 5.5bn) in US loan guarantees, has told Washington it is committed to US-backed Middle East peace efforts, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, sent a letter to Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state two days ago pledging to forge ahead with peace talks despite the possibility of an early general election, a Shamir aide said yesterday. The letter did not mention the loan guarantees which Israel fears Mr Baker will link for the first time to a curb on Jewish settlement of occupied Arab land. Israel needs the guarantees to help raise an estimated dollars 20bn in foreign loans over the next five years to settle an influx of Jews from the former Soviet Union. The figure is contained in a report which Mr Zalman Shoval, the Israeli ambassador, was due to give Mr Baker yesterday. Their meeting, however, has been put off until today when the US is expected to respond formally to the Israeli request. 'We believe that we have progressed at a respectable pace,' Mr Shamir wrote of the three rounds of Arab-Israeli talks since October. Mr Shamir, who torpedoed Mr Baker's first attempt to convene peace talks two years ago, has since tried to cast himself as peace-maker, partly to placate Washington which used the loan guarantees to prod him to the negotiating table. Washington is expected to give less than the full amount and insist that the money is not used directly or indirectly to increase the 100,000 Jews already living in guarded settlements amid 1.75m Palestinians in the territories Israel captured in 1967.</p>

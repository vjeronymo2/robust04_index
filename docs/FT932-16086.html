			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: Turner shares go ahead on sale report SHARES in Turner Broadcasting System, the cable television group founded by Mr Ted Turner, rose sharply yesterday as Wall Street reacted to fresh speculation that the company could be up for sale. Turner's B shares rose Dollars 1 5/8 to stand at Dollars 24 1/8 in early trading in New York. A press report yesterday suggested that Time-Warner, the world's largest media group, and Tele-Communications, the largest cable operator in the US, could be discussing plans to divide many of Turner Broadcasting's assets between them. None of the three parties would comment. Time and TCI each own about one-fifth of Turner Broadcasting's equity, having rescued the company from debt difficulties in 1987. Mr Turner, with around 37 per cent of the equity, retains 56 per cent of the votes and thus control. The fresh speculation follows rumours in February that Turner had been discussing a possible merger with other media companies.</p>

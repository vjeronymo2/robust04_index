			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Body Shop Fears that the Body Shop's franchise would be undermined by a mix of copycat commodity products and changing consumer fashions have tarnished the company's star rating. Yet if the recent UK performance is any guide, Body Shop may yet regain a dull shine. Declines in like-for-like sales have slowed substantially as the company has focused on basic selling skills. Even in a market which has had time to become tired of the idea, solid retailing ideas may help Body Shop hold out against competition such as Boots' Natural Collection. That offers hope for the international expansion of the chain, since Body Shop also faces generic competition in overseas markets - most notably in the US. Perhaps the main issue here, however, is the company's ability to manage the logistics of a global business with 1,000 franchise outlets. Part of the explanation for international profits rising more slowly than sales is said to be that the company is investing in the structure of the business. A further bolstering of the management team in this area might also reassure. As Body Shop has fallen back to a rating broadly comparable with the market, its appeal rests on the prospect of growth from its international operations. That in turn depends upon the strength of the brand and its continuing capacity to maintain premium pricing. Even mighty Philip Morris has worries on that score, so Body Shop still has reason to be cautious.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / North-west business shows optimism THE CORPORATE sector of north-west England has remained basically intact in the recession, which appears to have bottomed out in the region, according to Mr Rodger Hughes, senior partner of Price Waterhouse. Mr Hughes' conclusion follows a survey of 1,097 companies, sponsored by the accountants, conducted by Manchester Business School (MBS). The survey of companies with headquarters or main operations in the north-west covered the six-month winter period just ended. Sales and profits fell for 46 per cent of the companies, compared with 41 per cent last summer and 25 per cent in the winter of 1990-91. However, profits were falling faster than sales last year, but seem to have stabilised. Of the 54 per cent reporting sales and profits growth, 19 per cent achieved profits increases of more than 10 per cent over last summer, a result of cost-cutting measures to combat the downturn. Signs of optimism last summer were not fulfilled, but confidence is growing. Only 20 per cent thought things would get worse, compared with 30 per cent six months ago. Also, 25 per cent expected improvement within six months, compared with 21 per cent last October and only 9 per cent a year ago. Mr Nitin Sanghavi, director of MBS's Centre for Business Research, said: 'There is still need for some to get leaner and fitter, but a lot of restructuring had taken place before the recession started. There will be strong recovery among these companies.' Mr Hughes said: 'If you stand back and compare with, say, 1973-74, things are very different. Then, some businesses were cornerstones of the regional economy and if one of them went there was enormous damage. 'There is a wider spread of industry now. There have been closures, but the structure is intact.' Both said most business had been holding back on investment while awaiting the general election result.</p>

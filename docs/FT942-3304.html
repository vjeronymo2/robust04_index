			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Overseas buys help Volex rise 40% to Pounds 10.3m Overseas acquisitions and organic growth helped Volex Group, the restructured electrical interconnection products and cable assemblies company, record a 40 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits. The increase from Pounds 7.34m to Pounds 10.3m in the year to March 31 came on turnover ahead 26 per cent to Pounds 149.2m (Pounds 118.3m), partly reflecting the impact of three acquisitions made during the previous year in the US and south-east Asia. Organic growth accounted for about 12 percentage points of the increase. Sales of products manufactured in the UK increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 86.6m while those of products manufactured overseas increased by 62 per cent and represented 42 per cent of total group turnover. Earnings pre share increased by a more modest 9 per cent to 23.6p (21.7p) after a 23 per cent increase in the average number of shares following the Pounds 17.5m rights issue in February last year, partly offset by a reduced tax rate. An increased final dividend of 11.6p lifts the total to 18.1p (17.85p). Mr Oliver Chapple, chief executive since October, said the results highlighted the successful consolidation and integration of the acquisitions made in the previous three years. As a result Volex was now an international manufacturer and supplier of interconnect products to original equipment manufacturers in the computer, medical telecommunications and appliance industries. Operating profit increased by 41 per cent to Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 7.41m) and operating profit margin improved from 6.3 per cent to 7 per cent reflecting the greater impact on the group's performance of its power cord and data assembly operations which were enlarged considerably, partly as a result of acquisitions. Interest costs rose to Pounds 1.03m (Pounds 366,000). The group moved from net cash of Pounds 5.86m to marginal net debt at the end of the year after capital expenditure of Pounds 7m. Investment income rose to Pounds 855,000 (Pounds 297,000).</p>

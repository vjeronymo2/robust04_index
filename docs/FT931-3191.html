			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: It was 'a Budget for his job' - Paul Cheeseright hears Birmingham's view of Mr Lamont's changes EYEBALLS rolled a bit as Mr Lamont rehearsed everything which is right with the UK economy, but four Birmingham businessmen, gathered for a Budget tea party, heard him out in silence. Guffaws came when the chancellor mentioned sewage and newspapers in the same breathe. They turned into verbal sneers as he extolled the economic benefits of the bloodstock industry. If they took the Budget quietly it was because Mr Lamont failed to convince them he was doing enough to foster the recovery about which he talked so much. 'It's a Budget for his job,' said Mr Peter Thomas, chairman of Birmingham Deposit Centre, which guards the wealth of the wealthy. 'But then it was a Budget for not damaging the economy. It's what he's not done that matters. It's not going to damage anybody,' rejoined Mr Stuart Neal, chairman of Team Training Services. 'What has he done which will significantly affect anybody?' asked Mr Steve Williams, chairman of LBE Contract Tooling, an engineering company. 'He hasn't made me go out and decide to buy some new machine tools.' Mr Robert Woolley, chairman of Frederick Woolley, a family engineering company agreed. 'It won't make a lot of difference all round to companies with up to 200 people in Birmingham.' Certainly there was no feeling that suddenly there is a new dawn in the British economy. 'Lamont's just shuffling the pack,' said Mr Williams dismissively. 'Look at the private individual who's going to do the spending  -he hasn't done very much at all,' observed Mr Thomas. And local issues intruded. 'Bailing out Lloyd's, that's disgusting. What about Leyland Daf - why aren't we bailing them out?' asked Mr Williams, who is a firm proponent of propping up the manufacturing base. 'But it's a balance,' argued Mr Thomas. 'Lloyd's is an important factor in British business. It's taken a real battering.' On specific measures, though, Mr Lamont won a more favourable rating than the general criticism of his Budget might have suggested. 'The ACT measures are very good for companies,' contended Mr Woolley, and, if they look likely to benefit larger rather than smaller companies then, as Mr Williams said, 'All small businesses live off big businesses.' Although Mr Thomas felt that the steps taken by Mr Lamont on housing were not that significant - 'he's done nothing really to help housebuilding' - he was prepared to agree with Mr Williams that 'Lamont's concentrated his changes in the right area,' that is, the bottom end of the market. Changes in the taxing system for small business won qualified approval in terms of simplification, but the notion of having to pay tax on the corporate income of the current year, rather than preceding years, was not seen as a good idea. 'It discourages growth steps in the small sector,' suggested Mr Neal. 'It's an easy way of raising a few coppers for his coffers this year,' commented Mr Williams. Mr Thomas said: 'There was one thing that pleased me - there is an indication about utilising the unemployed. It's long overdue. I like the idea of prospective employers getting a subsidy.' Mr Williams worried that the system might be exploited by the wrong type of entrepreneur, taking on the long-term unemployed so he did not have to pay any wages. 'On face value, the numbers seem impressive,' rejoined Mr Neal. 'But if you spread it over the country, it becomes very small.' Celebration of the Budget, in short, did not seem appropriate. 'We're not going to get roaring drunk on it,' said Mr Williams. If he changed his mind, he would have chosen whisky.</p>

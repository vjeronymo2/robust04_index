			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PANEL REJECTS PORTION OF FAIRFAX PROJECT  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Planning Commission last week rejected a proposed hotel  and office building as too much development for the already congested streets  of the Fairfax District, but decided to let the A. F. Gilmore Co. go ahead with  a two-anchor retail mall behind the Farmers Market.  </P> <P> Although spokesmen for some neighborhood groups said that a regional mall would  be the ruination of the area, Planning Commission President William Luddy, who  lives nearby, said that he saw it as a plus.  </P> <P> "Fairfax has deteriorated. Neighborhood retail is drying up and dying," Luddy  said. "This isn't Disney's Main Street. There aren't ticket sales to keep it  going. There have to be people going into those stores."  </P> <P> He said that City Council President John Ferraro's plan for the site, which  calls for 700,000 square feet of development, amounts to "the least possible to  still maintain an economically feasible project." At that size, the shopping  center would be slightly smaller than the Beverly Center, one mile to the west.  The developer originally proposed a project of 2 million square feet.  </P> <P> Luddy said he believed a 700,000-square-foot development would produce enough  revenue to pay for the extensive changes needed to mitigate many of the effects  of extra traffic.  </P> <P> But Diane Plotkin, president of the Beverly Wilshire Homes Assn., said: "There  is no way to mitigate traffic in our area."  </P> <P> She said city officials were hampered by "tunnel vision" that makes them judge  individual projects in isolation from others proposed for the area, such as a  major expansion planned by the owners of the nearby Park Labrea apartment  complex.  </P> <P> Luddy denied it, however, saying that the Park Labrea expansion could lessen  the effects of traffic from the Farmers Market project by providing much-needed  housing. The Planning Commission also proposed up to 400 housing units for the  Farmers Market complex.  </P> <P> Executives at Gilmore, a family-owned company that has owned and operated the  Farmers Market for decades, had appealed to the Planning Commission to overturn  an earlier decision by a Planning Department official rejecting the hotel and  office building.  </P> <P> In its 5-0 vote Thursday afternoon, however, the Planning Commission dismissed  the appeal out of hand. In effect, the commissioners adopted the  recommendations offered by Ferraro in October, with modifications intended to  increase the number of housing units to be built at the eastern end of the  site, overlooking Pan Pacific Park.  </P></p>

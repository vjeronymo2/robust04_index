			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Vitaliy Cherkasov followed by </F> commentary by Aleksandr Gavrilyuk under general heading: "As Ye  Sow So Shall Ye Reap"]    [Text] Gorodishchenskiy Rayon, Volgograd Oblast -- The  sowing toil has reached the Lower Volga. Ivan Shabunin, head of  the Volgograd Oblast administration, ordered that the peasants  be paid all the state's debts for last year's grain back in  early April. The countryside was provided with fuel and  lubricants for the entire campaign.    At night on the field near the village of Novyy Rogachik,  Gorodishchenskiy Rayon, the tractor drivers were harrowing the  winter fallow.    "They are hurrying to lock in the moisture," explained  Nikolay Telitchenko, deputy director of the "Luch"  agro-industrial limited partnership. "Put you hope in god, but  don't slip up yourself. That is why people are working day and  night. We shall do the harrowing and start the sowing...."    That is the sowing technology. It was elaborated by  scientists from the Volgograd agricultural institute and from  the V.I. Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The  point of this program is to obtain the forecasted grain harvest  in any weather conditions. Even if not a single drop of rain  falls all summer, which in the Lower Volga region happens quite  often.    That is why no one here ever pins any hope on the weather.    "The present harvest was conceived the year before last,"  Nikolay Telitchenko explains the essence of dry arable farming.  "It was then that the entire winter crop area was left to bare  fallow."    This year the "Luch" limited partnership obtained an average  of 45 quintals of wheat [per hectare]. And that is on clay or  at best on red soil. In addition on these arid steppes the  grain that is grown is strong. In barter exchange between farms  this grain is very advantageous: One tonne of elite wheat seed  grain is equal to two tonnes of feed grain.    Sometimes this home-grown barter can provide three or five  tonnes of feed grain.    That is how "Luch" survives. No one here is groaning,  panicking, or intending to go on strike. There are no  stoppages, everyone is working. And that even with our  ubiquitous nonpayments. [Cherkasov report ends]  <H5>  Specialists' Opinion </H5>   Today the spring field work is at its height and in the  opinion of Ivan Gridasov, chief of the Ministry of Agriculture  plant growing administration, it is ahead of last year's  schedule. Over 3 million hectares have already been sown to  spring crops.    Unfortunately, the state of the winter crops is considerably  worse. About 3 million hectares will have to be resown -- it is  a long time since that happened and it is connected primarily  with the weather. In the fall they sowed without rain, into the  dry soil, and in addition frost struck immediately. As a result  1 million hectares have already been resown and last year this  figure was only 100,000 hectares. The saddest thing is that  this affects primarily winter wheat and as a result there is a  reduction in the gross harvest of this crop.    In the opinion of Ministry of Agriculture experts losses  will  be about 10 million tonnes. The situation is further aggravated  by the fact that this year at least half the amount of  fertilizers and plant protection agents will be applied to the  soil. Moreover sown areas are being reduced by approximately  4.5 million hectares, primarily because of the lack of land in  suburban regions. Of these hectares half are usually sown to  grain crops. Cottages are now growing up in their place.</p>

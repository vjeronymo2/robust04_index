			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Liberian civil war foes agree peace settlement WARRING factions in Liberia and the Interim Government of National Unity announced at the weekend they had reached an accord on ending the long and brutal civil war in the west African state, Reuter reports from Geneva. Officials of the three main groupings involved in the conflict said at the end of a week of negotiations that the accord would be formally signed by their leaders in Cotonou, Benin, on July 24. The groups said sticking points remained, but they were confident that agreement could be reached on these over the coming week. According to a communique signed by the three groups, a transitional government representing all the factions would be set up and a United Nations-supervised ceasefire would go into effect after next week's Cotonou signing.</p>

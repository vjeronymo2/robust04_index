			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: Naf Naf agrees to take over Chevignon Naf Naf, the French textiles group, last night announced it had agreed terms to acquire Chevignon, the leisurewear company, for FFr125m (Dollars 23.32m). Negotiations between Naf Naf and Chevignon, two of the best-known brand names in the French clothing industry, have been going on for some months. Mr Patrick Pariente, one of the two brothers that head Naf Naf, last week confirmed reports of an imminent deal but waited until yesterday's shareholders' meeting to announce the terms of the transaction. Naf Naf, which emerged as a force in the French textiles industry during the 1970s and 1980s, went public last year. The acquisition of Chevignon, which is a force in the jeans market, represents an important opportunity to expand its interests. Mr Pariente affirmed that Naf Naf was on course for growth this year with estimated net profits of between FFr135m and FFr155m. Far Eastern Textile, one of Taiwan's leading manufacturers of textiles and other related products, posted pre-tax profits of NTDollars 918m (USDollars 35m) in the year to June 30, against NTDollars 621m a year earlier, writes Laura Tyson in Taipei. Revenues climbed to NTDollars 11.4bn from NTDollars 9.8bn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 17 TASS -- Describing an incident  that took place after the undocking of the Soyuz TM-17 spaceship  and the Mir space station on Friday [14 January], Aleksandr  Serebrov told a news conference on Monday: "We circled the  station, touched it and flew away".    Specialists confirmed that, indeed, the spaceship with  Vasiliy Tsibliev and Aleksandr Serebrov aboard touched the Mir  station. However, it is too early to speak about causes and  consequences of the incident.    Some experts believe that the programme of the 15th main  expedition (Viktor Afanasyev, Yuriy Usachev and Valeriy  Polyakov) which relieved Tsibliev and Serebrov at the Mir  station, will be somewhat changed.    Their plan of work did not provide for space walks. However,  it will be necessary to do them now.    Nevertheless, according to the cosmonauts who ended their  mission on Friday, the Mir station is in good condition.  Although the station launched in 1986 was to end its service  life five years later, it will function normally till 1997  according to experts' estimates. Tsibliev stressed that for  this purpose it is necessary to take permanently preventive  measures.    The cosmonauts safely returned to the earth and, judging by  their statements, feel well. Some inconvenience is only caused  by muscles which did not function under zero-gravity conditions,  and which are forced "to work" now.    Tsibliev and Serebrov are satisfied with the fully completed  programme of the expedition. As for explorations and  experiments conducted on a commercial basis, they, according to  Serebrov, "are evidently profitable". True, cosmonauts do not  participate in signing such contracts, he admitted.</p>

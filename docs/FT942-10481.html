			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (3): The old guard can offer no alternative  -Economy / Kenyan business is emerging from a traumatic period in the doldrums, but reforms promise respectable growth If big-business sentiment is a reliable guide, the Kenyan economy has turned the corner and is poised to return to respectable growth rates in the latter half of the decade, though 1994 will be flat. Kenyan business is emerging from a traumatic period in the doldrums - 100 per cent inflation, 70 per cent devaluation, an epidemic of damaging financial scandals, record interest rates, drought, a freeze on donor funds and sudden, unpredictable shifts in macroeconomic policy. Yet such is the economy's resilience that GDP stayed fractionally ahead of the game, with real output rising 0.4 per cent in both 1992 and 1993 and forecast to grow by 2 to 3 per cent this year. But business sentiment is notoriously fragile and volatile. A leading businessman admits to 'a nervous feeling in the pit of my stomach' that at least some of the sweeping reforms of the past 12 months will be reversed. Another believes that the scales are so finely balanced between reform and a return to controls that the outcome is too close to call. The most immediate challenge is political. Clustered around President Daniel arap Moi is a clutch of old-guard politicians for whom structural adjustment, deregulation, privatisation, the World Bank and the IMF are dirty words. They are unlikely to acquiesce in the loss of privileged access to wealth and patronage at the behest of, and under duress from, the donor community. That said, this anti-reform group does not have much going for it, given the failure of its policies. However, it can point to falling living standards and the limp supply response to reform, other than exports. With a population growing at 3.4 per cent annually and stagnant GDP, real incomes have fallen some 8 per cent since 1990; unemployment has worsened and wage awards have fallen far behind inflation. Urban unemployment climbed from 16 per cent in 1986 to 23.5 per cent by 1991, and is now estimated to be in the region of 27 per cent, while rural unemployment is put at 12 per cent. The critics are on weak ground, however, when it comes to policy alternatives. The old guard has nothing to offer in its place. There is no constituency for a return to the bad old days of price and import controls, overvalued exchange rates and pervasive state intervention. With no elections due for almost four years, the reformers have a window of opportunity to get Kenya back on to a 5 per cent growth track  - fuelled, this time, by a structurally healthy economy, rather than one dependent on aid and volatile commodity prices than. A survey of multinationals by the East Africa Association finds that the majority of the 37 respondents (to date) have significant investment plans. Only one is disinvesting. The government's Investment Promotion Centre has had 120 investment inquiries so far this year, and about 20 per cent of them have been translated into firm project proposals. The country's first privately-owned industrial park and export processing Zone (EPZ) is fully subscribed, while officials claim good support for Athi River EPZ, due to come on stream later in the year. This - largely anecdotal - evidence suggests that there are at least the stirrings of an investment supply response, while exports have already responded significantly to devaluation and 100 per cent earnings retention. In dollar terms, exports surged 15 per cent last year to Dollars 1.1bn. Industrialists attribute increased exports of manufactures to devaluation, strengthening economies in (and improved trading ties with) Uganda and Tanzania, and some shift of commerce from informal to formal channels. Clothing, textile and footwear firms, some in the EPZ, or utilising the manufacturing-under-bond scheme, are penetrating European and North American markets Reform has done wonders for the financial sector, too - though not yet for insurance groups. Barclays Bank of Kenya doubled its profits last year, while share prices doubled on the Nairobi Stock Exchange in the first two months of 1994, though they have since fallen by a quarter. Business has also been encouraged by the opening up of constructive dialogue with the government, and especially with finance minister Musalia Mudavadi and central bank governor Micah Cheserem. Private enterprise played a leading role in staging the Nairobi investment conference last week, and will be prominent at the London investment conference scheduled for November, being organised with Confederation of British Industry. Not everyone is upbeat. The donor community, marching to a different drum, is stuck in wait-and-see mode. Its caution stems partly from its understandable preoccupation with political conditions, memories of having been misled by the Kenyans in the 1980s, and current concerns about macroeconomic management. The challenges here are formidable: per capita incomes will fall again this year for the fourth successive year; inflation, which had fallen to 16 per cent on a three-month moving average basis by December last year, from a peak of 101 per cent in mid-year, is back above 50 per cent; bank lending rates of 33 per cent are substantially negative in real terms and set to move higher; and the exchange rate, having overshot (it fell to a low of Ks70 to the dollar late last year), has now appreciated to the point where exporters are beginning to complain that their competitive edge is under threat. This year, too, the economy will pick up the tab for the fiscal and monetary expansion associated with the December 1992 elections and the subsequent banking and financial scams that cost the country literally hundreds of millions of dollars. The authorities managed to slow money supply growth to 26 per cent last year, from 33.6 per cent in 1992, by driving treasury bill yields above 70 per cent to drain liquidity from the system at enormous interest cost to the exchequer. The volume of bills outstanding more than quadrupled during 1993, to reach Ks59bn at the end of the year, and increased by a further 35 per cent in the first quarter to Ks80bn in early April. The high nominal interest rates used to mop up liquidity now threaten to destabilise the economy, fuelling rapid monetary growth as capital flight is reversed, resulting in a substantial 1993 current account balance of payments surplus and a firmer shilling. Managing the T-bill mountain will tax the authorities' ingenuity, forcing them to lengthen borrowing maturities, or incur a budgetary surplus to repay debt. The latter option is not on the cards. The budget deficit is forecast at 7 per cent of GDP this year (to June 30), due to heavy interest charges, external debt-restructuring notwithstanding. Interest costs account for 42 per cent of recurrent spending - 35 per cent domestic and 7 per cent foreign. It is clear that structural adjustment is not going to succeed without radical public sector reform. Civil service reform, in terms of freezing posts and retrenching staff, is on target, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. The real challenge is to improve accountability, transparency and efficiency right though the public sector, and especially the parastatals. Re-engineering the parastatal sector is arguably the most formidable challenge facing the government, since public enterprise inefficiency and infrastructural decay are both a heavy burden on the budget and major deterrents to new investment. Fiscal policy and the associated problems of monetary management and inflation top the policy agenda, and it is here that the scope for (and danger of) slippage is greatest, under pressure from big-spending ministers. The government is caught in a fiscal bind - stagnant revenue, reduced aid inflows, expenditure overruns, escalating interest costs, and the need to write off debt to clean up parastatal balance sheets. Over the next two years, the deficit must be trimmed to 2 per cent of GDP, implying both revenue enhancement and spending cuts. There are high hopes of the former, following the appointment of three pre-shipment import inspection agencies, whose prime task will be to monitor customs and VAT payments, thereby levelling the playing-field for local manufacturers facing competition from importers, paying bribes rather than duties to get their products into the country, while simultaneously boosting government revenue. Estimates suggest that anything for 25 to 50 per cent of taxes and duties are being evaded/ But it is impossible to reconcile heavy investment in the country's rundown and deteriorating infrastructure with fiscal stringency and domestic debt repayment, especially in a country forced to live with the withdrawal symptoms of reduced aid dependence. Traditionally, Kenya was able to rely on donor funding for development, with net disbursements of over Dollars 1bn annually in 1989-90. But those days have gone: Kenya's aid reliance ratio (aid as a percentage of GNP) fell from 13.7 per cent in 1989-90 to 7 per cent in 1991-92, when inflows declined to Dollars 780m. To achieve social stability, the economy must grow at 7 per cent annually into the next century, creating 165 000 new wage-sector jobs each year. This is a tall order, given declining rates of investment. The reforms of the past year have created a platform for self-sustaining growth, but there is a long way to go to overcome the political doubts of the recent past, to rehabilitate the public sector and create the enabling environment necessary for Asian-style growth rates. The jury is out on the sustainability of Kenyan reform, but with private enterprise markedly more bullish than before, the investment response lacking in so many parts of Africa may materialise in the latter half of the decade.</p>

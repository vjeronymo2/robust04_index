			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 13 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- Ten  activists of the Mongolian Democratic Association (MDA) have  gone on a political hunger strike at the central square of the  capital.    The MDA who was the first to appear on the political scene  has resorted to the experienced method of pressing the  authorities after nearly a one-month demands to the government  for its resignation. Four years ago the MDA by means of hunger  strike forced the then political leadership of the country the  Political Bureau of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party  (MPRP) to resign.    Prior to going on the hunger strike a rally of supporters of  the MDA has been held at the square during which the demands for  resignation of the government headed by the Premier P. Jasray  were reiterated. About 8 thousand people participated in the  rally in spite of the fact that the city authorities have not  permitted to hold an action on the main square of the country.    The democratic forces believe that the present government  has  failed to cope with the major social and economic problems of  the country apart from this there has broke out a scandal the  essence of which lies in that the former chief of the  counterintelligence service has accused the leaders of the  parliament and government of corruption and made public some  compromising facts. Four month later P. Jasray had to refer to  the court so that to succeed in getting "his dignity and honour  violated to be restored".</p>

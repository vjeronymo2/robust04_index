			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Scottish rumours Among brewers, Scottish &amp; Newcastle hardened 3 to 482p amid speculation that the group was in talks to buy the freehold of 320 public houses that it acquired last year through its purchase of the Chef &amp; Brewer chain from Grand Metropolitan. The leasehold is currently held by IEL, a joint venture between Foster's and GrandMet. Spirits and wines group Grand Metropolitan rose 5 to 403p as several brokers issued buy recommendations. The list included Goldman Sachs and Kleinwort Benson, which said: 'The power of the group's cash generation and the improving quality of profits will increasingly be appreciated as reassurance builds steadily.' Eurotunnel stood out among improving transport shares, shedding 5 to 253p as stories about a large overhang of stock forced sentiment to take a negative turn. Bombardier, the Canadian group which has supplied Eurotunnel with rolling stock and taken shares as payment, is said to be a potential seller of 29m shares. With Eurotunnel moving rapidly towards full operational running, sending more than 100 trains daily under the Channel, the Canadian company has the option to cash in its stake. The shares, some 3 per cent of the company's equity, are worth around Pounds 73m. Confirmation that BSkyB, the satellite television group, hopes to be floated on the Stock Exchange before the end of the year gave a lift to leading shareholders. Much of the news was already in share prices following an authoritative report in one Sunday newspaper. However, increased expectation that BSkyB will raise around Pounds 5bn by floating some 20 per cent of its equity helped Pearson, which holds 17.5 per cent, move ahead 8 to 590p, and Granada, with 13.5 per cent, close steady at 490 1/2 p. News Corp, the 50 per cent stakeholder, held at 229p. BSkyB has appointed Goldman Sachs and Lazard Brothers as joint advisers and co-sponsors of the potential offering. Appreciation of the Reed Elsevier purchase of Mead Corp's legal information arm saw Reed shares advance 21 to 761p. Among brokers who disseminated their views on the Pounds 950m deal, SG Warburg argued that it would enhance earnings for the Anglo/Dutch group by 4 per cent in 1995. BAT Industries rose 7 to 424p, with agency broker James Capel said to have reiterated its positive stance. Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome gained 18 at 670p as it announced that Valtrex, a new anti-viral drug being developed for the treatment of herpes, had shown 'remarkable efficacy' when used to treat shingles. The shares were also helped by US buying, as was Zeneca, up 10 at 809p. Chemicals group Laporte put on 5 at 694p as dealers said SG Warburg had shifted its stance from 'sell' to 'buy'. The house chemicals analyst was unavailable for comment. A better than expected 6.5 per cent improvement in new UK car registrations in September - taking the nine-month rise to 9.4 per cent - helped to push the motor sector higher. The news followed on from a September registration gain of 27 per cent in Spain and nearly 10 per cent in France. Among component suppliers, GKN rose 3 to 598p. Rolls-Royce saw 7m shares traded and ended 4 higher at 175p. Motor distributors were also firm, notably Lex Service, which put on 7 at 353p. Inchcape added 8 at 418p. A 3.1m block of shares in FR Group - 4 per cent of its equity - was placed at 271p, a substantial discount to the underlying market. On 6.8m volume, the busiest day ever for FR, the shares dipped 3 to 278p. GEC gained 5 at 288p as Hoare Govett improved its recommendation and emphasised the company's defensive qualities in the event of a US rate rise. Electricity groups Southern and Yorkshire were casualties in an otherwise steady sector, with dealers disappointed that the companies have not yet moved to buy in their own shares ahead of their closed periods. Yorkshire's closed period begins today, while Southern's starts on Thursday. The latter lost 11 at 715p and the former 11 1/2 at 694p. US buying lifted British Petroleum 4 to 406 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 10m shares. Retailing group Etam tumbled 21 to 282p after the company said sales in the first few weeks of the second half of the year were below expectations. High street retailer Marks and Spencer appreciated 9 to 402p in active trading of 5.4m after James Capel was said to have upgraded profits expectations and reiterated its buy stance on the shares. Kleinwort Benson was also said to favour the stock. A positive recommendation from Cazenove was said to have boosted Burton Group, which finished the session 2 1/2 ahead at 62p. The market continued to look favourably on Storehouse following Wednesday's positive trading statement. The shares appreciated 7 to 205p. There was plenty of action in the banks sector, where National Westminster responded to aggressive US buying interest, ending 6 higher at 478p and shrugging off talk of a profits downgrade by James Capel, the influential agency broking house. Capel also lowered its forecasts for HSBC and Barclays, dealers said. The latter made a poor showing, sharply underperforming the FT-SE 100 Index and finishing a penny off at 550p. HSBC managed a 7 gain at 676p. The two Scottish banks also suffered, Bank of Scotland easing 3 to 193p, still reflecting disappointment with its interim dividend and following comment on the results. United Friendly 'B' stood out in life assurances, racing up 20 to 480p.</p>

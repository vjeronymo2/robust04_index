			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arye Kiesel] </F>   [Text] Some 60 percent of Israelis support continuing the  negotiations with the PLO, according to Professor Asher Ariane  of Tel Aviv University's Center for Strategic Research.    The research is based on analysis of polls conducted between  1984 and 1994.    Seventy-one percent support autonomy in the territories,  while 31 percent support the establishment of a Palestinian  state. Support for the Oslo accord is declining but a majority  still support it.    Only six percent believe that the government is dealing  properly with the country's problems. Some 34 percent said that  the government is dealing with the issues satisfactorily, while  61 percent are dissatisfied with its handling of the situation.    Thirty-two percent believe that most Arabs aspire to  annihilate Israel and kill all the Jews. Twenty-three percent  believe that the Arabs "only want to conquer Israel."  Thirty-three percent believe that the Arabs want "to get back  the lands they lost in 1967."    On the Oslo agreement: 36 percent support a Gaza-Jericho  agreement, 25 percent "are not sure about the agreement," and 32  percent "oppose the agreement." Support for the agreement under  the latest poll is lower than in the December 1993 poll when 48  percent backed it.    Those interviewed think the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has  been weakened over the years, but that if the peace negotiations  succeed it will be able to regain its power.    Eighty-four percent believe the Gaza Strip should be  returned. Ten percent are ready to return East Jerusalem. On  the settlements: a third supports them, a quarter opposes them,  and the remainder are ready to support them for security reasons.    Fifty-five percent oppose uprooting settlements under a  permanent arrangement. Thirty-four percent are "very opposed"  to such a move, and 21 percent oppose it "to some extent." The  remainder, 45 percent, "definitely support uprooting  settlements."    On Syria, 46 percent are not prepared to return any part of  the Golan Heights while seven percent are ready to return all of  the plateau.</p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THESE HIGHPOINTERS HAVE 50 GOALS  </P> <P> Things are looking up for Doug Heroux and Bill Conroy. Again. They are  collectors, of a sort. Hobbyists with high ideals -- 50 of them.  </P> <P> The upwardly mobile duo have set their sights on reaching the highest point in  each of the 50 states, from Alaska's lordly Mount McKinley (20,320 feet) to  Florida's lowly Britton Hill (345 feet).  </P> <P> So far, the two have already bagged peaks in 26 states. More than three years  into their quest, the team is lagging a bit behind the initial goal of knocking  off 10 peaks annually for five years. They are too late to be among the first  10 climbers to complete the lofty pursuit, as they had hoped, but they should  have no trouble being part of the first 100.  </P> <P> Heroux, of Waterbury, Conn., and Conroy, from Naugatuck, Conn., aren't alone in  their quest; others are on the way up. Highpointers, a national club, was  recently formed (Heroux and Conroy are members), and now guidebooks and  organized group ascents are available to all.  </P> <P> The team's fascination for peak experiences grew out of a passion for hiking  and climbing in New Hampshire's White Mountains, still their favorite spot for  training. Their idea of a good time is a midwinter climb up Mount Washington.  There, on the Nelson Craig trail just a few weeks ago, Heroux was tromping  through waist-deep snow and Conroy was blown 40 feet by a gust of wind. That  was fun. And they actually liked waking up in a hoarfrost-coated tent, their  drinking water transformed into a chunk of ice.  </P> <P> Connecticut's highest point is on a shoulder of Mount Frissell, a mountain  whose peak rises in Massachusetts. It is a hill they know well.  </P> <P> "It's our practice mountain," Heroux said. "We've done it in winter, in summer,  in the rain, in the mud, in the dark."  </P> <P> Frissell is basically a walk-up, and for Heroux and Conroy, a breeze.  </P> <P> Other summits are even easier; some require no climbing at all. The two sloshed  across cornfields in a Winnebago all the way to the roof of Nebraska. At least  half the nation's high points are within equally easy reach.  </P> <P> But even easily climbed mountains may harbor unexpected challenges. An angry  bull gave chase while the two were high-pointing in North Dakota. To reach  their goal, Heroux and Conroy had to figure out how to get around the  cantankerous beast.  </P> <P> And more malevolent obstacles may await. Some high points are on private  property where trespassers -- even those who ask permission -- aren't welcome.  "I heard shotguns are involved in some of the high points," Heroux said.  </P> <P> A few top spots are demanding, though, and four are very difficult:  Washington's Mount Rainier, Wyoming's Gannett Peak, Alaska's Mount McKinley and  Montana's Granite Peak. These require advanced climbing skills.  </P> <P> McKinley is so daunting that when Conroy first thought of topping out in 50  states, he listed the high points and then nixed the idea. No way could he  climb to the summit of North America's highest mountain. People die there.  </P> <P> About 15 years later, he teamed up with Heroux. The two decided to dust off the  list of high points and hit the trail.  </P> <P> At Mount Frissell a few weeks ago, Heroux and Conroy are preparing for their  climb beneath a threatening pewter-gray sky. They will curl around Bear  Mountain, cut across the stony dome of Round Mountain, plunge into a valley and  chug up the steep rocky brow of Frissell. In all, a hike of 8 to 10 miles.  </P> <P> Heading out of a trail-head parking lot, Heroux, a stringbean of a guy,  shoulders a 35-pound backpack stuffed with essentials: a few plastic jars of  premixed Tang, a couple of candy bars, a few pieces of triple fudge cake and  plenty of pricey outdoor gear. "Just in case there's a white-out, I'll have  everything we could need," he says. Mostly though, the heavy pack is carried  for exercise.  </P> <P> Conroy, a Kenny Loggins lookalike, carries nothing. The 40-year-old gets his  exercise in more perverse ways -- donning a 60-pound backpack, for example, and  boarding a treadmill set at maximum incline for a one-hour workout. Or maybe  he'll run a few miles; he plans to compete in the New York marathon this fall.  </P> <P> The two plod toward Frissell with the measured pace of those accustomed to  walking great distances: sure and steady. They don't waste breath talking. The  clank of caribiners (metal rings that fasten ropes to the metal spikes used in  climbing) dangling from Heroux's pack fills the silence -- that, and the squeak  of his Day-Glo green hiking boots.  </P> <P> Their path threads thickets of shoulder-high mountain laurel, fords creeks, and  meanders through forests thick with mixed hardwoods. Hiking has little appeal,  says Conroy. What drives them onward is the challenge of reaching a peak.  </P> <P> Sometimes the two practice climbing techniques while dangling like spiders from  ropes in the rafters of a warehouse Conroy uses for his moving business.  Heroux, 32, is a self-employed plumber. "We needed time to hike," Heroux  explains. "So we both started our own business."  </P> <P> They also needed time to get in shape. Conditioning is the key to reaching the  top of the tough summits.  </P> <P> Take Mount McKinley. There, climbers fly into a base camp on the Kahiltna  Glacier, rope together, then stagger upward through oxygen-thin air, ever wary  of yawning crevasses. With each climber lugging more than 100 pounds of gear,  reaching the summit often takes two or more weeks. During their attempt last  May, Heroux and Conroy said they felt lost in the gaping vastness, dwarfed by  the mountain's gargantuan scale.  </P> <P> Eventually, altitude sickness forced Conroy to turn back at 11,000 feet. "My  lungs filled with fluid," he said. "I could hear them gurgling. That worried me  a little."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Heroux and a group of other climbers and guides pressed on to 17,000  feet -- eight hours from the summit -- only to be hammered by a storm and  nailed down for days. "We were holding on for dear life," he said.  </P> <P> The storm-enforced idleness depleted their food supplies, so the summit  remained elusive for Heroux, too. They plan to try again.  </P> <P> Another tough climb, one the duo did notch, was Washington's Mount Rainier.  </P> <P> It was on their first visit to the mountain, a tourist trip to a place called  Paradise, that the men hatched their 50-state scheme. Awed by Rainier's beauty,  they decided to return the next year, take lessons and make the climb. They  figured if they could reach Rainier's summit, they could hit the other 49 high  points. A year later, they came, they saw and they conquered.  </P> <P> Not everyone understands their high-minded obsession. "When you tell people you  drove all the way to Delaware to stand in the middle of the street (where that  state's high point is located), they think you're pretty strange," said Heroux.  </P> <P> But in a sense, the high point quest is just an excuse to travel. "That's the  key to this whole thing -- to see the country," said Heroux. "I don't want to  travel to England or something, there's so much to see in the U.S." Each trip  has been duly recorded -- complete with maps and photos -- in a series of  leather-bound scrapbooks kept by Heroux. After nabbing all 50 high points, he  wants to hit every national park in the country.  </P> <P> Until their next major mountain assault, the two are content in dreaming up  variations on a theme, new ways to reconquer nearby peaks. Lately they've  plotted a way to bag the high point in each of seven states within a single  24-hour span. They'll start at the top of Backbone Mountain (3,360 feet) in  Maryland, then race to Delaware and on to New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut  and Massachusetts. The climax would be Rhode Island's Jerimoth Hill: "You  arrive at the top of a hill, park the car, see if the dog's chained, walk into  a guy's backyard and stand on a rock." Heroux said. "You've done Rhode Island."  </P></p>

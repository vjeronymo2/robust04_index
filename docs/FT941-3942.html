			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Arts: Rattle's music of political upheaval - Concert The 'Towards the Millennium' music project, instigated by Simon Rattle, is gaining new allies. As it progresses decade by decade on its exploration of the 20th century, the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the Nash Ensemble have joined the musical line-up, while coverage of the other arts has expanded to take in literature, education and environmental artists. Perhaps the lure of the 1930s for this year's programme was just too great. That was the decade in which music became caught up in momentous political upheaval and reflected world affairs more urgently than at any time before. Barely any European composer remained unaffected. Some (Bartok and Schoenberg) were uprooted from their home countries. Others wrote openly (Britten and Tippett) or ambiguously (Shostakovich) in protest. The stockmarkets may have crashed, but in the world of music there was no depression, no slump, no sign of artistic energy lying untapped. For Rattle the choice was almost impossibly wide, given the number of strong personalities clamouring for inclusion. By and large he has not tried to group the composers in schools or nationalities. The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra's concerts simply bring together acknowledged masterpieces in balanced programmes. It may come as a surprise to realise how central a place the music of the 1930s plays in our concert-life. Almost all the music in Rattle's series is familiar, bar a couple of the short Gershwin pieces and Stravinsky's Persephone, which is not heard that often. In Thursday's concert there was also Varese's Ionisation, a five-minute display of percussion which has acquired rarity value on account of asking for 13 players on 40 different instruments. The two main works called for equally large orchestral forces. In Berg's Violin Concerto, representative of the Austro-German tradition, the soloist was Gidon Kremer. He was not relaxed and deep-toned in the music like Anne-Sophie Mutter at the Proms, but wiry, nervously introspective, the tension coiled tight within. In the closing pages he could hardly have played more quietly and it was a shame that the CBSO could not match his hushed eloquence. Unwanted strands of the orchestral accompaniment kept protruding at the wrong moments. Although it does not carry any specific agenda, Shostakovich's Fourth Symphony is one of the key political works of the decade, withdrawn before its first performance in fear of Stalin's disapproval. No wonder, when its music is nearly anarchic, setting out to break the symphonic status quo. The programme-note talked of a mechanical element, but Rattle was anything but mechanical. In his hands passages of sadness and longing, of humour and sincerity appeared alongside the sarcasm and savagery. The CBSO was on sharper form here. A performance of this symphony should always be shattering and this one was no exception. Sponsored by Bankers Trust Company.

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Poverty in Latin America 'outweighing growth' Latin America has shown signs of a new economic dynamism this year, but current rates of growth remain remain insufficient to have much impact on the region's poverty levels, the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean says today. In its annual preliminary economic overview, Eclac says regional growth this year rose to 3.7 per cent, from 3.2 per cent last year. Average regional inflation - excluding Brazil, whose inflation rate has fallen substantially in the second half - fell to 16 per cent, from 19 per cent last year. The 1994 growth performance was the second strongest in 14 years, and resulted in per capita growth of 1.9 per cent. Despite this, the commission said: 'Growth rates of less than 4 per cent are not enough to allow great advances in the fight against poverty, nor to prevent unemployment and underemployment from remaining unacceptably high.' Growth rates in Latin America had converged over recent years. Only three economies - Guyana, Argentina and Peru - grew by more than than 5 per cent this year, with Peru expanding by 11 per cent. Three contracted: Haiti by 6 per cent, Venezuela by 4 per cent, and Honduras. Imports rose by 15 per cent this year to Dollars 171bn (Pounds 110bn), after growth of 8 per cent in 1993, with imports growing fastest in Peru (36 per cent), Argentina and Brazil (25 per cent each). But exports rose by 14 per cent, after 5 per cent growth in 1993, to Dollars 153bn. This was helped by increases in prices of non-fuel raw materials, for the first time since 1989, and by an 8 per cent expansion in export volumes. The regional trade deficit grew from Dollars 15bn to Dollars 18bn, and the current account deficit rose from Dollars 46bn to Dollars 50bn, with increasing debt servicing and other factor payments also contributing. This was more than covered by capital inflows of an estimated Dollars 57bn, down from Dollars 65bn in 1993. Episodes of capital flight in Mexico and Venezuela 'did not have repercussions in other countries,' Eclac notes. The region accumulated hard currency reserves of a further Dollars 7bn in 1994, against a Dollars 20bn increase in 1993, despite falls of Dollars 9bn in Mexico's reserves and Dollars 4.5bn in Venezuela's. Of the Dollars 57bn of inflows this year, Dollars 17bn came through bond issues, a sharp reduction on 1993, about Dollars 5bn through the issue of shares in foreign markets, and an estimated Dollars 15bn in foreign direct investment. The region's debt rose 5.8 per cent to Dollars 534bn, despite Brady debt reduction deals for Brazil, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic. But, because of the rise in exports, the region's debt-to-export ratio fell from 302 per cent to 280 per cent, the lowest level since the start of the debt crisis.</p>

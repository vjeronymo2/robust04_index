			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Britain and nuclear power The government has laid the ground well for a properly searching review of the nuclear power industry with the publication yesterday of its terms of reference. Ministers now need to make sure that the controversy which will surround the review does not distort or delay the answers. The analysis, repeatedly postponed, comes at a crucial point, as Britain's ageing Magnox reactors reach the end of their lives. Its conclusions will determine whether nuclear power has a future in Britain, or whether it will be snuffed out as existing plants close. If there is to be a future, it must be different from the past. Despite the industry's appetite for state subsidy, it has failed to fulfil its promises of delivering limitless cheap electricity or world-class technological expertise. For those reasons, the government is right to have drawn its terms of reference much more broadly than parts of the industry wished. The review will encompass questions of nuclear decommissioning and environmental impact, as well as the economic issues. The Department of the Environment will also hold a separate, complementary review into the disposal of radioactive waste. Most controversy will surround the government's comments that it will 'consider without commitment' the possibility of privatising the industry. But as Mr Timothy Eggar, energy minister, said yesterday, privatisation is unlikely before the next general election. The debate is also secondary to the central question of whether Britain wants more nuclear power. The answer to that question should depend entirely on whether nuclear power can deliver electricity as cheaply as other available fuels. According to Nuclear Electric, the generator, future reactors built to the latest designs could do so. Economies of scale, plus lessons learnt in building Sizewell B in Suffolk, mean that construction and operating costs will be lower than in the past, it argues. That claim, which has aroused scepticism on many sides, needs to be vigorously tested. It assumes that new plants will run at 85 per cent capacity, and that costs will not run over budgets, both questionable given the industry's record. The estimate also discounts the cost of capital at a rate that may be too low if private finance is employed. The government should insist that details of these calculations are published, and not withheld on grounds of commercial confidentiality. The competitiveness of nuclear power also depends on its environmental impact. Unlike fossil fuels, it does not emit carbon dioxide and sulphur, implicated in global warming and acid rain. The review should attempt to put values, however imprecise, on these benefits, and to weigh them fully against the costs of disposing of radioactive waste. But preserving British expertise in nuclear technology should form no part of the case for nuclear power. The UK has lost its historic lead in developing civil nuclear technology. If the review decides that more plants are justified, generators should be freed of any obligation to buy British. Politically, there is no comfortable outcome: deciding to build more plants or to extinguish the industry will arouse protest. The best that can be achieved is for a conclusion to be reached in the light of all relevant facts.</p>

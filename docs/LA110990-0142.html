			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA PALMA;  </P> <P> HERMAN AND DUKE CLAIM REELECTION  </P> <P> Although votes for write-in candidate Wally Linn have not been fully tabulated,  incumbents Larry A. Herman and Orbrey Duke are claiming victory after this  week's election.  </P> <P> The top vote-getter was Duke, a retired chief of police, followed by Herman.  </P> <P> Challengers Christian Basquette and Kenneth Tipton finished in third and fourth  place in the race for two open seats.  </P> <P> The county registrar of voters won't finish counting Linn's votes until  Tuesday. Linn, 51, is seen as a possible threat to the incumbents by some  political observers.  </P> <P> "Everybody is going to be waiting anxiously for the count," said Linn a real  estate broker. "I am certainly optimistic."  </P> <P> However, Herman disagreed. "I don't think it will be a factor. I am looking  forward to another four years."  </P> <P> Tipton, a controversial former councilman who resigned his seat in 1986 after  being censured by the council, ran an on-again off-again campaign. In early  October he announced that he was pulling out of the race, only to resume his  campaign a few weeks later. However, his name remained on the ballot.  </P> <P> Never really serious about his candidacy, Basquette, 21, said he was running  because he wanted to do more than vote.LYNDA NATALI  </P></p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Wesfarmers advances WESFARMERS, the Australian agribusiness group, lifted net earnings by 10.9 per cent to ADollars 70.5m (USDollars 47.6m) in the June year on a 36 per cent sales rise to Dollars A1.7bn. The annual dividend has been raised from 26 cents to 29 cents a share. The results reflect a full-year contribution from the company's 47 per cent owned associate, Bunnings, the Australian timber group. Wesfarmers said it benefited from lower working capital requirements which allowed interest expense to fall from ADollars 32.6m to ADollars 27.4m. But the fertiliser division suffered from Australia's rural recession and directors said the outlook remained subdued. The result excluded abnormal profits of ADollars 3.8m against a ADollars 514,000 loss previously. Tax provision took ADollars 34m against ADollars 39.5m and de-preciation ADollars 68.3m against Dollars A59.1m.</p>

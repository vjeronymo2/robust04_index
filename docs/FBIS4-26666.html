			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, June 24 (XINHUA) -- China's leading inland  waterway shipping company has developed a new strategy to expand  shipping capacity along the Chang Jiang River.    The Chang Jiang River Shipping Corporation (Group) plans to  extend its navigation routes both to the east and west along the  country's longest river, so that foreign vessels can directly  transport their cargoes to the inland areas.    As the first trial shipping enterprise group designated by  the State Council, the corporation now has 110,000 employees and  2,548 ships, with fixed assets of 5.26 billion yuan (about 650  million U.S. dollars).    Its annual handling capacity of goods is 80 million tons, 51  percent of the total along the Yangtze. It can also carry 35  million passengers a year, 99 percent of the total.    China has given approval to 13 Chang Jiang ports to open to  foreign vessels. Now 10,000-dwt [deadweight ton] ships can  reach Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province, and 5,000-dwt ships  can anchor at Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province.    By the end of March this year more than 3,000 foreign ships  had entered the Yangtze.    Over 50 Chang Jiang ports in Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi and  Hubei provinces have established shipping ties with 50 foreign  counterparts.    The Chang Jiang flows 6,300 km from the Qinghai-Tibet  plateau  to Shanghai, where it empties into the sea. The river is the  third-longest in the world, after the Nile and the Amazon.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (17): People-carriers could even reshape the markets - Minivans Vehicle makers are betting that European buyers will like the people-carriers that are being planned for the next few years. Between them, they are laying down an extra 400,000 units a year to serve a market which, in the mid-1980s, amounted to only 35,000 units. There will probably be customers for them. But it seems very bold to risk large sums on a niche which still accounts for less than 1 per cent of the overall market. Indeed, the phenomenon is so recent that the category does not yet have a universally accepted name. The Americans call them minivans. Most Europeans refer to them as people-carriers or multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs). In France, the Academie francaise pronounced that the correct title is monospace. Whatever the vehicles are called, they are distinctive enough. They are the tall vans with three rows of seats and accommodation for seven. Their attraction for large families is obvious. But their appeal in the future may be so wide that it reshapes the company and executive car markets. Europe's best known example is the Espace, built by Matra and sold by Renault. It captured almost half of all minivan sales last year. This amounted to about 46,000 units out of a western European total of 98,000, according to Ms Carol Thomas, manager of DRI/McGraw Hill's European light truck service. More importantly, it is a highly profitable niche for Renault. Europe remains loose change compared with the performance of last year's minivan market in the US. More than 877,000 units were sold there, with Chrysler's contenders taking 45 per cent of the market. Neither did the popularity of minivans in America go un- noticed by Japanese companies, which developed strong contenders for the business. It was a little too strong for Detroit's Big Three, which asked the US Commerce Department to investigate Japanese pricing policies. The result was the recent Commerce Department ruling that Toyota and Mazda are dumping minivans in the US. The experiences could give Japan's car makers a flying start as Europe's minivan market starts take off. Chrysler introduced America to the minivan a decade ago as part of its crucial restructuring. It is such a success that the company and the category are almost synonymous. Now Chrysler is hoping to repeat the trick in Europe. Its Eurostar joint venture in Graz with Steyr-Daimler-Puch, the diversified Austrian engineering group, started assembling Voyager minivans last October. Production is slowly being built up. It will move to an annualised rate of 27,000 units in August, and double that by 1994-95. 'This plant can do 50,000, and 100,000 with ease,' said Mr Lee Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, at the plant's formal dedication in April. It may have to if Chrysler wants to repeat its American market share in Europe. DRI/Mccraw-Hill's growth predictions for the European segment over the next five years see it moving from last year's total of just under 100,000 units to about 400,000. That would represent an 11-fold increase in little more than a decade - growth unmatched by any other significant sector of the car market. Minivan sales are unlikely to reach the volumes they have in America, even though Europe's car market is larger. The reason, according to professor Garel Rhys of Cardiff Business School, is lack of space. 'Often these products (in America) are the replacement of the fifth car,' he says. 'You can't even park one car in Fulham. Where do you put two or three?' Prof Rhys, a motor industry economist, adds: 'In Europe, we have a much higher population density. That's going to put a top on buying vehicles much sooner than you'll see in places like New Zealand, South Africa, Canada and the rest.' Ms Thomas believes many European minivans will increasingly be bought at the expense of large cars and estates. She thinks they have distinct image advantages over more utilitarian estate cars, such as lofty, Range Rover-style visibility and more futuristic styling. Unquestionably, the size of the segment will be dictated by the arrival of all the new models planned for the next few years. Car makers will be in trouble if they don't find homes for all the vehicles they will then be capable of making. The development will also spell the end of the Espace's current market domination, which leaves the Chrysler Voyager, Toyota Previa, Nissan Prairie and a few others mopping up the oddments. As the Austrian Voyager factory gathers speed, Nissan's Motor Iberica unit in Barcelona will start making a model to be known as the Serena. Production begins this September, and will eventually reach 50,000 a year. With 80 per cent local content - including petrol engines from Nissan in Britain - it will not be subject to all the sales curbs imposed on cars imported from Japan. There will then be a slight lull in European activity before two substantial joint ventures reach fruition in 1994, those between Peugeot and Fiat and Volkswagen and Ford. The intention in each case is to share design and development costs, but to market the products in competition. Peugeot and Fiat are investing FFr5bn to bring their shared vehicle to market. It will be made at a rate of up to 120,000 a year in a new facility near Valenciennes, northern France. The Dollars 2.8bn VW/Ford collaboration is at a new factory being built in Setabul, Portugal. It will come on stream at the end of 1994, and will have an eventual annual capacity of 180,000. All this activity would leave General Motors as the only main European maker without a competitor in the class. However, reports from Detroit suggest the corporation will plug the gap in its model line-up by having its European Opel and Vauxhall dealers sell a new, US-made minivan from 1995. So far, none of the lower volume, upmarket companies has announced any production plans for minivans, though Mercedes-Benz exhibited a concept vehicle early last year. Volvo is in a good position to join the segment thanks to its steadily increasing ties with Renault, the category's market leader. Each company has stressed that all future models will start with shared chassis and drivelines.</p>

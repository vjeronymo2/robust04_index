			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TOP RETAILERS REPORT MIXED OCTOBER SALES;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: CLOTHING STORES DID RELATIVELY WELL. BIG-TICKET ITEMS SOLD POORLY  DURING THE MONTH.  </P> <P> The country's big retailers today reported mixed October sales, with results at  some general merchandise stores hurt by consumers' reluctance to spend freely  on expensive goods, such as furniture or home appliances.  </P> <P> Clothing retailers fared better than major national chains that depend heavily  on sales of big-ticket durable goods.  </P> <P> In some parts of the country, particularly the Northeast, however, unseasonably  mild weather discouraged shopping for winter apparel.  </P> <P> "They were generally modest kinds of sales gains that continued the basic trend  of the past several months," said analyst Jeffrey Feiner of Merrill Lynch &amp;  Co.  </P> <P> Sears, Roebuck and Co., the largest U.S. retailer, said its sales edged up 0.7%  in the four weeks ended Oct. 28 to $2.53 billion from $2.51 billion a year  earlier.  </P> <P> But sales at Sears stores open at least a year, called same-store or  comparable-store sales, were flat.  </P> <P> Retailers and analysts regard same-store sales as a better reflection of a  company's performance than tallies that include the take at newly opened  stores.  </P> <P> Feiner said results for some of the retailers looked slightly worse than they  were because they were being compared to sales during a strong month last year.  </P> <P> Analysts said it was difficult to generalize about last month's retailing  business because the results varied so widely. Economists track retailers'  results closely for clues about spending patterns. Consumer spending accounts  for about two-thirds of total U.S. economic output.  </P> <P> "The numbers were really mixed, more so than we've seen in previous months,"  said retail analyst Jeffrey Edelman of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.  </P> <P> Within the apparel category alone there were variations. Moderate to  higher-priced clothing merchants posted fairly strong results while apparel  sales at discounters lagged, analysts said.  </P> <P> Among some of retailers reporting:  </P> <P>  -- K mart Corp., the second-largest retailer, said its October sales increased  5.3% to $2.07 billion from $1.97 billion in October, 1988. Its comparable-store  sales were up 2.1%.  </P> <P>  -- Third-ranked Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported a 22% increase in October sales  to $2.19 billion from $1.79 billion. Wal-Mart's same-stores sales grew 8%.  </P> <P>  -- J. C. Penney Co. Inc. reported a 9.6% October sales gain to $1.28 billion  from $1.17 billion. Penney's same-store sales rose 8.2%.  </P> <P>  -- Dayton Hudson Corp. reported October sales went up 16.2% to $969 million  from $834 million. Its same-store sales rose 8.5%.  </P> <P>  -- Limited Inc., a leading specialty apparel retailer, said its sales rose 9%  to $334.9 million from $307.7 million. On a comparable-store basis, Limited's  sales were up 6%.  </P></p>

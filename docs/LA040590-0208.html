			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Bank of New England to Cut 5,600 Jobs: Bank of New England said 5,000 job cuts,  representing a third of its employees, will take place by year-end and are part  of a strategic plan to stabilize the ailing bank. About 1,700 employees will be  told over the next couple of days that they are no longer needed, and the  remaining jobs will be cut through attrition, consolidations or through  continued planned asset sales, the bank said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Beverly Chau] </F>   [Text] Beijing plans to break its own tax reform rules by  offering tax breaks to the two domestic airlines which have been  given approval to seek listings abroad. The planned relief will  cut their enterprise income tax (EIT) by nearly half.    The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) is  currently negotiating with the State Tax Bureau to reduce EIT  paid by China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines from  the unified 33 per cent tax rate down to 18 per cent, according  to reliable sources. The tax reduction is proposed as a  subsidies arrangement, under which the two airlines would submit  the full amount to the tax bureau first, after which 15 per cent  would be returned to the CAAC, which looks after the whole  family of state-run airlines in China. The concessionary period  will run for two or three years under details still being  finalised by the State Council. The planned tax cuts would save  the two airlines about US$4.5 million (about HK$34.7 million)  per year.    Alfred Shum, partner of Ernst and Young, said the tax cut  would give a facelift to the airlines' profit forecasts. Their  annual income currently amounts to about US$30 million each.  Beijing is determined to develop its lucrative aviation  business, which has long been enjoying a premium 18 per cent  EIT, compared to a tax rate which sometimes reached 55 per cent  for domestic enterprises before the tax reform came into effect  on January 1.    Other main state-run airlines including Air China, China  Northern Airlines, China Northwest Airlines and China Northeast  Airlines are also on the list to benefit from the tax cut  measures. But business insiders said the concessions would  arouse jealousy among the remainder of the second batch of 22  companies seeking overseas listings. Mr Shum said he believed  the tax breaks could set a precedent for the other companies  seeking overseas listings.    Joseph Fu, partner of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, said China  would be unfair if it granted tax concessions to only one  industry. "China will appear to overrule its own rationale to  achieve the unification of income tax rules if it does give the  tax premium to the aviation industry," he said.    Li Yonggui, general deputy commissioner of the State Tax  Bureau, denied tax concessions had been granted to the two  airlines. "We have always been trying to unify the tax system.  Although we granted tax privileges to lower the first batch of  H-share companies' EIT rates by 15 per cent, we are not going to  repeat it this time," said Mr Li.</p>

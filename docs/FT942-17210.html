			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Germany On the surface, it looks as though the great bond market decoupling has finally started. In late March, 10-year German and US government bonds were virtually neck-and-neck in yield terms, but German issues escaped the steep falls suffered by the US market after last week's jobs data. Now they yield some 80 basis points less than their US equivalents. At the short end of the curve, decoupling is clearly under way. The Bundesbank has cut its money market repurchase rate by 24 basis points since the start of March, showing that German rates can fall while those in the US rise. This is not difficult when the repurchase rate is still above its US counterpart. How far the process will flow through into longer maturities is another matter. For German bunds to trade consistently at a lower yield than US Treasuries requires an expectation that the D-Mark will strengthen against the dollar. Despite yesterday's advance, the dollar is still lower than it was when the Federal Reserve started tightening in February. But the consensus expectation remains for it to rise, and that is what counts. Nor are domestic German buyers returning to the bond market in force. Perhaps they are waiting for further Bundesbank rate cuts, which could also be hastened by a weaker dollar; perhaps tax worries limit the attractions even of a 6.3 per cent yield. Whatever the cause, it is hard to believe the German market is suddenly free of transatlantic influence.</p>

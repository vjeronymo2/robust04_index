			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> SIMPLE STORIES OF POOR CHILDREN'S URGENT PLIGHT  </P> <P> Avert your eyes from the grimy figure sleeping in a doorway. Feel the frisson  of fear induced by the sight of abject poverty. Could you ever end up like  that? What would happen to your family?  </P> <P> "America's Children: The Poorest in a Land of Plenty," airing Sunday at 10 a.m.  on Channel 4, asks you to go beyond fear -- or pity or contempt -- and see the  faces behind the poverty statistics. Particularly the youngest faces.  </P> <P> Remarkable for its eloquent black-and-white still photographs by Pulitzer  Prize-winner Eli Reed, the hourlong film, produced by the National Council of  Churches as part of "The Promise of America II" series, profiles the lives of  seven parents and their children in a struggle for survival with dignity.  </P> <P> In clear, measured tones, narrator Maya Angelou ("I Know Why the Caged Bird  Sings") offers an inexorable list of statistics, presented as poetry and pulpit  exhortation.  </P> <P> "Cry out in shame" is the program's repeated demand.  </P> <P> We must feel shame that we allow 13 million children to live in poverty,  Angelou tells us, and that the United States and South Africa are the only two  industrialized nations out of 20 that don't provide comprehensive prenatal and  child care.  </P> <P> In contrast, those profiled -- chosen from the West and East coasts, the  Midwest and the South -- tell their stories simply. Teen-agers fear shabby  clothes will earn them ridicule, a little girl wishes for a baby doll, a farmer  grieves for his lost land, a woman can't have a necessary operation.  </P> <P> One mother wants to reassure us that poor people are "OK" people, not threats  of some kind.  </P> <P> And these are the fortunate ones. They are being given a lifeline by a few  church and community groups to help them climb out of the deepening pit of  "dependency, crime and joblessness."  </P> <P> Urgency, not subtlety, is the tone here: We can fix the problem, we are told,  but if we ignore the plight of others it could be "the bankruptcy of all our  dreams."

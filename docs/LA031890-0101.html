			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN THE GARDEN: GARDENING;  </P> <P> NEW ZEALAND SHRUB FEELS AT HOME  </P> <P> Arriving at nurseries right about now are the many varieties of one of Southern  California's best shrubs, the leptospermums, also known as New Zealand tea  trees, because the leaves were apparently used to prevent scurvy on sailing  ships a long way from home.  </P> <P> Though they grow almost like native plants here, they originally came from  those islands, where they are known as manukas. They are fast-growing, drought  resistant, pest-free and flower in winter and early spring.  </P> <P> Though some never seem to stop flowering (but this has to do with pruning),  they generally begin in the late fall and peak now. March is their month, when  they finally come into full, fat flower, which is why nurseries stock up on  leptospermums at this time of the year.  </P> <P> This is definitely the only way to buy them -- in full flower -- because the  names are much confused and the colors distinct enough to require seeing in  person before any decision is made. In flower you can see that those called  "pink" are quite rosy, and usually not a clear pink, and that the reds are  ruby-like or burgundy and nothing like a fire engine.  </P> <P> Like most plants from the Southern Hemisphere, their colors are a bit different  than those of us on this half of the globe are accustomed to, and they don't  always blend harmoniously without a little effort on the planter's part.  </P> <P> The double-white varieties are certainly safe in any color scheme, and are  probably the prettiest of all since they look remarkably like fruit tree  blossoms. The best known of the hybrid leptospermums is the one named 'Ruby  Glow,' which has deep ruby-red or oxblood blossoms that are also double. They  look all the more handsome because the slender, sliver-like leaves are also  tinged with red. This was one of the first to be introduced by pioneer plant  breeder Walter E. Lammerts, who hybridized a number of leptospermums while at  UCLA in the 1940s.  </P> <P> (A remarkable man, he also hybridized eastern lilacs ('Lavender lady') for  Descanso Gardens; California lilacs, or ceanothus ('Sierra Blue'); peach trees  (the 'Daily News' series), plus a number of roses and camellias.)  </P> <P> In New Zealand and Australia there are many kinds of leptospermums and quite a  few have found their way to our shores, but the best known, including 'Ruby  Glow,' are hybrids of Leptospermum scoparium. These are the ones with the  prettiest flowers, and they fall into roughly two groups.  </P> <P> There are those with reddish foliage and dark-red flowers. 'Ruby Glow' is one  of these. Others include 'Red Damask,' 'Winter Cheer' and 'Crimson Glory,'  which along with 'Ruby Queen' grow to about 10 feet, though they can be kept  around 6 feet with pruning. Two other red-flowered, red-foliaged cultivars get  a few feet taller -- 'Burgundy Queen' and 'Atlantis,' which has perhaps the  reddest foliage.  </P> <P> The other group grows taller, to 12 feet given the opportunity. These have  green foliage and include 'Blossom' with blush-pink double flowers; 'Pink  Pearl,' with its pink buds and white double flowers; 'Martinii' with single  white and rose flowers; 'Helene Strybing' with single, deep-pink flowers, and  'Sunyasia' a rose pink with large flowers.  </P> <P> 'Fascination,' a double pink, is the shortest of this lot, growing to only 8 or  10 feet, though there is one named 'Nanum Tui' that supposedly grows to only 3  feet, though New Zealand books put it at closer to 6.  </P> <P> The shortest is probably 'Pink Cascade,' a low, spreading variant that would  make a fine bank cover, growing about 2 feet tall by 10 feet wide, but most of  the common leptospermums are big shrubs. Even with regular pruning it is  difficult to keep them under a window at 6 feet tall, and it is not too hard to  spot examples of leptospermums that their owners are having a hard time keeping  in bounds.  </P> <P> Because they flower profusely when only a foot tall, and because their branches  and leaves are so light and airy, many gardeners must assume that what they've  bought is going to be a small shrub. But, figure 10 feet tall, and as big  around, for most. A few will even assume small tree proportions in time.  </P> <P> This is no reason not to plant them, just give them room to grow. They are  particularly attractive against the walls of a house, which shows off their  delicate structure, but don't put them in front of windows or too close to  doors.  </P> <P> They are also handsome in front of taller, dark-green shrubs with larger  leaves, and in front of dark fences. They are not much of a screen since they  are not dense.  </P> <P> In most gardens, they should be pruned every year after flowering. Pruning  helps slow them down and it encourages a second round of flowers (which is why  some appear to bloom all year).  </P> <P> The flowers come on new growth, so if you cut them back, they immediately make  new growth and then flower a few months later.  </P> <P> Don't prune with a hedge shear, however. Prune by taking out entire branches  back to a secondary branch, thereby removing enough growth to make the plant  smaller without destroying its natural grace.  </P> <P> As an example, find one branch, follow it down past two or three side branches  and then make your cut just above another side branch that faces up or out from  the plant. Do this to each branch until the desired effect is achieved.  </P> <P> The flowering branches, incidentally, are excellent cut, lasting several days  in a vase.  </P> <P> Other than pruning, there is little to do. Leptospermums can take being watered  along with everything else, or they can be left to fend for themselves, with  only an occasional irrigation inland where the summers get really hot.  </P> <P> The best time to plant is in the fall, or right away, so the plants are  established by summer. Even then, they will need frequent watering the first  summer since they do not have their roots deep in the soil yet.  </P> <P> They do like a location with full sun. They are not fussy about soil, and  require no special soil preparation, and no fertilizer in most situations.  </P> <P> They just grow happily (and rapidly) and flower. And, in the middle of winter  and in early spring, those flowers are a delight.  </P></p>

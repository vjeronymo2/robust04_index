			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kenan Akin from Kiev] </F>   [Excerpt] Chief of General Staff Dogan Gures, whom we met  while seeing President Demirel off to Kiev, announced that  Russia is posing a greater danger to Turkey than it used to  during the Cold War. Stressing that our northern neighbor has  started threatening our borders, General Gures said: "I  inserted this fact into the official records of one of the NATO  meetings."    During our airport meeting, we asked the chief of General  Staff his views on relations between the Russian Federation and  Turkey, military and political developments abroad, and the  latest developments concerning the PKK [Kurdish Workers Party].  The chief of General Staff, who for the first time felt the  need to reply to the abundant verbal threats against our country  coming from the officials of the Russian Federation, said  "Russia is now posing a greater threat than it used to during  the Cold War," and added: "Russia is also threatening our  borders. Each day it flies 40 planes to Armenia, which is at  war with Azerbaijan. It is sending arms and military hardware  on board these planes."    When asked about the latest developments in relations  between  the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic and Turkey, he made the  following assessment: "Nakhichevan is not in danger. This is  because Turkey has already expressed its resolute position on  this matter. There is no need to repeat that. Besides, a very  important Azerbaijani military force, a brigade, is stationed in  Nakhichevan. For these reasons, it will not be easy to attack  Nakhichevan."    Disclosing that in one of NATO meetings last year he  strongly  objected to the Russian chief of General Staff's statement that  they would sent Russian forces to the former Soviet republics  and regional countries, Gen. Gures said: "In reaction, I  inserted into NATO official records the need to send a  multinational force under CSCE supervision." Noting that at  this same meeting the German chief of General Staff supported  his views on this matter, Gures said that "thus Russia's  dangerous intentions were obstructed."    The chief of General Staff reiterated the existence of the  Russian threat by saying: "I repeat, Russia now poses a far  greater threat than it used to during the Cold War era." He  continued with the following important statements and  assessments: "Russia wants to annex Crimea. I want to draw  attention to this fact. The Turks in Crimea are in a critical  situation. Our esteemed president is visiting Ukraine at such a  critical period. And, look at Georgia, where Russia is on the  verge of bringing that country under its control. The Russians  want to send troops to Azerbaijan, but the latter is resisting  it."    Asked to comment on reports that a coup is being prepared  against Azerbaijani President Aliyev, Gures said: "They cannot  do anything to Aliyev, but unfortunately such preparations  exist."  <H5>  Apo Is Finished </H5>   In reply to our question on the PKK, General Gures said the  operations have been very successful and this separatist  organization started to vanish sooner than expected. Gures  said: "I thought they would surrender in September. But it  happened sooner than that. I can state that the PKK, which is  now on the verge of collapse, will eventually turn into an urban  terror organization. The PKK will become an organization like  Dev-Sol [Revolutionary Left Organization]."    Asked what will become of Apo [alias for PKK leader Abdullah  Ocalan], Gures said: "I do not know.... He might flee. He is  already looking for a place to escape to." [passage omitted]</p>

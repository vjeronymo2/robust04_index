			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / How To Spend It: Sofa so good WHEREAS five years or so ago sofas came plumply stuffed and covered in flora of every shape and hue, these days they come classically proportioned and covered in creamy canvas or one of the crisp cotton ginghams reminiscent of New England interiors. To coincide with Chelsea Design Week, Designers Guild has launched a collection of sofas, ottomans and chairs covered in fabrics from Tricia Guild's latest collection of striped and checked hand-loomed Indian cottons, which she calls Orissa. There are some 35 different designs and an example of each is on show at the Designers Guild showroom at 271 and 277 King's Road, London SW3. To go with the sofas is a selection of different stools, ottomans and boxes. Those photographed (right) illustrate the mood of the collection. The two-seater Canonbury sofa ranges from Pounds 1,280 to Pounds 1,540, depending on the fabric chosen, while the Montgomery chair in the background ranges from Pounds 695 - Pounds 770. The Brompton long stool starts at Pounds 335 and goes on up to Pounds 395. Photographed left is Kingcome Sofas' version of the classical 19th century shape, the Howard. Kingcome have chosen to cover it in a creamy viscose material by Manuel Canovas. At 6 ft long, 42 in deep, 35in high the Howard will need 15.5 metres of plain fabric to cover it and it sells for Pounds 1,580 (plus vat). See it at Kingcome Sofas showroom at 302 - 304 Fulham Road, London SW10.</p>

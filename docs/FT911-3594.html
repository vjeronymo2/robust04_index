			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Milacron dips into the red CINCINNATI Milacron, one of the world's biggest machine tool makers, slipped into the red in the first quarter on the back of weak demand and heavy price discounting. However, the company reported a pick-up in new orders, with a first-quarter inflow 6 per cent higher than a year earlier and 14 per cent up on the previous three months. The order backlog also widened during the quarter. Milacron suffered a Dollars 5.9m loss, or 22 cents a share, in the first quarter, against earnings of Dollars 2.5m, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales dipped to Dollars 181.1m from Dollars 184.2m. Mr Daniel Meyer, chief executive officer, said slack business conditions were especially evident in standard machine tool, grinding machine and plastics machinery sectors. He said stringent cost controls combined with new products and an expanded distribution network should return the company to break-even in the second quarter.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Sizewell replica to aid nuclear training A FULL-SCALE replica of the future control room at Sizewell B, the pressurised water reactor nuclear power station due to start up on the Suffolk coast in 1994, opens today. It will be used to train Sizewell's operators. The replica is housed in Cliff Quay, a futuristic building next to a disused power station on the River Orwell at Ipswich. It has been built by Nuclear Electric, the state-owned operator of the nuclear power stations in England and Wales. The control room mimics Sizewell down to the carpet tiles. Its sophisticated Marconi-designed software 'thinks it is a power station', according to Nuclear Electric. For the operators, the control room 'feels exactly like the real thing', explained Cliff Quay's principal, Mr Brian Malloy. It can simulate everything from escaping steam to a mouse chewing through cables. The system, Nuclear Electric said, is infinitely more sophisticated than a flight simulator. It is based on one of a few existing models of a nuclear reactor core, designed by Combined Engineering of the US. It may also be used to train nuclear industry staff from what was the Soviet Union and eastern Europe.</p>

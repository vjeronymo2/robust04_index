			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Batch sizes of methamphetamine produced at clandestine labs can vary greatly. Recent information indicates that methamphetamine is also produced in small batches via a procedure known as the ``cold process.'' This procedure has utilized quantities of 40 grams or less of ephedrine. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The smuggling of bulk ephedrine and the purchase of OTC ephedrine tablets are the primary sources of ephedrine utilized at these clandestine laboratories. Ephedrine tablets make up a significant portion of the more than 10 metric tons of ephedrine reportedly seized at clandestine laboratories between 1990 and 1992. This material may be purchased from several different sources at below threshold quantities. The purchase of regulated chemicals from several suppliers in quantities below established thresholds is a common method of diversion and continues to occur with ephedrine. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A comparison of U.S. hospital/pharmacy purchase data with the quantities of ephedrine seized at clandestine laboratories indicates that the use of ephedrine for clandestine laboratories is much greater than amounts purchased by these types of distribution outlets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Drug products containing ephedrine are used legitimately to treat asthma and other conditions. They are available as OTC products from pharmacies, hospitals and other distribution outlets. Ephedrine products, which are lawfully marketed and distributed under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act and contain other active medicinal ingredients in therapeutically significant concentrations, are currently exempt from the reporting and recordkeeping requirements imposed under the CDTA. Of the oral OTC products available for medicinal treatment of chronic asthma, these ephedrine combination products are the products more frequently dispensed by pharmacies and hospitals. The elimination of a threshold for ephedrine does not impose any additional requirements on pharmacies, hospitals or points of distribution which distribute only those ephedrine products which are exempted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Acting Administrator, Drug Enforcement Administration, hereby certifies that this proposed rulemaking will have no significant impact upon entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. This proposed rule only eliminates the existing threshold for which ephedrine transactions must be reported and records maintained. It only impacts firms involved with small bulk transfers of ephedrine or distribution of single entity ephedrine tablets/capsules. This proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action and therefore need not be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in E.O. 12612, and it has been determined that the proposed rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 21 CFR 1310 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Drug Enforcement Administration, Drug traffic control, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For reasons as set out above, 21 CFR part 1310 is proposed to be amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1310_[AMENDED] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

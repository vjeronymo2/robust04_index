			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORGEOUS OUT; BONE CHIP DISCOVERED AFTER GALLOP  </P> <P> Gorgeous, who finished second to Bayakoa in last year's Breeders' Cup Distaff,  will miss a chance to reverse that outcome today because of a training injury  Friday at Belmont Park.  </P> <P> Gorgeous suffered a chipped bone in her left knee, an injury that was  discovered when she was X-rayed after a gallop.  </P> <P> Gorgeous, who was going to be retired after today's race, will go to the  breeding shed with a record of eight victories, four seconds and one third in  14 starts. She earned $1.1 million.  </P> <P> Half of Gorgeous' six losses came in races won by Bayakoa. Gorgeous handed  Bayakoa one of her three defeats this year, beating the Argentine-bred mare in  the Apple Blossom Handicap at Oaklawn Park in April.  </P> <P> Go for Wand, winner of seven of eight starts, is the even-money favorite in the  Distaff. Bayakoa is 6-5 on the morning line. BILL CHRISTINE  </P></p>

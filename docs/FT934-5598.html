			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (4): Hey ho, the wind and the rain - Insurance industry user view / Claire Gooding looks at how a geographical information system is helping a reinsurance broker explore and assess financial risks Wind and rain matters greatly to Alexander Howden Reinsurance Brokers. One of four companies in the Alexander &amp; Alexander Group, its business as a reinsurance broker is concerned with limiting the exposure of first-line insurance companies by arranging reinsurance for customers such as Lloyds and UK insurance companies. In Britain, the main risks to property are flood and wind, such as the major storm of 1987, known in the business as 87J. Predicting the effect on insurance claims of such a storm is at the heart of evaluating both the risk, and the value of the reinsurance. Alexander Howden's role is as the expert in the middle, proffering advice to both customers and reinsurers. The geographical information system (GIS) plays a part in the assessment of risk, and the modelling of 'what-if' scenarios, such as a flood on the east coat, or another hurricane-force gale. The GIS is doing a job nothing else could do, according David Evans, chief executive of the management information systems division. It is pulling together a mixture of geographic information, expert knowledge, and modelling and analysis techniques, and presenting it so that clients can see and interpret the picture for themselves. 'It's about putting things into a common denominator where our mutual abstract thoughts can be communicated' says Evans. The risk represented by a storm is made up of different and variable factors, such as windspeed, trajectory, the geographical spread of policies held by the insurance company, and the density and nature of the property. 'Over the years we've developed complex techniques to advise clients on risk exposures, and what we've done is sophisticate those techniques on the computer.' Alexander Howden's job is as much about presentation as it is about facts. Previously, the company spent hours creating one-off maps showing the density of policies and other factors, to demonstrate exposure to clients. The tools they used were PC graphics like Freelance, which were fine for presentation, but ate up hours in creating maps. The choice of MapInfo as a tool came about partly because of its ease of use, because it could be used as a fancy presentation tool as well as for in-house analysis. The ability to input different sorts of data, and index it, was important, and other tools were thought not to offer the same depth, nor the quality of presentation. The use of postcodes for rating purposes has enabled insurance companies to 'zone' areas of risk, a geographical breakdown that forms the basis for most of the analyses. At the first level, there are 268 areas, indicated by the first three letters of each postcode: further breakdowns are to 2,600 areas, and then 10,000. According to Michael Watson, director in the non-marine reinsurance division, information on what policies were held where was almost useless when presented as pages of columns and figures. 'Quite frankly, you can't do anything with it. Several sheets of paper with those figures on it was enough to send you number-blind. What we wanted to do initially was show clients where their area of exposure was by mapping it.' The first problem was to get the quality of information from forty or so clients, an operation that has taken about two years, according to manager Graeme Roberts. For each customer, the system shows a breakdown of the areas where the majority of policies are held, using colours to show high densities and values. Reinsurance is bought by a certain amount, to cover the entire UK, and the trick is to guage the amount needed, based on the risk level and the location of policies. The system throws exposures into stark relief by using different colours. 'It may be surprising, but few reinsurance clients have such facilities, and neither do a lot of insurance companies,' says Mr Roberts. 'A lot of us had no conception where the business actually was. We'd have clients coming to see us whose gut feel was that they were pretty strong in the South-East, whereas we could demonstrate that in fact their main area of exposure was in the Midlands.' The next step was to start modelling 'what if' scenarios and demonstrating risks, again by postcode areas, linked to the likely damage caused by flooding and gales in particular areas. This meant cross-referencing postcodes to geological and topographical information: floods are more likely to wreak havoc in low-lying areas. 'It's not just a selling tool, in terms of being clever. It's a matter of putting something back into the insurance industry,' says Mr Watson. 'We're trying to add value for our customers, keeping them informed of their exposure and keeping them up to date.' Graeme Roberts adds: 'What we do find is that it re-inforces the relationship. We're telling them something they don't know. It points out their vulnerability, and they may not always be aware of it.' His calculations can take a complex number of factors into account, plotting storm paths, the estimated damage according to windspeed, and all sorts of other factors, painstakingly researched and fed into the system. 'There's a lot of data out there. It's all a matter of getting it off the mainframe, and that can mean a long wait. We also draw on historical analyses, studies, published papers, geological information, all sorts.' Mr Roberts is enthusiastic about the MapInfo software - 'it's the first piece of software I've used that encourages you to try things out. It's all about the power of the desktop. It's a poor man's GIS, no special equipment, because people like us can't wait. It's saved us time, and taken all the hurt out of the presentation process. Now our users push us quite hard to deliver, to go out and explore new areas.' The system has already been in development for 18 months, and regularly leaves the office on a portable PC, to demonstrate to the clients the quality of the information the company can offer. Watson also believes it has helped the relationships with clients. 'It comes down to a more understandable demonstration, which helps to get the business.' David Evans agrees on both the value of the system, and its potential - 'we can now calculate many more permutations, and do it interactively and graphically, asking customers for their input. We want to expand the system elsewhere in the world, because we regard it as one of the key roles of a high-quality intermediary to provide this sort of service. We hope we're ahead off the competition.'

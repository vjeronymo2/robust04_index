			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / France to reform pensions system THE FRENCH government will table legislation before the end of June to reform the pension system, with the introduction of new tax-efficient personal equity plans a central feature. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, said in an interview with the newspaper, La Tribune de l'Expansion, yesterday that he saw the proposed eight-year personal equity plans as the basis for a private pension system to run alongside the existing state pension scheme. Pension reform is a pressing issue in France. Almost all pensions are provided by the state with the exception of the small number of fonds salariaux schemes for senior executives. The government runs the system through the Caisse de Retraite, a body that pays for pensions with money received from those in employment. However, this system, devised after the end of the second world war, is coming under strain as the elderly population increases and there are proportionally fewer people in employment to pay for their pensions. The logical solution would be to expand the use of private pensions. The government, however, has been reluctant to act partly because of opposition from the trade unions, who believe pensions should continue to be solely provided by the state. There is also the political problem of asking the electorate to pay extra money for their own private pensions at the same time as they are contributing to the state scheme. Despite these obstacles Mr Beregovoy earlier this year signalled that the government was determined to take action. Mr Beregovoy originally considered a German-style system of corporate pension plans but was deterred by the complexity of such an initiative, as well as by the impact of the Maxwell pension scandal in the UK.</p>

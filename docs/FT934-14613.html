			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Lasmo rejects Moody's arguments on downgrading LASMO, the independent oil exploration and production company, yesterday rejected arguments used by Moody's on Wednesday in sharply downgrading the rating of its senior debt and preference shares. Moody's cited Lasmo's vulnerability to low oil prices as the main reason for cutting the rating on senior debt from Baa1 to Baa3 and on preference shares from Baa2 to Ba1. It also said that Lasmo's 'management appears to be willing to accept a higher, permanent level of financial risk.' 'We don't like debt, but we don't think that out debt is out of control,' Mr Michael Pavia, finance director, countered yesterday. He noted that plans to increase net debt to between 80 and 90 per cent of shareholders' funds by 1995 from its present level of 70 per cent arose directly from Lasmo having to spend Pounds 350m as its share of the development costs of the Liverpool Bay field. Mr Pavia stressed that financing for the project is in place, and that Liverpool Bay posed no special technical challenges. 'After completion of the Liverpool Bay development in 1995-96, the level of gearing is forecast to fall rapidly,' the company said. Lasmo shares lost 1 1/2 p to close at 136p. Volume was slightly above average at 3.9m shares.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Survey of International Standards (2): BSI sails into choppy seas - Charles Batchelor discusses the problems facing the UK organisation THE British Standards Institution, the organisation which co-ordinates the writing of UK standards, should be riding the crest of the wave. BS5750, the quality assurance standard it devised in the late 1970s, has become a world-wide best-seller and the basis for the European and international quality standards. Yet, just when the benefits of the hard work that went into BS5750 are starting to pay off, BSI has run into choppy seas. The strains imposed by its efforts to modernise its somewhat bureaucratic procedures cost it its chief executive earlier this year. And around the same time the government ordered a review of BSI, the grant it receives from the public purse and the whole issue of standards writing in the UK. The government has yet to announce the results of its review but BSI is pressing on with its own internal reorganisation. It is streamlining its standards-writing division at the cost of 70 jobs and an annual saving of Pounds 3m. Further cost savings and increased efficiency are expected from a concentration of the organisation's London-based activities in new offices in Chiswick, west London. BSI is unusual for a standards organisation in that it not only co-ordinates the writing of standards, it also has divisions involved in quality assurance certification and product testing. Its German and French counterparts, DIN and AFNOR, are engaged simply in standards-writing. BSI's combination of activities produced profits of Pounds 7.5m last year on sales of Pounds 74m. It employs 2,000 people. Combining these three areas of activity gives BSI an undoubted marketing advantage in the highly competitive fields of certification and testing, though it stresses they are managed separately. More than 30 other organisations are engaged in certifying companies to the BS5750 quality standard while, according to some estimates, the UK has no fewer than 5,000 product-testing laboratories. To ensure that the organisations which carry out certification and testing are themselves up to scratch, the government established a National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies in 1984. If a certifier meets the standards set, it can issue certificates bearing the tick and crown symbol of the NACCB. For reasons which have looked increasingly eccentric as competition between the certification bodies has grown, the NACCB was set up under the BSI's royal charter and is funded by BSI. No-one has suggested that this curious arrangement limits the NACCB's ability to treat BSI's certification activities any differently from those of BSI's commercial rivals. But it does look odd and BSI itself is keen for the NACCB to achieve complete independence. Established in 1901 as the Engineering Standards Committee, BSI managed to avoid the split between the electrical sector and the rest of industry which has marked other standards organisations. The split arose because the International Electrotechnical Committee was founded in 1907, 40 years before the International Organisation for Standardisation, responsible for all other industry areas, and the two never merged. Other standards organisations which were subsequently set up, notably the European organisations CEN and its electrical counterpart CENELEC, mirrored this split. One of BSI's first actions was to bring order to the manufacture of the steel sections used to make tramway rails. Within a year of BSI introducing a kitemark for tramway rails in 1903 the number of steel sections used had fallen from 75 to five and industry was making savings of around Pounds 1m a year. BSI has since gone on to create standards in a wide range of industry areas and now has some 12,000 standards covering anything from the fungal resistance of wood panels and the strength and durability of fitted kitchens to the impact resistance of cycling helmets. Requests for standards come in from a variety of sources including companies, the government, trade associations and consumer groups. If BSI is convinced that there is a case for a new standard it puts together a drafting committee made up of groups such as manufacturers, purchasers, local authorities, government departments and consumers. These representatives give their time free although the government has calculated that the cost to industry of this activity is Pounds 200m a year. BSI says it takes about two years to produce a British standard. It says that this is faster than many of its international counterparts but it is keen to speed up the process. In spite of Britain's early lead in standards setting,quality slumped after the second world war. When industry and government realised just how far standards had slipped, there was a revival of interest and the creation, in 1979, of BS5750, which now accounts for just under half of BSI's turnover and two thirds of profits. Five years ago BSI embarked on a programme designed to modernise its organisation, speed up the creation of standards and improve its profitability. As an institution incorporated by Royal Charter, it had not had a strong commercial drive and had become somewhat bureaucratic in its attitudes. It created the post of chief executive and appointed Mr Michael Sanderson, formerly managing director at AWD Bedford Trucks, to the job. But after only 18 months Mr Sanderson resigned in June 1993 following what BSI called 'a deep disagreement with the board on important matters of policy and management'. Day-to-day management has been taken over by a three-man board committee headed by Mr Vivian Thomas, non-executive chairman. Not long after Mr Sanderson's departure, though the two events were not connected, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, announced a government review of BSI. Mr Heseltine has called into question whether an organisation which now makes a sizeable profit needs an annual government subsidy of Pounds 4.5m. The government also wants to know what contribution standards make to the competitiveness of British industry and what BSI's role should be now that European and international standards are becoming more important than purely national ones. BSI believes that its work justifies continued public sector backing. But the pressures on the government to reduce public spending are such as to make reducing or removing the subsidy extremely attractive. BSI's efforts to become more commercial could prove to be very timely.</p>

It  is interesting to note Sarwono's suggestion that the identity of  those responsible for polluting the environment be revealed in  the newspapers. He said it is only proper that the names of  these businessmen or industries be identified clearly and not  just by their initials.    The minister said this is one of the steps the Environmental  Impact Management Agency will take at its next national working  meeting on the clean river project, and will be implemented next  year.    Minister Sarwono stressed that the press should not hesitate  to reveal in detail the names of industries that are not  concerned about the environment, or whose products and  technology endanger the lives of their workers. He added that  it is not sufficient for the press to publish their initials.  He reiterated that if the press is confident that their  information is accurate, they should not fear any resulting  legal charges, because they will definitely win the case.    We say that the minister's suggestion is interesting because  this is something new for our national press. Based on the  principles of the journalistic code of ethics observed by  members of the PWI (Indonesian Journalists Association), all  journalists should honor an individual's privacy and not violate  the principle of presumption of innocence [preceding three words  in English]. This code of ethics is clearly spelled out in the  PWI's journalistic code--an individual should be regarded as  innocent until a decision is issued in court.    The Indonesian press is required to honor its journalistic  code of ethics as stipulated by the PWI statue. The press  should use wisdom and tact before it reveals the full name and  identity or publishes a photograph of any person. One of the  code's rules relates to the presumption of innocence, which  requires the press to refrain from indirectly accusing a suspect  of committing a crime or revealing his or her full identity  until he or she is convicted in court. This is guaranteed in  the PWI's journalistic code of ethics under Section 8 of Law No.  14/1970.    We feel that it would be very difficult for the national  press to violate the code of ethics, the law, and the order that  are the basis of their profession. There has never been a case  where journalists have been charged in court for reporting  inaccurate information and ordered to pay an exorbitant amount  to the plaintiff in damages.    In view of recent cases where people felt defamed by press  reports and pressed for legal charges against the journalist  concerned, we also find that some journalists are being  blackmailed and an unbelievable amount of money is being  extorted.    The PWI, as a professional organization for journalists, has  thus far been able to impose discipline and enforce its  journalist code of ethics for reporting on the national press.    Addressing the 19th PWI Congress in Bandar Lampung from 2 to  5 December, Information Minister Harmoko reminded the PWI and  its honorary board members of their unflinching obligation to  uphold justice, defend the people's interests for the sake of  the law, and take disciplinary action against members who  violate the journalistic code of ethics.    We fully understand Minister Sarwono's objective in saying  that the identity of industries proven to have caused  environmental pollution should be revealed in the press. Such  transparent reporting would force businessmen to be more serious  about producing products and following production processes that  do not harm the environment. But if the press reveals the  identity of the industry causing industrial pollution, and at  the end of the trial the court cannot convict the industry  because of lack of evidence, who can guarantee that the  publication in question will be free from countercharges and  demands for compensation?</p>

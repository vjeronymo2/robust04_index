			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: Sherritt signs Cuban joint venture Sherritt, the Canadian resource group, has signed a joint venture agreement with Cuba to mine, refine and market nickel and cobalt from an operation in Moa Bay, on the Caribbean island. Sherritt will gain long-term feed for its Alberta nickel refinery, while Cuba will benefit from modernisation of the mine and an increase in capacity from 20,000 to 24,000 tonnes yearly, at a cost of USDollars 140m. Sherritt has for some time refined Cuban nickel and cobalt in Alberta. 'The mine urgently needs refurbishing, and it is now operating at about 13,000 tonnes yearly,' said Mr Ian Delaney, Sherritt chairman. He said the Moa Bay reserves were sufficient for 50 years. Sherritt is also a fertiliser producer, is active in metallurgical research, and operates an upstream oil and gas unit.</p>

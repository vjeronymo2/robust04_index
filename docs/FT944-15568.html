			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Cleveland seizes Samsung prize Samsung's decision to establish its main European production beachhead at Wynyard, Cleveland, comes after fierce competition among European Union members to attract the biggest investment in the region yet by a Korean company. The world's fifth-biggest electronics group has been studying sites in the EU for the past year as part of its strategy to establish regional manufacturing centres around the globe. It has already selected Tijuana, Mexico, as its main production complex for North America. EU candidates included Portugal, Germany and France. the final choice came down to Spain, where Samsung has TV and VCR manufacturing operations in Barcelona, and the UK. It produces colour TVs at Billingham, Cleveland. Samsung plans to spend Dollars 700m (Pounds 443m) on the new project, almost seven times the average annual investment by Korean companies in the EU. The proposed complex will have an annual production of 1m computer monitors, 1.3m microwave ovens, 250,000 facsimile machines, 250,000 personal computers and 3m monitor tubes as well as facilities to make 8in semiconductor wafers and colour televisions. The facilities will generate Dollars 2bn in annual turnover. British officials describe Samsung's project as the single biggest foreign manufacturing investment in the UK since Nissan's initial Dollars 450m investment at Sunderland in 1988. It is a significant boost to overseas expansion by Korean companies, which lag behind their Japanese competitors in establishing plants abroad. The aim is to get round protectionist trade barriers and to be close to markets. Samsung recently announced plans to build a Dollars 500m plant outside Shanghai. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, believes that the reasons the UK was selected include labour productivity and infrastructure, the Koreans' familiarity with the English language, and the previous success of Korean operations in the UK. Mr Heseltine, who is on a visit to Seoul, cited the Samsung choice as supportive of the UK's decision to opt out of the EU social chapter so that it could offer 'competitive wage rates'. But he added that Samsung found the UK an attractive place to invest because of its membership in the EU. The government's offer of financial benefits also influenced Samsung. The company said direct and indirect assistance accounted for 20 per cent of the investment cost. British officials believe the incentive package is worth the price since the Samsung complex is expected to provide at least 3,000 jobs in a 'regional unemployment blackspot'. Samsung is expected eventually to buy electronic components from local suppliers, further boosting employment. In the past two months seven Korean companies have decided to invest in the UK, including Goldstar, Samsung's main electronics rival, which announced a Pounds 10m colour TV plant last week. Other EU countries are also seeking Korean investment. Daewoo Electronics has plants in northern France and Samsung plans to establish other European complexes, possibly in Spain or central Europe, and in eastern Europe. Editorial Comment, Page 21</p>

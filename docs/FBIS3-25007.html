			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Gnassingbe Eyadema; </F> place and date not given -- live or recorded]    [Text] Togolese, the parliamentary election campaign has  ended. You will vote tomorrow in a sovereign manner as free and  responsible citizens. I noticed that the Fourth Republic's  first parliamentary election campaign took place peacefully;  freedom of speech for all was respected. This is proof of your  political maturity. Everyone was able to express himself fully  and was granted the same access to the state media. Few  countries in the world can boast of showing such a high degree  of democratic principle. I wish to thank all those who assisted  in organizing elections -- the International Monitoring  Committee; foreign countries which sent us experts and election  material; the National Electoral Commission, which worked with  all the political forces through consensus; the government and  the administration which worked relentlessly so that everything  will be ready on time; and the Supreme Court, which is carrying  out its constitutional mission by respecting people's rights. I  must not fail to thank all those citizens who helped in issuing  and distributing voter cards. Their action is even more worthy  considering the fact that violence caused by people from outside  tried to destabilize our country once again; it caused death and  desolation in our capital and its surroundings.    The choice you are about to make is a decisive one for our  country. I will respect whichever choice you make in accordance  with the democratic law established by our Constitution. I am  pleased that the elections will be held in the presence of  several international observers. We are happy to welcome them.  We also thank them for the selfless contribution they have been  making to our democratic development. Our democracy is  transparent so they are free to carry out their important  mission the way they wish. On the eve of the elections, I wish  to remind you of certain basic principles in my capacity as head  of state and guarantor of national unity. I will direct all my  energy to ensuring that democratic regulations, which require  everyone to respect the Constitution, are followed.    After this long transitional period, our country needs  stability and order. One cannot call for democracy and resort  to violence at the same time. Similarly, one cannot call for  respect for the law of the ballot boxes and incite people to  rebellion at the same time. As a head of state, elected through  universal suffrage for a five-year term of office, I will assume  my high mission by serving you. My duty is to enable our  country to resume its march forward on a sound footing with the  contribution of the new assembly to be elected. I hope that  your choice will enable our dear Togo to recover political  stability without which nothing good can be undertaken. There  is no magic solution to our problems. We have the solution, you  have the solution, and it demands that each of us should get  back to work and that the people's interests prevail over those  of the political class. I hope that while voting freely and  sovereignly, you will keep in mind these two periods: the 24 and  1/2 years that we spend together and the three years of  transition that we are currently going through. At the end of  this transition, do not fail to support all those who are ready  to help our country set back to work.    Democracy is not anarchy, laxity, or confiscation of the  people's will. Democracy is discipline and the desire to serve  the people. It is also self-denial and mutual respect. In  democracy each citizen can express his preferences, but a  multiparty system must not make people forget the national  interest. Tomorrow's poll should enable people to express our  different leanings, but in the absolute respect for our unity as  well as ethnic and geographic peculiarities. There may be among  us different leanings, but there is only one people. I hope  that each Togolese will remember this before going to the poll.  After the elections, my main concern will be to strive for  reconciliation among all the sons of our people and to enable  each of us to participate in the activities of national life.  Before concluding, I should not forget to stress that an  election is also a peaceful competition.    I would like to wish each of the candidates good luck, and  may the best win. To you fellow countrymen and women, I wish  that you choose the candidates that you will deem the best. I  call on you to eagerly go the polls and do this in a calm  atmosphere as well as in discipline so that in the days ahead  our country can proudly recover all its lost positions in the  comity of nations.    Long live Togo! Long live the Republic! Long live democracy!</p>

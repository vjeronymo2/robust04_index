			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak  on 24 May on page 1 carries a 600-word interview with Peter  Weiss, chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left, SDL, signed  "alg" and entitled "I Do Not See Any Prospects of Cooperation."  The interview, the place and date of which are not given, deals  with the possibility of the SDL's post-election cooperation with  the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia,HZDS. The same issue is  also the subject of a 300-word interview with SDL Deputy  Chairman Milan Ftacnik by Robert Kotian in Bratislava SME in  Slovak on 24 May on page 1.    In the SLOVENSKY DENNIK interview, Weiss is asked to react  to  an interview with SDL Deputy Robert Fico, published in the 20  May issue of LUC (BEAM), a regional daily published in Kosice,  in which Fico reportedly said that "it should not be a problem  for the SDL to cooperate with the HZDS after the elections, if  the HZDS comes up with a program such as it had in 1992." Weiss  replies that the HZDS electoral program and its practical policy  are two different things, and continues: "I said before that the  HZDS has become an etatist [etatisticky] movement pursuing a  vulgar right-wing policy, aimed at satisfying the interests of  the party's top echelons. It was simply impossible to cooperate  with this policy. Moreover, the HZDS chairman personally did  everything he could to damage relations with other political  parties and their representatives. He personally destroyed all  prerequisites for effective political cooperation." In Weiss'  opinion, the SDL's decision to support the motion of  no-confidence in Meciar on 11 March 1994 was correct: "We came  out against a demagogic populist policy that was increasingly  resorting to the crutches of nationalism, was irrational, and  did not contribute to the solution of independent Slovakia's  problems. So far, we have not received any signals that the  HZDS would like to change this policy. The opposite is true.  The HZDS election campaign is based on pitting Slovaks against  the Hungarians and the Czechs and one group of Slovaks against  another group of Slovaks. It is based on the creation of the  image of an enemy and we cannot agree with such policy."    Asked whether the SDL could cooperate with a HZDS without  Meciar, Weiss replies that "Mr. Meciar is the strongest current  in the HZDS and I cannot imagine the HZDS without Meciar."  Weiss also denies the existence of any pressure from the SDL  rank-and-file to cooperate with the HZDS after the elections.  In conclusion, he reiterates that "if the HZDS policy does not  change -- and there is no indication of that -- I see no basis  for post-election cooperation with the HZDS."    In the SME interview, the place and date of which are not  given, SDL Deputy Chairman Milan Ftacnik refuses to give a  definite reply to the question of possible HZDS-SDL cooperation,  arguing that the party leadership has not yet discussed the  issue. Confronted with the statement made by SDL Deputy Robert  Fico to the daily LUC that "there should be no obstacles" to  post-election cooperation between the SDL and the HZDS, as long  as the HZDS observes its 1992 program, Ftacnik says: "I consider  this to be Deputy Fico's personal view. We have not yet  discussed this issue in substance within the SDL. We are now  prepared to clarify it in a democratic manner, first within the  party and, subsequently, with our coalition partners. This can  no longer be only our decision. The coalition partners are to  submit by 30 June the principles of post-election cooperation  and our party bodies should clarify this issue in substance by  then."</p>

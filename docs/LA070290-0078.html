			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> LUNG ASSN. FIGHTS UTILITIES MERGER  </P> <P> Citing potential air pollution and health problems, the American Lung Assn. of  California has joined Oxnard and Simi Valley officials in opposing the merger  of Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric.  </P> <P> If the merger is approved by the state Public Utilities Commission, Edison will  increase production at its two power plants in Oxnard while curtailing  operations at plants in San Diego.  </P> <P> Edison has promised the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District that it  will reduce pollutant emissions to levels it says would compensate for  increases the merger will generate. Those reductions would not begin until  1996, officials said.  </P> <P> In the agreement, Edison officials said they would reduce the level of county  pollutants in part by replacing internal combustion engines with electric  motors at the company's plants at Ormond Beach and Mandalay Bay in south  Oxnard.  </P> <P> But the lung association, in a June 27 letter to Board of Supervisors  Chairwoman Madge L. Schaefer, said electric motors are "highly profitable" for  Edison and that the company could profit from the conversion in only two years  through increased sales of electricity.  </P> <P> Further, the association charged that Edison has already begun a conversion  program for profit so "the agreement achieves nothing for air quality that  would not happen anyway."  </P> <P> The lung association called the agreement between the county and Edison  premature and imprudent. It asked that the Air Pollution Control District  suspend its agreement until officials examine the merger's potential impact on  air quality.  </P> <P> The lung association sent a position paper and petition signed by 130 county  residents to the Public Utilities Commission on Friday. It stated that the  merger could increase nitrogen oxide emissions in the county and called the  shift of power generation unacceptable.  </P> <P> Last week, Simi Valley City Council members agreed to send a letter to the  Public Utilities Commission and the Board of Supervisors stating that the  merger will threaten the county's air quality.  </P> <P> Oxnard officials also have expressed disapproval.

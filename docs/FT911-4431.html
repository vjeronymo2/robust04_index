			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Rights issue benefits lift Albert Fisher to Pounds 45m ALBERT FISHER Group, the acquisitive fresh produce distributor and food processor, reported a 47 per cent advance in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 30.53m to Pounds 44.98m, for the six months to end-February. Excluding the effect of exchange rate movements and acquisitions, underlying profit growth was just over 15 per cent. At the earnings per share level, the rise was held back to 13 per cent at 5.18p (4.59p); the interim dividend is up 17 per cent to 1.75p (1.5p). The group's shares fell 5p to 115p on the announcement, although analysts said there was no disappointment with the numbers. Sentiment towards the shares has been affected recently by the sudden departure of Mr Keith Brackpool, who headed the North American operations. His departure followed the revelation that he personally owed Polly Peck International, the failed trading group, over Dollars 10m relating to a share deal done by a company he ran. Mr Tony Millar, executive chairman, said the group was looking for a new chief executive for the US business. The figures benefited from interest receivable of Pounds 9.85m (Pounds 80,000) following the Pounds 180m rights issue launched just before Christmas 1989. The group has net cash of Pounds 65m, but this is expected to be spent over the second half. Europe was the best performing area for the group with Germany and the Netherlands providing good growth. Fresh produce operating profits rose 22 per cent to Pounds 6.5m and food processing and distribution was up 42 per cent to Pounds 18.5m. North American profits fell, in sterling terms, from Pounds 12m to Pounds 10.1m as recession and the Gulf War hit the food service business, which includes catering for hotels and airlines. The group took a Pounds 3.7m write down after tax on its 24.2 per cent stake in Pacific Agricultural Holdings. PAH owns land in Cadiz, California, with its own water supply which was to be developed for growing produce, but for which there are now different plans. COMMENT Albert Fisher has suffered its share of bear raider inspired rumours but the Brackpool incident has to be put down as a mistake by the company. Sentiment has turned against the stock, not because Mr Brackpool was thought vital to the group, more that Mr Millar's judgment in hiring him has been called into question. There is also some concern that a large acquisition is coming, though Mr Millar retains his reputation for not overpaying. These fears do not remove the underlying argument for Fisher that the fresh produce market is one of the fastest growing areas in the food industry, but is still highly fragmented. The group should make Pounds 93m pre-tax (Pounds 74.4m) for the full year, giving a prospective p/e of 10.6 and a yield of 4.5 per cent if the full year dividend rises 15 per cent. The rating has come down from the group's glory days, but the shares may remain under a cloud yet a while.</p>

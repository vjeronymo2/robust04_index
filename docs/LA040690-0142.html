			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HEAVENLY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN FOR ANGELS FANS  </P> <P> For a month there was famine. Now, for the feast.  </P> <P> After a wobbly start, Major League Baseball gets under way tonight in Orange  County after a spring training lockout that sidelined players and made even the  most hard-core of fans threaten to boycott the favorite American pastime.  </P> <P> Tonight is the first game in the long-awaited Freeway Series as the Dodgers and  the Angels duke it out for local bragging rights in the traditional, preseason  rivalry.  </P> <P> Game time is 7:35 p.m. at Anaheim Stadium. Tickets at the stadium cost between  $3 and $9 and there are thousands of seats left, Angels team officials said.  </P> <P> Stadium caterers will be serving up sushi, pasta and low-fat yogurt for  baseball fans who have burned out on the traditional hot dog and soda. Rowdy  KLOS radio disc jockeys Mark Thompson and Brian Phelps will throw out the first  pitch.  </P> <P> However, the Angels-Dodger contest itself is off to a blander-than-usual  beginning.  </P> <P> When the lockout ended, the game in Anaheim was scheduled for Sunday, then  moved to tonight. The false start seems to have dampened enthusiasm for the  Freeway Series with Angels officials predicting a modest turnout of 43,000 for  tonight's opener.  </P> <P> "With the Dodgers we usually have upwards of 60,000," said Angels spokesman Tom  Seeberg. "But I think the uncertainty and the last-minute change from Sunday to  Friday has probably hurt attendance."  </P> <P> Still, fans lined up at Anaheim Stadium Thursday afternoon for tickets to the  cross-town rivalry. The Angels recently broke a team record, surpassing the  18,500 mark for season tickets, Seeberg said.  </P> <P> "I've got a bet on the Freeway Series," said Mike Megia, an Irvine ticket agent  and die-hard Dodgers fan who plans to attend tonight's game. "Nothing serious,  just lunch."  </P> <P> Although the Freeway Series does not count in the season standings, some fans  are still taking it seriously.  </P> <P> "I just want to go down there and see what these guys look like so I can have  an idea of what's going to happen the rest of the season," said Angels Booster  Club President Rich Kanger. "There's always a certain anxiousness about seeing  the baseball season start."  </P> <P> The excitement was infectious at Anaheim Stadium, where bustling  concessionaires prepared food and grounds-keepers painted fences and trimmed  grass during furious, last-minute game preparations.  </P> <P> "I've just been running all over the building," said a winded John Trosper,  stadium concessions manager. "The ice machines and Coke systems have been  dormant for about six weeks so now we're in the process of turning everything  on."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, three days before the official season opener, baseball mania is  flourishing in Orange County. Memorabilia shops that couldn't give away  baseball cards during the lockout now can't keep enough items with the Angels  logo on the shelves.  </P> <P> "It's like night and day now compared to before the strike was settled," said  Bob Saucedo, an Orange sports store owner whose business suffered during the  lockout. "I'm sold out of Angels trash cans and if I don't have one when they  (fans) come in, they get really upset."  </P> <P> Says Bob Jablonski, a Santa Ana store owner: "Fans show their allegiance by  buying caps, T-shirts, even jackets, which is amazing considering how thick  they are and how hot it is in Southern California."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, local ticket agencies have been fielding hundreds of calls each day  from fans who want a prime piece of the action. Prices for premium seats for  regular season games have doubled over last year.  </P> <P> "We cater to people who want to see the game without having to bring  binoculars. They like mustard on their hot dogs instead of bloody noses," said  Kevin Miles, an Irvine broker whose corporate clients plunk down $75 to $150 to  impress out-of-town clients with choice seats in field boxes. "They want the  good stuff between bases and don't want to take a prized client and stick them  up in the boonies."  </P> <P> In an ironic twist due to rescheduling after the lockout, the Angels and the  Dodgers will both open at home on the same day for the first time ever,  splitting the loyal following of two teams just a freeway jaunt apart --  especially among Orange County transplants who still root for Dodger Blue.  </P> <P> The Angels' regular season opener, against the Seattle Mariners, will begin at  6:05 p.m. Monday -- just 4 1/2 hours after the first pitch is thrown in Los  Angeles, where the Dodgers play the San Diego Padres at 1:35 p.m.  </P> <P> Some fans, such as Jim Simpson, 33, of Huntington Beach, have found an easy  solution to their dilemma. "I'm going to make opening day of the Dodgers then  swing by, pick up my son and go over to Anaheim Stadium," he said. "I'm either  going to miss the end of one or the beginning of the other. But I grew up in  Pasadena following the Dodgers and I still haven't let them go -- kind of like  a kid with an old teddy bear or a blanket."  </P> <P> Others are still undecided. "I'll probably go to the Angels game with my radio  and play the Dodgers game, or, go to the Dodgers game with my radio and listen  to the Angels so I won't miss anything," said Lorraine Saunders of San  Clemente.  </P></p>

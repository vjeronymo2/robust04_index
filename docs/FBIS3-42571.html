Today a summit like the one in Moscow is  not likely to evoke the almost hysterical excitement of  journalists which relatively recently marked the negotiations of  the leaders of Russia (or the USSR) and the United States.    Although the problems discussed are no less significant.  Take, for example, the decision that the strategic missiles of  Russia and America will no longer be aimed at any specific  target. In essence this means that both powers in practice have  rejected the possibility of launching a preventive nuclear  strike. Can you really not call this a true breakthrough in the  area of international security?! [passage omitted]    In my view, the Russian audience did not get much food for  thought about the content of the Moscow summit. At least if one  is to judge from the newspaper reports. The American public, on  the contrary, as always, had no shortage of commentary from  qualified specialists. The majority of them confidently  anticipated the agenda, which consisted of three main points,  including recommending economic aid to Russia, the problem of  nuclear weapons, and expansion of NATO. The only variations were  in the degree of attention which, in their opinion, would be  paid to one issue or another. I decided to compare the opinion  of American international affairs specialists with the  viewpoints of their Russian colleagues. One of them, and a  fairly well-informed and extremely experienced one at that,  suggested these topics (in order of importance): discussion of  the American vision of partnership relations with Russia, a  comparison (and for the Kremlin also a definition) of the  national and vitally important interests of the two countries, a  clarification of the understanding of the role of Russia in the  CIS, problems related to NATO, and, finally, questions of  disarmament.    As we can see, the preliminary assessments of the experts  are  extremely similar to one another and do not differ greatly from  the actual agenda in its generally accepted form. But still I  will risk making a prediction which, in Russia at least, has not  been given constant attention. When speaking about the fact that  Bill Clinton made a visit to Moscow one should not forget that  the Russian capital was not the only point on his route. The  American President's tour was European and involved various  aspects of ensuring the security of primarily the United States.  It would seem that this is the perspective from which one should  consider the negotiations between Yeltsin and Clinton if one  wants to understand the logic of the behavior and approaches of  the American President.    Clinton's European trip came at a fairly critical moment.  Literally a couple of days before his departure from Washington  they announced the completion of the work on the adjustment of  the White House's foreign political course. After not very  successful attempts at leadership in resolving regional  conflicts, the American administration was to have proposed to a  nation accustomed to world leadership an updated strategy and  tactics for actions in the international arena. Hardly anyone  would argue with the idea that the world has changed recently.  The problem is to determine how the world has changed. So far  these changes have not been detected precisely enough in the  United States, since they have too many of all kinds of misfires  and blunders.    Nonetheless Bill Clinton, like any other descendent of the  conquerors of the Wild West, does not want to show weakness.  Therefore he has made every effort to push through his program  "Partnership for Peace" and stem the tide of the growing new  antagonism between West and East, on the one hand, and, on the  other, retain his influence in NATO, which is in need of  reconstruction and is getting out of control. The master of the  White House also had to respond to attacks from Republicans, who  were accusing him of political shortsightedness with respect to  the turns of events in Russia. The reception arranged for  representatives of various political parties in Spaso House was  to have confirmed the postulate that Clinton is able to learn  from his mistakes. And the fact that Zhirinovskiy was not on the  guest list meant that the strong America had no intention of  concealing its sympathies when the fate of democracy was being  decided in Russia. And then the economic aspect of the  negotiations in the Kremlin, including in the trilateral  agreement on the elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, may  be regarded as a kind of attempt to "buy them off." It is clear  and quite understandable that the American government had no  intention of sliding into the Russian economic quagmire. But, on  the other hand, it is impossible to view the entire world from  on high; sometimes it is necessary to descend to earth to get a  point of reference.    For President Yeltsin the meeting with his colleague from  the  United States in his home represented a truly unique opportunity  to demonstrate the stability of his position and loudly demand  equal rights--if only officially--in bilateral relations and  joint actions. This position, as certain observers have noted,  reflects the real state of affairs much more than narcissism and  self-glorification do.    Nonetheless it is still not altogether clear whether Russia  will succeed in gaining real equal rights in partnership with  the United States, which, at the concluding news conference,  Boris Nikolayevich discussed with a sly expression on his face,  apparently intending to convince those in attendance once and  for all.    In spite of the assessments contained in certain  commentaries  to the effect that the Moscow negotiations were unproductive,  one should avoid an extremely pessimistic or excessively  optimistic perception of the results of the meeting of  Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton. Judging from the number of  agreements signed, the pessimists are right. If one were to try  to interpret the hour's delay of the concluding news conference  as related to the "unplanned conversation" of the leaders of  Russia and the United States, optimism is justified. It would  seem that the presidents could have achieved impressive results  in Moscow. The question is one of how correctly they dispose of  these fruits.</p>

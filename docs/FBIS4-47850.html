			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer Jeremy Dawes] The Independent Electoral  Commission [IEC] has just discovered another major hitch in the  counting process. IEC chairman Judge Johann Kriegler has just  announced that the computer system used to calculate the results  has been tampered with. Anton Fisher is at IEC headquarters in  Kruis Street. Anton, the story please:    [Fisher] Jeremy, what happened was that there were  noticeable  inconsistencies between the tallies received from the counting  stations and the number of votes being put out by the computer,  so what happened was that, according to Judge Kriegler, it  appears that the computer program used here by the IEC had been  tampered with, to such an extent that certain parties were being  consistently favored, were getting more votes all the time, and  that is the gist of the kind of tampering that is now being  discovered.    [Dawes] Are they going to disclose, or has it been  disclosed,  how many votes have been affected?    [Fisher] Well, Judge Kriegler was questioned on that and  according to him it's quite an insignificant amount, but he did  concede that it could amount to tens of thousands of votes in  the 12 million that had been counted up to yesterday morning.    [Dawes] They can't identify which particular areas are going  to be affected?    [Fisher] No, but it's on a party basis. Certain particular  parties are being favored by this fault in the program which has  been discovered, and he wouldn't name which parties either.    [Dawes] So, what is Judge Kriegler going to do now to follow  this up?    [Fisher] Well, apparently the monitoring directorate of the  IEC has started an investigation. What they have done also is  called in the help of two outside computer experts, and they are  now continuing the investigation and apparently the matter will  be referred to the police.    [Dawes] Have the party leaders been informed and are they  going to react to the this?    [Fisher] Apparently, there has been communication between  the  parties, you know, all parties at the party liaison committee.</p>

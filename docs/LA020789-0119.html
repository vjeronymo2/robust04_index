			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KITTY DUKAKIS IS TREATED FOR ALCOHOLISM  </P> <P> Apparently despondent over her husband's failed Democratic presidential  campaign last year, Kitty Dukakis has entered a treatment program for  alcoholism, Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis announced Monday.  </P> <P> Dukakis said his wife, who spoke repeatedly during the campaign about her  successful battle in 1982 to quit a 26-year dependency on diet pills, had begun  drinking at home in the three months since the election.  </P> <P> "Until shortly after Election Day on Nov. 8, Kitty had never had a problem with  alcohol," Dukakis said in a statement released in Boston. "Unfortunately, a  combination of physical exhaustion, the stress of the campaign effort and the  post-election let-down all combined to create a situation in which, on a  limited number of occasions while at home, she has used alcohol in excessive  quantities."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Facility in Newport  </P> <P> The governor said his wife was admitted Sunday evening to Edgehill Newport, a  highly regarded, 160-bed residential treatment facility in Newport, R.I., for  alcoholics and chemically dependent men and women.  </P> <P> Dukakis said his wife voluntarily decided to seek treatment because she has  recognized since her 1982 treatment that "she is chemically dependent and . . .  that her recovery is always at risk." He said he and his family supported her  decision.  </P> <P> Cathy Damakos, an Edgehill spokeswoman, said the treatment typically begins  with one to seven days of close medical observation, followed by a 28-day  rehabilitation program involving one-on-one counseling, group therapy, plus  family sessions. A Statehouse spokeswoman in Boston said Dukakis would  participate in his wife's therapy sessions.  </P> <P> Mrs. Dukakis announced in July, 1987, that she had been treated five years  earlier at the Hazelden clinic in Minnesota for a 26-year addiction to  amphetamines.  </P> <P> "As she has now discovered, whether it comes in a bottle or in solid, if you're  chemically dependent, you're chemically dependent," Dukakis told a Statehouse  news conference. After her 1982 treatment, "she thought they were two different  things," he said.  </P> <P> Mrs. Dukakis campaigned frequently before students last year to cite her own  story in moving terms and warn about the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse.  Like many recovering addicts and alcoholics, she said in an interview with The  Times last May that she still had to "struggle" with her former dependency.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Effusive Campaigner  </P> <P> Often described as a fiery complement to her husband's icy demeanor, Mrs.  Dukakis was a warm, wisecracking and effusive campaigner.  </P> <P> Mrs. Dukakis, 52, began a nationwide speaking tour on Jan. 11 with a United  Jewish Appeal reception in Beverly Hills, and has signed a contract to  co-author a book about her experiences in the campaign. But since the election,  "she has been very sad," said Sandy Bakalar, a lifelong friend who often  traveled with Mrs. Dukakis during the campaign. "I think she's been grieving.  This loss has been very, very difficult."  </P> <P> Bakalar said Mrs. Dukakis felt "sad and empty" when the campaign ended. "For a  year and a half, she would wake up, people would set her schedule, they would  tell her where she was going, a car was waiting and she was gone," she said.  "She loved it. She was going 1,000 miles a minute, and then on Nov. 8, it was  suddenly over. It was like someone died."  </P> <P> Dr. Al Peters, a recovering alcoholic who is Mrs. Dukakis' brother-in-law and  who advised her to seek treatment, said her alcoholism was being treated "at  the earliest stages." He praised her for going public with the problem.  </P> <P> "It takes an awful lot of courage to recognize and to admit one's chemical  dependency, be it alcoholism or whatever, and to seek treatment," he said.  "Hopefully, this may send a message to other people to have the courage to  admit their problem and to seek appropriate treatment. Alcoholism is a  treatable disease. The only shame in alcoholism is when it's not treated."  </P></p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Business Air Travel (1): An Aladdin's cave of inducement - As the world tentatively begins to recover from recession, airlines are putting in place programmes to ensure that they win a growing share of the business market. European airlines are adopting many schemes common in the US BUSINESS AIR travellers are being wooed by the airlines as never before. Airline marketing teams have been working ferociously to win passengers and establish market share before economic recovery brings business passengers flocking to the travel agents. This is in stark contrast with the past 18 months. The trough in world economic activity saw airlines holding on grimly to existence, with varying success. As corporate revenues dwindled in businesses worldwide, company executives cut spending in many departments including air travel. This matters a lot to airlines. Business air travellers occupy a special place in the hearts and wallets of industry executives. 'We make our money at the front of the aircraft,' says one US manager. At Lufthansa, the German state carrier, the top 20 per cent of customers provides 56 per cent of revenues on its European routes. In the spring of 1992, there is much talk of recovery but little sign of it. Carriers are continuing to sell heavily discounted tickets, and last month US airlines began a price war on their domestic routes. It followed cut-throat competition on lucrative North Atlantic routes which saw fares fall by one third. The battle has been joined with such ferocity because this is a critical moment for the industry. Recession-bound customers are on the point of returning to the skies and airlines feel they must now buy that most elusive of commodities, customer loyalty. Discounted fares represent only one gem in an Aladdin's cave of inducements to fly. The early 1990s has seen an explosion in the the number of gaudy incentives aimed at securing business passenger loyalty. They include special lounges, limousines to the airport, free gifts chosen from the catalogues of expensive stores, on-board massages, beauty therapy, individual video screens on board and more. Most popular are frequent flyer programmes, where passengers collect points on the basis of the distance travelled and then use the points later to obtain upgrades to business, or first class, or free tickets. Frequent flyer programmes were developed in the US and have now spread to the UK. Large continental European airlines are thought to be studying the idea and 'it is only a matter of time before they launch their own programmes,' says an executive of one US airline. The attraction of frequent flyer programmes to passengers is strong. A survey of business travellers by the International Air Transport Association last week shows that 98 per cent of US passengers were members of a scheme. The figure for UK resident business travellers was 63 per cent. But the power of such programmes is limited. The same Iata survey showed it ranked only fourth on the list of passenger preferences. And giving away seats might be simple in a recession, but airlines risk losing valuable fare paying passengers as points are redeemed after the recovery is under way. The search is on, therefore, for new ways to attract passengers. The flavour of 1992 is 'product segmentation'. Now that computers minutely analyse changing patterns of ticket demand, airlines can create products for very specific groups of passengers. Virgin Atlantic Airways last week launched a 'Mid Class' ticket intended for the small minority of economy class passengers who buy full-price tickets. These passengers are almost entirely travelling on business. Virgin's move is classic airline management: improve service to the business passengers and leave price cuts for leisure travellers. The Iata survey supports this strategy. It showed about 90 per cent of business travellers declare bigger seats to be the most desired benefit of travelling in business class. Other airlines are following a similar route, with small independent carriers quickest off the mark. Austria's Lauda Air last week reduced its three abreast business class seating to two on its London to Vienna route. Canadian Airlines International is offering business class seats to passengers who pay full economy class fares. And TAT, in France, is advertising its short haul European services and 'all business class' although this refers more to the flexibility of the ticket than bigger seats.' In the deregulated US market, such innovations have been common practice for a long time. Some carriers added business class to previously two-class domestic aircraft routes late last year. But the price war on domestic US travel last month was more about cutting the published prices of business class and full-fare economy tickets than bigger seats. The move was partly to do with the continuing recession: the Iata survey showed that 28 per cent of passengers worked for companies which had cut their travel budgets. In 10 per cent of cases, the cut had been of more than 20 per cent. It was also to do with the precarious state of the US airline business. The biggest US airlines, American and United, which initiated the cuts, wanted to reduce the plethora of discounted fares. By so doing they might cut the ground from beneath their ailing rivals such as TWA and Continental. These two, and others, and have filed for protection from their creditors under US Chapter 11 legislation. Mr Robert Crandall, head of American Airlines, has been the vocal leader of a lobby which accuses the US bankruptcy laws of allowing weak airlines to damage strong ones. The laws are designed to allow failed businesses to keep functioning while a rescue package is put together. Mr Crandall and others allege this allow carriers to set fares only to meet current costs, not investment programmes. When recovery comes the shape of the battleground will change. Airlines will want to soften their sales pitches; they will want to give high paying business clients the personal touch they have paid for, but more cheaply than by giving away seats through frequent flyer programmes. One way to do this is through technology. Automated check-in machines that speed passengers past check-in desk queues are already being installed in airports. These machines print out a boarding card after the passenger has fed in a ticket and specified smoking or non-smoking and window or aisle preferences. They are already working in some airports such as Charles de Gaulle in Paris. British Airways intends to begin installing automated boarding card machines at its check-ins around the world later this year. To Virgin Atlantic, this approach is abhorrent. 'We are a people based industry. The check-in is the human contact with the passenger, we don't want to replace that because it degrades customer service,' says Mr Paul Griffiths, Virgin's commercial director. Mr Chris Byron, head of service delivery at BA sees no conflict between the impersonality of automation and the need to provide a personal touch. 'Queues are not the best place for personal service. The objective is to speed up the processes and not to reduce the number of people involved on the airline side.' He says that automation can help airports that are already overcrowded to cope with the increasing passenger flows. Baggage is next in line. BA is already using bar coded baggage tags that are machine read in the new Terminal 4 at London's Heathrow airport to direct baggage to the correct aircraft. The bar codes will be replaced over the next two years by magnetic stripes, which can contain more information, such as which freight container the luggage is in. Such developments are a far cry from the expense of giving away free seats through frequent flyer programmes, or reducing the number of seats. For the airlines it is a means of adding reliability to their service while keeping costs under control. It is an unspectacular kind of service that could have its day, if and when economic recovery pushes demand for air travel closer to the level of supply.</p>

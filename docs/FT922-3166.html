			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Charges over baby formula THE US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has charged the three leading US makers of infant formula with a range of improper business practices, including price fixing and the rigging of bids for government contracts in Puerto Rico. Two of the manufacturers - Bristol-Myers Squibb and American Home Products - have denied the allegations, but agreed to settle. Abbott Laboratories, the pharmaceuticals company that has the largest share of the US infant-formula market, has refused to settle and yesterday pledged to contest the charges 'vigorously'. The charges stem from an FTC investigation that began two years ago. The Illinois-based Abbott, which has about 50 per cent of the US infant-formula market of Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 820m) in annual sales, was charged with price fixing and bid rigging in Puerto Rico and with conspiring with the other companies to refrain from advertising directly to consumers in the mass media.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Labour after John Smith Mr John Smith's death at the early age of 55 is a shock to his party and a loss to British politics. As leader of the Labour party Mr Smith combined an acerbic parliamentary style with a stabilising gravitas. His supporters believed that under him Labour was at last cruising through the wreckage of a shattered Conservative party towards its first general election victory since 1974. Mr Smith was, in certain respects, ideally qualified to lead the Labour party. A committed member of Labour's moderate wing through its internecine 1980s struggles over defence, Europe and the economy, he was attractive to the party's right wing. At the same time, his burning sense of social justice buttressed by a belief in engaged government, deeply rooted in his Scottish political base, made him acceptable to those on his left. A period as shadow chancellor prior to the 1992 election confirmed his stature and led to overwhelming triumph in the leadership contest later that year. Yet for those whose starting point is not Labour loyalism, but a desire to see more than one modern political party capable of forming an effective government, Mr Smith's leadership must be judged a disappointment. The unhappy consequences of Labour's pre-election decision to publish a tax-raising 'shadow Budget' appeared to convince him that the party would in future win most by saying least. At the same time, although he supported efforts to modernise the party, he believed that more Kinnock-style, high-profile internal reform would only provoke more politically damaging internal feuds. Positive response In short, Mr Smith contended that Labour, without need for further varnish, was ready for office, an idea which sat uneasily with the fact that the party had just lost an election in the middle of the second longest recession since the 1930s. Even in last week's local authority elections, with the Tories in despised disarray, Labour's 41 per cent of the vote fell short of the level needed for clear victory in a general election. There has been no sense among Mr Major's sea of troubles that Labour is evoking a positive response from the general public. This must be in some measure because the party has been silent or unconvincing on the most important issues. Its approach to the European question was to seek tactical advantage during the Maastricht debate, whilst avoiding re-examination or reaffirmation of the Europhile position of its own 1992 manifesto. Who can say today where Labour stands on any important aspect of the development of the European Union? On the economy, the commitment to renationalise private utilities has been muted, but there is no clear sense that the party understands how to work more effectively with a flourishing private sector for its own broader social and political objectives. Opportunist attitude Its ideas on unemployment are difficult to take seriously given the dogma on minimum wages and labour market regulation. The party's attitude to necessary reform in health, education and the civil service remains opportunist and reactionary, tainted by alliance with the producer interest of the public sector trade unions. When it comes to party institutions and treasured nostalgias, Labour has been too ready to compromise. As a result, the party remains constitutionally committed to 'the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange', whatever that means. Another legacy is an electoral college for selecting a leader in which the trade unions still have one-third of the votes. This last fact casts an extra pall of gloom onwards from yesterday's sad news. Once again, trade union leaders will play a crucial role in appointing a Labour leader. A satisfactory outcome therefore requires some of those leaders to have the vision and the courage to look beyond the direct interest of their members, which is not what they are paid to do. This electoral college may thus prove incapable of electing the radical and modernising leader Labour needs if it is to play a serious part in the future of British politics. The most attractive standard-bearer for that modernising cause looks like Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary. He should be preparing himself for the political fight of his life.</p>

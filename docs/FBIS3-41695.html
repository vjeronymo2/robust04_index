			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vissarion Sisnev:`` ``First Aid'' Delayed: Why </F> Your Correspondent Needs To Write a`Self-Refutation' '']    [Text] Washington -- Last week my report `` `First Aid' for  Russia'' was published. In it I stated that a large group of  American medical personnel would soon be dispatched to  Novosibirsk to help with their practical experience, drugs, and  education. One of the initiators of this noble business was  Doctor Bruce Sanderson from Arkansas, the birth state of  President Clinton. After learning about him, the President wrote  a personal letter to the trip organizers, emphasizing that  direct cooperation between his fellow countrymen and Novosibirsk  City Hospital No. 25 seemed to him to be a ``splendid project  that can bring much good.'' The departure was planned for the  middle of August.    Unfortunately, today I must refute my own information. The  journey has, at best, been delayed for a long time. Doctor  Sanderson sent a letter to Aleksandr Bychkov, chief physician at  hospital No. 25, in which he explains what happened in the most  delicate tones. Assuring his colleague that it was not easy for  the group members to reach such a decision and that the arrival  of American ``first aid'' in Siberia is not being canceled but  only put off into the future, Doctor Sanderson reports that the  refusal of a number of specialists was dictated by the fact that  in their opinion, the religious bans approved by Russia's  Supreme Soviet are unacceptable.    It may of course be said that the physicians do not  necessarily need to react so strongly to the decision of another  country's parliament and that denying humanitarian aid for this  reason is not very logical. As is known, however, each monastery  has its own rule. Not only the physicians, but many others in  the United States as well, view the Supreme Soviet's recent  decision regarding limiting the activity of representatives of  foreign religious organizations as a return to the epoch of  violating human rights. American legislators, colleagues of our  deputies, have both in groups and individually approached  president Yeltsin with the urgent request that he carefully  weigh everything on the scales of justice before signing the  draft legislation of 14 July.    Included among them are such renowned politicians as  senators  Richard Lugar and Jessie Helms and house members Christopher  Smith, Henry Hyde, and Frank Wolf. In a separate letter, Senator  Phil Graham argues his negative reaction to the Russian draft  legislation with the fact that for 200 years already, Americans  have considered the right to profess one religion or another one  of the fundamental human rights. And Samuel Eriksson, president  of the association Lawyers International, noting that his  organization consults the leaders of 200 million Christians,  recalls the words of Professor Robert Jackson, chief prosecutor  at the Nuremburg process, regarding the fact that many  ``inconveniences'' must be put up with in the name of freedom of  religion, speech, and the press.    INFORMATION. The U.S. legislature does not specially  regulate  the religious and missionary activity of foreigners within its  country's territory, but it does provided for specified visa  control. Since 1 October 1991, the Immigration Service has  issued a special category R visa to individuals desiring to come  to the United States for religious activities. It applies to  clergy professionally executing their activity at KOKFESSII of  which they have been members for two preceding years (of course  this also applies to representatives of the Russian Orthodox  Church), as well as to individuals working professionally for  religious organizations in the United States and individuals  working in organizations or tax-exempt affiliates as  professional clergy. Such a visa is valid for 5 years.    The category R visa, like any other, strictly regulates what  a person receiving it may and may not do. First, each person who  applies for it must be a member of a religious community  belonging to a corresponding American noncommercial religious  organization (there are commercial ones as well). Second,  holders of a category R visa are not permitted to perform  nonprofessional work for their religious communities or work for  other religious communities or any other employers in addition  to or instead of working for their sponsoring religious  community. The purpose of these restrictions is to prevent the  entry of individuals who have no relation to religious activity  but who simply wish to get into the United States for one reason  or another.</p>

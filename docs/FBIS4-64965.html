			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article including interview with Green Party Secretary </F> Kjell Dahlstrom by Goran Eriksson; place and date not given:  "Green Party Wants To Pick Off Green Social Democratic Voters"]    [Text] "The Social Democrats are ripe for division. Many  Social Democratic voters are closer to us than they are to the  Social Democratic Party [SDP] leadership."    Kjell Dahlstrom, secretary of the Green Party, receives us  in  the library of the party headquarters at Kristineberg castle on  Kungsholmen in Stockholm. He regards the percentagewise numerous  Social Democrats as an overripe fruit, ready for picking. As  party secretary, Dahlstrom is paid to be an optimist, and his  confidence before the election is appropriately quite high.    "We hold all the cards: the European Union [EU] issue, New  Democracy is splitting up, and the other small parties are in a  weak decline, while our curve is pointing upward."    He studies the IMU poll, which shows that many who support  the Green Party, 76 percent, also have a positive attitude  toward the Social Democrats. Kjell Dahlstrom also says that the  opposite is true.  <H5>  Excited Debate </H5>   "We believe that many of those who say they want to vote for  the Social Democrats would not be very well served by a Social  Democratic majority government. It would be devastating; the  party leadership would take over completely. They would build a  bridge over Oresund and they would finesse nuclear abolition  together with the Conservatives and industrial groups."    On the other hand, a Social Democratic minority government  would, it is thought, be forced to take its own voters' green  values into account. The SDP leadership, which according to the  Green Party's view of reality is cast in concrete, would be  forced to listen to the environment- and solidarity-oriented  party opinion.    However, Kjell Dahlstrom is careful not to lock in the party  as a bloc-tied government base. A heated debate was held before  the last election on this issue. Now the message is the  following before a potential return to the Riksdag: cooperation  on issues of fact, with anyone at all.    And the EU question is so good, according to Dahlstrom, that  it alone should suffice to carry the party into the Riksdag.    "Of course it will be an EU election. If the popular  movement  parties, the Center and the Social Democrats, think they can  eliminate the issue from the election campaign, they are wrong."    So there. But if the EU issue is to drive hordes of  Euroskeptics into the Green Party camp, one wonders why it has  not already done so? So far the effect of the EU question in the  form of support for the Green Party is negligible.  <H5>  Political Superstores </H5>   "It is obvious that the voters have not yet drawn a  conclusion from their preferences on the EU issue. Further, both  the Social Democrats and the Center Party have promptly opened  branch offices for the no vote. Those parties have become  political superstores: They offer everything."    Dahlstrom believes in a quick dividend, however.    "The convulsions we could possibly see here in connection  with their conventions should be quite revealing concerning  these parties not having a clear opinion about what they want  for the future."    The effect in the mass media in connection with the  conclusion of the Swedish negotiations in Brussels should also  soon be converted into beautiful, green percentage units.    Experts seem to agree that the election will be about  employment and the economy. Does anyone dare to vote for  experimental economic policy from the Green Party?    In Dahlstrom's opinion the voters do not regard the party's  economic policy as a hazard.    "Our ideas about shortening the workday, division of labor,  and changing the tax base are well anchored in the discussion  today. National economists are discussing these issues --  Jacques Delors talks about reducing working hours, and KDS  [Christian Democratic Party] about changing the tax base."    In the election campaign the Green Party will compete with  the Left Party; the same disaffected Social Democrats are to be  lured over, to a certain extent with the same bait. But Kjell  Dahlstrom anticipates that history will set its communist trip  wire for the left. The Green Party's phase of sectarian battles  has simultaneously passed through a stage. The party has matured.    Now it is just the voters who are missing.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / News Corp advances 76% to ADollars 334m at nine months NEWS Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's media group, yesterday underlined its recovery from financial problems with a 76 per cent increase in net profits to ADollars 334m (Pounds 142m) for the nine months to the end of March. News Corp said the improvement in profits was largely due to better results from its newspaper and television operations, offset by disappointing results at Twentieth Century Fox. The biggest contributor to profits was an ADollars 170m reduction in interest expenses to ADollars 728m, reflecting lower interest rates and falling debt after the group's USDollars 7.6bn (Pounds 4.2bn) debt refinancing, completed in early 1991. The reduction in interest expense was offset by an increase from ADollars 11m to ADollars 77m in the group's share of losses at BSkyB and Ansett Transport Industries, the Australian aviation business jointly owned with TNT. News Corp also confirmed that BSkyB, the British satellite television operation in which the group has a 50 per cent interest, moved into profit in March. Revenue fell from ADollars 8.3bn to ADollars 7.7bn, mostly due to disposal of assets and the flotation of a 55 per cent interest in the group's Australian commercial printing business. Net profits were ADollars 437m, after taking account of abnormal profits of ADollars 103m, mostly reflecting the flotation of the Australian printing businesses. Abnormal losses of ADollars 189m in the comparable period last year reflected financing costs of debt rescheduling. The result represents a recovery since the end of the year to June, when News Corp made a net loss of ADollars 393m after abnormal losses of ADollars 714m. The group forecast 'significant' gains in profits in the current year. At the trading level, US profits fell 17 per cent to ADollars 655m, on turnover down 1.3 per cent to ADollars 4.8bn. News Corp said the lower figures reflected the sale of nine consumer magazines in June, together with foreign exchange gains in the earlier period. UK profits increased 158 per cent to ADollars 275m, reflecting the transfer of satellite broadcasting losses to BSkyB and a 49 per cent improvement in profits from the newspaper division. Profits from Australia and the Pacific basin increased 4 per cent to ADollars 259m, helped by a 12 per cent improvement in profits at the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong.</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> OTHER JOSE PRODUCES FOR ATHLETICS IN A BIG WAY  </P> <P> In an outfield that includes Jose Canseco and the Hendersons -- Rickey and Dave  -- there isn't much room for the latest Oakland Athletics phenom, Felix Jose.  </P> <P> He will have to get his playing time when one of the Big Three requires a day  off or suffers an injury, as Rickey Henderson did when his calves tightened  Wednesday night.  </P> <P> But Thursday night -- to the chagrin of the Baltimore Orioles -- Jose enjoyed  his biggest day in the majors while replacing the ailing Henderson.  </P> <P> He had four hits, including a two-run homer and a broken-bat single in the  ninth that sealed Oakland's 6-4 victory, four runs batted in and two runs  scored.  </P> <P> "I would say his chances of playing tomorrow (Friday) are pretty good whether  Rickey's back or not," A's Manager Tony La Russa said of Jose. "We'll find a  place for him."  </P> <P> Jose learned that he would be leading off when he arrived at Memorial Stadium  for early hitting Thursday. "Sometimes, you don't work," he said. "But I try to  keep ready all the time by working hard."  </P> <P> That was the case early last season when Jose, 23, made the club in spring  training with a .329 average and 17 RBI. His chance surfaced when Canseco broke  the hamate bone in his left hand and did not play until after the All-Star  break.  </P> <P> Jose flopped in his first trial, however, hitting only .125 before being  optioned to Class-AAA Tacoma, Wash., April 23.  </P> <P> "The rope just wasn't very long," La Russa said. "We were playing short-handed  as it was, and staying in there was a matter of producing. If he didn't get off  quick, we couldn't afford to go with him.  </P> <P> "On a club that didn't think it had a chance to win, he would have gotten a  bunch of at-bats, but we just didn't have that luxury."  </P> <P> Eventually, Stan Javier settled in for Canseco and did a creditable job through  the first half.  </P> <P> "I don't feel nervous now," Jose said. "I know I can do the job. I believe a  lot in myself. I feel more comfortable this year because I know I've got a  chance to stay in the big leagues."  </P> <P> His teammates are trying to smooth the transitional period for the Dominican  switch hitter, who had a superb winter league season in his native country.  </P> <P> "I try to help him with what I can," Rickey Henderson said. "I get a kick out  of seeing anybody do well."  </P> <P> Henderson said that there is a good chance he can play against the Boston Red  Sox Friday night "but they'll probably keep me out another day now."  </P> <P> Jose, who can play all the outfield positions, had one faux pas in the game --  when Steve Finley's drive caromed off his glove and was scored as a hit in the  ninth inning.  </P> <P> The play stopped Dennis Eckersley's streak of 18 Orioles retired.  </P> <P> "I got it right there," Jose said, "and it rolled off the glove."  </P> <P> He already has learned one thing. When his drive off Jay Tibbs soared toward  the right-field seats in the seventh, Jose stared at the ball admiringly,  Reggie Jackson style.  </P> <P> "I knew the wind was blowing a little," he said. "I knew I had gotten it."  </P> <P> La Russa is ready to look for more spots for Jose because "this usually doesn't  work this way. It just shows what kind of depth we have. We never have to  apologize for any team we put out there.  </P> <P> "The more you do, the more chances you get."  </P></p>

Guest of honour at the British Property Federation's annual bash was none other than the hapless Sir John Quinton, chairman of Barclays, which has been pilloried as the largest UK lender to the property industry. To bring the point home, a speech of thanks was made by the federation's outgoing president Trevor Osborne, chairman of Speyhawk, which has just lost Barclays a small fortune. 'Sir John,' quipped Osborne, 'we owe you more than we can ever repay.' Osborne was not alone in his gratitude to Sir John, whose speech contained much that the property industry wanted to hear. 'Banks would far rather work with, not against, their customers, and the incumbent management who know the assets best,' he said.

The largest contingent, occupying no fewer than five tables, was from Madagans, a well-known firm of bailiffs.</p>

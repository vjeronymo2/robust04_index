			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: CHRISTMAS EVE PROVES PUZZLE TO TRUMP'S LAWYER  </P> <P> PEOPLE ARE talking about Donald Trump's attorney, Stanford Lotwin, who appeared  a few days ago on the Phil Donahue panel with fellow lawyers Marvin Mitchelson,  Raoul Lionel Felder and Melvin Belli. Lotwin was a voice crying in the  wilderness as his peers, more or less, took him to the cleaners in the  discussions about prenuptial agreements.  </P> <P> Lotwin came a cropper when he said that his client, Donald, has two children.  Even Donald -- and the most ill-informed tabloid reader -- knows that Trump has  three children with Ivana. And Lotwin also failed to see any irony in the fact  that Trump had Ivana sign their nuptial money contract on a Dec. 24. Lotwin  didn't seem to know WHAT Dec. 24 signifies!! The Donahue audience was  dumbstruck.  </P> <P> THEY DO say the first rushes of the Matt Dillon-Sean Young thriller, "A Kiss  Before Dying," are sensational. The love scenes are reportedly especially hot.  Insiders think this movie, now filming in New York, will cap the career of  young Matt. It will add to the acclaim he won from critics for "Drugstore  Cowboy" and move him into the top echelons at last.  </P> <P> MUCH YAKKING from the District of Columbia about remarks made by comic Sandra  Bernhard and fashion designer Isaac Mizrahzi at the Art Against AIDS gala. They  were the talk of the staid old capital, according to reporter Martha Sherrill.  </P> <P> Sandra: "I'll do anything I can to draw attention to the cause. Especially in a  town like Washington -- which has chosen to ignore the disease, frankly. The  government seems full of people who are enjoying the genocide of homosexuals.  And please don't hesitate to quote me."  </P> <P> Isaac: "I'm just here accompanying Sandra and trying to temper her. And being  supportive, of course. Let's find a senator to influence."  </P> <P> Sandra: "To offend!"  </P> <P> TALK, TALK, talk! Michael J. Fox is now shooting "The Hard Way" on New York's  mean streets. In this, he portrays a young actor studying to play the role of a  tough cop and his street-wise mentor is James Woods.  </P> <P> Michael should be on a high. His latest, "Back To The Future III," has been  seen by people in my office and they, along with many others, say this movie is  much better than the rather mean-spirited "Future II." Number III recaptures  the original's playfulness and good-natured sense of fun.  </P> <P> WHISPERS: That gorgeous international star Greta Scacchi will beautify the dog  days of summer with Harrison Ford when their movie "Presumed Innocent" opens in  August. Scacchi also has a co-starring role with "L.A. Law's" Jimmy Smits next  February. The film is called "Fires Within."  </P></p>

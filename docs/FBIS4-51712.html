			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday pointed  to the possibility of France and Indonesia being called to help  settle the Cambodian problem.    King Norodom Sihanouk was proceeding on the issue, Squadron  Leader Prasong said, confirming support for a so-called  round-table among Cambodians.    But he said "there is a mechanism for solving the Cambodian  problem and the most significant one is the co-chairmanship of  Indonesia and France".    The situation may warrant resort to this "old mechanism".    The minister made the remark shortly before it was made  known  that peace talks due to begin in Phnom Penh yesterday and  continue to May 7 had been suspended.    The Khmer Rouge has cited security concerns for refusing to  go to Phnom Penh for talks.    King Sihanouk reportedly has suggested Paris, Jakarta and  Pyongyang as possible alternative venues for the round table.    Thai officials said the 1991 Paris peace agreements provided  for signatories to call on the assistance of the cochairmen of  the Paris conference on Cambodia in the event of a violation or  threat of violation.    The Khmer Rouge signed the peace agreement but refused to  disarm, and fighting has escalated in northwestern Cambodia over  the past week.    Sqn Ldr Prasong urged a negotiated settlement.    "If the round table can be held, the situation will  improve,"  he said.    "I don't think the Cambodian problems can be solved through  military means but rather by political means, which may take  some time. We need to be patient."    Sqn Ldr Prasong made the comments shortly after talks with  United States Deputy Joint Chief-of-Staff Admiral William Owens.    Sqn Ldr Prasong said he asked the U.S. to refrain from  giving  support to any one Cambodian faction as this would prolong the  conflict.    He also reaffirmed that Thailand upheld the policy of  non-interference in Cambodian affairs, and did not support the  Khmer Rouge.</p>

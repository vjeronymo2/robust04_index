			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League ideologue Gianfranco </F> Miglio by Daniele Vimercati in Milan; date not given: "Miglio:  `The North to Us and the South to Fini'" -- first paragraph is  IL GIORNALE introduction]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] It is Gianfranco Miglio, the  Lucifer-like professor of the Northern League, the political  expert from the Cattolica University, who is playing at being a  Beelzebub and is succeeding to perfection. "Yes, a government  with Berlusconi and the fascists will be formed." This is  exactly how he calls them, fascists. However, he is firm about  governing with them.    [Vimercati] But Professor, how can you really believe that  National Alliance will accept federalism, after having defended  a strong and centralized state for years?    [Miglio] It was easy because they gave in immediately. There  was agreement on the need for a strong decisionmakerr, elected  directly by the people, who would act as a meeting point for the  federal macroregions. We wanted this person to be the prime  minister, they were focusing on the president of the republic.  Our formulation was the one that passed, the head of state will  simply be a guarantor and the president of the Constitutional  Court.    [Vimercati] What did they say to you about the macroregions  that were judged as being synonymous with an attack on national  unity until just a few days ago?    [Miglio] We did not enter into the details, but the MSI  [Italian Social Movement] people agree in substance. Also  because they know very well that the governor of the macroregion  in the South will be one of them, they will have the South in  their grasp. The same applies for the Reds, who own the center.    [Vimercati] Yes, the Reds. How do you foresee reforming the  Constitution without support from the Left? In the Senate you  do not have the absolute majority.    [Miglio] Well, I hope that Berlusconi will see to buying  some  representative from the opposition. I, personally, am convinced  about the timeliness of having contacts with the left-wing  parties, also because I know that I have good arguments.  Moreover, I am really curious about what will happen in that  field. If they divide themselves, which could be possible, we  can negotiate. However, I am not obsessed with this problem.    [Vimercati] Do you not think that a new Constitution should  have a consensus that is wider than the one that forms the basis  of a hard-earned majority government?    [Miglio] Absolutely not. We and the fascists have agreed  that the initiative must be a governmental and not a  parliamentary one. One twin-assembly associative commission is  sufficient. The people will then decide.    [Vimercati] You keep on repeating: discussing, governing  with the fascists. As a federalist, does this not have a  strange effect on you?    [Miglio] There are some problems, especially at an  international level. Public opinion overseas is concerned. A  private meeting of all the European autonomist movements  represented in Strasbourg [European Parliament] was held in  Linate [Milan] today. They let us know that they are not happy.  However, we are committed to a decisive battle for federalism  and we cannot be too nice. Even they, the fascists, who until a  short while ago were asking for the abolition of the regions,  understand that dangers do exist.    [Vimercati] Which dangers?    [Miglio] I say that federalism is close, but that if  something were to go wrong, problems would arise. The North is  enticed by independence. I will confess that we talked about  this at the League's last federal council. We asked ourselves:  Is it perhaps the case of trying to play the card of  independence? For the time being we are following the principal  path of federalism, we hope that they are not teasing us.    [Vimercati] And if this should happen?    [Miglio] We would leave the government immediately. We  would not keep watch over a dead body.    [Vimercati] Does it not seem that the League is experiencing  a phase of eclipse?    [Miglio] On the contrary, the League has demonstrated itself  to be the central force, it has forced every one to revolve  around the pivot of federalism.    [Vimercati] Observers have the impression that everything is  revolving around [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi.    [Miglio] I spoke with him recently. He said that he was  enthusiastic about our contacts with the MSI people. He added  that there will be a federal constituent assembly.    [Vimercati] And what do you expect from Bossi at Pontida  [League rally venue]?    [Miglio] He will say that he wants federalism immediately of  course. He will rightly ask for specific and clear pacts.    [Vimercati] Are you concerned about Berlusconi's TV  stations?    [Miglio] I am convinced that he has already decided to move  aside, despite the screams of his plenipotentiary, [Fininvest  Chairman] Confalonieri. Berlusconi has already reconverted  himself many times, he can do this one more time.    [Vimercati] There is no danger for democracy then?    [Miglio] Not if we succeed in imposing a federalism that  will  limit any strong power.    [Vimercati] And if you do not succeed?    [Miglio] Then we can do nothing else but ask Andreotti and  De  Mita to return and take charge of the country again. This means  that we will change the seventh commandment as Dario Fo  suggested: instead of "no stealing" it will be "steal a little  less."</p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Tentative Braniff Deal: After nearly five months of talks with Braniff Inc.  management, negotiators for the airline's pilots have approved a tentative  contract proposal that one union official described as "a quantum leap into the  future" for both groups. The tentative agreement, adopted late Friday night by  the pilots' negotiating committee, now goes to the airline's 850 pilots for  consideration. It will take about a week for union officials to present the  proposal to pilots and for them to vote on it, said John Holland, chairman of  the Master Executive Committee of the Braniff pilots union. If approved by the  pilots, the contract still would have to be approved by the national leadership  of the Air Line Pilots Assn., which represents Braniff pilots.  </P></p>

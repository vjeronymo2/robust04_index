			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUGHES UNIT EXPECTED TO STAY IN TORRANCE  </P> <P> Hughes Aircraft is expected to announce today that it will not relocate its  Torrance-based Electron Dynamics Division and the unit's 1,200 jobs, an option  that has been under consideration during a 10-month study about whether to  remain in Southern California.  </P> <P> The company has considered moving the division, which produces electronic  components for radars and satellites, to locations in New Mexico, Colorado or  Arizona.  </P> <P> If Hughes announces that it will not move the operation, it could send an  important signal that Southern California does not stand to lose every time a  company considers moving out of the area.  </P> <P> Hughes said Monday it would disclose the results of its study today at a news  conference at the Torrance City Hall. The use of city facilities was one strong  indication, sources said, that the decision has been made not to leave the  city.  </P> <P> Torrance Mayor Katie Geissert said she was not privy to Hughes decision, but  said the city had attempted to entice Hughes to remain in Torrance during  meetings in recent months. "They are major contributors to our economy,"  Geissert said.  </P> <P> The Hughes division operates five facilities along Lomita Boulevard in  Torrance, where it produces traveling wave tubes, among other products. The  tubes, which are technically difficult to make, are a key component in  high-power transmitters used in radars and communications satellites.  </P> <P> A Hughes executive said one problem with the Torrance facilities is the high  cost of rent at the leased facilities. He added that the consideration of sites  in other states was not unusual; during a relocation study, it is normal to  examine the best alternatives to staying.  </P> <P> Last summer, another Hughes official said that the company was being "cautious"  in its study and that the softening housing market in Southern California held  out some hope of making homes more affordable for employees.  </P> <P> Hughes has expanded and relocated outside of California in the cases of more  than a half dozen plants, while its California employment has dropped  precipitously over the past several years.  </P></p>

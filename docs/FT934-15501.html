			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Three banks join forces in Russia THREE of the strongest of Russia's many fledgling banks are to merge their operations. With assets of about Rbs1,500bn - high by Russian standards - they will form one of the largest banks in the country. Pre-tax profits last year were Rbs20.2bn. The three banks - Imperial, Yugorsky and Rossiisky Kredit - are backed by some of the largest companies in Russia. Gasprom, the huge state gas monopoly, and Lukoil, one of the biggest of the newly independent oil companies, founded Imperial. A group of western Siberian oil associations owns Yugorsky, and Rossiisky Kredit's main shareholders are the Krasnoyarsk aluminium plant and the Tula small-arms enterprise. The merger, announced yesterday by the news agency Interfax, appears to have been undertaken because the strengths of the banks are complementary. Mr Sergei Rodionov, chairman of Imperial and a former head of the Russian central bank's supervisory department, said Yugorsky had a large portfolio of investment projects, Rossiisky Kredit had one of the most extensive retail branch networks and Imperial had advanced technology and banking skills. This is the first big merger of substantial Russian banks, which normally preserve their recent independence jealously. It is also aimed at strengthening the still weak institutions against the feared, and slowly advancing, foreign competition. The central bank, although supporting some measures of protectionism, has opposed a full ban on the operations of foreign banks, as sought by the former Russian parliament. Mr Rodionov said one aim of the merger was to cut credit risks, since more than 70 per cent of future investment projects would be undertaken from the banks' own portfolios which they would see through 'from beginning to end'.</p>

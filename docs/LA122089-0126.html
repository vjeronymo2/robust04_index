			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS TARGET PORNOGRAPHIC FILMS  </P> <P> The City Council this week was presented with petitions signed by about 1,200  area residents protesting the sale and rental of pornographic films at some  local adult bookstores.  </P> <P> Church leaders and an anti-pornography group delivered the petitions, which  object to movies depicting the graphic abuse of women. Police Chief John R.  Robertson said at least two such films had been recently seized by the Garden  Grove police, and that his department would meet with the district attorney to  discuss prosecution of the crimes.  </P> <P> The Rev. Sharon K. Newland, 33, pastor of family ministries at Living Springs  Christian Fellowship in Garden Grove, told the City Council on Monday that the  films were much worse than soft-core pornography.  </P> <P> "We're not talking about Playboy or X-rated videos," Newland said.  </P> <P> She urged city and county officials to prosecute the makers and marketers of  such materials on obscenity charges.

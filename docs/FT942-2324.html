			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Pension funds Free movement of capital within the European Union has died a quiet death. A proposed EU directive defending the right of pension funds to invest overseas was dropped last week after three years of disagreement. There will be little immediate impact on financial markets: of the Pounds 800bn held in EU pension funds, the vast majority is in UK and Dutch schemes which are free to invest as they choose. With other countries edging towards funded schemes, though, the long-term impact on European capital markets could be profound. It is difficult to justify any blanket limit on overseas investment. An equity portfolio containing around 30 per cent overseas shares is often seen as offering the optimum balance of risk and return. UK pension funds on average hold 25 per cent of their assets in overseas equities and 5 per cent in foreign bonds, but that level of overseas investment is not without risk. As UK funds mature, such a large mismatch between foreign currency assets and sterling liabilities will be more difficult to justify. The government's proposals for a solvency test for pension funds, expected this week, could bring matters to a head. Under the test, liabilities would be valued with reference to UK bond and equity yields. Overseas equities are unlikely to feature in the calculation. Older schemes which are less well endowed will question whether the risk of falling below the solvency threshold is worth the additional returns from investing abroad. That does not alter the case against an explicit cap on foreign investment, but the drift of UK pension fund assets overseas may have reached its peak.</p>

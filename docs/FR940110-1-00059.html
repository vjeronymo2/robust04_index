			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board has determined that an estimate for reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utility costs should be included in the determination of rents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charged to households under this section, if they are not already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the projected rents. Including utility costs would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce the housing cost burden for very low-income households  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the AHP, and would allow all rental projects to be treated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equally, since some projects include the cost of utilities in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rent, while others do not include such costs in the rent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Including utility costs would be consistent with the treatment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rents in other federal housing programs, such as HUD's Section 8  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program and the LIHTC program. It also would be consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the treatment of rents under the AHP's 20 percent requirement,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is currently an interim rule of the Board, and which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated in &sect;960.9(c) of this proposed rule. (See discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 20 percent requirement below.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``affordable for low- or moderate-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households'' in &sect;960.1 of the proposed rule is similar to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above definition, except that the household must have an income of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 80 percent, instead of 50 percent, of the median income for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area, since the Act defines a ``low- or moderate-income household''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as any household which has an income of 80 percent or less of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area median. 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(13)(A).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sale of AHP-assisted rental housing project. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.5(a)(3) of the proposed rule provides that an owner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an AHP-assisted rental housing project may sell the project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to the end of the long-term period during which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project's rental units, or applicable portion thereof, must remain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at or below  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the levels committed to in the AHP application; however, either:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The purchaser must agree to continue the project's rental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units, or applicable portion thereof, as affordable for and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committed to in the AHP application for the remainder of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long-term period committed to in the AHP application, and must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agree to be subject to the same restrictions on resale that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied to the seller; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. If the purchaser does not satisfy the requirements in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph a. above, and if the Bank provided a direct subsidy to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicant which was passed on as a grant to the seller, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seller must repay a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  portion of the grant as provided in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;960.16(d)(1); or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. If the purchaser does not satisfy the requirements in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph a. above, and if the Bank provided a subsidized advance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the applicant which in turn provided a below market rate loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the seller, then the provisions of &sect;960.16(d)(2) shall apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;960.5(b) further provides that the Bank's AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation plan shall permit the owner of an AHP-assisted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rental housing project to sell such project as provided for in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (a)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. Establishment of AHP Funding Cycles and Available AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsidies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.6(a)(1) of the proposed rule requires each Bank to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish at least two but no more than four AHP funding cycles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per year during which applications for AHP subsidized advances or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct subsidies will be accepted. This is a change from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board's existing AHP regulation, which provides that the Banks may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accept AHP applications during two of four quarterly periods each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year. See 12 CFR 960.4(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.6(a)(1) of the proposed rule also provides that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP funding cycle schedule, including application due dates, is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be determined by the Bank in its discretion, but shall allow for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient time intervals to ensure an adequate pool of applicants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to compete in each funding cycle. The funding cycles schedule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including application due dates, shall be described in detail in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Bank's AHP implementation plan. This is also a change from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Board's existing AHP regulation, which sets forth specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application due dates. See 12 CFR 960.4(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.6(a)(2) of the proposed rule provides that each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank shall inform the general public and its members of the number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and dates of its AHP funding cycles for the year and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximate amount of available AHP subsidies for each funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycle at least 45 calendar days before the due date for AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications for the first funding cycle for the year. This is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change from the Board's existing AHP regulation, which requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each Bank to announce its funding cycles by December 1 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preceding year, and to notify only its members of the approximate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of AHP subsidies to be offered in each funding cycle. See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 CFR 960.4(a), (b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

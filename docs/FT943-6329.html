			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Observer: Soft landing So Stephen Wolf is really grounded for good. The man who last month quit as boss of United Airlines when employees took the controls has wasted no time in finding a new slot. But, his 28 years in the airline business notwithstanding, it is Wall Street and Lazard Freres where he is poised to land. The airline industry is the primary loser, for Wolf had immense experience. After a low-key start with a sociology degree from San Francisco State University, he was soon winging his way upwards, initially with American Airlines. By the time he joined United in 1987, he had seen the insides of Pan Am, Continental, Republic and Tiger International (parent of The Flying Tiger Line). It was his success at brow beating the unions that made his departure from United an inevitability, once the workers took control. But, precisely as a turnaround artist able to wring concessions from employees, Wolf, 53, will no doubt earn his keep as a senior adviser with Lazard. His advice on mergers, acquisitions and restructurings will be founded on something more than business school case studies. At his new stable, he has a close personal friend in Ira Harris, the partner heading the Chicago office. And the firm obviously passed muster on a professional basis when it advised Wolf and United in the course of the buy-out negotiations with the unions.</p>

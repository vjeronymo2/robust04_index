			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: First Pacific tumbles 21.2% FIRST Pacific, the Hong Kong distribution and telecommunications group, yesterday announced a 21.2 per cent decline in 1991 net earnings to HKDollars 288.5m (USDollars 38.1m) from HKDollars 366m in 1990. The company also said it had written off its investment in Internatio-Muller, a Rotterdam-based trading and transport group, in which First Pacific bought a 43.2 per cent interest last May. First Pacific purchased the shares in an attempt to merge the company with Hagemeyer, a marketing and distribution subsidiary, but this was successfully blocked by the Internatio-Muller management. The company said the decline in its profit resulted from significant losses at Metro Drug, its Philippines subsidiary and Tech Pacific, its Australian computer software company. The contribution from banking declined due to the sale of its wholly-owned banking interests to 67 per cent-owned Hong Kong listing First Pacific Bancshares. Cellular telephone operator Pacific Link showed strong growth, more than doubling its subscriber base in 1991, while Hagemeyer achieved record profits. After extraordinary gains and losses associated with asset sales and the writing off of its Internatio-Muller stake, First Pacific made a gain of Dollars 115.1m. Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders reached Dollars 358.5m, up 17.2 per cent from 1990, after the disposal of a number of investments. The company said it was positioned for a strong profit recovery in 1992. It announced a final dividend of 5 cents, maintaining the total for the year at 8 cents a share.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Poison gases were used against Serbian positions on  the Glamoc front last night [19 April], forcing Serbian fighters  to seek urgent medical care. Here is a report by Slavisa  Sabljic:    [Sabljic] Aircraft flew over Serbian positions on the Glamoc  front in the republic of Srpska at about 1800 yesterday evening.  These planes, which are as yet unidentified but which were  definitely enemy planes, left behind a thick veil of smoke  forcing all Serbian fighters on the front line to seek urgent  medical care to deal with breathing discomforts and sharp  stomach pains.    Serbian military sources are awaiting the results of a  microbiological analysis of specimens taken from the affected  soldiers before giving any further details about the incident.  They are confident, however, that an as yet unknown poison gas  was used for the first time and that the brave soldiers of  Glamoc were the first to experience the toxicity of the gas.    The thick toxic smoke was released by propeller aircraft  which throughout yesterday flew over the Serbian positions on  (Goricna), Golija, and (Bujaca), about 15 km from Glamoc.    [Announcer] We have learned that the specimens are being  analyzed in Banja Luka and that the results of the analysis will  be announced the day after tomorrow.</p>

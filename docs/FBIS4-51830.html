			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 3 KYODO -- The supreme leader of the  Japanese Communist Party (JCP) urged Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  Tuesday [3 May] to dissolve the House of Representatives for a  snap general election to see where voters stand on a minority  government. Kenji Miyamoto, chairman of the JCP Central  Committee, said, "The Hata cabinet must tap the will of voters  since the government has fallen to a minority government."    Speaking at the party-sponsored Red Flag Festival, Miyamoto  said the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] quit  the coalition after its partners made light of it.    JCP Chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa, who also spoke at the event,  accused the United States of provoking war against North Korea.    Fuwa said, "The U.S. is the world's largest nuclear power.  The U.S. is provoking war and punishing another country if it  is trying to obtain nuclear arms."    He also accused the U.S. of threatening the peace in Asia  and  rest of the world. Fuwa said Japan must never join the U.S. if  it imposes sanctions against North Korea.</p>

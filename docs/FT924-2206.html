			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / International Company News: Arrangements advanced for sale of 25m Teva shares ARRANGEMENTS are well advanced for the sale of the 25m shares in Teva, the Israeli pharmaceutical group, which are owned by the Common Investment Fund  -the pot into which the Maxwell pension funds were pooled for investment. Mr Neil Cooper of accountants Robson Rhodes, liquidator to Bishopsgate Investment Management, manager and trustee of the Maxwell pension funds, said that a sale was expected 'in the New Year'. He would not specify a date, stressing that this was market-sensitive information, but said the Teva shares 'were not necessarily ones we want to hold on to'. However, he had just approved the appointment of County NatWest, the investment house, as advisers on the sale of the shares. The Teva shares were valued at Pounds 25m last summer and are now estimated to be worth more than Pounds 40m. The shares were voluntarily returned to the pension funds in June this year by National Westminster Bank, which had been pledged them as security for a Dollars 27.3m (Pounds 17.9m) loan to Robert Maxwell Group, a Maxwell private company, two days after Robert Maxwell's death. Any distributions of the money to the pensioners is subject to continuing disputes over claims on ownership between trustees to the five Maxwell pension funds which contributed to the CIF.</p>

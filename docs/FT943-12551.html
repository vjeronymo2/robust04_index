			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Pay gap between sexes narrows The salary gap between male and female executives is narrowing fast, says the latest quarterly survey by pay and benefit consultants Sedgwick Noble Lowndes. The survey also finds that the downward trend in executive pay rises has been reversed and that executive increases are now nearly 50 per cent higher than the rise in average earnings, which is 3.75 per cent. The news of the narrowing pay gap for women executives will be broadly welcomed, especially after recent figures showing that the number of women managers in Britain's top organisations is falling. Those figures, from the Institute of Management, showed that the proportion of female senior managers and directors had fallen from last year's 10.2 per cent to 9.5 per cent. The latest pay figures show that in the past 12 months the average increase in women's base salary was 5.4 per cent compared with 5 per cent for their male counterparts. In the same period a year ago the average rise was 6 per cent for women compared with 5.4 per cent. The statistics, drawn from a database of 5,199 executives in 407 companies, show a consistent pattern over the past four years, with women receiving up to a fifth more - in relative terms - than men in their pay awards. But the gap remains wide. The average base salary for directors is Pounds 67,371 for men and Pounds 54,836 for women, a gap of 22.9 per cent. For function heads the gap drops to 10.2 per cent - Pounds 44,832 for men and Pounds 40,698 for women. At departmental level the difference is 9 per cent  -Pounds 36,259 for men and Pounds 33,169 for women. Mr Andy Christie, remuneration consulting director at Sedgwick Noble Lowndes, said: 'There has been an attempt to narrow the pay gap, at least at executive level, but it is still considerable and appears to widen as women climb the executive ladder. At director level men are still earning over 20 per cent more than women in similar positions.' Overall, 27 per cent of executives have enjoyed pay awards of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent since January, compared with 18 per cent in the previous six months. There has also been a sharp increase in the number of executives receiving performance-related bonuses: in the past year 44 per cent received them compared with 39 per cent in the previous year.</p>

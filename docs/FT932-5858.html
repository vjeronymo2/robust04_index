			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / World Trade News: EC fails to ease Cairns Group fears MR Peter Cook, Australian trade minister, yesterday called for the Cairns Group of agricultural exporting countries to toughen its stand in the Gatt global trade liberalisation talks. His call followed high-level talks with the European Commission in Brussels, during which he failed to receive assurances about early European ratification of last year's US-EC Blair House accord on agricultural export subsidies. Australia, representing the 14-member Cairns Group, is worried that the EC-US focus on reaching a substantial market access package in industrial products and services risks delaying final agreement on agriculture. In Brussels yesterday, Mr Cook suggested - in talks with Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, and Mr Rene Steichen, EC agriculture commissioner - that the US, EC, Japan and Canada - the principal negotiators in the market access talks - might be tempted to re-open Blair House in order to bridge last-minute differences. But, after the Brussels meetings, Mr Cook left the impression that the EC was unable to give assurances either on the timetable for ratification of Blair House or on the inviolability of the accord. The Blair House agreement, which limited EC-US farm export subsidies, faces severe criticism from France. However, the French government has signalled it is ready to accept part of the transatlantic agreement covering oilseeds. Mr Cook told reporters that Blair House was 'rock bottom' for the Cairns Group in terms of an acceptable deal. He added: 'I don't think the Commission was in a position to give me a commitment (on Blair House) in advance. I don't think I will be returning to the southern hemisphere thinking that all is sweet on agriculture.' As a result, Mr Cook said, Australia would urge the Cairns Group to adopt a tough message at its meeting in Bangkok on June 26-27, aimed at ensuring its interests are heeded at the Group of Seven industrialised countries' meeting in Tokyo on July 7-9. The EC hopes to reach a broad agreement among the G7 on an across-the-board market access package, using such a deal as a springboard for a comprehensive Gatt agreement by mid-December, the deadline for the expiry of fast-track negotiating authority for US President Bill Clinton. At a meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris today, Mr Cook will receive another account of progress among the US, EC, Canada and Japan on the market access package.</p>

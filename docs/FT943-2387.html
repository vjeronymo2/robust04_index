			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Haiti: Haitians wonder, What next? - James Harding joins a bewildered crowd watching the Americans fly in Charlie said his friends, standing bewildered on the quayside across from a US aircraft-carrier in Port-au-Prince harbour, did not like him speaking English. 'They want me to speak Creole or French, but I like to speak English because Americans is raining down in on the city,' the former tourism operator said. Most people, unsure whether the last-minute deal by the US and Haiti would stick, contained their enthusiasm. As the US troops arrived - not in a shower of paras, as the delighted Charlie described, but in a swarm of helicopters flying low over the bay to the civilian airport north of the city - Haitian heads lifted from their daily business. Neither in celebration nor defeat, most appeared to be wondering: 'What next?' The mood on the streets changed throughout the day. At dawn, before the US troops landed, the marketplaces bustled. The men carried baskets of disweet (flat-square bread), the women sold papaya and avocados, and the stores offered soft drinks and plastic trinkets that had squeaked through the two-year-old economic blockade. By midday, however, the spirit of business as usual gave way to nervous confusion and the streets were almost empty. Confidence returned with the evening as thousands of Haitians lined the shore to watch the US naval flotilla and wave upon wave of helicopters. Because of the economic embargo, which has increased the price of staple foodstuffs threefold and petrol 15-fold, the arrival of the Americans has come as a relief to many. 'When I saw President Clinton, I said 'God bless you' to America. This has gone on too long,' said Moise Herbert, a driver in the Haitian capital. 'This is the last chance for Haiti to be born again. We can't take more than we already have.' His friend, Pierre Joseph, a supporter of the ousted president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was sceptical. 'Cedras said he would leave before in October and now he is saying again he would leave in October. We don't believe him.' He was referring to the last US-brokered agreement with the army chief, Lt-Gen Raoul Cedras, in 1993 which provided for the military to step down and Father Aristide to return. If the future of Gen Cedras, the police chief Lt-Col Michel Francois, and General Phillippe Biamby was unclear yesterday as more and more US military personnel arrived, the threat they posed to the Haitian people seemed to be receding. Some people, who complained of the junta's reign of terror, now saw no need for a witch-hunt. One man said: 'Cedras could stay if he wants because he is in his country, but he doesn't matter now.' One thing all agreed on was relief that there had been no hostile intervention. Zachary, a relief worker, said: 'You've got to think it's good  -there's no blood.' But, warned Zachary, there were still dangers. He did not believe the Haitian military would disobey Gen Cedras if he had accepted the agreement, but said there could still be casualties. For example, 'if one of them (the Haitian soldiers) does not know how to carry a gun and a bullet just takes off', he said, waving his arms in all directions. The possibility of guerrilla warfare is another unknown. US officials do not rule it out. Testing the temperature of popular sentiment is difficult. The walls of the capital are covered with anti-Aristide and anti-intervention graffiti, such as 'no to Aristide - Aristide is Castro', and '1915 (the first year of a two-decade US occupation) - never again'. Whether these, like the small groups of anti-US protestors outside the palace over the last few days, are an outpouring of public feeling or commissioned by the military is not clear. Honest comment has been further skewed by the arrival of thousands of journalists to whom Haitians, for a fee, are happy to give a big smile and a pro-American soundbite. With so many questions unanswered - not least how many US servicemen will stay and for how long - the Clinton administration may find Charlie's expectations worrying. Asked what the US-led forces should do in Haiti, he said he wanted them to run the country. 'The city is too dirty, there are no roads - the Americans could do everything. I like the Americans to stay for all time - forever.'</p>

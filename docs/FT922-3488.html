			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitive year for Northern Foods NORTHERN FOODS' balance sheet has borne the costs of its acquisition programme, which totalled Pounds 398m in the year to end-March, up from Pounds 69m the year before. Net borrowings at the year end were Pounds 199m (Pounds 53.4m). Shareholders' funds fell from Pounds 305.4m to Pounds 277m, leaving gearing at 72 per cent (18 per cent). There was a goodwill write-off of Pounds 282m, a Pounds 6m fair value adjustment and a Pounds 36m provision to cover rationalisation costs at Express Dairies and Eden Vale. Part of the acquisition was funded by a rights issue which raised Pounds 227m after expenses. Mr Martin Clark, finance director, said that the group's cash flow was strong. He said internally generated funds covered a record level of capital spending of Pounds 93m (Pounds 61m) with Pounds 30m to spare. In the current year, he said, capital expenditure would rise to Pounds 120m, but would fall the year after that. As a result the depreciation charge of about Pounds 40m in the past year would rise to about Pounds 60m in the current year. Mr Clark said that from 1993 onwards the group would generate substantial cashflow. Meanwhile, interest cover was comfortable. He expected borrowings to remain at the same absolute level during the current year, but gearing would fall as shareholders' funds rose. Profits increases were recorded by all four of Northern Foods' divisions. Group trading profits rose 23 per cent to Pounds 137.5m. The dairy division raised profits by 25 per cent to Pounds 62.5m on sales 27 per cent higher at Pounds 568.6m. The slight weakening in margins was accounted for by the inclusion of Express Dairy. Significant savings are expected from the closure of two dairies and the head office in London and a Pounds 9m spending programme at the Express dairy in Ruislip, west London. The convenience food division raised profits 35 per cent to Pounds 29.4m on turnover of Pounds 379.8m, some 34 per cent ahead. Underlying growth was 10 per cent. This included Eden Vale, the chilled dairy products business acquired with Express Dairy. Mr Chris Haskins, chairman, said he expected margins at Eden Vale to double eventually when its head office had been closed, private label business was introduced and more marketing effort was put into brands such as Ski yoghurt. Meat had a flat second half, leaving profits for the year 9 per cent up at Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 22.1m). Recession affected sales to the catering industry, while the poultry business only broke even because of the over-supply of chickens. Grocery products, including Fox's biscuits, achieved a 21 per cent profit rise to Pounds 21.5m.</p>

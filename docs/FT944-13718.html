			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Hino Motors recovers sharply Hino Motors, Japan's largest truck maker, yesterday announced a sharp profits recovery for the first half of the year and forecast more than doubled earnings for the full 12 months. It reported a 39.1 per cent rise in recurring profit - before extraordinary items and tax - to Y2.79bn (Dollars 29m) in the six months to September. The group, 11 per cent owned by Toyota, attributed the improvement to an increase in demand from civil engineering companies, carrying out the public works funded by the Japanese government's economic measures. Tougher rules against overloading also added to demand for new trucks. Hino expects the profits improvement to accelerate in the current six months, this time helped by the steady recovery of the domestic economy, so that 1994 will mark the end of a three-year profits decline. Interim turnover rose by 9.1 per cent to Y302bn, within which unit sales to the domestic market climbed by 20.2 per cent to 69,820 vehicles. This more than made up for a 14.6 per cent decline in exports to 15,560 units, a mark of the damage inflicted by the yen's strength on Hino's overseas price competitiveness. Hino's net profits rose by 58.7 per cent to Y1.62bn, worth Y4.48 a share, up from earnings of Y2.82 a share in the first six months of last year. Hino will pay an unchanged dividend of Y3 a share.</p>

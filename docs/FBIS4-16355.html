			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Turchenko report: "Disgraced Division"] </F>   [Text] The provocative incident connected with the seizure  of the 318th Division of Black Sea Fleet ships by Ukrainian  special-purpose troops elicited a harsh reaction both in Russia  and in Ukraine. We asked Captain First Rank Valeriy Volodin,  chairman of the Black Sea Fleet Officers' Assembly, to comment  on what happened.    "Servicemen of the Bolgrad Airborne Brigade of the Ukrainian  Armed Forces participated in the seizure of the division of  mothballed Black Sea Fleet ships in Odessa during the night of  9-10 April. The Ukrainian servicemen were put on alert status  and delivered in seven Ural trucks to the Potemkin Steps in  Odessa. They infiltrated the unit's territory through the  windows of the checkpoint. The attackers arrested 31 people.  The commander of Odessa Military District came to the division,  read out to the personnel the Ukrainian defense minister's  directive disbanding the unit, and put an ultimatum to the  servicemen: take an oath of loyalty to Ukraine. Those who  refused, so it followed from the directive, would be instructed  to leave for military units on the territory of CIS states.  Only four officers and 12 warrant officers among the personnel  of the 318th Division agreed to this. In all, approximately 200  servicemen in the unit must come to a decision on service."    Right after the incident a Russian delegation headed by  Yuriy  Dubinin, ambassador for special assignments, flew to Kiev. It  held talks with Borys Tarasyuk, Ukrainian deputy minister of  foreign affairs. It also met with Leonid Kravchuk. The results  of the talks were not made public.    A meeting of officers of the fleet's chief base and of the  garrison's military units was held in Sevastopol yesterday. It  adopted a resolution in which the Black Sea Fleet sailors demand  an end to provocations by nationalist Ukrainian forces.  Bewilderment was expressed at the lack of a reaction to what  happened from the presidents of Russia and Ukraine. The  officers voiced a total lack of trust in the Ukrainian Ministry  of Defense and demanded that tough measures be taken, even  including criminal proceedings against the officials who  organized the provocation.</p>

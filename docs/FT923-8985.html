			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US meat output soars to record AMERICAN RED meat production soared to new highs in June, bucking generally depressed global market trends. The US Department of Agriculture has reported that commercial red meat production went up 12 per cent from last year to 3.42bn lb, a record for June. Also, pork production, at 1.33bn lb, broke a 12-year old monthly output record. This output surge will probably further improve US export performance, which has risen steadily during the first half of the year. For the first five months, beef and veal exports were up 8 per cent compared with the same period last year to 175,000 tonnes, worth Dollars 791m, while pork exports rose 32 per cent to 47,000 tonnes, worth Dollars 161m. June export figures are not yet available. Industry analysts warn, however, the production boost may be illusory. This June there were more slaughter days than last June and, more importantly, output is largely supply driven. 'We go through cycles of production, but we also have had slight growth in demand,' says Mr Glenn Grimes, an agricultural economist at the University of Missouri. Most of the increase comes from hogs, which are up 17 per cent over the last year. 'We're actually setting a record in pork production in 1992,' says Mr Grimes, who estimates output at 17.2bn lb, eclipsing the 1980 record of 16.43bn lb.</p>

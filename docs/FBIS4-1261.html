			<p>BFN     [Text] At least 14,000 government and Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo] soldiers were demobilized throughout the  country by 24 April. Over the last three days the two sides  have (?only) sent 51 men to join the new Mozambican Army,  thereby increasing to 4,000 the number of troops available for  the formation of the future Mozambique Defense Armed Forces.  Meanwhile, the UN Operations in Mozambique has reported that  some 50,000 government and Renamo soldiers have already been  confined to their assembly areas.</p>

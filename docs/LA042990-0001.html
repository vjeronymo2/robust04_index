			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> What a magnificent production of "Jesus of Nazareth." Hats off to Zeffirelli  (et al.) who had the vision for such a masterpiece.  </P> <P> It was my fifth viewing of the miniseries, which I would never miss. We seldom  see such quality in films these days and what a treat to have NBC bring it to  us.  </P> <P> Mrs. D. Porter, Yucaipa  </P></p>

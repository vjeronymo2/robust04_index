			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (46): Bad news for drug smugglers  -User view: Customs and Excise WHEN someone is discovered trying to smuggle drugs through Customs, officers must make a record of the details so that information is available for the later prosecution of the case. In years gone by, the painstaking recording of data proved to be time-consuming (taking up to two hours in many cases) and was also liable to clerical error along the way. Then, between November 1988 and May 1989, HM Customs and Excise looked into three database packages for its seizure documentation system at London's Heathrow airport. The product chosen, Sybase, submitted the cheapest bid, and it was also at that time, according to Vic Whittington, head of the informationtechnology (IT) infrastructure division,'way ahead on client-serverarchitecture.' With the new system, details of incidents are recorded on a local personal computer. After entry, the data is sent across the network to the Sybase server, where it is stored. Information can then be sent back to the local personal computer, if necessary, to be printed out. The Sybase system has speeded-up the recording process, releasing officers to spend more time dealing with the public. In what must be bad news for drug smugglers, the system has also improved the accuracy and 'trackability' of recording of evidence on drug trafficking which is so essential to provide records for court evidence. Vic Whittington says that the rate of development of the system was slower than expected, largely because of HM Customs' own strategy, not because of the product - 'Sybase has met our requirements, but then so would any other,' he says. It is, though, now part of HM Customs' IT strategy. Although the system is so far only being used for recording the seizure of drugs, it will soon be extended to include all contraband material. Later, it will feed information into the intelligence unit, warehouse and management information systems.</p>

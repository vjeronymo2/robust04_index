			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITERATURE, BY FRED CHAPPELL  </P> <P> The girls and flowers keep changing into literature  </P> <P> until that endless languid age arrives  </P> <P> when all the world becomes a picture catalogue of  </P> <P> gardens  </P> <P> where men and women play at chess, at love,  </P> <P> and every animal comes fawning to the hand.  </P> <P> Then the spirit must begin once more,  </P> <P> untaming everything that it has tamed,  </P> <P> forgetting all that it has paid for in blood,  </P> <P> until the blazoned phrases melt from the vellum  </P> <P> and the gold-leaf initials turn into butterflies  </P> <P> and lift off the pages, climbing into space  </P> <P> to find the hidden planet all wild rose and chicory.  </P> <P> Slow signals are emitted from that far system.  </P> <P> The planet throbs in its orbit like a hive of sleepy bees,  </P> <P> the seasons settle into an undying summer  </P> <P> where poplar leaves slide in the wind  </P> <P> like shoals of rainbow trout nibbling the river.  </P> <P> It is a world prepared for men,  </P> <P> but no one comes, each reader still entranced  </P> <P> by the courtly chronicle of his native world,  </P> <P> the book that murmurs the secret names of lovers.  </P> <P>  From "First and Last Words" by Fred Chappell (Louisiana State University  Press: $13.95, cloth; $6.95, paper; 64 pp.). Chappell, a professor of English  at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, has received the Bollingen  Prize in Poetry.

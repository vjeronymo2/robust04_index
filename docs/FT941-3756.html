			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / People: McKinnon to chair T. Cowie Sir James McKinnon, previously director general of Ofgas, the gas industry regulatory body, has been appointed non-executive chairman of T. Cowie, the motor finance and retailing group with a turnover of Pounds 800m. His appointment, which takes immediate effect, reflects the enhanced influence on Cowie policy of chief executive Gordon Hodgson since the company's forceful founder and chairman Sir Tom Cowie retired last year. Until now Cowie has had only one non-executive director at a time on its board. The company is now seeking a third, to join Sir James and Lord Elliott of Morpeth, until now the only one; an announcement is expected shortly. A spokesman says Cowie believes non-execs can bring a valuable outside perspective. Sir James had been chosen because of his extensive city experience and the 'right chemistry' with Hodgson. Both, said the spokesman, were self-made men from modest backgrounds who had trained as accountants. 'They both have a forthright and frank manner.' Sir James, 64, was earlier this month recruited as chairman of Trafficmaster, a provider of in-car traffic information, which is to be floated. Currently he chairs MAI, the money, securities and television company, is deputy chairman of Scotia Holdings (pharmaceuticals), chairman of Ionica (radio telecommunications) and a non-executive director of Admiral (computer services, systems development and software). His Cowie role is expected to take up four to five days a month.</p>

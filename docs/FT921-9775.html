			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Arts: 'When beauty is destroyed, God suffers' - Civil war has inflicted more damage in Croatia than any world war / Architecture It was a bizarre and moving sight. A well-dressed evening crowd in London stood before the glowing eye of a television set, their eyes riveted to film of bombs and rockets blazing over the ancient city of Dubrovnik. It was no ordinary gathering. The majority of the crowd were Croatians either living or in exile in London. They had gathered to attend the opening of an exhibition of photographs in London's Royal Festival Hall documenting the tragic loss of much of the cultural heritage of their country. As the sun went down and the floodlights came on along the banks of the Thames, it was impossible not to compare the calmness of London with the brutal destruction so recently inflicted upon the ancient cities of a European neighbour. 'When beauty is destroyed, God suffers.' These were the poetic words of Dr Stambuk, the UK representative of the Croatian government who spoke at the opening of the exhibition. Dr Stambuk is both a medical doctor and a poet and he movingly described both the loss of lives in the recent civil war in Yugoslavia and the damage to the art and architecture of Croatia that is part of the European cultural heritage. There are perhaps some 20,000 dead in Croatia and some half a million refugees; thousands of homes, villages and some 30 towns have been destroyed; and 400 churches have been ruined. The Ministry of Culture and Education in Zagreb estimates that some 40 per cent of the built fabric of Croatia has been ruined. The damage inflicted by Federal forces is far worse than anything any part of the country experienced during the Second World War. The question has to be asked: were the ears of Europe sealed that it did not hear the cries of pain? No one can deny that the cities of Zagreb, Dubrovnik and Split are important places in the history and culture of Europe. It was Rebecca West, in her book Black Lamb and Grey Falcon, who described Zagreb as having, 'the warm and comfortable appearance of a town that has been well aired. People have been living there in physical, but not political, comfort for a thousand years. Moreover it is full of those vast toast-coloured buildings, barracks and law courts and municipal offices, which are an invariable sign of past occupancy by the Austro-Hungarian Empire'. It is not a flamboyant city. The moderately elevated upper town still has its medieval character while the lower town retains some sense of Imperial Vienna. The upper town was bombed and attacked by rockets in a big air raid last October. Damage was inflicted on more than 70 important buildings and the governor's palace was ravaged. Photographs in the exhibition graphically show how rockets damaged rooftops in the densely packed older parts of the city. Dubrovnik has been exposed to destructive military and naval attacks since the beginning of last October. It is hard to imagine this Dalmatian coastal town, which has many of the qualities of Venice, being so brutally attacked, so recently. In some ways the remarkable 12th- and 13th-century walls may have fulfilled their original function and helped protect the city from even worse damage. At certain points the walls are some 30 feet thick and 80 feet high but since November last year, when the historic centre was subjected to incessant shelling, they have not been enough to defend the city. The famous Minceta Tower - the best viewpoint for the city walls - the northern and western ramparts and the Gate of Pila have all been directly shelled and damaged. The two citadels of St John, Bokar and St Saviour have also suffered serious damage. It was last December 6 that the very heart of the famous old city experienced a barbaric bombardment from Yugoslavian naval vessels. The 15th-century fountain designed by the Neapolitan architect Onofrio de la Cava, which is like a great domed altar running with water, was badly hit. The Sponza Palace, on the main square of Stari Grad, with its almost perfect 14th-century courtyard, has been damaged. This wonderful building is a lovely mixture of the Renaissance style and Venetian Gothic. Its growth shows that styles can mix, if a continuous civilisation builds with local coherence and integrity. Added to this tragedy is the fact that archives housed here dating back to the 12th century may have been destroyed. A great part of the attraction of Dubrovnik lies in the unspoilt atmosphere it maintained on its tiny, half mile wide, peninsula. It still felt like an independent republic that never fell under the rule of Hungary or Venice. It is a terrible irony that the city that resisted the Turks and other invaders for so long is now being so badly damaged by civil war. The fearful damage seems so wrong, as there have been no troops or military installations of any importance in Dubrovnik since the 1960s. Damage to its historic heart is equalled by the loss of many of the fine summer houses around the city and the burning of many of the 16th-century gardens that were so admired by Lord Byron. In the Gruz Port area almost total destruction is reported, including the loss of two rare Renaissance summer houses. The main street of the old city, Stradun, has been riven with craters by grenades, and the cupola of the cathedral has been damaged. The official estimates of the damage in Dubrovnik suggest that some 30 per cent of the entire historic city centre has been heavily damaged and that 10 per cent has been completely destroyed by fire. There is also serious shell damage in the port of Split; and the old centres of Vukovar, Osijek, Kostajnica, Otocac, Gospic and Petrinja have been completely destroyed. While it is possible to see the records of all this horrific cultural damage in London at the Royal Festival Hall exhibition - also in displays at the Courtauld Institute in Somerset House and the Photographers' Gallery in Great Newport Street - anyone concerned with the culture of Europe must feel the need to help Croatia. Both funds and expertise are badly needed. An appeal is now launched under the auspices of the International Council on Monuments and Sites. Cheques should be sent to 'The International Monuments Trust, Croatia Appeal', c/o Lady Beresford-Pierse, 34 Cadogan Square, London, SW1X 0JL.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 17 May (PL) -- It was learned here today  that Cuban physicists are designing a three to six megawatt  research nuclear reactor. The physicists hope to have the  nuclear reactor operational by the end of the century.    Andres Garcia, secretary of the Nuclear Affairs Executive  Secretariat, explained to PRENSA LATINA that the project is part  of a strategy aimed at the gradual advancement of the potential  in this field that, even though it is seriously affected by  material shortages, has the scientific capacity for the  development of this type of technology.    The idea of the reactor, Garcia said, is linked to the  creation of a center for the production of radioactive isotopes  that should be completed by late this year and that includes,  among its main objectives, becoming a source of radionuclides  for medicine and the pharmaceutical industry.    We hope 50 percent of the reactor's technology will be  produced in the country, Garcia added. Garcia said a small  group of very highly qualified specialists are designing the  nuclear reactor.    From the very beginning, the Cuban nuclear program was  conceived as a multiphase project and, together with nuclear  energy (the production of electricity by the fission of an  atom), the use of radioisotopes and radiation in various fields  will also be developed.    The center for the production of isotopes, located at the La  Quebrada Research Center in southeastern Havana, is being built  with the help of Invap S. Emn, an Argentine enterprise  specializing in that technique.    Regarding the construction of the Juragua Electro Nuclear  Plant, which was being done with the help of the former USSR and  is currently stopped, Garcia said talks are under way with  Italian, British, and French companies interested in continuing  the construction.    The Cuban Atomic Center project included the supply of two  VVER, model V-318, (water pressure) reactors. Each of these  reactors can supply 417 megawatts of electricity.</p>

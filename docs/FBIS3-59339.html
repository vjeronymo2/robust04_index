			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang Tao (1728 1718) and Wang Huaijian (3769 </F> 2037 1696): "Measures To Improve Heilongjiang's Sluggish  Industrial Growth"]    [Text] Looking at Heilongjiang industries' "northeast  phenomenon," the only way to vitalize them is to focus on the  key links that are holding back industrial development and  achieve major breakthroughs in the system.    1. Restructure the tax system to achieve major  breakthroughs in expanding local financial power. Looking  at the current situation, the financial system that lets the  central and local governments "eat out of separate pots" no  longer meets the needs of our economic development. It is  imperative that we separate state and local taxes. Therefore, we  must seize the opportunity before us to make a breakthrough in  the financial system. The provincial party committee and  provincial government must diligently review the experience and  lessons in the second phase reform to substitute taxation for  profit delivery and "eat out of separate pots" and, in light of  Heilongjiang's own realistic situation, gather the relevant  departments to conduct an in-depth investigation and study to  sort out the situation and forecast the future and come up with  some suggestions and a program to separate state and local  taxes. They should actively report to the central authorities  and, in separating state and local taxes, strive to keep the  share of local financial power at or near the nation's average  level, so as to lay the foundation for industrial development.    2. Further restructure the system of planning to make a  breakthrough in retaining a larger percentage of the raw  materials: 1) Reduce the scope of mandatory planning with  regard to petroleum. First, it will be unrealistic to completely  change the production pattern already set up under the planned  system, but we can use 50 million tons of petroleum as base and  allocate it according to state plan; the remaining portion  should be kept by the localities. Second, with regard to  petroleum gas, the province should be allowed to work with  Daqing in its comprehensive development and utilization. Third,  while Daqing expands its new oil fields, the localities should  be allowed to buy shares and make investments; oil should be  allocated according to the number of shares. Fourth, local  governments should be allowed to invest in and exploit odd-lot  oil fields around Daqing and engage in the deep-processing work.  Fifth, the localities should have priority in projects  complementing the initial processing of new crude produced in  Daqing. 2) Reduce the scope of mandatory planning with respect  to timber. The state's reduced timber index for 1992 should be  used as base, and the entire contract should be taken over by  the year 2000. While balancing tree-cutting and tree-planting,  any out-of-plan timber should be deep-processed by the  localities. 3) Continue to reduce the fixed quota procurement of  grain. To reduce fixed quota procurement, the current 10.6  billion jin should be cut to 8 billion jin. The remaining  portion should be deep-processed or marketed by the localities  themselves. 4) Reduce the large and medium-sized enterprises'  share of mandatory plans, gradually decontrol product prices,  and allow the large and medium-sized enterprises to purchase raw  materials in the market--letting them "buy high and sell high."  Only by gradually reducing the state's mandatory planning can a  chain of upstream, midstream, and downstream products be  produced to achieve breakthrough in Heilongjiang's industrial  development.    3. Restructure the financial system to make a  breakthrough in credit funds: Seizing the opportunity of  the central bank's imposition of macro control and the  separation of the state's policy-oriented banks from commercial  banks at this time, we should expand the scope of local credit  funds. First, taking advantage of Heilongjiang's fine industrial  structure, we should strive to win credit support from the  state's policy-oriented banks. Second, we can use selective  products that are profitable and competitive to win commercial  bank loans and help develop industries. Third, while meeting the  conditions of the state's financial policy, we should actively  develop local banks and raise capital on our own. Fourth, we  should take advantage of our border trade and set up bank organs  aboard to gather international funds.    4. Restructure the investment system and make a  breakthrough in readjusting the industrial structure: To  restructure the investment system, we must begin with the  province's economic development and the layout of the productive  forces, formulate central and local investment plans, and  coordinate the development. One, while the state's investment  focus is on coal, timber, and petroleum, it should invest in  transportation and power supply and other basic industries, and  it should also invest in light industrial products that meet the  state's industrial policy requirements and are profitable. While  the provincial government and governments at all levels invest  in the development of light industry that makes use of  agricultural products as raw materials, they should gradually  shift more emphasis on light industry that utilizes  non-agricultural raw materials. We must improve Heilongjiang's  lopsided industrial structure and its outdated basic industry.  Second, given that the central and local authorities share the  same development goals, they should work in concert and  cooperate with each other. For example, the province can work  with Daqing to produce 800,000 tons of ethylene, which not only  will facilitate the development of state-affiliated enterprises  but also the creation of local-led industries. The two should  make a joint investment to accelerate the realization of this  project.    5. Reform the management system and make a breakthrough  in giving play to the province's overall industrial productive  capacity and efficiency: First, the central government  should continue to decontrol enterprises, and except for the  state-monopolized trades, it should hand down most enterprises  to the localities and promote the cooperation between the  state's large and medium-sized enterprises and local  medium-sized and small enterprises, so that they no longer  pursue separate development. Second, enterprises that cannot be  handed down to the lower levels should work closely with local  industrial enterprises. By forging lateral economic ties and  through the proper circulation of factors of production, we can  help forge the internal organic link between central enterprises  and local industrial enterprises and create proper division of  labor and improve the province's overall industrial productive  capacity and efficiency.    6. Promote reform that focuses on "enterprises'  property rights system" and make a breakthrough in the operating  mechanisms: Deep-seated conflicts in the industrial economy  are reflected in enterprises, and the solution lies in the  reform of the property rights system to resolve the issues of  enterprises' ability to pursue their own development, their  ability to take responsibility for their profits and losses, and  their self-discipline, and in addition, we must change the  operating mechanisms and push enterprises toward the market. 1)  We should continue to expand the enterprise shareholding system.  First, we should set up and develop a "workers' cooperative  fund" to gather the enterprise workers' scattered funds and turn  them into legal person shares, so that the workers can take part  in the shareholding companies and help forge lateral ties.  Second, shareholding companies that have already been approved  should set up windows and counters to accelerate the transfer of  enterprises' internal workers' shares to enliven the 1.2 billion  yuan's worth of stocks in the hands of stock investors. Third,  we should actively develop directional capital-raising companies  to absorb corporate funds and entice enterprise workers to buy  shares. Funds should be spent on expanded reproduction. Fourth,  we should help enterprise be better prepared when listing their  stocks in the market and help more enterprises list their  securities. Fifth, we should continue to convert some industrial  enterprises to the shareholding system and accelerate  enterprises' technological transformation. Sixth, all newly  undertaking industrial projects should generally be converted to  the shareholding system. 2) We should give more weight and add  more depth to state-owned, civilian-run operations. Most  medium-sized and small state-owned enterprises should become  market-oriented through one of the following ways: Convert to  the shareholding system and sold by the share or as a whole,  broken up and managed as separate entities, leased out, operate  as "one enterprise under multiple systems," declare bankruptcy,  merge, or form alliances and so on. 3) We should put enterprises  in the property rights exchange markets and let the superior  eliminate the inferior companies. We should accelerate the  promotion of free circulation and optimal combination of key  factors of production. While continuing to set up markets for  capital goods, personnel, labor and services, technologies, and  information, we should accelerate the improvement of the  province-wide market for exchange of property rights and  management rights. Enterprises that are chronically losing money  should be publicly auctioned off, merged, leased out, or  contracted out. Through enterprise reform that focuses on  property rights, we can push enterprises toward the market,  radically change their management mechanisms, and increase their  ability to compete.</p>

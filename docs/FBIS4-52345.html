			<p>BFN     [Text] As of 8 May, the Defense Agency [DA] has  unofficially decided to appoint Noboru Hoshuyama, director of  the DA Director General's Secretariat, to replace Ichiro  Yoneyama, director general of the Defense Facilities  Administration Agency [DFAA], who will shortly be retiring  voluntarily. Masahiro Akiyama, chief of the DA's Bureau of  Finance, is expected to fill Hoshuyama's post. The director  general of the DFAA is the second-highest bureaucratic post in  the DA. As a result of this personnel reshuffling, Naoaki  Murata, chief of the DA's Bureau of Defense Policy, is expected  to be promoted to administrative vice minister of the DA since  incumbent DA Administrative Vice Minister Shigeru Hatakeyama is  expected to leave this post next year.    Hoshuyama graduated from Waseda University in 1963, majoring  in politics and economics. He then entered the DA. After  serving as DA counselor and chief of the DA Bureau of Finance,  he assumed the post of director of the DA Director General's  Secretariat in July 1993. Fifty-seven-year-old Hoshuyama hails  from Oita Prefecture.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Srinagar, May 22 -- Deeply concerned about the  sagging morale of most of the militant groups operating in Jammu  and Kashmir [J-K], because of their failure to hit at the  assigned targets and to unleash violence, Pakistan's Inter  Services Intelligence [ISI] has reportedly despatched a fresh  group of 400 armed mercenaries into the Valley during the past  few weeks.    They have come with very clear directions to take leadership  of the militant outfits and to plan large scale subversive  operations. The latest infiltration, it is learnt, has taken  place through Kupwara and Uri sectors.    According to sources, the increasing disillusionment of the  people with the militants has upset the senior command officers  of the ISI. There have been instances during the recent months  when the people have openly defied militants' orders and refused  to support their cause. Today's Id celebration was yet another  pointer to the fact that the people no longer approved the cult  of violence being indulged in by Pakistan-supported militant  groups.    It is learnt that the new group of mercenaries, including  Pakistan trained Afghan guerillas, militant from POK  [Pakistan-occupied Kashmir], Sudan and other West Asian  Countries, have entered India through unmanned routes along the  LoC [Line of Control]. They have also smuggled in sophisticated  arms including, AK56 and AK-76 assault rifles, rockets and  rocket launchers.    It is learnt that ISI, which has been openly aiding and  abetting militancy in J-K, has conveyed its disgust and  annoyance to some of the leading militant groups here for their  failure to organise subversive operations and to hit at soft  targets. Instead of accomplishing the task given by ISI, the  militant groups have of late been killing their own people as  most of the outfits lacked motivation and fought among  themselves.    It is for this reason that Pakistan has decided to enlist  the  support of trained Afghan Mojahedin to infiltrate into the  Valley and to take over the operational command of the militant  groups. According to sources, the reason ISI decided to send  Afghan Mojahedin was that they are trained in handling highly  sophisticated weapons, and secondly, were motivated to  accomplish the assigned field responsibilities.    Sources indicate that in view of ISI's increasing  desperation, the security agencies had anticipated that as soon  as the ISl's field intelligence units succeeded in identifying a  safe unmanned route along the international border, they would  make a determined bid to `push in' about 2000 to 2500 trained  Mojahedin.    Other apprehension is that the militants, who had set up  their bases in the Peerpanjal range would advance with the  clearing of snow. This shift in the bases would pose a serious  threat to the national highway and the troops and vehicular  movement on it.    This happened last year also when the militants attacked the  army convoys and the security forces from the hilltops and  inflicted casualties. Though the security forces effectively  replied to these attacks yet the militants' vantage position  aided them in attacking and then fleeing back to their hideouts  in the range.    The militants are planning to fortify the existing bases and  to create new ones on the frontline of the Peerpanjal range. The  target is the national highway for it serves as a vital link  between the Valley and the rest of the country. It is important  for the security forces also as most of their supplies arrive  via this route. The movement of the troops also depends on this  road which is surrounded by high mountains on both sides.    That the militants are increasingly targeting the highway  was  evident from the fact when they even attacked the Border Roads  Organisation men.</p>

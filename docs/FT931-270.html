			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / China wants 'rigged' poll says Patten MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, yesterday suggested that China wanted 'rigged' elections in the colony in 1995. On the eve of a visit to the UK, where Britain's policy towards Hong Kong and China is expected to come under scrutiny, Mr Patten told Singapore radio: 'I do not want rigged arrangements for the 1995 elections.' Mr Patten and his advisers believe that China's aim in negotiations with Britain about the elections - if the negotiations take place - would be to achieve an agreement which would deny a place to Hong Kong's pro-democracy politicians. Failing that, advisers say, China's strategy in talks will be designed to frustrate for as long as possible the introduction of the governor's democracy legislation into the Legislative Council, LegCo. Since last October, Mr Patten has made a point of saying that the colony's elections had to be fair, open and acceptable to Hong Kong. He has sought to broaden the franchise beyond the small group of professionals that may have been acceptable to China. Beijing has has waged an unremitting campaign against him since. 'China wants us to do their dirty work for them,' said one official yesterday. 'Well it is just not going to happen.' Mr Patten leaves Hong Kong today for Brussels where he is expected to press the European Commission on trade issues, including the commission's anti-dumping policies. But the main business to be transacted will be in London, when Mr Patten has talks with Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary about Britain's Hong Kong policy. In his interview with the radio station the governor said that 'big political jobs' always threw up long agendas and difficult choices. But 'you have to do what you think is right and you have to do what you believe is in the interest of the people for whom you're responsible,' he said. Yesterday Mr Patten's executive council, or quasi-cabinet, deferred until after Easter a decision on the introduction of his legislation into LegCo. This was to allow time for China to reconsider its position on talks with Britain about Hong Kong's political development. In the absence of an agreement on negotiations the Hong Kong government is expected to table the legislation on April 21. China has threatened trade retaliation against Britain and to bring forward administrative preparations for the takeover of Hong Kong if Mr Patten proceeds.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Scottish Power shows 16% advance to Pounds 95m THE CHIEF executive of Scottish Power foresaw real increases in dividends of 5 per cent a year for the next two years as his company reported a 16 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits. Mr Ian Preston's comments and the profits rise of Pounds 95m for the six months to September 30 helped the shares to rise 2p to 221p. Some analysts revised their forecasts for the full year upwards, with average expectations at around Pounds 300m. Profits before tax in the half year were achieved after a net provision of Pounds 13.3m taking in a debit of Pounds 23m for reorganisation and restructuring and a Pounds 9.7m credit for a re-assessment of energy losses. The re-organisation costs include severance and early retirement payments to cut the workforce further. It has fallen from 9,500 at privatisation to about 8,300 and Mr Preston said there were opportunities for further reductions. Operating profit per employee in the half year was 28.5 per cent up on the 1991 first half. For the six months earnings per share after the exceptionals were 8.47p, an increase of 6.7 per cent. The interim dividend is 3.72p, a 10.1 per cent increase. Turnover was up 6 per cent at Pounds 634.8m with total unit sales 2.3 per cent ahead. However the company said that weather apart, unit sales were flat and full year growth was likely to be 0.5 to 1 per cent. The recession was starting to have an effect, said Mr Preston. Sales of electricity to England and Wales was Pounds 36.5m in the first half, an increase of 6.7 per cent, the company said. The company will boost its capacity to distribute electricity to England and Wales by over 70 per cent as the interconnector is upgraded to handle 610 megawatts by the end of 1993 instead of the present 350. Capital expenditure this year is expected to be about Pounds 130m, up on the normal Pounds 100m to Pounds 110m, largely because of the cost of improving the interconnecter. Gearing was about 1 per cent at the end of the half. This will rise by the end of the year but the company said it would be less than the 18 per cent at the end of last year. Mr Preston said the retail operation made an operating profit of Pounds 2m in the half year, about the same as for the whole of last year. In electrical contracting the company was benefiting from a renegotiation of terms and conditions Basic salaries in the division had fallen 10 to 20 per cent, although performance related pay arrangements meant that in some cases earnings were higher. The company has invested Pounds 10m in a fibre optic system, although it said it was not in the business of setting up a rival telephone user to BT. It wanted a niche market aiming for bulk transfer of data to companies including financial services institutions. The company said average rebates for small customers, arising from inflation being lower than expected in the year to October, will range from Pounds 5 to Pounds 15. This will amount to about Pounds 20m.</p>

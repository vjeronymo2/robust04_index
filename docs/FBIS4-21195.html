			<p>`Adviser'   <F P=102>   PA1504230994 San Salvador DIARIO LATINO in Spanish 14 Apr 94  p 24 </F>  <F P=103> PA1504230994 </F> <F P=104>  San Salvador DIARIO LATINO </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] First Criminal Judge Luis Antonio Villeda today  instructed Forensic Institute Director Dr. Juan Mateu Llort to  refrain from making any statements on the death of U.S. adviser  Julio Ramon Rivera, particularly regarding the toxicological  test which showed the U.S. officer was on drugs.    With several journalists present, Llort said that, due to  Villeda's orders, he could not make any remarks but that he  ``trusted God and the judge'' everything would come out right  for the sake of the Forensic Institute's prestige.    The judge made this request ``so as not to hamper the  investigations'' into the death of the officer, who was killed  by the explosion of a hand grenade, the safety pin of which he  pulled saying it was a toy grenade. The incident took place at  the police station in Zacamil. Forensic Institute adviser  Martin Santos has said: ``We abide by and obey our laws. We at  the Forensic Institute will never be belittled by anyone. Our  analyses are scientific and not biased in favor of anyone. For  this reason, it will be the criminal judge who will decide who  is telling the truth.'' Santos stressed the fact the order to  keep silent originated with the judge, who surely knows why  ``the investigations should not be hampered.''    U.S. Ambassador Alan Flanigan has told the Salvadoran news  media the institute's tests were false and that Jose Maria  Monterrey, National Civilian Police director, would report on  the case today or tomorrow.    When the ambassador's position was announced, the press  sought out Dr. Llort, but he replied he must refrain from  reporting on the situation on the judge's instructions. It has  been reported the judge will study the institute's tests and  those carried out by the U.S. Government before making a  statement. Llort finally said: The prestige and reliability of  the institute's work has been released to the local news media.  I trust God and the judge all will come out right.    The reporters appeared to have been taken by surprise this  morning by the turn of events regarding Rivera's death, because  Ambassador Flanigan himself has announced Police Director  Monterrey would make a statement with additional details.</p>

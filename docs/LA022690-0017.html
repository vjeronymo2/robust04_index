			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FLAMES SCORCH EDMONTON, 10-4  </P> <P> There have been numerous times this season when the Calgary Flames have not  looked the part of Stanley Cup champions.  </P> <P> They hit a low point early this month when the Kings, who have been bounced  around recently by weaker teams, won back-to-back games against them.  </P> <P> But the Flames are looking sharp again and were at their best Sunday night  against the Edmonton Oilers at Calgary. The Flames scored three quick goals and  vaulted into first place in the Smythe Division by overwhelming the Oilers,  10-4.  </P> <P> Joe Nieuwendyk, the Flames' leading scorer, had two goals to lead the assault.  The Flames, who built a 6-1 lead in the first two periods, fired 45 shots. They  moved in front, 10-2, before the Oilers scored the last two goals of the game.  </P> <P> Pokey Reddick, who has played so well in the absence of the Oilers' two top  goalies, Grant Fuhr and Bill Ranford, was the victim.  </P> <P> The Flames, who have played one less game than the Oilers, lead the Oilers by  one point.  </P> <P> Last Thursday the Flames put on another powerful offensive display, smashing  Toronto, 12-2.  </P> <P> New York Islanders 3, New Jersey 3 -- How much do the Islanders miss their  injured offensive star Pat LaFontaine?  </P> <P> Gary Nylund, a 6-4 defenseman, is now the star of the offense.  </P> <P> Before LaFontaine, who scored 48 goals in 62 games, chipped a bone in his left  hand Thursday night, Nylund had not scored a goal this season.  </P> <P> He has three in the two games LaFontaine has missed. LaFontaine is expected to  be out at least another week.  </P> <P> Saturday night Nylund, who scored 25 goals in his first 500 NHL games, ended  the Islanders' six-game winless string by scoring the tying goal, late in the  game against Detroit.  </P> <P> In this game at Uniondale, N.Y., Nylund scored the first goal, with eight  seconds left in the first period. He also scored the last one with 50 seconds  left in regulation to give the Islanders their second tie in a row.  </P> <P> The back-to-back ties have put the Islanders only one point behind the New York  Rangers.  </P> <P> Buffalo 3, Winnipeg 1 -- Clint Malarchuk stopped 37 shots at Buffalo and the  Sabres held onto second place in the Adams Division.  </P> <P> Malarchuk was at his best in the last two periods, stopping all 28 shots the  Jets tried.  </P> <P> Rick Vaive scored what proved to be the winning goal in the second period.  </P> <P> Montreal 6, St. Louis 5 -- Russ Courtnall scored at 3:05 of overtime at  Montreal to lead the Canadiens to the victory.  </P> <P> The Canadiens built a 5-2 lead, but Brett Hull rallied the Blues late in the  second period with his 60th goal.  </P> <P> After Gino Cavallini cut the Montreal lead to a goal early in the last period,  Hull, with less than five minutes left in regulation, scored his 61st to tie  the game.  </P> <P> Washington 9, Detroit 4 -- This spirited offensive display by the Capitals at  Landover, Md. really tightened the Patrick race.  </P> <P> Dale Hunter, Mike Ridley and Dino Ciccarelli each scored twice and the Capitals  moved into a tie with Philadelphia for fifth place. With 58 points, they are  only seven points behind the division-leading Rangers.  </P> <P> The Capitals had blown third period leads in three of their previous six games,  but didn't falter when the Red Wings' Gerard Gallant cut the lead to two early  in the last period.  </P> <P> Shortly after scoring his 51st goal in the second period, Steve Yzerman was hit  in the foot with a puck and had to leave. Earlier Steve Chiasson also was hit  in the foot and departed.  </P> <P> Chicago 4, Philadelphia 1 -- Dirk Graham scored twice and the Blackhawks took  apart the NHL's best penalty-killing unit in this game at Chicago.  </P> <P> The Flyers entered the game having killed off 83.9% of the oppositions power  plays.  </P> <P> But they lost this one when Steve Thomas and Graham scored in the second period  when the Hawks had a man advantage.  </P> <P> It was the first loss this season for goaltender Ron Hextall in just his fifth  game.

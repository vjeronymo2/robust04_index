			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E VOWS SUIT TO STOP TAKEOVER STUDY;  </P> <P> DISPUTES AUTHORITY OF WATER BOARD, WHICH COUNTERS BY NEARLY DOUBLING ITS BUDGET  </P> <P> San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. plans to file suit today to prevent the County  Water Authority from financing a feasibility study of a public takeover of the  utility, an attorney for SDG&amp;E said Thursday.  </P> <P> Attorney Steven S. Wall told the Water Authority's board of directors at its  Thursday meeting that it has no authority to finance the study.  </P> <P> "Don't spend the taxpayers' money on doing something that you don't have the  power to do," Wall said.  </P> <P> The board's response was to approve a budget of nearly $1 million -- almost  double the amount recommended by its general manager -- to investigate the  takeover possibility as an alternative to SDG&amp;E's planned merger with  Southern California Edison.  </P> <P> Wall, of the law firm Luce, Forward, Hamilton &amp; Scripps, vowed to go to  court immediately on behalf of SDG&amp;E to obtain a temporary restraining  order against the Water Authority.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $250,000 Offered by City  </P> <P> San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor has led the city in its drive to block the  merger of SDG&amp;E and Rosemead-based SCEcorp, Edison's parent company, since  the agreement was announced in July. After the city attorney's office suggested  that a governmental agency might take over the utility, the Water Authority was  eventually tapped as the most likely candidate.  </P> <P> In December, the City Council voted to lend the Water Authority $250,000 to  study the feasibility of a takeover, but Water Authority attorney Paul  Angstrand ruled last month that the agency could finance the study on its own.  </P> <P> In the agenda packet circulated to the board members, Lester Snow, the Water  Authority's general manager, originally recommended raising the Phase I budget  from $250,000 to $500,000 and urged the board to approve the increased amount  immediately so the proposed three-phase study could be completed before the  merger.  </P> <P> But, when Wall told the Executive Committee before the board meeting that  SDG&amp;E would sue to stop the expenditure, committee member Herb Stickney  immediately moved to raise the amount to $940,000 in order to defend against  SDG&amp;E's threats of litigation.  </P> <P> The 35-member board, with three members abstaining, voted to adopt the budget  increase. The single "no" vote was cast by Gordon Luce.  </P> <P> Before voting, Luce, chairman of Great American First Savings Bank, said he is  concerned about the mounting public debt in the county and said he feels that  Water Authority staff members' attention was already being diverted in too many  directions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Newly Formed Committee  </P> <P> Luce also is chairman of a newly formed committee on the merger that is made up  of civic and business leaders. The committee, formed as the result of a meeting  among O'Connor and officials of the Chamber of Commerce and the Economic  Development Commission, has taken a stance against the merger, but has not come  forward in support of municipalization of SDG&amp;E.  </P> <P> Outside the meeting, Snow defended the proposed expense and said that raising  the budget to $940,000 will not have an "immediate impact" on water rates  because the agency has reserves of about $10 million.  </P> <P> "On every occasion, they (SDG&amp;E) claim to be expressing concern about us  using taxpayers' money," Snow said. "If  </P> <P> we had their full cooperation, we could probably do this for somewhere around  $200,000."  </P> <P> Snow said the Water Authority has been forced to continually escalate its  budget for the takeover study "by the posturing and attitude" of SDG&amp;E. The  actual feasibility study would take only a fraction of the $940,000 budget, he  said, but the rest of the money will be necessary to hire lobbyists in  Sacramento to combat lobbyists from SDG&amp;E and SCE, to mount a  public-relations campaign in San Diego and to cover the cost of the litigation.  </P> <P> In December, the board of directors voted to get the ball rolling on the study,  as well as to seek an amendment to the County Water Authority Act that would  explicitly allow the agency to acquire and operate a gas and electricity  system.  </P> <P> But, according to Wall, the Water Authority cannot use money on the study  unless it has been given power to undertake such an acquisition.  </P> <P> "Until the California Legislature has made a determination and the people have  spoken, it is our position, with regret, that you are acting far beyond your  power," he told the board members.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Temporary Restraining Order  </P> <P> Wall said he will go to court this afternoon to seek a temporary restraining  order against the Water Authority.  </P> <P> Before the vote was taken, SDG&amp;E spokeswoman Karen Hutchensc attempted to  explain the utility's position to the water board members.  </P> <P> "We feel a multibillion-dollar organization is more appropriately run by  private enterprise," she said.  </P> <P> Hutchens said the board was reacting in a "knee-jerk" fashion against the  merger and urged it to "slow down" and wait for all the facts surrounding the  proposed merger to be made public before spending money to fight it.  </P> <P> "How do you get all the facts on the table without investigating the  alternative to the merger?" board member Mike Madigan asked.  </P> <P> "We know that the facts on the table right now (show) there is no way a  governmental agency could take over . . . and not increase rates," Hutchens  said.  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E Director of Finance Malyn Malquist told board members that a public  takeover would mean a drastic increase in utility rates. Malquist cited a study  done for SDG&amp;E by the Seattle-based consulting firm of CH2M Hill, which  concluded that such a move would mean a rate increase of as much as 23%.  </P> <P> The study also found that a debt of $1.3 billion owed by SDG&amp;E to its  bondholders would not be assumable by a public agency.  </P> <P> "The only way the utility's present debt could be assumed is if every  bondholder voted to permit a transfer to the local government agency," Hutchens  said. "And a unanimous vote would be virtually impossible."  </P> <P> According to the study, a government takeover would also result in a federal  and state income tax liability of $1 billion, which would not be the case with  a merger. The total cost of a takeover would be $6.5 billion, the study found.  </P> <P> Several board members cited previous pledges by SDG&amp;E to cooperate fully  with the Water Authority, and asked why the company was not willing to let them  proceed with the study.  </P> <P> Hutchens responded, "We would be more than willing to sit down with the general  manager to go over the numbers we have presented today for your scrutiny."  </P> <P> Board member Christine Frahm countered, "You can't expect us to accept somebody  else's version of the facts, yet you won't let us do the minimum amount of work  to get the facts."  </P> <P> When asked if SDG&amp;E would consider helping the Water Authority conduct  another study to verify the conclusions of CH2M Hill, Hutchens replied, "We  feel it would be a waste of taxpayer money."  </P> <P> After the meeting, Water Authority spokesman Jim Melton said the agency has no  response yet to the takeover cost figures presented to the board by SDG&amp;E.  "We don't know if the figures are high or low," he said. "They may be  accurate."  </P> <P> Ben Clay, legislative representative for the Water Authority, said: "Our budget  was expanded because of saber rattling by SDG&amp;E about going into court. If  these folks hadn't threatened to go to court and not opposed this in  Sacramento, there wouldn't be half the money spent.  </P> <P> "They're just scared to death that, if we shed a little light on these numbers,  there might be a good basis for" a public takeover of SDG&amp;E.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Greg Johnson contributed to this story.  </P></p>

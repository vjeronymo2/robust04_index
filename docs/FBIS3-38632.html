			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stavros Angelidhis] </F>   [Excerpt] Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special  coordinator on the Cyprus issue, assured President Glavkos  Kliridhis yesterday that the Turkish side is prepared to hand  over to the United Nations all of the fenced-off town of  Varosha. A very well-informed source told O FILELEVTHEROS last  night: "There is now light at the end of the tunnel," adding  that the beginning of proximity talks in Nicosia should be  considered certain. But the source explained that the talks  will most probably open the week after next, since Rauf Denktas  will visit Ankara at the end of next week for talks with the  Turkish Government.    Lamb refrained from making any statement. He simply  described the meeting as very good. He justified his refusal  [to make a statement] by saying he would give a news conference  at the Ledra Palace Hotel today for Greek Cypriot, Turkish  Cypriot, and foreign correspondents.    According to O FILELEVTHEROS' always-reliable information,  Kliridhis made it clear that he would not attend the talks  unless it was insured that all of the fenced-off town would be  handed over so that 15,000 refugees could return. While he  agreed that the return to the area north of Dhimokratia Avenue  take place as a second stage, Kliridhis insisted on setting out  a clear schedule for this area, saying that the issue should not  remain open for an unspecified period in which it might be  possible to cancel the residents' return.    Concerning Turkish "fears" about security for the Famagusta  port, President Kliridhis said he was ready to accept any UN  measures that would neutralize these fears. At the same time,  Kliridhis asked for safeguards that the area would soon be given  to the United Nations (in about two months) and that effective  measures would be taken against the infiltration of Turkish  Cypriots or Turks and against thefts and other crimes, thus  consolidating feelings of safety among those who will start  working or settling in the area. The broader issue of safe  accession to the area now surrounded by the occupation troops  was also raised.    It appears that Lamb gave initial assurances although the  final arrangements will be made during the talks. [passage  omitted]</p>

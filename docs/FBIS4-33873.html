			<p>BFN     [Text] Valparaiso -- Commenting on his meeting with  President Bill Clinton, which is scheduled for 28 June in  Washington, President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle said it will be  "very positive for Chile because it will be a working meeting."    President Frei thus responded to a journalist's question at  the Valparaiso City Hall where he attended a meeting of regional  officials and Regional Council members. He said: "President  Clinton, his advisers, and I will meet for about one hour to  discuss several issues. We will have lunch and participate in  other activities."    Frei said: "This is a short trip during which we will hold a  working meeting. I believe it is very positive for Chile  because we will be able to discuss all issues pertaining to  bilateral ties."    Frei noted that last March, when Foreign Minister Carlos  Figueroa met with the U.S. assistant secretary [not further  identified], "we explained our position regarding bilateral ties  with the United States. We have a vast agenda on all issues of  interest to our two countries. This meeting will help to expand  on these issues."    Frei added: "For us and for Chile (this meeting) is an event  of great satisfaction because we will be able to visualize our  national agenda for the next few years and the summit summoned  by President Clinton. We will be able to express our opinion,  which to some extent means explaining our personal view of Chile  and Latin America to the most powerful country on Earth. The  fact that Chile and its president have been invited is  extraordinarily positive. It speaks highly of Chile, of the  political process, of the development our country has achieved  at all levels -- at the economic, social and political level.  We are very happy with this trip."    Asked if the agenda includes Chile's joining NAFTA, Frei  said: "NAFTA is one of the subjects we will discuss. It is on  the agenda."</p>

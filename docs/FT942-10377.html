			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Water company settles claims South West Water yesterday agreed to pay about Pounds 400,000 to settle almost 150 claims from people who alleged they suffered long-term health effects after drinking contaminated water six years ago. They will receive amounts ranging from Pounds 680 to more than Pounds 10,000. The settlement was announced in the High Court in Truro, Cornwall. The claims came after 20 tonnes of aluminium sulphate were poured into the wrong tank at the Lowermoor treatment works near Camelford, Cornwall.</p>

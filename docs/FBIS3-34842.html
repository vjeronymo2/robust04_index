According  to official sources at Balasore, the decision to this effect was  taken at a high-level meeting of defense authorities and the  district administration yesterday.    It may be recalled that the third launch of the missile  slated for seventh of last month was postponed at the last  minute following the detection of a technical snag in one of the  onboard systems.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Account by Dmitriy Orlov of interview with Russian Deputy </F> Premier Sergey Shakhray: "Forecast: The State's Future Should  Not Be Decided Within the Garden Ring, Russian Government Deputy  Chairman Sergey Shakhray Believes"]    [Text] When speaking about Russia's future it is necessary  to bear in mind that events may develop in various ways. It is  feasible that the country may either enter a state of chaos and  disintegration, become a police state, or emerge as a real  federation with developed local self-government.    I am convinced that federalism today is the only means of  preserving a stable political regime and state unity. That is  why it is so important to formulate a state regional policy.  Its main objectives should be to even out the position of  citizens in all regions, guarantee human rights and citizens'  rights, and protect the territorial integrity and unity of the  economic area.    The main conflict within the Russian Federation's state  system resides in the existence of ethnic and territorial models  for the organization of authority in the regions. There is real  asymmetry within the federation, and equalizing the status of  oblasts and kray to the level of republics within the Russian  Federation means considerably relieving this asymmetry. But the  conflict between the ethnic and territorial models will take its  toll on the Russian state system for a long time to come.    Contrary to the assessments being heard today, Russia is a  federation based not on a treaty but a constitution. At the  same time Articles 11 and 78 of the Russian Federation  Constitution enable the diversity of the state's regions to be  preserved while the Federation Treaty is an instrument of the  law in force. However, the treaty-based form of delimiting  authority between organs of federal power and Federation  components may be used with regard to republics that have not  signed the Federation Treaty. The constitutional norms  regulating the demarcation of powers are primarily imperfect in  that the legislature and judiciary are excluded from this  process. This has led to the government and other executive  organs virtually having a monopoly on deciding the substance of  national policy.    There is another problem in relations between the center and  the regions: Federation components received the right to  legislate and are making vigorous use thereof. At the moment  one is not conscious of pressure from local legislation, but  there is a threat of unified legal standards becoming weakened.  It is absolutely essential that the federal parliament retains  its unsurpassable initiative in respect of the fundamentals of  legislation. "Model" legislation is needed -- standard acts  which are generally borrowed by republic parliaments and kray  and oblast legislative assemblies. What is more, the Law on the  Constitutional Court must finally undergo a second reading  because the federal executive and legislature do not have the  authority to abrogate acts adopted by Federation components. It  is the Constitutional Court that can determine the framework of  the treaty process governing the mutual delegation of powers and  demarcation of objects of jurisdiction between the center and  the regions. Many people say that any kind of treaty process  brings down the Federation. However we would remind you that  three years ago Russia and Tatarstan flexed their muscles at one  another. They had enough courage to resolve the conflict by  first economic agreements and then a bilateral treaty. In my  view the same mechanism is quite applicable in relations between  Kiev and Simferopol and in conditions in the Dniester Region and  Karabakh.    In our view, interregional economic associations represent a  system compelling state centers in the CIS countries to embark  on integration by means of reciprocal treaties. On that basis a  confederative core of three or four states can and must be  created within the CIS. Otherwise the processes of integration  could be uncontrolled.    Nor must one forget that, given the separatism in a number  of  regions, market relations do not eliminate but intensify the  regional imbalances. In this connection prices of power and  railroad transport tariffs must be subject to mandatory  regulation. One must also bear in mind the fact that certain  regions are wholly "tied" to the fuel and energy complex, the  military-industrial complex (Udmurtia), or the agro-industrial  complex (Altay) and regional state administrative and economic  structures are being consolidated, yet the configuration of the  Moscow political elite virtually does not reflect these  processes.    The state's future should not be decided within the Garden  Ring, otherwise the "rules of play" will not be accepted by all  the participants.</p>

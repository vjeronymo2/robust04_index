			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Onslaught by Zagreb undermines its support in Bonn GERMANY, which spearheaded and precipitated the European Community's recognition of Croatia in 1991, has sharply criticised Zagreb's incursion into Krajina in the south of the republic at the weekend. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, told Mr Zdenko Skrabalo, his Croatian counterpart, that he understood Croatia's frustration at not being able to gain full control over its territory, but he condemned the use of force, saying it would weaken support by Germany and the international community for the Zagreb government. 'Croatia's actions at the weekend also play into the hands of Slobodan Milosevic (the president of Serbia),' said a foreign ministry official. 'Milosevic will point out how he, unlike Croatia, is the man of peace,' he added. Germany is the largest provider of aid to Croatia, and is likely to argue strongly against any attempt to impose any economic sanctions against the country. The Foreign Ministry yesterday defended the decision by Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister, to speed up the recognition of Croatia in December 1991, despite opposition from France and Britain. 'It was morally right and just in the face of aggression by the Yugoslav army, and Serbia,' an official said. Bonn points out that Mr Milosevic's acceptance of the Vance plan for Croatia is far removed from the actual implementation of it. The plan, agreed by Zagreb and Belgrade in December 1991, paved the way for ending the war in Croatia by setting up four United Nations protectorate zones on about a third of Croatian territory held by Serb nationalists. It also included a process of demilitarisation by Serb forces in those zones, as well as the eventual return of Croatian and other refugees to those Croatian regions. Since October, the UN has postponed the return of the refugees on the grounds that it was unsafe. The decision by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to use military force in the protected zones reflects his frustration with delays by the UN, fears that the UN was cementing Serbian gains in the republic, and his determination to regain control, by force if necessary, of all Croatian territory. 'Since the Serbs were not willing to demilitarise the 'pink zones' so as to allow Croatian refugees to return, should we not learn some lessons from that?' an official said. Officials in Bonn said that they repeatedly pleaded with Mr Tudjman for patience and adherence to the Vance/UN plan, whose mandate expires in May.</p>

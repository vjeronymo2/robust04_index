			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: A bite from the watchdog - John Authers thinks consumers should give Lautro a pat THE WATCHDOG finally bit into pension transfers this week. Lautro, the life assurance regulator, produced new rules which said members of occupational pension schemes should under almost no circumstances be encouraged by sales agents to switch to personal pensions. This will make no change to the practices of reputable companies. But the Weekend FT has details of several worrying cases where pension scheme members appear to have been enticed out of their schemes by commission-hungry salesmen. For example, retired miners have been lured out of index-linked pensions. Lautro admits to 'concern that adequate care was not always being taken by company representatives in establishing whether or not it was bona fide in the interests of members of occupational pension schemes to transfer to personal pension plans'. It adds that the new rules have been provoked by a sharp rise in public complaints about the selling tactics used for pension transfers. However, the field is complex. There are problems with occupational schemes, which the Maxwell affair revealed, and this is now being used as a 'selling opportunity' by some salesmen. Company schemes also offer many benefits which personal pensions cannot. Lautro insists that these should be pointed out. The advantages of company pensions which should be pointed out to you, according to Lautro, include: The guarantees which are often offered; Pensions for spouses and children; Options for early retirement, or retirement on grounds of ill health; Indexation, which is often offered in some form by company schemes; Ancillary benefits, such as life cover, and; Leaving service benefits. Frequently, company pensions do not offer anything like as big a pension as employees assume but this battery of factors can only make personal pensions seem less attractive. Lautro's document goes on to suggest extra additional factors, such as the financial security of the occupational scheme (a very difficult area for laymen to assess where improved disclosure rules will be vital), and 'transfer club' facilities, which are often offered to allow easy transfer between company schemes. A transfer will also seem less sensible if the employer would not contribute to a personal pension, or if eligibility for permanent health insurance (used to cover sick pay) would be affected. It also requires the initial charges payable on any new personal pension plan to be considered. These rules are meant to be applied retrospectively - companies receiving complaints from those who have transferred out should consider whether the new guidelines were followed when the original sale was made. They are also supposed to review all past cases, and contact any people who appear not to have received adequate advice under the new guidelines. This offers some hope of compensation for victims of bad advice. The rules also aim to limit the amount of commission that can be charged to clients up front. Life insurance companies typically deduct up to two years premiums to pay sales costs on long-term insurance contracts. The new rules will limit commissions on personal pensions to a percentage of each year's premium - usually four to five percent. Many companies already have a flat prohibition on any of their sales agents encouraging clients to opt out of a company pension scheme altogether, which is encouraging. But it can only be good news for consumers that companies will now have no choice in the matter.</p>

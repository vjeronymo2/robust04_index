			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / TSB feels effects of flat retail banking market Growing competition in a flat retail banking and insurance market was evident yesterday as TSB Group disclosed that income from on-going business rose by only 3.5 per cent in the first half to Pounds 955m, against Pounds 921m. TSB's pre-tax profits for the six months to April 30 jumped to Pounds 226m, against Pounds 80m. But this was mainly due to a Pounds 92m fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts to Pounds 113m, and the absence of the previous period's Pounds 44m reorganisation charge. TSB reached its target of a 15 per cent post-tax return on equity. It achieved a 15.5 per cent return compared with 5.7 per cent in the first half of last year and 11.1 per cent for the full year. Pressure on income emerged despite a 9.5 per cent expansion in the mortgage book to 6.5bn, compared with overall market growth of 2.1 per cent. Loans rose to Pounds 17.4bn from Pounds 17bn, but risk-weighted assets stayed at Pounds 16.1bn. Mr Peter Ellwood, chief executive, reaffirmed the bank's interest in buying a building society. The aim would be mainly to sell a range of products to the society's members, rather than as a means of increasing mortgage lending. He said Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society had encouraged other societies because it had shown that they could preserve partial independence if they were acquired. But he said that the losses sustained by TSB after buying the merchant bank Hill Samuel in 1987 would make it cautious. 'The last time we bought something and said to them 'you keep running it', it was a bit expensive,' he said. TSB raised its interim dividend by 12.5 per cent to 3.544p, against 3.15p. Earnings per share amounted to 9.6p, up from 3.1p. It increased its tier 1 ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets to 9.1 per cent, against 8.7 per cent. Sir Nicholas Goodison, chairman, said that capital strength gave TSB the flexibility to add new products and 'take advantage of a suitable acquisition'. Mr Ellwood said growth in credit cards and personal loans, which have high margins, offset a squeeze elsewhere. The margin on its mortgage book fell to 1.6 per cent because of the growing proportion of fixed rate products. He said that TSB would launch a 24-hour telephone banking service called PhoneBank this autumn, following a successful pilot project in the north-east. It would offer all customers basic banking services by telephone. TSB had provided a 'small additional sum' against compensation payments for its 55,000 pension transfer cases. It was investigating a total of 100 cases of possible mis-selling by staff. The shares shed 9p to close at 211p. Lex, Page 20</p>

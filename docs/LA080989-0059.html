			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROBERT F. JANI, 55; NOTED PRODUCER OF SPECTACULARS  </P> <P> Robert F. Jani, who produced such spectacular celebrations as the U.S.  Bicentennial celebration in New York Harbor in 1976, a revitalizing stage show  for Radio City Music Hall, halftime entertainment at the Super Bowl and some of  the Walt Disney organization's most storied events, has died.  </P> <P> A spokesman for his firm, Robert F. Jani Productions, said he had died Sunday  night at his Palos Verdes Estates home after a three-year struggle with  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known commonly as Lou Gehrig's disease. He was  55.  </P> <P> Both on his own and with the Disney company, where he worked for 11 years, Jani  put on much of the live entertainment that has become standard fare at  Disneyland and Disney World. Among his achievements were "America on Parade,"  "The Main Street Electrical Parade" and, as a consultant, master plans for Euro  Disneyland (to open in 1992) and the new Disney/MGM Studio Tour at Walt Disney  World in Florida.  </P> <P> In 1978, he was responsible for the revival of Radio City Music Hall's  "Magnificent Christmas Spectacular." That was the year he left Disney's employ  to found his firm. From 1979 to 1982, he was in charge of all live stage  productions at the New York City hall, dubbed the "Showplace of the Nation."  </P> <P> He had taken over the hall after a 35-day restoration and was credited with its  revitalization after a long period of decline. His other productions there  included "America," "Encore" and "Manhattan Showboat."  </P> <P> Jani also staged the 1983 Super Bowl entertainment in which spectators amazed  themselves and a national television audience by spontaneously hoisting 103,000  synchronized flash cards into the air, filling the Rose Bowl with bright  rainbows. It was believed to be the biggest stunt-card spectacular of all time.  </P> <P> Jani drafted the master plan but did not provide the staging for the opening  and closing ceremonies at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. That contract  eventually went to David L. Wolper. In 1981, Jani produced "The Glory of  Christmas," with a cast of 400 and a small zoo of animals at the Crystal  Cathedral in Garden Grove.  </P> <P> Survivors include his wife, Joan; his mother, daughter and son. Contributions  are asked to the USC Neuromuscular Center at 637 S. Lucas Ave., Los Angeles  90017. A memorial service is scheduled for Monday at 4 p.m. at the Rolling  Hills Covenant Church in Rolling Hills Estates.  </P></p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Boom brings out the head-hunters Booming business in base metals has led to fierce competition for experienced traders, prompting rising salaries and bonuses, reports Reuter. Banks and trading companies, fearful of losing top people, are offering a range of incentives to existing staff, while others are seeking to lure dealers through attractive signing-on terms. An annual package of salary plus bonus totalling Pounds 130,000 to Pounds 140,000 is not uncommon, according to a trade house executive. 'The (metal trader) recruitment market is buoyant,' said a leading job consultant. All areas of metals trading are expanding as business from consumers and producers increases and investors buy in the hope that prices will continue to rise as the world steps out of recession. Banks, financial institutions and other players see metals as a growing source of business. There has been a rush of derivative product issues, such as warrants on baskets of metals, regarded as the commodities most likely to benefit from an economic revival. A further boost to business has come from rising demand from mining company's for long-term packages to hedge their price risk. As the metals business is small compared with bond and foreign exchange markets, turnover in dealers has become particularly active. 'We have been busy since the start of the year,' another recruitment consultant said. The number of floor members on the London Metal Exchange is rising. Sucden UK, a subsidiary of French broker Sucres et Denrees, becomes the 18th member later this year. At least one other company may follow suit, while the number of associate broker clearing members is also rising. US securities house Kidder, Peabody International, part of General Electric Company, was recently elected to this category.</p>

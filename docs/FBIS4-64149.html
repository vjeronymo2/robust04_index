			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Federal Law `On the Procedure </F> for the Publication and Enactment of Federal Constitutional  Laws, Federal Laws, and Acts of Chambers of the Federal  Assembly' Was Adopted 25 May by the State Duma"]    [Text] As we know, on 25 May the Duma had already adopted  this law, but it had not been approved by the Federation  Council. In this connection, a coordination commission was  created, made up of representatives of both chambers of the  Federal Assembly and the Russian Federation president. It  prepared a new single text of the law.    The adopted document envisages that the day of the adoption  of a federal law by the State Duma in its final wording is  considered to be the date of its adoption. The date of the  adoption of a federal constitutional law is the day when it is  approved by the Federal Assembly chambers according to the  procedure established by the Russian Federation Constitution.    According to the document, the first publication of a  federal  constitutional law, a federal law, or an act of a Federal  Assembly chamber in its full text in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA or  SOBRANIYE ZAKONODATELSTVA RF is considered to be the official  publication.</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family: Anger over society's Pounds 4.3m loss on property - Now investors must wait months for court rulings to decide the future of Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Assurance SEVERAL thousand savers opened their post this week to find that a fund of gilts and cash deposits in which they had invested had managed to lose Pounds 4.3m in a property deal. The savers are with the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Assurance friendly society and, understandably, they are unhappy. But what happens next depends on decisions by the high court, which could take months. L &amp; Y is closed for new business until then. How did it happen? The losses affect only the society's main Capital Secure fund, which has about 69,000 policyholders and is valued at more than Pounds 50m, having grown by only 1.6 per cent in 1991. All policies written on this fund from December 1981 to January 1987, and some of the policies between then and October 1988, specifically excluded property as an investment. This affects around 53 per cent of all L &amp; Y policies in force at the beginning of this year, or about 36,000 people. With hindsight, the story of how the fund went off the rails has an almost tragic inevitability. In 1987, with the property market booming, it seemed sensible to give Capital Secure the freedom to invest in property. But the funds which had started when property was endorsed as an investment were not kept separate. The fund then spent Pounds 6.8m on a hotel development. But this has now been valued at Pounds 2.5m - a write-down of Pounds 4.3m. Capital Secure's unit price fell around 9 per cent as a result. The present members of the board all have been appointed since June 1990, and discovered the problem only when holders of maturing policies complained early this year. After discussions with their regulator, Lautro, and the Registry of Friendly Societies, it was decided the issues involved were so complex that they would have to be settled by the high court. Those holding policies with L &amp; Y's other funds are not necessarily affected, although Capital Secure is the society's biggest fund and many people have at least half their money invested in it. The property loss is the most serious issue facing the society, but it is also seeking high court guidance on two other problems which may lead to policyholders losing tax relief. The first affects those who invested in a tax-exempt fund via a lump sum - around 9 per cent of all policyholders. Regulations state that payments to friendly society funds must be in the form of regular premiums, so most societies organise lump sums by asking policyholders to buy an annuity, which then pays the premiums. L &amp; Y did not do this, which puts in question the tax relief. Those who started a policy between October 1 1990 and December 5 1991 could be hit by the society's other problem, which is that it issued policies under a new set of rules, or 'table,' which had not been registered formally with the registry. While this looks merely a technical matter, it also requires a court ruling. The society will continue to take in premiums and pay sums on maturity as normal while it awaits the decisions. If you are an investor, there is little or no reason to surrender a policy. In most cases, this would mean you would get back, at best, only the premiums you had paid. In any case, the bad news now should be all in the price following the write-down. The society is invested heavily in cash deposits (missing out on the strong returns on gilts obtainable recently). Thus, the fund is unlikely to lose any more money. Legal costs may be a problem, but the reduced overheads of running the society when it is closed to new business could offset this. Whether L &amp; Y can rebuild its business once the court's decisions are known is another matter, and chances are it will have to merge with one of the few larger societies. John Reeve, chief executive of Family Assurance, the UK's largest friendly society, said his society would do anything it could to help if required provided it was in the interests of family members. John Ramsden, L &amp; Y's chairman, admitted that one option might be to transfer all its interests to another friendly society. He added that it was not clear if compensation should be paid as there was no legal precedent. Policyholders are furious. Colin Boylett, of Dulwich, said L &amp; Y had 'totally betrayed our trust.' He asked why it had continued to accept new business until November, and suggested policyholders should be compensated by an amount equal to the performance over the period of the average exempt fixed-interest fund. In the past three years, he added, this would be 36.7 per cent, offer-to-offer, rather than the 11.8 per cent achieved by the Capital Secure fund. No one will have incurred massive losses as the policies involved all are small; indeed, the loss for each has been estimated at around Pounds 100. But it is difficult to see where the money for compensation will come from. Jean Eaglesham, of the Consumers' Association, suggested that the friendly society movement might try to set up an ex gratia compensation system if the high court decided investors were not covered by another compensation scheme.</p>

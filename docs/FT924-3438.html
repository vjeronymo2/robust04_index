			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Observer: Book rights What's the difference between Tom Paine, the left-wing political writer, and Jeffrey Archer, the right wing Tory peer? While Lord Archer's fat tomes have been available in Swedish for years, only now is a Swedish version of Paine's revolutionary work, The Rights of Man, hitting the bookshops of one of the world's oldest democracies. Just goes to show that for all Sweden's belief in individual rights, the country doesn't like rebels. Then again it might also show that the egalitarian Swedes have always been jolly good at reading English.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Disney loses battle for US civil war park The Battle of Third Manassas has ended in defeat for the Walt Disney Company with the sudden announcement that it was abandoning plans to build a Dollars 650m (Pounds 411m) history theme park on the rolling Virginia countryside over which the US civil war raged 130 years ago. The flag of surrender to local environmental and historical opposition was run up by company officials on Wednesday night in Richmond, the state capital. Disney officials told Governor George Allen, who had pushed Dollars 163m in tax breaks for the project through his legislature earlier this year, that it had been decided not to proceed. A statement from its California headquarters said it was still intent on building its theme park, preferably elsewhere in Virginia, and announced a new management team for the project. The collapse of the plan - controversial for its location, about 35 miles from Washington and near the famous US civil war battle site - is another setback in a year that is coming to resemble Disney's own Waterloo. Beset by disappointing attendance at its US venues and the continuing financial crisis at the 49 per cent owned Disneyland outside Paris, its management has been deeply split over long term direction, including possible purchase of a leading US commercial TV network. Last month, Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, who had transformed Disney's moribund animated film division, resigned after Mr Michael Eisner, the chairman, had refused to give him a more powerful management role. Mr Eisner himself has been incapacitated this year following open heart surgery, while Mr Frank Wells, the highly regarded president, died suddenly in April. The 3,000 acre Virginia project and its related developments, which included 2,300 houses, 1,300 hotel rooms and 1.9m square feet of retail space, would have created 3,000 new jobs and an extra Dollars 12m in county tax revenues, Disney said. Governor Allen backed it for its economic benefits, and Prince William County gave its provisional zoning approval, subject to environmental clearance by the federal government. US Talk shows and political commentaries saw the Disney park in growth-versus-environment and populist-versus-elite terms. But the plan was criticised by environmentalists and the local 'horse country' set afraid that unspoiled countryside would be ruined. Historians also condemned what they feared would be the sanitisation of history, rendered all the more unacceptable by the location on top of beautifully preserved battlefields.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (7): US monopolies under attack - The bottlenecks facing legislation on deregulation The liberalisation of US telecoms is a war conducted on a number of fronts: in Congress, in the courts, in state legislatures and in regulatory agencies. The significance of the bill which collapsed last month in the US Senate lay in its attempt to draw the various strands together. Its failure means that, for the time being, the deregulation process reverts to a state of apparent chaos. However, there are certain basic principles at work. The regulatory barriers at issue are simple enough: long-distance telephone companies may not operate in local markets, and vice versa; telephone companies may not operate cable networks; and regional telephone companies may not manufacture telephone equipment. There is general agreement that the first two, at least, should be scrapped or modified. The argument is over the terms. For the government, this involves a familiar type of trade-off. The Clinton administration gives a high priority to the construction of a digital super-highway, capable of delivering voice, image and data to homes and businesses throughout the US. This can only be done with private sector money. But, as long as companies are barred by regulation from roaming the superhighway at will, they will be the less ready to invest. Before setting all companies free to compete across the network, however, the government is obliged in fairness to ensure they compete on equal terms. The snag is that while long-distance telephone companies compete with each other, as do cable companies, regional telephone companies - the so-called 'Baby Bells' - do not. They are still safe, immensely profitable monopolies; and as such they form the chief bottleneck in the deregulation process. In tackling this problem, the authorities face another familiar trade-off. As in other countries, the regional companies are obliged by statute to provide a universal service to the public. Their quid pro quo for this is the monopoly: for if competitors were given free access to the market, their natural inclination would be to poach business in lucrative urban areas and leave the original companies to lose money supplying telephone services to remote towns and villages. Various schemes have been proposed to get round this, the most popular being a 'play or pay' system whereby all competitors in a local market would contribute to a central fund from which loss-making services could be funded. In the meantime, however, the local monopolies remain hugely profitable. As a result, it looks as if the regional companies will not surrender their monopoly status until they are forced to. This point was brought home by the collapse of the telecoms bill last month. The regional companies were offered access to the long-distance market in exchange for loosening their local monopolies. According to Mr Royce Holland, president of MFS Communications and a vocal critic of the regionals, this ultimately led them to kill the bill. 'Some of them were more in favour of the bill than others,' he says. 'But it came down to an issue of whether they would try to hold on to their monopolies for another year, or try to get into long distance. It looks like in the last few weeks the monopolists won.' But the monopolies are under attack, anyway. MFS Communications is a case in point. One of a new breed of companies known as competitive access providers, MFS takes advantage of gaps in the legislation to provide high-tech telephone, video and data services to big business and government customers, in competition with the local telephone company. Set up in 1987, MFS now has a stock market value of around Dollars 2bn. For Mr Holland, the point of the telecoms bill was simply that it would have speeded up his company's development - 'our approach is basically state by state,' he says. 'Big states, like New York, Illinois and Massachusetts, are moving towards competition, anyway. But in a state like Georgia, where we have a significant position in Atlanta, it will probably be five years before we get proper competition. If we'd got a bill, it would have accelerated the move towards competition across the country.' Another threat to the local monopolies became real last month with the finalisation of the AT&amp;T-McCaw merger. The combination of America's biggest long-distance phone company and its biggest mobile phone operator means the old nation-wide phone system is recreated at the cellular level. The deal has, of course, been bitterly opposed by the regional companies, but their chances of blocking it in the courts seem slim. To add to their problems, the government has decided that the present system of cellular licences - whereby the regional companies plus one competitor apiece are allowed to run regional duopolies - is not competitive enough. Towards the end of the year a clutch of broad-spectrum licences known as personal communication services (PCS) licences will be auctioned off to the highest bidder. There is already speculation that the bidding process will force alliances throughout the industry, the result being further pressure on the regional incumbents. Not that the regional companies are incapable of looking after themselves in other respects. Most of them are conducting court cases to overturn the ban on them owning cable companies, and the industry gives them a reasonable chance of success. More speculatively, they are bringing a collective action seeking to overturn the ban on them entering the long-distance market. If this comes to anything - which seems on balance unlikely - it will take 18 months to come to fruition. By that time, the odds are that this year's failed telecoms bill will have been revived. The regional companies are under fire for having blocked it, and a number of influential senators are reportedly very cross. Informed observers who had bet against the bill going through this year are now betting on its passage next time. But, whatever form the legislation finally takes, its task will merely be to tidy things up and hurry them along. The momentum for change in the industry will carry on regardless.</p>

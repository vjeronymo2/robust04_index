			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Council watchdog urges rise in homes for rent GOVERNMENT action is needed to remedy the shortfall in affordable housing for rent, according to a report published today by the Audit Commission. The local-government watchdog warns that there will be a growing shortfall in rentable properties at reasonable cost in the next few years. Ms Sheila McKechnie, director of the housing charity Shelter, said: 'We want the government to look again at the implications of the projected Pounds 1bn reduction in local-authority housing resources.' The Audit Commission's report, she said, 'reinforces Shelter's call for extra affordable homes as the only way to stop spiralling homelessness'. The commission says councils could do more to meet the demand for social housing from their existing resources, but that would still not eliminate the shortfall. Its report estimates that an additional 74,000 homes will be needed every year for the next 10 years to meet the demand. The commission is also critical of the government's encouragement of large-scale transfers of council homes to housing associations. It notes that such transfers have resulted in increased rents and more government costs in higher housing benefit. The government has promised housing associations sufficient finance to build 57,000 homes a year by 1994-95. But with local authorities expected to build only another 5,000 homes a year, there would still be a shortfall. Sir George Young, the housing minister, said the government supported the commission's recommendations on measures local authorities could take. He added that ministers were looking at a range of initiatives to bridge the housing gap. They included the use of the planning system to increase the supply of affordable housing, and - through housing associations - reducing the risks of letting for private landlords. Sir George did not dispute the Pounds 1bn figure for the reduction in local-authority housing resources, but pointed to increases in the budget for the Housing Corporation. 'We don't expect local authorities to build new family homes for rent,' he said. The commission says that the gap could be partly closed if local authorities made better use of their existing housing stock. It suggests that: Gaps between lettings are still unnecessarily long. Achieving the commission's target of three weeks (six weeks in London) would create 26,000 extra lettings and generate additional rents. Reducing the growing number of unlicensed tenancies would provide 7,000 new homes (mostly in London). Many councils fail to use their full entitlement to nominate tenants to registered housing associations. Councils could do more to encourage people to move into more suitable council homes - perhaps by increasing rent differentials so that people in unnecessarily large homes were encouraged to move. The report estimates that the backlog of maintenance and repairs to local-authority housing stock has fallen to about Pounds 8.5bn (down from Pounds 11bn in 1985). While the number of homes in the private sector lacking basic amenities has continued to fall, the level of homes in serious disrepair or unfit is stable. Developing Local Housing. Audit Commission.

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Monopoly panel rapped as 'toothless' Competition policy has become reactive, slow and unpredictable and does little to deter companies from abusing their market position, the Consumers' Association says today. Mr Stephen Locke, the association's director of policy, says in an article published today in Consumer Policy Review that competition policy is in urgent need of review. Mr Locke says the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which should be 'a fearless guardian of the consumer interest, is gradually diminishing into a toothless watchdog'. He adds: 'From having one of the most effective and feared competition regimes in the western world, the UK has slipped into the league of also-rans, suspected by many of our international colleagues of being a soft touch when it comes to abuses of market power and anti-competitive agreements.' The association calls for rules that are more clear, faster investigations, more openness in decision-making and properly resourced watchdogs. It also calls for compensation for consumers when companies over-price goods or services or adopt restrictive practices. Customers who suffer loss should be able to get damages, as in other countries. There should be provision for class actions where consumer organisations would be able to launch proceedings against companies abusing market power on behalf of consumers generally. The association says that recent reports by the monopolies commission on new cars, perfume prices, ice cream, mortgage valuations and compact discs have proved 'disastrous' for consumers. Mr Locke says these reports have become 'progressively more corporatist in tone and supportive of the status quo'. The association says that competition law is too imprecise and therefore unpredictable. Mr John Beishon, chief executive of the Consumers' Association, has told association staff that he will consider withdrawing recognition from two unions and sacking members who strike unless a pay dispute is called off by August 1.</p>

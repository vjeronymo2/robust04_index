			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Chile grows weary of US 'stalling antics' on FTA - Leslie Crawford reports on the belief that President Bush is losing a chance to forge a new relationship A WEARY look of resignation descends upon Mr Alejandro Foxley, the Chilean finance minister, when asked about Chile's chances of clinching a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US. Mr Foxley has just returned from a gruelling week-long trip across the US, where he and President Patricio Aylwin tried to drum up support for the elimination of trade barriers between Chile and its biggest trading partner. But instead of winning a firm commitment from President Bush to launch negotiations, the Chileans were asked to wait patiently on the sidelines until a similar, and far more complex, agreement was concluded with Mexico and Canada. Only then will Mr Bush (and then only if he survives the November presidential elections) ask Congress for an extension of 'fast-track' authority in order to conduct talks with Chile. 'We understand the political constraints on Mr Bush during an election year,' Mr Foxley concedes, 'but we are also impatient to see concrete results from the US president's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative.' Mr Bush's vision of a free trade bloc spanning the Americas met an enthusiastic response in Chile when it was first mooted two years ago. When Mr Bush visited Santiago in December 1990, he flattered his hosts into believing that Chile would be the first country in South America to sign an FTA in Washington. But after 18 months of no progress, officials in Santiago have ceased to regard an FTA as their top foreign policy goal. Mr Foxley believes that Washington is losing an opportunity to forge a new relationship with Latin America based on economic partnership rather than military or political domination. He says middle-income countries like Chile are experiencing 'trade negotiation fatigue' after making huge unilateral efforts to open up their economies and liberalise trade. 'We are frankly bored with the stalling antics of the US and European Community at the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks,' he says. He believes that developing countries will become increasingly sceptical of the free-market prescriptions handed down by the industrialised world while it continues to spend Dollars 250bn on agricultural protection. This criticism was echoed at a meeting of EC and Latin American foreign ministers in Santiago last week. While European diplomats were lush with praise for Latin America's economic reforms, Mr Aylwin delivered a harsh rebuke: 'We face a great paradox. 'On one side, Latin America is opening up to international trade at a great social cost. On the other, industrialised nations, including the EC, shelter behind protectionist measures that hamper our growth and development.' Access to foreign markets has become much more important to Chile than aid, soft loans or debt relief. Its Dollars 9bn of exports last year accounted for about 30 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). Mr Foxley wants to lead Chile into a second phase of export-led development, in which manufactured goods take precedence over traditional exports such as copper, fishmeal and fresh fruit. That is why, despite all the frustrations, Chilean officials have not given up hope of clinching an agreement with the US. They see the accord spurring a new wave of investment in export industries, as an FTA would provide long-term stability in the rules of access to the US. It would also be Chile's insurance policy against arbitrary protectionist measures. Mr Foxley says an FTA would act as a magnet for foreign investment. He has been fielding inquiries lately from European companies interested in using Chile as a launch pad into the US. Nobody in Washington believes a free trade deal with Chile would threaten US jobs. Two-way trade, which totalled Dollars 3.2bn last year, is evenly balanced. The asymmetry lies in the relative importance of this trade: the US buys 18 per cent of Chile's exports, but Chile buys less than 0.5 per cent of those of the US. The obstacle Chile faces in Washington is not protectionism, but indifference. An FTA with Chile would let Washington signal to the rest of Latin America that it supports democratic regimes with open economies. Recent events in Peru and Venezuela show how tenuous is democracy in the region. Chile is not holding its breath for free trade to materialise with the US. The fastest growing market for its exports is now the Far East. Japan, for the first time last year, edged out the US as the main buyer of Chilean goods.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Consumers regain a degree of confidence MORE consumers than six months ago say they plan to spend money in the next six months on holidays, life assurance, do-it-yourself products, jewellery and home furnishings. But fewer expect to buy most types of white goods and personal pensions. A survey by Mintel International, the market research group, also finds that more consumers are fulfilling spending plans, and that many have bought more products and services since August than they planned to at the start of the period. In the same period a year earlier, many spending intentions were not matched by actual purchases. Mintel says these changes, coupled with slower growth in savings, suggest a recovery in consumer confidence may be under way which could lead to increased spending this year. It also cautions that the number of people who say they plan to make purchases has fallen since 1991, and that some recent spending increases may reflect consumers' inability to delay essential expenditures, such as repairs, any longer. The survey holds out little hope of increased activity in the housing market, finding that fewer people than six months ago plan to move home in the next three years, while the number with no plans to move has risen slightly to more than 60 per cent. Mintel forecasts that the fastest-growing areas of spending in the next five years will be educational fees, convenience food, house insurance, soft drinks, domestic and gardening help, and fruit and vegetables. It expects these areas to grow by between 25 per cent and 49 per cent by 1997. The main areas where spending is expected to fall are cigars, cigarettes and tobacco, cleaning and laundry, coal and coke, shoe, clothes and furniture repair, and meat and fish. Overall, the survey expects consumer attitudes to be 'cautious and wary' in the next few years. Patterns of Income and Expenditure. Mintel International, 18-19 Long Lane, London EC1 9HE.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Military Pilot 1st Class Colonel A. Denishchev </F> under the rubric "For High Combat Readiness": "A Restructuring  in the Combat Ranks..."]    [Text] ... was conducted by the aviators of the  detached helicopter regiment commanded by Military Pilot 1st  Class Colonel A. Denishchev, which encountered a host of  difficulties when withdrawing from the ZGV [Western Group of  Forces] and arriving in the Motherland. How they were able to  set up combat training in a new location thanks to this  "restructuring" is related by the commander.    People say that one move is worth two fires. And not for  nothing--our own experience convinced us of that. We had just  sent off the first echelons with the technical mat&eacute;riel to  Azerbaijan, to the new base location, when we were suddenly  removed from there and assigned to a different base airfield. We  rushed to re-address our "household," not very likely with such  haste. It was good that we got back at least some of the freight.    We had barely been able to recover from this scenario when  there came the next--we received, instead of our own (almost  completely new) helicopters, some that had "served out their  lifetimes" from army aviation units that were still on the  territory of Germany. It then became clear that the service  lives of many of these combat craft would be sufficient just for  the ferry flight to the Motherland. The aviation specialists  under the supervision of my deputy for IAS [aviation engineering  service], Lieutenant-Colonel V. Petkevich, had to sweat their  guts out, as they say, to prepare the equipment for rebasing in  a timely and quality manner.    But the main test awaited us on the ground, it turned out,  and not in the air. And it started with the fact that there was  not even anywhere to put the helicopters at the airfield where  the regiment went. All of the suitable sites were occupied with  aircraft from the local air club. There was nothing else to  do--we had to take axes and shovels to set up new hardstands. We  handled that task well enough.    We are still toiling with housing for the personnel. While  the bachelors could still be put into barracks somehow, setting  up the families was a very complicated matter--we couldn't even  find any suitable rooms. We had to rent living space within a  radius of 30 kilometers from the airfield. I, as commander,  could not count on the rapid assembly of the personnel.    The energetic participation of the local administration and  its head, V. Rudnitskiy, in solving our problems is easing  everyday tensions. A team of construction workers repaired the  office accommodations at the airfield under his direction, the  head of one of the city's industrial enterprises has leased us a  dormitory and the Zodchiy cooperative has built a barracks and  teaching wing. The erection of the air compound is proceeding at  a very slow rate nonetheless. Somebody, after all, is to blame  that the construction started eight months late. Exactly who?  Perhaps they know in Moscow?    But housing is housing, and the regiment must be  combat-ready. No one has taken that task from us. The fliers,  then, having completed their "earthmoving operations," have  finally sat down at their desks and set about studying a flight  region new to them without delay, and successfully passed the  corresponding performance evaluations. I would like to note the  efficiency with which the regimental senior navigator,  Lieutenant-Colonel V. Zatinshchikov, developed, coordinated and  obtained approval at the MVO [Moscow Military District] Air  Forces headquarters for flight performance instructions--a  document without which there could be no discussion whatsoever  of flight training.    It must be admitted that the rhythm of flight training was  disrupted at first owing to the constant interruptions in the  supply of fuel and spare parts. We had to plan reduced flight  shifts, but fortunately the proficiency levels of most of the  pilots did not force us to accelerate their further training.  The lag in the fulfillment of the norms for flying time at night  in bad weather conditions was of concern, it is true, since a  number of restrictions were imposed on the flights of our  aviation after the unification of Germany. The flight commanders  made up a detailed schedule for the restoration of lost skills  by types of flight training, and set an annual threshold for  each crew. This lag was able to be eliminated, to the credit of  the entire collective. The work was organized best of all in the  squadron of Lieutenant-Colonel N. Pyrin, who had many years of  service in the DVO [Far East Military District] and is a "double  Afghan." Most of his subordinates also completed the harsh  schooling of Afghanistan.    I can assert with all confidence that virtually all of the  crews are ready to perform the most complex combat missions  today. Confirmation of this are the results of performance  evaluations of combat readiness of the regiment by  representatives of the Air Forces staff of the district. The  personnel demonstrated good theoretical knowledge and high  professional proficiency during them. The group of aviators  headed by Major L. Kokoulin in particular, making use of the  results of aerial reconnaissance, determined the optimal  composition and most effective means of operation for the  helicopter fliers to execute a fire strike from the air. The  pilots in the flight of Major M. Pukhov handled the task of  identification and target designation in excellent fashion; they  clarified and transmitted in timely fashion the coordinates of  "enemy" targets to the leaders of the  groups--Lieutenant-Colonels A. Zittser and S. Kostikov. Their  subordinates operated in masterly fashion, destroying ground  targets on the first pass. The officers of the flight  supervision group, who controlled them reliably on all sorties,  also deserve no small amount of credit for the successful  fulfillment of the assignments by the crews.    The results of the performance evaluations were doubly  pleasing since we had to take part in them with a reduced  complement. About a third of the officers and warrant officers,  after all, signed requests for discharge from the armed forces  or transfer to other service locations after the return to the  Motherland. The departure of the younger ones, who were only  yesterday filled with the hope of professional growth, is  especially regrettable. The highly rated specialists and  pilots/weapons officers Senior Lieutenants D. Pyshchev and V.  Sychev have thus parted with aviation. And young officers such  as them were worth 15 people. There is no need to relate the  feelings that arose in parting with them.    Aviators who have decided to link their fate with service in  the Russian Air Forces have meanwhile been coming to our  regiment from the former republics since the collapse of the  USSR and the start of the migration of servicemen. Senior  Lieutenants S. Klichko and S. Abdurakhmanov, who came from  Uzbekistan, were comparatively recently assigned to the post of  flight technicians. A good spot is not long empty, as they say.    It is important that the newcomers be helped to gain  confidence in themselves and regain their former optimism. The  work of my deputy for personnel work, Lieutenant-Colonel V.  Malashkin, should be singled out in this regard. Our collective  is gaining army strength and cohesion again largely thanks to  him. That is pleasing. I can thus state firmly that the regiment  has successfully carried out the essential "restructuring in the  combat ranks."    COPYRIGHT: "Aviatsiya i kosmonavtika", 1993.</p>

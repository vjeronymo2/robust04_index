Peter Weiss, chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL),  the  strongest opposition party, criticised the government's foreign  policy, arguing that it was not a coincidence that German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl, British Premier John Major and other  European politicians have forgotten to include Slovakia among  the candidates for NATO membership.    He said the reason was the lack of political definition of  the government coalition Movement For a Democratic Slovakia  (HZDS) and the Slovak National Party (SNS), which have no  political partners in Europe. He said the SDL was a suitable  partner for left-oriented parties in other European countries,  adding that the victory of the left in Poland has not brought  difficulties on the international scene.    Anton Hrnko, member of the SNS breakaway National Democratic  Parliamentary Group, said foreign policy was a continuation of  internal policies. It is thus difficult to make a successful  foreign policy given the poor credibility of top-ranking Slovak  officials, including Premier Vladimir Meciar, he said.    Arpad Duka-Zolyomi, chairman of the deputies' club of  Egyutteles (Coexistence), a Hungarian minority movement in  Slovakia, speaking on behalf of Hungarian deputies, rejected the  accusation of irredentism and of the efforts to question and  complicate Slovakia's international position. He described the  phrase that the ethnic minority rights in Slovakia are in  harmony with international law as meaningless one.    Ex-Foreign Minister and Chairman of the Alliance of Slovak  Democrats (ADSR) Milan Knazko voiced disappointment that  Slovakia had not utilised the advantages stemming from the  peaceful division of the Czechoslovak Federation.</p>

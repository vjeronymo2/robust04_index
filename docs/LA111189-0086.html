David Christopher Johnson, 22, was taken into custody without incident on  his way to work at the Body Emporium and was booked into city jail, authorities  said. Undercover agents twice bought the drug from him -- once at his work --  and a search warrant was obtained for his apartment, police said. After the  arrest, authorities searching his residence said they found dozens of boxes of  steroids, a large amount of cash and equipment for injecting the drug.  </P></p>

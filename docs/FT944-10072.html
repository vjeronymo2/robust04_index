			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Forget market signals, companies must act on higher orders Sir, I have spent months trying to establish the optimum level of investment for my company, so imagine my excitement at reading that my work is over - the government has the answer. I, with every other business, should invest more ('Businesses must expect less and invest more, Heseltine tells CBI', November 8). Call me gullible, but I immediately engaged a pantechnicon to call at the department of industry. I knew a large vehicle would be needed for the department's research on my company's investment, my own investigations occupying yards of shelf. It was with disbelief that I found there was nothing to collect. Apparently politicians and civil servants are able to make judgments without research. Their grounds are that companies respond to market signals, while government direction is far above this. Curiously, when I asked how often the department was perturbed by over-investment I met with silence. Peter Krafft, Ferncroft Avenue, London NW3</p>

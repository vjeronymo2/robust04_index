			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / West faced with political minefield over Kurds THIS week's call by Mr Bernard Kouchner, France's minister of humanitarian affairs, for the United Nations to lift trade sanctions on the Kurdish-controlled areas of north Iraq raises questions about the western commitment to the Kurds. Baghdad has refused to renew the UN aid memorandum forced on President Saddam Hussein last year to allow UN agencies to operate in the country. The Iraqis have also yet to agree to implement UN Resolution 706, under which Iraqi oil receipts were to finance medical and other aid purchases under UN supervision - all of which puts the future of western relief effort for the Kurds in doubt. The situation poses practical as well as legal and financial challenges for the aid organisations and allied governments wishing to support the Kurds. The impasse is of particular concern for Turkey, key regional player in the Kurdish relief operation. The Turkish parliament last month gave approval for allied aircraft based in southern Turkey to continue to provide air cover for the Kurds for a further six months. But Ankara is worried about the evolution of a de facto Kurdish state in north Iraq. The foreign ministry argues that the recent Kurdish elections represent a dangerous step in that direction, despite Kurdish assurances. Turkey is none the less aware that without the help of western aid agencies and with President Saddam continuing to put the area under military and economic pressure, Turkey could face a repeat of last year's refugee exodus. The World Food Programme still conducts food distribution, much of which is being ferried from Turkey. The UK's Save the Children Fund is continuing a reconstruction project in an area close enough to the Iranian border to allow for a quick withdrawal if security deteriorates, but many agencies are already considering pulling out, reluctant to continue a cross-border operation from Turkey if Baghdad does not give at least tacit support. A nine-month economic blockade of the region already hampers essential services and supplies, particularly of fuel oil, which aid agencies now bring in from Turkey. Mr Kouchner proposes that the UN should conduct its own cross-border operation. However, diplomats say this would create a legal and political minefield. Such a move would amount to implicit recognition of the separate status of the Kurdish region, something France and the other Security Council members were keen to avoid when drafting the original UN resolutions to protect the Kurds.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 17 Jun (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AKHBAR  denounces Yemeni leaders for continuing to ignore the reality of  what they are doing, not only to their homeland but also to the  Arab and Islamic world. These leaders continue to tamper with  the future of coming generations, who will never forgive them  for the innocent blood they shed and the installations and  utilities they destroyed, which belong to all the Yemeni people.    In an editorial today, AL-AKHBAR states that Egypt and its  leader Husni Mubarak advised Yemeni leaders to use dialogue to  settle the Yemeni crisis and has repeatedly warned against  resorting to arms, particularly between brothers. It points out  that the fate of a homeland and people must not be decided by  officials who are controlled by arrogance and personal whims.  It says that a leader who is not concerned about the interests  of his homeland and people is unworthy of his post and he had  better look for another job in the interest of his people.</p>

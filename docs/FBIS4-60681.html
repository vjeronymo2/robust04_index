			<p>BFN     [Text] Israel has welcomed the British Government's  decision to lift the arms embargo. Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi  Beilin in an interview with our reporter Jack Katzenell  described the lifting of the embargo as a very important  decision.    [Begin recording] [Beilin] Of course, it has a symbolic  effect, but it has also a very realistic impact because it will  enable us to participate in bids of selling arms to Britain,  which will include British components, and that can happen only  when the embargo is lifted, and when the British can sell us  those components.    [Katzenell] So, do you think that this embargo, which has  lasted 12 years, has it done Israel a great deal of harm, or has  it been mainly a kind of slap in the face, something moral or  symbolic?    [Beilin] Both. This embargo was decided upon during the war  in Lebanon in 1982. It was a European decision, and only  Britain decided to continue the embargo. In our visits to  London and the meetings with British officials, we raised this  issue. I raised it with Secretary Hurd exactly two weeks ago,  and I said to him that it is really inexplicable to continue the  embargo after the agreement which has been signed between us and  the PLO, and against the background of the development towards  this in the Middle East, and I believe that those talks with the  British helped us in putting an end to this embargo.

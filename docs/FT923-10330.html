			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Arts: Strange Fish - Dance IN THE six years of its existence DV8 has produced vivid and thought-provoking work that has explored the idea of 'physical theatre'. DV8's creations have charted areas of social and sexual politics - from the bleak homosexual despair of Dead Dreams of Monochrome Men to the pursuit of dreams and desires in if only. In everything, there has been the matching of technical daring with emotional bravado: if it is not perched on the edge of the perilous, DV8 seems to say, then it is not worth doing. And if it does not challenge its theme - and its audience's preconceptions - then it is not worthy of DV8's idealism. There has resulted a body of work that stands at the forefront of British dance and, surely, of British theatre, by reason of the dazzling use of the ensemble's gifts - the pieces are usually a collective creation - and by the zeal of Lloyd Newson, DV8's director, to push further and further into that most dangerous territory, the human psyche. Now DV8 has brought its latest creation, Strange Fish, to Riverside Studios. The title is owed to the Buddhist saying that we should be as ignorant of what we are going to catch as a fisherman of what is at the end of his line. The argument concerns the nature of our quest for someone to love (though DV8 does not believe in tame gazelles or gentle doves) and something or someone to believe in. The staging is - and in this lies an acute fascination - exactly of our time in gauging the forms through which this quest may be understood, and the terms in which disillusion will manifest itself. We see a boarded stage in front of a wooden facade (excellent design by Peter J Davison) which has windows, doors, a ladder, and small apertures which will enable the cast to find hand and foot holds for the more acrobatic moments of the action. As the action begins, drifting mist reveals a cross from which hangs the Christ-figure of the singer Melanie Pappenheim. Through the gloom a crowd of naked bodies climb across the stage and into the facade of the building. The tiny, elf-like figure of Diana Payne-Myers, a fascinating performer despite her sixty-something years, lights candles at the foot of the cross. Wendy Houston, that thrillingly intense dancer, whirls and falls, holding a wine-glass which she constantly fails to seize with her other hand. A door opens to reveal Diana Payne-Myers worshipping a crucifix in front of a gushing wash-basin. The stage brightens to bring on other members of the cast - Jordi Cortes Molina, Nigel Charnock, Dale Tanner, Lauren Potter, Kate Champion - who mime, mingle, exchange physical babble, flirt, pick up and drop each other (in every sense) as a tango rings out. I have detailed this opening section since it contains images which will recur throughout the 90 minutes of the piece. They are in no way shocking - though Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells may not be too happy - but they are provocative in the very best terms of DV8's creative imagination. The performance process is to confront each member of the cast - and each of us  -with the failure of belief, of love, with the corruption and extinction of hope and desire. Strange Fish is pessimistic - in an interview Lloyd Newson quoted Francis Bacon's comment that he 'believed in nothing but was eternally optimistic' - yet it takes a compassionate view of its crises and of the human condition. It is riven with moments of wild humour, and galvanised both by stunning theatrical coups and stunning performance from its cast. Speech is minimally used, notably by Nigel Charnock as the gabbling unwanted guest, desperately trying to be loved - 'People are my hobby. I'm a people person' - and insinuating himself between pairs of lovers. A duet for Lauren Potter and Jordi Cortes Molina is a transcendental study in movement curving and oiling itself through bodies. Houston sticks two feathers on Charnock's shoulders, leads him to a window, and urges him to fly - and heart-stoppingly he plunges down. (Freudians will recognise the sexual connotation). Intercourse between Houston and Tanner degenerates into frantic masturbation by the man as a torrent of stones suddenly pours on to the stage, and Houston starts to flail and writhe among them. The images resonate throughout the action, and we make connections, and know the despair that lies at the heart of the work. The closing section is fiercely daring. Charnock has roped himself to the Cross. Rejected by the other members of the cast, Houston has torn up part of the stage floor, to reveal subterranean waters. She teases Charnock. He flees from her through trapdoors, but she at last releases him from the cross, and they plunge into the water. Melanie Pappenheim appears, supporting Dale Tanner as if holding a Christ from a Deposition. Houston emerges from the water, and wanders over the empty stage. She takes a glass of wine, climbs up the cross where Pappenheim again hangs, pours wine on her, kisses her, and after a desperate search for Charnock, balances herself upon the last wine-glasses. The light dies, and we can take no comfort from what we have seen. In the matter of performance, the evening is unflawed. The playing of the ensemble - the brilliant conflict and complementing of personalities; the shared sense of risk and trust; the acuteness of timing and physical response - is matched by an emotional awareness that is dazzlingly communicative. One may argue with the work's premises - its denial of faith, of the enduring power of human relationships - but there can be no argument about the astonishing force of its realisation and performance. To Lloyd Newson and his cast, admiration and gratitude. The fine score and soundtrack are, respectively, by Jocelyn Pook and Adrian Jackson. Admirable lighting is by Steve Whitson. Not to be missed. Strange Fish continues at Riverside Studios, Hammersmith, until August 8.</p>

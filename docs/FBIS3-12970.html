			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Friendly Reproach"] </F>   [Text] When sisterly Qatar stood with us during the ordeal  of the brutal Iraqi invasion, this was not merely aimed at  extending help in a time of need. When Qatari forces had the  honor to confront the Iraqi aggression, this was no coincidence  but was part of the principled and honorable position of  sisterly Qatar.    In this, its singular position toward its oppressed brother  during the ordeal of the invasion of Kuwait, Qatar clearly  expressed its stand in a manner that showed noble and pure  fraternity and deep and strong relations. Qatar offered all it  could to support justice. Toward that objective, Qatar extended  everything it had in order to defeat the aggression and restore  Kuwaiti rights. Kuwait's ordeal demonstrated the status of the  Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] and reflected the closeness of  relations among its states.    Now, three years after the liberation of Kuwait and the  restoration of legitimacy, much of the credit for which goes to  the GCC states, and with our national celebrations, which are  also celebrations for all those who contributed to the  liberation of our country, it is difficult to see sisterly Qatar  opening its windows to the aggressor so that the aggressor can  spread its poisons and use these windows as a means to improve  its image and win the sympathy of others.    If the brothers in Qatar are hurt by the suffering of the  Iraqi people, our hurt in Kuwait is no less than theirs. Our  sufferings increase with the continuation of this regime because  we knew that regime and lived with it for seven months. We also  know that a human being is worthless according to its hateful  Ba'thist ideology.    This regime is still practicing its oppression despite all  the international sanctions imposed on it after its sinful  aggression. Instead of receiving Qatar's help against the  oppressor, as we used to expect from Qatar, we were surprised to  see the sinful aggressor appear in the brothers' media, as if he  is mocking us, our solidarity, the pure blood that had been  spilled, and the international resolutions that have been  adopted.    Our love for Qatar and appreciation of its principled  positions toward us allow us to reproach it in the spirit of  family -- a family that we are both part of and of which we are  proud to be a member. This reproach is a friendly one that  expresses our hope that the brothers will reconsider their  positions toward the one who has harmed and suppressed his own  people, as well as our people, and continues to do so.    It is a friendly reproach from a wounded heart that can bear  no more injuries.</p>

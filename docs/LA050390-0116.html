			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR'S VIEWS  </P> <P> In a recent article ("North's Attitude Divides by Longitude, Not Latitude,"  April 1), I was quoted out of context, which proved misleading to the readers.  The purpose of this letter is to set the record straight on my views regarding  the character, life style and opportunities of Escondido.  </P> <P> The people of Escondido have traditionally played a major role in molding the  economic, cultural and academic standards and priorities of our community. In  1985, the citizens voted to build a $52-million cultural center, including a  state-of-the-art, 1,500-seat lyric theater and fine arts museum to open in  1993. They also agreed to spend up to $12 million on revitalizing downtown.  When it was determined that a suitable land site for a state college campus was  not available in Escondido, the city supported the establishment of a state  college in neighboring San Marcos. Further, Escondido is a role model for other  cities in providing housing for the working poor, single parents and homeless.  </P> <P> These enterprises are but a few of Escondido's laudable accomplishments. We are  proud of our city and its people, and we welcome others to join us in the  celebration of our cultural and academic achievements.  </P> <P> DORIS THURSTON  </P> <P> Mayor  </P> <P> Escondido  </P></p>

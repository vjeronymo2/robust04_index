The Foreign Ministry reiterated in a communique Chile will  vote for the Costa Rican candidate, Foreign Minister Bernd  Niehaus, in tomorrow's elections to appoint the successor of  Brazilian Joao Baena Soares. [passage omitted]    Representatives for member countries will have to choose  between Colombian President Cesar Gaviria or Costa Rican Foreign  Minister Bernd Niehaus, because Venezuela withdrew its candidacy  this week. [passage omitted]    "We have not come under pressure; all we have received are  the views of several Rio Group foreign ministers," said Chilean  Foreign Minister Figueroa, who on the afternoon of 25 March  traveled to the U.S. capital.    Figueroa said Chile will "honor" the written pledge signed  by  former President Patricio Aylwin and support the Costa Rican  foreign minister.    He said President Eduardo Frei hopes the next OAS secretary  general will concentrate on resolving the continent's internal  problems and play an active role in the United States' relations  with other continents.</p>

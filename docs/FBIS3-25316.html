The delegation is headed by Tokyo Sexwale, a member of the ANC  Executive Committee. Sexwale was welcomed by MPLA Secretary  General Lopo do Nascimento. Speaking to journalists, Sexwale  said he was particularly optimistic about the future of the  South African people.    [Begin Sexwale recording, in English fading into Portuguese  translation] We believe a democratic South Africa will play an  important role in the region and will go a long way in helping  the people of Angola themselves to solve their problems. [end  recording]    This afternoon, the ANC delegation called at the MPLA  headquarters to learn about the activities carried out by the  party that won the first multiparty elections in Angola. Lopo  do Nascimento discussed the activities of his party, leading to  the September 1992 victory at the polls. He blamed the National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola for the deplorable  state of the country.    One of the main goals of the ANC delegation's visit to  Angola  is to learn about the Angolan elections because the first  multiracial elections will be held in South Africa soon. Also  today, the ANC delegation went to the Congressional Palace,  where MPLA members of parliament told them about electoral  systems. Tomorrow, the ANC delegation is scheduled to visit  Benguela Province.</p>

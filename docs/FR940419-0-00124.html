			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The total annual cost for each category of ship was calculated by multiplying annual cost per ship by the estimated number of ships effected in each category: freight and tank vessels: $1,257,432.94; tug and tow vessels: $281,634.50; small fishing vessels: $7,939,799.04; large fishing vessels: $131,087.04; passenger vessels: $2,309,402.90; cruise vessels: $25,749.48; offshore oil and mineral vessels: $245,642.76; research and other miscellaneous classes of vessels: $52,156.88; and manned fixed and floating platforms: $128,010.00. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The average annual burden of this requirement per respondent is estimated to be 20.9 hours. This average was calculated by dividing the total number of hours spent on recordkeeping annually, by the total number of applicable ships. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Small Entities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard does not have accurate information on how many vessels or manned fixed or floating platforms would qualify as small entities and what the economic impact on them would be. However, because the recordkeeping is expected to require only five minutes per day and no particular record book or format is prescribed, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Collection of Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule contains a collection of information requirement. The Coast Guard has submitted the requirements to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and OMB has approved them. The section number is &sect;151.55 and the corresponding OMB approval number is OMB Control Number 2115&hyph;0613. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Federalism <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. The regulations are administrative in nature and are expected to have some positive but no negative impact on the environment. The regulations should contribute to the reduction of the occurrence of plastic, as well as other ship-generated garbage, in the marine environment. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 151 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Oil pollution, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Water pollution control. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set out in the preamble, the Coast Guard amends 33 CFR part 151 as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 151_VESSELS CARRYING OIL, NOXIOUS LIQUID SUBSTANCES, GARBAGE, MUNICIPAL OR COMMERCIAL WASTE, AND BALLAST WATER <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

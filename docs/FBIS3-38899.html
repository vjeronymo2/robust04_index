			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President-Elect Martti Ahtisaari by Isabelle </F> Graviere in Helsinki; date not given: "Ahtisaari: `Finland Must  Become Active Member of European Union'"]    [Text] On Sunday [6 February], his son's 25th birthday,  Martti Ahtisaari became the new president of the Finnish  Republic with 53.9 percent of the votes compared with 46.1  percent to his rival, current Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn.  After a tight electoral campaign between the two candidates,  both of whom were clearly pro-European, the success of Social  Democrat Ahtisaari -- a diplomat who had been long removed from  the national political arena -- seems to stem from his  commitment to the fight against unemployment (in a country where  over 20 percent of the population is out of a job) as well as  the population's discontent with its traditional politicians.    To the population's double appeal for more jobs and more  innovation in politics, the new president -- who will take  office on 1 March -- has this answer: "Europe." According to  him, only the European Union will make it possible to create the  new economic and political framework that Finland needs.    However, it seems that the negotiations currently in  progress  in Brussels between the Twelve and four candidate members --  including Finland -- will be particularly tense with respect to  matters such as agriculture, regional aid, or the contribution  of candidate members to the Community's budget. Indeed, the  deadline for the completion of the negotiations, which remains  scheduled for 1 March, appears problematic despite the two  additional sessions announced last week by the Greek presidency.    [Graviere] What is the first priority for Finland's new  president of the Republic?    [Ahtisaari] Employment is undoubtedly our society's main  challenge. As president of the Republic, I have a duty to help  return Finland as quickly as possible to a state of economic  development likely to ensure a strong reduction in unemployment  over the next few years. To achieve this, we must, among other  things, implement economic support measures, diversify our core  industrial production, and become an active member of the  European Union.    [Graviere] You find yourself in a "French-style" situation  where the president and the prime minister do not belong to the  same political groups. How will you cooperate with current head  of government Esko Aho, especially in economic matters, where  your analysis differs from his own?    [Ahtisaari] In Finland, the government is clearly  responsible for the country's economic policy. However, I said  that I consider the president to be responsible for the welfare  of the citizens. My role will not be to prescribe -- even less  so since the government enjoys the support of a parliament  chosen by a broad majority of the Finnish people -- but to  influence and to convince. The government can alter the course  of its current policy; I shall work toward this goal.    [Graviere] You have always stressed your commitment to  European membership. Why is this so important for Finland?    [Ahtisaari] The main motive is economic. The European  economic space, of which we are already a member, does not make  it possible to exert significant influence on the European  construction process. We need to be present inside the European  Union, make our positions heard, prevent decisions which run  counter to our interests. Also, another pro-European argument  often heard concerns security. I my opinion, this argument is  also based on economic grounds, since economic cooperation  strengthens security, whereas isolation fosters insecurity.    [Graviere] The current negotiations with Brussels are  proving particularly difficult. Do you think Helsinki can reach  an agreement with the Twelve before the (early March) deadline?    [Ahtisaari] The main stumbling block today is unquestionably  the farming issue. Everything considered, what we want can be  summed up in one sentence: To be granted the same conditions as  other member states are currently enjoying, in particular with  regard to the their less-favored regions, which indisputably  also apply to our northern regions. However, I am convinced  that an agreement will be found, even if the negotiation  deadline is delayed.</p>

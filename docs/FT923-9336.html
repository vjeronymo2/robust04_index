			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Wallace Smith liquidator says Pounds 100m is missing LIQUIDATORS trying to trace funds that disappeared from Wallace Smith Trust, the financial company closed last year by the Bank of England, have recovered only a small fraction of the money owed to its creditors. Mr Tim Hayward, head of corporate recovery at KPMG Peat Marwick, said yesterday he was clear the amount of the missing assets was about Pounds 100m, but he had recovered only a few million pounds. He was speaking after news emerged on Tuesday of writs being issued against two clearing banks in an attempt to recover money paid to Wallace Smith Trust which was allegedly transferred without authorisation to another company, Wallace Smith Holdings. Mr Wallace Duncan Smith, the chief executive of Wallace Smith Trust, was charged last year by the Serious Fraud Office with offences involving more than Dollars 50m. The Royal Bank of Scotland is being sued to recover transfers worth up to Pounds 418m and National Westminster Bank for Pounds 71m plus interest. Both banks are vigorously defending the actions. Mr Hayward said: 'We have an understanding of where the majority of the missing funds may have gone. We have identified where they were flowing. The next stage is to find them.' Money had been transferred through 'a number of related parallel companies' from Wallace Smith Trust. Much appeared to have then been used either to buy the trust's shares or to provide interest which needed to be paid on its deposits. 'Either money was siphoned off to a pot of gold or more likely it was used for the purpose of covering the growing cost of masking a lack of profitability,' he said. National Westminster was a banker to both Wallace Smith companies and Royal Bank of Scotland took over that role in the late 1980s. The payments referred to in the two writs relate to money earned by Wallace Smith Trust for the sale of certificates of deposit and other financial instruments. Wallace Smith Holdings, which received the money, is now called Dundalk Investment, a Canadian-registered business. It appears to have been used as one of the principal vehicles through which money was allegedly transferred. Investigators are trying to understand the relationship between Wallace Smith Trust and Wallace Smith Holdings. However, a director of the trust is believed to have had signing powers with Holdings giving him authority to transfer money from the company. Mr Hayward did not rule out further legal action in attempts to recover money. He has already issued a writ against Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells, now part of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, for its work as auditor to Wallace Smith companies.</p>

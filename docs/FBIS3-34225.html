			<p>Language: <F P=105> Pashto </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Note issued by the Foreign Ministry; date not given] </F>   [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful.  As evidence and precise reports convey, the Republic of  Uzbekistan Government continues its interference, in various  forms, against the Muslim people of Afghanistan and national  sovereignty of the ISA [Islamic State of Afghanistan]. For  instance, this interference has clearly been felt since the  beginning of the current fighting in Afghanistan. Relations and  good-neighborliness taken into account, the ISA brought this  issue to the attention of the related authorities of the  Republic of Uzbekistan in a friendly manner through diplomatic  channels, and was expecting such interference to be prevented.    But, unfortunately, against the expectation of the ISA and  the Muslim nation of Afghanistan, not only was this interference  not stopped, but it was intensified. The ISA strongly protests  against such interfering acts by Uzbekistan in the internal  affairs of Afghanistan, which demonstrate the unfriendly policy  of that country, and is against the UN Charter and all  internationally accepted current norms and principles, and  demands from the authorities of that country to seriously  refrain from the repetition and continuation of such  interference which will have grave consequences for and negative  impact on the relations of the two neighborly countries.  Otherwise, the ISA cannot remain indifferent toward such  interference.</p>

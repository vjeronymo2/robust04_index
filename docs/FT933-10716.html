			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Talks over Russian killings THE MURDER of two senior Russian officials has brought home to the Russian public the increasingly bitter struggle between two ethnic groups in the north Caucasian region, writes John Lloyd in Moscow. Mr Viktor Polyanichko, temporary governor of the areas of Ingushetia and neighbouring North Ossetia, was murdered when gunmen fired on his car late on Sunday afternoon. Major General Anatoly Koretsky, commander of the Russian forces in the area, was also killed. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, deputy Russian prime minister for nationalities, and General Pavel Grachev, defence minister, immediately flew to the Ossetian capital of Vladikavkaz for talks with local leaders. Mr Polyanichko, a former senior communist official in Azerbaijan, had emergency powers to rule in the region as increasingly violent conflict followed efforts by Ingush families deported from their homes to resettle in areas of South Ossetia.</p>

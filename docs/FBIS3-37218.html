"I think this might inflict psychological damage to this  diplomatic initiative," Kostikov told Interfax on Tuesday.    "The concept of this program has not been explained or  understood fully," he went on to say, "many may perceive air  strikes on the Serb positions by the NATO forces, in which the  U.S. plays the leading role, as the implementation of this  project. Given this, the operation might be viewed as the false  start of the American initiative."    Kostikov also said that it was in the United States' and  Russia's common interests to find a political solution to the  Bosnia conflict.</p>

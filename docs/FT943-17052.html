			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Delay 'surprise' for Eurotunnel Eurotunnel, which owns and operates the Channel tunnel, said yesterday that the announcement of delays to the start of Eurostar train services had come as a surprise and that it might seek compensation for any loss of revenues. The British, French and Belgian railways said on Wednesday that their long-distance passenger services between London, Paris and Brussels, due to start this month, would not start until September at the earliest. They said the extra delay had been caused by the complexity of the testing and commissioning of the Pounds 24m trains. According to Eurotunnel, the reasons for the delay to the Eurostar services appeared to be caused by the rolling stock and the trains' ability to run reliably on the rail network of south-east England. As far as it was concerned, certification for Eurostar services was still scheduled for July. It said the launch of Le Shuttle services, which carry cars with passengers through the tunnel, will not be affected by the Eurostar delay.</p>

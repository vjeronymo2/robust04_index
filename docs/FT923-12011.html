			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TURNOVER in the derivatives market soared on the back of strong two-way business in both stock index futures and traded options, as economic worries led to a sharp retreat, writes Joel Kibazo. The September futures contract on the FT-SE, having opened at 2,415, was gently squeezed forward and had risen to 2,436 by around 10am. However, with continuing worries about the economy and an indication from the Alliance &amp; Leicester Building Society of a possible increase in mortgage rates, the initially positive mood changed, causing the September contract to fall sharply, which in turn pulled the underlying cash market lower. At the day's worst, around 1pm, September, which had dropped to 2,367, was trading at parity with the cash index. The intervention in the money markets to support the dollar provided the spur for a recovery in the contract in the afternoon. September finished at 2,416, down 22 from the previous session and around 5 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 18; volume reached a hefty 14,000 contracts. Turnover in traded options was also high, totalling 50,180 lots by the close. The FT-SE option was particularly active, having 26,313 contracts transacted, while the Euro FT-SE option saw 4,677 lots dealt.</p>

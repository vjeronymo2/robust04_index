			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Sellafield plant faces tough safety standards POLLUTION authorities proposed tough new standards yesterday for British Nuclear Fuels' new waste processing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria. But while they claimed these would result in significantly lower discharges of harmful materials, the proposals did not include a requirement to install control equipment on a controversial radioactive gas. The new standards could leave room for an increase in discharges from current levels. The Pollution Inspectorate's proposals are contained in a draft authorisation for the Sellafield site, including the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (Thorp), a new Pounds 1.85bn facility designed to process fuel from pressurised-water reactors. There will be an eight-week consultation period, after which a final authorisation will be drawn up. Dr David Slater, the inspectorate's director, said yesterday: 'I emphasise that no decisions will be taken until we have considered all the representations made to us.' Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, has the power to call for a full hearing if he wishes. The proposed emission levels are tougher than BNF requested. But the company welcomed them last night. Mr John Guinness, the chairman, said he was convinced that the inspectorate would be 'scrupulous and fair' and would not be swayed by 'the tactics of the anti-nuclear lobby which has been orchestrating a letters campaign in order to distort the right and proper process of public consultation'. Dr Patrick Green of the environmental pressure group Friends of the Earth said: 'Far from preventing further contamination of the coast and atmosphere, the Pollution Inspectorate is planning to let BNF increase massively its discharges to the environment.' The proposed maximum limit on gases would reduce the annual radiation dose to the most exposed members of the public from 451 microsieverts to 214ms. However, Sellafield's emissions are currently only 170ms. The maximum for liquid wastes at present allows a dose of 219ms, against actual emissions amounting to 135ms to 153ms. The new limit would be 165ms, again leaving room for an increase. The inspectorate stressed yesterday, however, that British Nuclear Fuels would have to stay within 75 per cent of the limit. The inspectorate is not requiring British Nuclear Fuels to install equipment to remove krypton-85, a radioactive gas that will be discharged into the atmosphere by Thorp. The inspectorate said there was no proven and safe means. But BNF would have to install the equipment as soon as 'reasonably practicable'.</p>

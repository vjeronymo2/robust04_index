			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Jamaica sees change in its fiscal fortune: The causes of upturn are being contested The custodians of Jamaica's finances are celebrating what they see as a significant change in the fortunes of their economy. Since the beginning of the year, there has been a marked increase in the volume of foreign currency in the commercial banking system, and the country's foreign reserves have grown twenty-fold. This, they say, has contributed to several months of currency stability in Jamaica. The underlying cause of these developments, however, has been questioned. It has been suggested this financial turn for the better has nothing to do with the performance of the economy, and that it could be temporary. Officials say it is government action which has brought stability. The deregulation of Jamaica's foreign exchange market three years ago was followed by an 83 per cent depreciation in the value of the Jamaican dollar, following a fall of 67 per cent during the 1980s. Since January, however, flows of foreign currency into the banking system have moved from about USDollars 2m a day to about Dollars 5m a day. The country's net international reserves have moved from Dollars 12.5m in December to about Dollars 240m in June - equal to the import bill for about six weeks. The exchange rate has been stable for nine months. 'This is the result of a successful policy,' said Mr Jacques Bussieres, governor of the central bank. 'The tight monetary policy of the last year has helped to stabilise the exchange rate, restoring some confidence in the Jamaica dollar. This has encouraged people to hold Jamaican dollar assets, leading to significant reflows of capital into Jamaica.' Mr Edward Seaga, the opposition leader and a former finance minister, is far from convinced. During the period of increased foreign inflows and currency stability, there has been a decline in earnings by the leading sectors of the economy. 'There is no underlying growth in the economy to support the inflow of foreign exchange claimed by the government,' he contended. Jamaica's merchandise deficit in the first five months of this year widened to Dollars 374.5m, Dollars 50.4m more than a year earlier, and follows a trade gap of Dollars 1.1bn last year. Marginally higher earnings from tourism will not close the gap. 'Jamaica is in great danger by proceeding on the false premise of having a safe reserve position,' Mr Seaga said. The increased foreign currency inflows followed the expansion of the network of licensed foreign exchange facilities, said Mr Rex James, president of the Banker's Association. 'Black market trading in foreign currency seems to have disappeared. Some money is also coming in because of higher interest rates here than might be available in the US.' Jamaican banks' interest rates on foreign currency deposits are about 50 per cent higher than those prevailing in the US. This increase in currency inflows and the improvement in international reserves, however, masks some continuing and chronic problems for the economy. Economic growth this year is not expected to be much higher than last year's 1.2 per cent - less than half the government's target. The bauxite mining and refining industry and export agriculture (mainly sugar and bananas) are likely to record no more than the marginal growth expected by tourism. Despite the exchange rate stability of the past eight months, figures up to July indicate an annualised inflation rate of 32.7 per cent, following last year's 30.1 per cent. The fiscal programme, attempting to achieve a surplus, has adversely affected social services. Industrial unrest threatens as the government, ironically, becomes the victim of what its claims is a policy success. Reports of the improvement in the foreign reserves have coincided with a spate of hefty wage claims from public sector unions. Despite repeated suggestions that illegal activities have contributed to the increased inflows, Mr James maintains 'there is no evidence that money is being laundered in Jamaica'. Mr Bussieres concurs: 'While there is always the chance of some element of money laundering being attempted, the central bank has taken all steps to ensure that this is not happening.'  ----------------------------------- JAMAICA'S NET INTERNATIONAL RESERVES  -----------------------------------            in millions of US dollars  ----------------------------------- 1983                 -807.4 1984                 -623.6 1985                 -700.3 1986                 -768.1 1987                 -538.1 1988                 -535.2 1989                 -530.5 1990                 -447.8 1991                 -443.0 1992                  -67.0 1993                  +12.5 1994 (Jun)           +240.0  ----------------------------------- Source: (Central) Bank of Jamaica  -----------------------------------</p>

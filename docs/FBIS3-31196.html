In the  future, emphasis should rather be placed on improving its  operation and increasing its efficiency, the draft electoral  manifesto of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) says.    The 200-page document, which was distributed among members  of  the MDF National Board in Budapest this weekend, will be  discussed and finalized by the party's three-day national  congress next weekend.    The three chapters of the draft comprise the main issues of  legislation, home affairs, foreign affairs, economy,  agriculture, education, culture, health, and social welfare.</p>

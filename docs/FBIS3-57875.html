Rossigneux affirms that the Czech Republic is willing to play  the role of intermediary in such a transaction. She cites as  evidence the minutes of a 20 October government-industry meeting  in Paris and a report on the results of a 25-27 October visit to  East European countries by the Aeronautics and Space Industries  Group (GIFAS) commission in charge of exports.

She cites an excerpt from the GIFAS commission  report explaining the advantages of working with the Czechs:  "Czech officials offer Western companies qualified and  inexpensive manpower, a capable and underemployed labor  instrument, and access to export markets such as Algeria, Libya,  Iraq, Thailand, and New Zealand."</p>

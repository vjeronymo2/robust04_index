			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. NAVY SHOULD ADOPT THE COST-SAVING MISSILE DEVICE DEVELOPED BY MICRONICS  </P> <P> I would like to point out an additional item not mentioned in the story about  Micronics ("Micronics vs. the Pentagon," Oct. 29).  </P> <P> Shortly after Precision Aerotech purchased Micronics in 1987, it became  apparent that someone had to adopt a more sensible approach to the Phoenix  missile problem. The directors of Precision Aerotech elected to fully fund, at  its own expense, the complete redesign of the "safe and arming" device.  </P> <P> This new design was 40% cheaper than the original Navy design, and it could be  assembled in the volume necessary to get the Phoenix program back on track. The  completed article was presented on Aug. 24. Four weeks later, Micronics was  closed down, and our solution to a decade of program mismanagement by the Navy  slipped into a void.  </P> <P> I write this letter for two reasons. First, it should be noted that Precision  Aerotech was quick to show good faith by investing its own funds and personnel  at Micronics to solve the problem. Secondly, while Precision Aerotech will  never own and operate Micronics again, the Navy should use the redesigned safe  and arming device today. It will save the American taxpayers millions of  dollars and permit the Navy to arm Phoenix missiles now rather than wait two  years to develop an unproven alternate source.  </P> <P> G. ADDISON APPLEBY  </P> <P> LA JOLLA  </P> <P> The writer is chairman of Precision Aerotech.  </P></p>

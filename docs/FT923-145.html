			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Falling pound prompts increase in gilt sales OVERSEAS financial instit-utions sold gilts worth Pounds 1.3bn last month as they worried about the falling pound, the Bank of England said yesterday. It was by far the largest monthly selling of gilts by non-UK institutions since Britain joined the European exchange rate mechanism in October 1990. It indicates that such groups may be averse to buying large stocks of government bonds now the pound is floating outside the ERM. Last month the government sold Pounds 1.2bn worth of gilts, taking into account redemptions. The state of corporate finances improved in the second quarter although industrial and commercial companies continued to run a financial deficit. Seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office yesterday showed a financial deficit of Pounds 2bn in the second quarter compared with Pounds 4.3bn in the first. Gross trading profits of the corporate sector, net of stock appreciation, were Pounds 20.5bn, more than Pounds 1bn higher than the first quarter.</p>

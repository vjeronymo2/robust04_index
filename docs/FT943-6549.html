			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Body Shop document pre-empts expected US attack Body Shop International, the cosmetics and toiletries group, has issued a 32-page document pre-empting an expected broadside on it by Mr Jon Entine, a US journalist, to be published in US journal Business Ethics on September 1. Mr Gordon Roddick, Body Shop chairman, said: 'The Body Shop can no longer sit, wait and allow pre-publicity hype to damage its reputation.' Speculation over the contents of the article has prompted a 24p fall in Body Shop's share price to 218p. The company admits that it has not seen the 25,000-word dossier that Mr Entine has offered to UK newspapers through his agent. However it has seen an article submitted by Mr Entine to the magazine Vanity Fair, which was not published. It is this article, Body Shop believes, that is being offered for serialisation. Mr Roddick said the article made 'inaccurate and misleading statements which were very seriously defamatory'. The Body Shop document attacks what it believes are Mr Entine's arguments. It says: His statement of the percentage of Body Shop business which comes from its Trade Not Aid programme with developing countries is false. 'More importantly his percentages are beside the point,' although such trading 'is a small part of all our trade'. Accusations about how Body Shop 'stole' its name and concept are 'demonstrably false'. Relationships with its franchisees are healthy and prosperous. The company acknowledges that it uses synthetic, as well as natural products, and says that it has made no attempt to hide the fact. It restates its 'powerful commitment to charitable endeavours' and sets out its 'efforts to be environmentally responsible', acknowledging that 'any industrial or commercial activity involves some adverse environmental impact'.</p>

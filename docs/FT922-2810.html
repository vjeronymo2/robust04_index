			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Rise and rise of the east Asian trading economies IN A lecture last week on 'Europe in the 1990s: the Economic Perspective', the Bank of England's chief economist, Professor Mervyn King, remarked that 'we must not become obsessed with the current conjunctural position to the detriment of medium-term policies to raise economic growth, on the one hand, and ensure price stability on the other'. He was correct. Similarly, one should not allow short-term phenomena, such as the collapse in Japanese asset prices and the slowdown in Japanese growth, to obscure the world's most significant economic trend: the rise of east Asia, with Japan in the lead. The World Bank's recent publication on global economic prospects*, discussed by Edward Balls in this column on April 27, shows that Japanese gross domestic investment, at Dollars 910bn (Pounds 500bn) in 1989, exceeded that of the US, then Dollars 878bn, and was little less than that of the EC, at Dollars 1,023bn. This was in spite of the populations of both the US and the EC being more than twice that of Japan. With 2 per cent of the world's population, but a fifth of its investment, Japan's economy remains formidable by any standards. Such high rates of investment reflect the identification and exploitation of profitable opportunities. Prominent among these has been technology-intensive manufacturing. World trade in commodities that rely heavily on expenditures on research and development, which is how the World Bank defines technology-intensive production, soared from Dollars 25.3bn (21 per cent of global exports of manufactures) to Dollars 511.9bn (28.6 per cent) between 1968 and 1988. Japan's exports rose faster still, its share growing from 8.5 per cent to 17.5 per cent. By 1988 its high-technology exports were only slightly less than those of the US, which, like Germany and the UK, experienced a sharp decline in its share. The most interesting policy aspect of Japanese success is the relative absence of government support, not its high level, as so many allege. In the US and UK, R&amp;D expenditures have been dominated by the needs of defence. In Japan, by contrast, R&amp;D has been oriented towards market demand. Japan's market-driven technology seems to have been far more economically successful than the government-driven alternative. Japan's success is no longer an isolated one. Over the same 20 years the Republic of Korea moved from generating only 0.1 per cent of world exports of high-technology manufactures to 2.9 per cent, nearly half the UK and French levels. China's share jumped from 0.2 per cent to 1.1 per cent between 1978 and 1988. Such international trade achievements have made a crucial contribution to the spectacular east Asian economic performance. The International Monetary Fund's latest World Economic Outlook notes that between 1980 and 1981 alone, China's real gross domestic product grew 2 1/2 times, while the combined GDPs of Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand, all trade-oriented, more than doubled. The World Bank shows total gross domestic investment in the region at Dollars 1,233bn in 1989, three quarters of it in Japan, with the remainder in its developing economies. This was virtually the same as in the whole of Europe, both east and west, and significantly more than in North America. With such high levels of investment and continued success in international trade, the roughly 20 per cent of world GDP already accounted for by the region is certain to rise further. This year marks the celebration of the 500th anniversary of the European discovery of America. Throughout most of that period the most dynamic parts of the world have been Europe and its American offshoots. Prior to the 15th century, however, east Asia, then dominated by China, was the world's most economically advanced region. It is on its way to reclaiming that historic place. *Global Economic Prospects and the Developing Countries (World Bank: Washington DC 1992).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------         INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: BALANCE OF PAYMENTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Trade figures are given in billions of European currency units (Ecu).

---------------------------------------------------------------------- April All trade figures are seasonally adjusted, except for the Italian series and the German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting the visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are calculated on the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and Italian imports which use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance and freight charges). German data up to and including June 1990, shown in italics, refer to the former West Germany. The nominal effective exchange rates are period averages of Bank of England trade-weighted indices.

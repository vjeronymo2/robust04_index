			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Attali departs, the stables still uncleaned THERE IS an old joke in the airline industry that Air France could fire half its workforce and still operate perfectly smoothly its entire fleet of aircraft and airline services. Of all the big international carriers, Air France has always suffered from some of the heaviest costs in the industry. But its entrenched union structure, coupled with the reluctance of successive governments to force a showdown with the unions, has prevented managements from introducing the necessary restructuring to make the French national flag carrier competitive in an increasing global and liberalised world airline market. Mr Bernard Attali, the airline's chairman who resigned last night, had been no exception. For four years after being appointed by the former Socialist government he attempted to navigate a delicate flight path to improve the carrier's competitive position without forcing a showdown with the labour unions. But after initially concentrating on strategic issues to strengthen the airline's domestic and international position by absorbing Air Inter, the French domestic carrier, and UTA, the French independent long-distance airline, acquiring stakes in Sabena of Belgium and CSA of Czechoslovakia, and forming a marketing partnership with Continental Airlines of the US, Mr Attali could no longer escape the need for a radical restructuring. Some previous, timid attempts at reducing the workforce and improving working efficiency had clearly not been sufficient to carry the airline through the worst post-war recession in the airline business and the emergence of new, fiercer international competition as a result of deregulation in Europe. Mr Attali finally announced a sweeping restructuring plan involving 4,000 job cuts, including some compulsory redundancies, and route cuts last month after close consultation with his government shareholders. The government also agreed to provide an additional FFr5bn (Pounds 583m) in support to back the airline's recovery. Air France was continuing to see its losses grow (they totalled FFr3.8bn in the first half of this year alone) while other competitors appeared to be already well on the way to recovery. British Airways, one of the world's most profitable airlines, tackled the problem back in the early 1980s with a restructuring programme before and then after privatisation which took out more than 20,000 people. Lufthansa, the state-controlled German carrier, also embarked successfully on a restructuring programme 18 months ago. Mr Attali's task was further complicated by his difficult relationship with the French government following the victory of the centre-right in the last election. As somebody always close to President Francois Mitterrand's camp - he is the twin brother of Mr Jacques Attali, controversial former head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development - his days were always seen as numbered once the Socialists lost power. But Mr Edouard Balladur, the new prime minister, has been reluctant to engage in one of the 'witch hunts' that have characterised French politics with a general clear-out of state industry bosses after an election. However, Mr Attali was under pressure to deliver results as his airline plunged deeper and deeper into the red. Indeed, many felt he was being kept on in his job to 'clean the stables', in the words of a French airline industry analyst, to be replaced once the airline was deemed to have turned the corner and be ready for privatisation. A few weeks ago in Paris Mr Attali made it clear that there was no alternative for Air France but to go ahead with stringent restructuring. He clearly miscalculated the government's resolve to back him up in the face of the furious union protests that have paralysed French air transport all last week. But his resignation and the government's decision not to support his original restructuring plan has simply delayed the day of reckoning at Air France. 'The only hope for the airline's future viability is swingeing restructuring, even if this will entail a long and painful labour confrontation,' said another analyst last night. 'Whoever takes over from Attali will face exactly the same problem.'</p>

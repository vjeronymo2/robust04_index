			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Public Admission by Iran on Presence </F> of Mojahedin in Bosnia"]    [Text] The Iranian press agency IRNA has reported that two  mojahedin fighting against Serbian forces have died on the  Bosnian battlefield. According to the agency, it is a question  of two Arabs -- Habib Al Madani and Abdulah al Saleh. IRNA does  not specify from which Arab country the two mojahedin came.    The news from the Iranian news agency would not draw special  attention, considering the tragic fact that people are dying on  the Bosnian battlefield every day. However, for the first time  since the beginning of the Bosnian civil war, media of the  Islamic world have admitted that mojahedin from Islamic  countries have also been fighting on the side of the Bosnian  Muslims.    IRNA also states that "a certain number of Arabs have been  working" in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina in the area of the  "humanitarian aid and education."</p>

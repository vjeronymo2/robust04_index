			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: Weak prices hit Reynolds Metals DESPITE record shipments, weak aluminium prices continued to depress earnings at Reynolds Metals, the second-largest US aluminium group. The company reported second-quarter net income of Dollars 33.1m, or 56 cents per share, a 46 per cent drop from last year's Dollars 61.4m, or Dollars 1.04. Revenues in the quarter ended June 30 were Dollars 1.49bn, compared with Dollars 1.52bn a year ago. Shipments were a record 393,400 metric tons, up 3.6 per cent from 379,700 last year. Reynolds' efforts to cut costs helped contribute to earnings in spite of the poor prices, according to Mr Richard Holder, chairman. He said demand was up, particularly in the US, and the company and the industry were seeing strong order rates. However, prices remained weak because of continued worldwide oversupply due to recession in some countries, substantial new capacity in the industry, and CIS exports. Mr Holder said he expected producer inventories to continue to rise moderately and for prices to remain weak through the summer. However, he believed prospects should improve in the autumn. The company's shipments have increased for cans, consumer and packaging products, residential building materials and international fabricated products. In the first half, net income was Dollars 46.4m, or 78 cents per share, on revenues of Dollars 2.82bn, compared with Dollars 88.9m, or Dollars 1.50, on revenues of Dollars 2.89 last year. Shipments in the first half were 727,100 metric tons, up from 701,800 a year ago.</p>

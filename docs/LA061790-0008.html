			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALBUM REVIEW;  </P> <P> *** 1/2 RENEE ROSNES "RENEE ROSNES" BLUE NOTE: ALBUMS ARE RATED FROM FIVE STARS  (A CLASSIC) TO ONE STAR (POOR).  </P> <P> This is Rosnes' first album as a leader, and the Vancouver-trained pianist  takes full advantage of it.  </P> <P> Her approach is mainly an extension of 1970s bop; her companions include  Branford Marsalis on two tunes and Ralph Bowen's muscular tenor on three  others. Driving solos on her own "I.A. Blues" and Cole Porter's "Everything I  Love" as well as a fluent examination of Joe Henderson's "Punjab" are  highlights. Weakening the set are Ron Carter's uninspired bass work, Rosnes'  synthesizer-and-soprano saxophone duet with Wayne Shorter, and a pretentious  attempt at a piano duet with Herbie Hancock.

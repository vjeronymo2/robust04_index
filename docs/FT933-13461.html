			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Marketing games Lights at the Treasury and SG Warburg doubtless flickered all weekend as the vendors of BT3 tried to separate the institutional sheep from the speculative goats in the professional part of the sale. The clustering of bids around 12p over the market price of BT shares suggests greater enthusiasm than there was in BT2 when fund managers kept all the interest saving associated with partly-paid shares. Still, that is more of a reflection of the outlook for BT and UK equities than the marketing effort. Overseas investors may simply view BT partly paid shares as a geared play on the UK market. The increase in allocations to UK retail holders thus looks odd since institutions were prepared to pay so much more. Given that there will be little immediate premium for retail stags to sell into, perhaps Warburg is making the job of stabilising the issue easier by keeping professional investors hungry. One troubling aspect of the BT3 saga needs sorting out before the secondary sale of the power generators next year. The Treasury, determined to get maximum value for its stake, indulged in a little self-help by twisting the Stock Exchange's arm over reporting of large trades. There are concerns over market manipulation around share offers. But that applies equally well to the government and Warburg making up the rules to suit themselves as it does to institutions trying to depress the price. A widely agreed framework for the stabilisation of issues both before and after flotations is needed. The failure to produce one promptly will leave the SIB's and the exchange's leaky ship still lower in the water.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [George Johansson report: "Declining Opposition to the EU"] </F>   [Text] EU [European Union] supporters now outnumber EU  opponents in Sweden. The figures are 39 percent for and 30  percent against, according to the latest EU poll carried out on  behalf of DAGENS INDUSTRI and SKOP [Scandinavian Opinion Polls].    This is mainly due to the decreasing number of opponents  rather than a growing number of supporters.    In January, 39 percent of Swedes thought that Sweden should  definitely or possibly join the EU. This figure, which is more  or less unchanged since November-December, confirms an earlier  indication that the negative opinion trend was reaching its  peak. Since October the number of supporters has increased by 8  percent.    The number of Swedes who think that Sweden should definitely  or possibly not join the EU, on the other hand, has fallen from  34 percent in December to 30 percent in January. The greatest  drop is among those totally opposed. The number of absolute  opponents has been falling continuously from the figure of 42  percent recorded in September.    The proportion of undecided voters increased during this  period from 26 to 31 percent. That represents a growth of 2  percent since September, not confirmed by the statistics [as  published].    The undecided continue to be crucial for the outcome of the  vote. This category would still be inclined to vote no if the  referendum were held today. The opposition would then win by 53  percent against 47. That is a 6-percent lead, compared with 23  percent in November-December and 25 percent in September.    A more positive attitude toward the EU is permeating through  all voter categories. Socialist sympathizers have taken a much  more positive attitude, with 27 percent in favor and 37 percent  against in January. The proportion of "don't knows" among  socialist sympathizers topped 75 percent in September.    In the conservative camp, those inclined to vote yes  represent the same 52-percent majority as in September.    "Support for the EU is growing among men and women, old and  young, blue- and white-collar workers, and employees in the  public and the private sector", Birgitta Hultaker of SKOP said.  <H5>  EU -- The Most Difficult Plebiscite of All Time </H5>   "Three, maybe four, important factors will determine Swedish  opinion on the EU issue from now until the voting -- and it will  be impossible to predict its final course," Soren Holmberg,  election researcher at Goteborg University, said.    The forthcoming crucial debate around the Swedish vote will  mainly depend on:    1. The ability of the parties to rally and capture their own  groups of voters. It is generally easier for people to change  their views than to switch party.    2. External events affecting Sweden, such as developments  within the EU, unrest in East Europe, etc.    3. Economic development. The EU debate has been very  materialistic so far. Favorable economic development in Sweden  between now and the referendum will give more room for other EU  issues, such as environment, equality, and peace.    4. The setup of the debate. No previous plebiscite in Sweden  (right-hand traffic, general supplementary pension, nuclear  energy), except for the one on alcohol prohibition in 1922, has  given rise to such emotional involvement among the Swedes as the  vote on EU membership.    Soren Malmberg believes that this is due to the "catchall"  nature of the EU issue.    "The EU can be linked to everything: Economy, national  security, equality, environment, industry, growth, unemployment,  peace, etc., and this makes the issue difficult and unwieldy.  It is impossible to predict how public opinion in Sweden will  evolve, especially if you consider that two parliamentary  parties -- the Social Democrats and the Center Party -- have  evaded the issues and confounded their voters for such a long  time."    The nature of the debate -- and the scope created by the  actors on the scene -- will of course depend on the first three  elements in the opinion scenario outlined by Soren Holmberg.    "The peace issue, which I see as being fundamental to the  whole concept of the EU, has not received much attention in the  debate so far. Except for a brief spate of euphoria less than  two years ago, the EU debate has hitherto focused on  materialistic issues and the economy."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An affidavit made by an individual familiar with the issue at hand is both reasonable and within the documentation parameters established by the SNPRM. The authenticity of any document proposed as evidence to support activity occurring over 21/2 years ago could be challenged by any party. Of the possible items of documentation which could be submitted, a notarized affidavit may be the least susceptible to alteration. It represents an individual's witnessed, sworn statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An affidavit could, of course, be fraudulent, and the FHWA would be reluctant to take regulatory action based solely on an affidavit without other support. In fact, however, affidavits are merely one kind of information which the FHWA has combined with other types of documentation to demonstrate the operation of vehicles that State law and/or regulation allows. In addition, section 1023(c) of the ISTEA amended 23 U.S.C. 141(b) by adding at the end the following sentence: ``Each State shall also certify that it is enforcing and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> complying with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the provisions of section 127(d) of this title and section 411(j) of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (49 U.S.C. App. 2311(j))'' (emphasis added). Additional discussion of the certification change is contained elsewhere in this document. However, for this discussion the statement means that if a State is found not to be complying with the ISTEA LCV requirements, it will be subject to Federal-aid highway funding sanctions involving millions of dollars annually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Documentation of operation of the vehicles listed in appendix C for each State was provided to the docket by the following sources.

In 1983, permits were issued to allow the operation of the above described vehicle combinations in order to conduct an over the road test of these vehicles. The State, in its comments, points out that the 1983 tests were conducted, in part, to assist the FHWA in its study of the costs and benefits of a national intercity LCV route network.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

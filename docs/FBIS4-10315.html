			<p>BFN     [Text] On 11 April, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina  met with approximately 100 Peruvian businessmen on the first day  of his official visit to Peru. The frank, open dialogue focused  on the needs, prospects, and difficulties of foreign investments  in Cuba.    Robaina expressed, in a direct manner, the situation and  difficulties that Cuba is experiencing, as well as the existing  interest in obtaining foreign investments. Robaina explained  that the investments' aim is to meet capital, technology, and  markets needs. Robaina stated that Cuba has raw materials, a  trained work force, and the infrastructure. Robaina added that  Cuba is perfectly aware of the need to create a climate of  confidence and security for foreign investors and has therefore  established the appropriate judicial framework.    Robaina praised the approximately 100 businessmen who have  already invested in Cuba, despite difficulties of all types such  as the fact that Cuba is still undergoing a learning process.  Robaina also discussed the U.S. blockade and added that  Washington is determined to stop investors from negotiating in  Cuba.    Robaina asserted that Cuba does not discriminate on the  basis  of the origin of foreign investments, but that those from Latin  America are preferred, for this area is of the same historical  and geographical background as Cuba. Robaina mentioned Cuba's  daily difficulties and efforts to get ahead in the midst of  great problems, and added: We are not interested in the surname  of our model. We only want it to be Cuban and viable.</p>

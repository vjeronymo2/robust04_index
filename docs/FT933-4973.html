			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / International Company News: Northern Telecom Northern Telecom, the equipment manufacturing affiliate of BCE of Canada and Germany's Robert Bosch have dropped a joint venture to manufacture transmission equipment, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Last March the companies announced the venture to produce equipment under the CCITT global standard. Each planned to put certain assets, technology and personnel into the project and Nortel would have gained a distribution channel for some of its equipment in Germany. At the weekend the two companies would not enlarge on a statement, saying they have 'strengthened their relationship and are co-operating in other areas of mutual interest, including several global bidding opportunities.' Analysts regarded the ending of the joint venture as a potential setback for Nortel. 'Germany was a key market in Nortel's strategy to become a leader in European telecom equipment,' said Mr Fredericks Larkin, of Bunting Warburg in Toronto. However, industry sources stressed that international market changes may have dictated the move. Nortel, in a USDollars 400m note issue filing, said it will would contend a US tax re-assessment for 1980-85, potentially requiring payment of USDollars 450m. The company said it has a strong case to contest the IRS claim.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Evode sells part of shoe business to cut debt EVODE, the adhesives, sealants and coatings company, moved to strengthen its balance sheet with the announcement yesterday that it is selling, for Pounds 11.9m, the shoe components business acquired as part of its protracted bid battle for Chamberlain Phipps in 1989. Mr Andrew Simon, chairman, said the proceeds would be put towards the group's debt which was Pounds 46m at the end of September. On a pro forma basis, Evode would have gearing of about 61 per cent after the sale, he said, compared with 78 per cent in September. The decision to sell was due to the sharp slowdown in footwear sales and the aim to focus on adhesives and coatings. The division represented about 30 per cent of the original Chamberlain business with sales of Pounds 48m and profits of Pounds 1.7m for the year to September 28. The business has been sold to Mr Dan Sullivan, a US investor, and Legal &amp; General Ventures. Some Pounds 9.7m will be paid in cash.</p>

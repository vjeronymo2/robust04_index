			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OFFICERS WALKING BEATS TO GET NEIGHBORHOOD BACK ON ITS FEET  </P> <P> For the two years that Rosa Gaspar has lived in an apartment on Orion Avenue in  Sepulveda, her world has been delineated by the locked iron gate that surrounds  her complex.  </P> <P> As much as possible, she stays inside, behind the gate that keeps the drug  dealers, prostitutes and transients out. Concerned for the safety of her  10-year-old son, she does not let the boy play outside unless she is there to  watch. She doesn't even let him take out the trash.  </P> <P> But Gaspar believes that things may be changing where she lives in the 8900  block of Orion.  </P> <P> The reason is that Los Angeles police have begun foot patrols for the first  time in the Sepulveda neighborhoods south of Nordhoff Street that include  Orion, Langdon and Columbus avenues. A 2-week-old pilot program to study the  effectiveness of foot beats in the city has placed officers on walking patrols  in the area five nights a week.  </P> <P> Gaspar, like many other residents and police officers, believes that the  patrols may be a deterrent to drug dealers, prostitutes and other problems in  the neighborhood, which is made up mostly of apartment buildings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'It Is Changing'  </P> <P> "I'm feeling more and more comfortable with the police here," Gaspar said. "I  think with the police here, it is changing."  </P> <P> Sgt. George Thomas, who coordinates the foot patrol, said the Police Department  is doing what more police agencies across the country are doing: going back to  basics.  </P> <P> "The foot beat is a tradition that is at the core of law enforcement," Thomas  said. "When you are in a patrol car, you are cut off from the people. You are  on the outside looking in. The foot beat takes away that barrier. It puts  police officers in contact with the people they serve."  </P> <P> Although a handful of drug dealers and several drug buyers and loiterers have  been arrested since the officers were put on foot in the area, Thomas said the  goal of the program is not more arrests. Police hope that their presence will  make drug dealers and prostitutes and their customers go somewhere else. In the  meantime, officers hope to improve relations with the community.  </P> <P> "We are not as interested in putting people in jail as we are in letting kids  play and ride their bikes, letting people enjoy their neighborhood without  being in danger," Thomas said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Second Beat Planned  </P> <P> The Sepulveda foot beat -- which includes two-block stretches of Orion, Langdon  and Columbus between Nordhoff and Rayen streets -- is the only such patrol in  the San Fernando Valley. Thomas said the department expects to put foot  officers on a beat covering the Pierce Park public housing complex in Pacoima  early next month.  </P> <P> In Sepulveda, six to eight officers walk the beat between 5 p.m. and midnight  Wednesday through Sunday. The officers work in pairs and take to the sidewalks  in an area where more than 800 arrests for drugs, prostitution, thefts and  gang-related crimes were made in the first six months of the year.  </P> <P> The patrol is one of 18 new foot beats in a pilot program approved by the Los  Angeles City Council. The council voted in September to implement the beats as  a means of increasing police presence in high-crime neighborhoods. The foot  beats do not entail the addition of new officers. Rather, they are being manned  by officers working on overtime shifts.  </P> <P> Although originally set for a 10-month tryout, the program was vetoed four days  after it started by Mayor Tom Bradley, who said he would support a shorter  three-month program. While the issue is being hashed out by the mayor and the  council, the Police Department has continued the patrols and expects at least  the three-month program to be approved.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Popularity Returns  </P> <P> Experts on foot patrols said cities grappling with neighborhood crime,  particularly drug problems, are increasingly turning to foot patrols to fight  the problems.  </P> <P> "Departments from Alberta to Tallahassee are doing it," New York City Police  Lt. Thomas Madden said. "It is to get back in touch with their communities."  </P> <P> Madden is assigned to the Vera Institute of Justice, a police research  organization that monitors foot patrols that it helped establish five years ago  in New York City's police precincts.  </P> <P> "The foot patrol is efficient and effective," Madden said. "It is not just a  community relations gimmick. These officers take pro-active roles in the  neighborhoods. Having them there improves quality of life conditions. The  officers are right there in the neighborhood as a physical representation of  the local government."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 5-Year Growth  </P> <P> More than 200 U. S. cities have officers on foot beats, according to the  National Neighborhood Foot Patrol Center in East Lansing, Mich.  </P> <P> "Without a doubt, it is clearly the trend in policing today," said David  Carter, a professor at Michigan State University's School of Criminal Justice,  where the center is located.  </P> <P> "The foot patrol was almost extinct," Carter said. "During the last five years  is when we have seen its growth.  </P> <P> "The contemporary foot patrol goes beyond having a cop walk a beat like we used  to have years ago. They are out there to talk to people, get to know them, to  establish a liaison between residents and their government."  </P> <P> The rise in popularity of the foot beat among police departments coincides with  the rise of neighborhood problems associated with crack cocaine, Carter said.  Crack dealers and users can quickly spread through a neighborhood, turning  entire blocks into areas of danger and decay. He said the posting of officers  on foot helps re-establish a sense of order in neighborhoods and shows  law-abiding citizens that local government cares.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Little Crime Evidence  </P> <P> On the beat on Orion on a recent night, open drug and prostitution problems  were not apparent. Graffiti on walls and dumpsters on the street hinted at  troubles, but Thomas said the police presence was acting as a deterrent.  </P> <P> Thomas and other officers were greeted warmly as they walked along the  sidewalks. They introduced themselves to adults and passed out baseball cards  to youngsters. They chased a known hooker out of a parking garage and checked  alleys for drug users. On Langdon, a teen-ager was asked how his high school  basketball team would do this year. A man known to police as a paroled drug  dealer who lives elsewhere was sternly told that he did not belong on the  street.  </P> <P> Officer John Girard has worked patrol, narcotics and vice operations around the  neighborhood for nine years. But only now is he getting the chance to work the  street on foot, to establish contacts with concerned residents. He said he is  already nurturing the start of a committee of residents and landlords. The  first meeting is scheduled Oct. 26 at a nearby church.  </P> <P> "We are going to try to develop a community strategy for dealing with the  problems of the area," Girard said. "There are a lot of good people here that  want to do something."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Baseball Cards  </P> <P> During the evening patrol, 10-year-old cousins Victor and Henry Funez rode up  to Thomas and Girard on their bikes. They hopped off and approached the men in  blue uniforms and hats. Victor timidly asked: "Do you have baseball cards?"  </P> <P> "Are you kidding?" Thomas asked back. "Of course I have baseball cards."  </P> <P> The boys were each presented with cards featuring Orel Hershiser, which  promptly brought smiles all around. For Victor, the appearance of the foot  patrol officers is something he looks forward to each night -- and not just  because of the baseball cards.  </P> <P> "I like to see them here," he said of the officers. "There are too many drug  dealers. I want the police to keep them out."  </P> <P> How long and how well police can do what the boy wants depends on whether the  foot patrols are continued by the city's politicians at the end of the pilot  program.  </P> <P> "It's like cockroaches in the kitchen," Officer Gene Ferone said one night  while on foot patrol on Columbus Avenue. "You hit them with the light and they  hit the bricks; they're gone. You turn the light out and they are going to come  back."  </P> <P> But for now, while the foot patrol is still a presence on Orion, Langdon and  Columbus, police said its effect has already been positive.  </P> <P> "The good people are coming out," Thomas said. "They are feeling safer, and  that is the name of the game."  </P></p>

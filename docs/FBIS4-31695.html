			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nedim Gendzhev, leader of the Democratic </F> Party of Justice, by Nataliya Vuchkova; place and date not given]    [Text] [Vuchkova] Dr. Gendzhev, is the Democratic Party  of Justice ready with its program and, if elections are held,  among which parties will it seek a coalition partner?    [Gendzhev] Our party will have a leftist orientation. We  can work in coalition with both the Aleksandur Stamboliyski  Bulgarian National Agrarian Union and the Bulgarian Socialist  Party [BSP], despite the fact that some people will not like  this. The party's program is social democratic in nature and  close to the BSP program. The Union of Democratic Forces, which  claims to be a democratic party, has nothing to show the people  apart from a pronounced primeval anticommunism. However, this  will not help us emerge from the economic crisis, which can only  be achieved by national consensus reached by making compromises.    If anyone analyzes the activities of the Bulgarian  Parliament  during the last two years, he will reach the conclusion that  Bulgaria has no Bulgarians who think about their state, only  anticommunists and sodomists.    [Vuchkova] Dr. Gendzhev, do you think your party will  capture votes from the electorates of the Movement for Rights  and Freedoms [DPS] and Mehmed Hodja's party?    [Gendzhev] We address ourselves to all people, regardless of  their party affiliations or official position. We want to  develop an economic program for the regions that are in the most  wretched situation. The present government is a DPS one, but  not one that represents the DPS electorate; it is a government  of Ahmed Dogan, Osman Oktay, Yunal Lyutfi, Kadir Kadir, and a  handful of others. More than a half of the electors who voted  for the DPS at the last elections will now cast their votes for  the coalition that we will form. However, one thing is clear --  namely that from now on we will not enter any coalition with the  DPS or Mehmed Hodja.    [Vuchkova] How will you react to possible accusations that  you formed a party on an ethnic basis?    [Gendzhev] One should not make such speculations if a Turk  or Muslim stands at the head of a party. I believe that, in  this case, one cannot say that our party is religiously or  ethnically based.    [Vuchkova] Would you like to comment on the recent practice  of identifying religious with ethnic features.    [Gendzhev] One cannot identify the Muslim religion with  Turkish nationality. Armenians, Bulgarians, Turks, and Romanies  may all be Muslims. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who was both a  Frenchman and a Muslim, did not identify himself as a Turk, did  he? It must be made clear that Islam is a world religion, not a  Turkish one.    A degree of Turkification may indeed be taking place in  certain regions, but the more attention you draw to a problem,  the more it comes to the forefront of public attention. When  they made the Muslims change their names and closed the mosques,  did this turn them into Bulgarians?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [A.M. report: "Solchaga Avoids Making Statement on </F> Resignation, Emphasizes `Very Good' Relations Between PSOE and  CiU"]    [Text] Carlos Solchaga, floor leader of the Socialist group  in parliament, yesterday avoided making a statement on whether  he will hand in his resignation as a PSOE [Spanish Socialist  Workers Party] official at the Congress of Deputies. On the  contrary, he alluded -- albeit indirectly -- to his intention to  carry on in his post. Nevertheless, during a lunch in which,  together with Miguel Roca of the CiU [Convergence and Union] he  presented the book Catalonia by the Year 2010,  Solchaga did not wish to talk openly, preferring to block --  without being able to conceal his discomfort -- any reference to  his resignation.    When his turn came to comment on the contents of the book,  the PSOE leader asked the other participants if they could hear  well from all the seats. On his left, from the end of the  table, a journalist commented out loud "well enough to hear a  resignation." With an annoyed expression, and facing a tense  silence, the former economy minister responded, as if he had not  heard (although it was perfectly audible): "Excuse me?" The  journalist, somewhat embarrassed, excused himself by saying "it  was just a comment," which Solchaga, in a clearly annoyed tone,  dismissed with a contemptuous "brilliant, quite brilliant."    Afterwards, his speech, which was listened to with great  anticipation, as have all his speeches since last Monday [25  April] when he placed his mandate at the executive's disposal,  was often full of praise for the CiU, and especially Miguel  Roca. He defined the PSOE's relations with the center-right  nationalist coalition as "frank and very good," and said they  were a substantial factor in achieving political governability  "at a time of tension and a time when we do not have an absolute  majority." He then sent a message that can be interpreted as an  intention to carry on in his post as the Socialist spokesman in  the Congress of Deputies. Solchaga said: "I am going to make a  political statement so that no doubt remains: I am working and  will continue to work -- with the agreement of my party -- to  ensure that these relations (with the CiU) are optimal." It is  true that at no time did he say whether he was thinking of  carrying out this task as the head of the Socialist Group or as  an ordinary rank-and-file deputy.    The praise heaped on the spokesman for the Catalan Group,  however, exceeded even that lavished on the CiU. He said that  "as long as people like Roca, and others, are around, the  political scenarios for Catalonia and Spain are likely to be  positive. And I will promote these relations without the  slightest reservation."</p>

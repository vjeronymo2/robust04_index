			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Pentagon reshapes its strategy with greater emphasis on UN COLLECTIVE security rather than the preservation of sole military superpower status should be the principal goal of US defence policy for the remaining years of this century, according to the Pentagon. A revised draft of a controversial internal policy paper leaked in February no longer states that the overriding US national security goal should be to prevent the emergence of a rival to American military hegemony. Instead, according to leaks to the New York Times and other publications of the 1994-99 Defence Planning Guidance, a prime goal should be to 'strengthen and extend the system of defence arrangements that binds democratic and like minded nations together'. While it does not preclude the formation of ad hoc coalitions, as in the Gulf war last year, it places great emphasis on the value of United Nations peacekeeping operations and regional security agreements such as Nato. The first draft had warned against 'the emergence of European-only security arrangements' among US allies. The careful leaking of the revised document appears to mark the end of a curious passage in the US defence policy debate this year and a victory of sorts for the internationalist wing of the defence establishment over its more unilateralist counterpart. It now awaits formal approval by President Bush. The original draft had drawn intense criticism at home and abroad. It had been attacked domestically as an attempt by the Pentagon to justify sustaining high levels of defence spending at a time when a a post-Cold War diversion of resources to home use was widely considered politically and socially necessary. Overseas, the first draft was interpreted as a warning to allies such as Japan and Germany not to challenge US military supremacy and to nations as different as Russia and India to hold back on any plans to develop regional military hegemony. Given the absence of any recent elaboration of Mr Bush's concept of a 'new world order', its muscular tone appeared to imply little fundamental change in US thinking in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet threat. The changes in the document were freely ascribed to the recent inputs of Dick Cheney, the defence secretary, and General Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. Both drafts were written by Paul Wolfowitz, who is close to both Mr Cheney and General Powell. The shift in geopolitical emphasis and the adoption of more moderate language in the second draft did not bring about any change in what the Pentagon considers its minimum needs.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum highest for nearly 12 months PLATINUM PRICES rose strongly again yesterday to their highest level for nearly a year. Gold followed platinum's lead and broke through the psychologically-important Dollars 350 a troy ounce barrier. Some analysts suggest platinum's recent performance has been caused by nervousness about the upheavals in South Africa, the world's biggest producer, accounting for more than 65 per cent of supply. Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at Durlacher and Co, the London stockbroker, pointed out, however, that 'most platinum buyers have seen it all before. There has been no sign of panic buying - otherwise platinum, and gold, prices would be considerably higher.' He suggested that other, non-South African factors were at work in the platinum market. 'I get the impression the producers are happy about the medium-term outlook and that they feel the price was forced down too far.' Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, suggested that platinum's price might fall back as the deadline for a general strike in South Africa, for two or three days starting on August 3, passed. But Mr Neil Carson, general manager of marketing at Johnson Matthey, the world's largest platinum marketing group, said prices should be able to hold on to present levels because supply and demand were in reasonable balance. A sudden rise in the three-month platinum leasing rates to about 5 per cent during the past few weeks indicated the tightness of physical supply, he added. Platinum touched Dollars 392.50 an ounce at one stage in London yesterday before meeting some profit-taking. It closed at Dollars 391.75 an ounce, up Dollars 4.90 on the day. Gold closed in London up Dollars 1.85 an ounce at Dollars 350.55.</p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 49ERS STRIKE BACK AT RAMS, 26-10;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: SAN FRANCISCO TAKES CONTROL WITH 16-0 LEAD. AT 5-9, L.A. IS  MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED FROM PLAYOFFS.  </P> <P> The San Francisco 49ers, Big Nickel-ed and dimed to death by the Rams only  three weeks ago, performed a little math lesson for their inferiors Monday  night in front of a national audience that is used to these 49er  teacher-student sessions.  </P> <P> One superstar quarterback plus one superstar wide receiver plus one darting  young running back plus a surging defense equals a Super Bowl contender, just  about any season you want.  </P> <P> Even subtracting 49er all-pro safety Ronnie Lott, all that added up to a 26-10  defeat for the Rams (5-9) and the mathematical end to any of their far-fetched  playoff hopes.  </P> <P> The team that came into the preseason called "the Second-Best Team in Football"  probably won't even be the second-best team that doesn't make the playoffs this  season, while the best team in football keeps on besting everybody. And the  Rams will second that proclamation.  </P> <P> "They just show you what championship-level is," Ram Coach John Robinson said  of the 49ers. "They cover for an injured player very well."  </P> <P> The Rams, after stopping the 49ers at Candlestick Park with an imaginative  four-safety "Big Nickel" defensive scheme, were just another bump on the road  Monday night. And the 49ers do love the road -- this victory made it 17 in a  row on the road and nine of their last 10 in Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> You can confuse the 13-1 49ers once, spoil their shot at a perfect season with  defensive tricks and gadgets and big plays, but Joe Montana and Jerry Rice and  all the rest aren't about to be swept. They do their own sweeping.  </P> <P> Monday night marked Montana's ninth consecutive victory in Anaheim, his own  personal Disneyland.  </P> <P> This time the difference was two big 49er offensive plays -- a 60-yard scoring  pass from Montana to Rice and a 74-yard burst by rookie runner Dexter Carter --  and a relentless defense that separated the NFL's best from one of its most  disappointing.  </P> <P> Carter's run was the longest touchdown run in the NFC this season. And it was  an almost perfect duplication of last week's game-turning 67-yard dash around  the left side by New Orleans runner Gill Fenerty as Ram safety Vince Newsome  again took the wrong angle on the runner.  </P> <P> "Last time we played them, they didn't get the big plays," Robinson said.  "Their two big plays in the game tonight were pretty much the difference."  </P> <P> The Rams got no game-shaking big plays of their own against a scrappy 49er  defense that was missing a Lott but not missing a beat. Ram quarterback Jim  Everett completed 17 of his 35 passes for 232 yards and was intercepted twice,  and the Rams managed only 53 rushing yards in 19 attempts.  </P> <P> Conversely, the 49ers piled up 173 rushing yards in 36 tries -- thanks mainly  to Carter's 124 yards in 13 carries. The Rams dared the 49ers to run again,  using variations of six-back and seven-back defensive sets, but not only did  the 49ers run, Montana found open passing lanes where last meeting he did not.  </P> <P> After Carter blew past the Rams' defense early in the fourth quarter to  transform a 19-10 game into a 26-10 laugher, the Rams' season was over, with  two meaningless games left.  </P> <P> But the Rams, who have been pounded in their three nationally televised night  games this season and still have one left, said they will charge on this  season.  </P> <P> "I always thought we'd dig ourselves out of the hole, but we never did," tackle  Jackie Slater said. "The good thing about team sports is that, at times like  this, you can find a bright side. I can look at my teammates, look them in the  eye, and see no quit there."  </P> <P> They may not have quit, but the Rams were pushed around by the 49ers from the  opening kickoff until the final gun. The Rams did not force the 49ers to punt  until less than two minutes remained in the third quarter, and Everett didn't  complete his second pass of the night until the game was well into the second  quarter.  </P> <P> The 49ers started the scoring on their second possession, using their patented  short-passing game to march for more than five minutes down to the Rams'  five-yard before settling for Mike Cofer's 23-yard field goal. Montana  completed five straight at one point, dinking and dunking to Rice and John  Taylor on quick hits over the middle and his backs flying out to the flats.  </P> <P> On their next possession, the 49ers swallowed up 9:03 in 15 plays, scoring on  fullback Tom Rathman's one-yard dive on fourth and goal. The 49ers converted  three third downs and the one fourth-down try on the drive, but failed on the  extra-point attempt when the snap was low and two 49ers ran into each other  vying for holder Barry Helton's pass. That made it 9-0.  </P> <P> After a three-and-out Ram possession, the 49ers did it the quick way: a 60-yard  pass to Rice streaking down the left sideline past Jerry Gray and Anthony  Newman for a 16-0 lead.  </P> <P> The Rams mustered up a challenge as the half ticked down, moving 78 yards on a  long drive of their own. Rookie wide receiver Derrick Faison caught the first  touchdown pass of his NFL career to cap the drive, a perfectly thrown  eight-yard lob by Everett over cornerback Darryl Pollard, closing the score to  16-7.  </P> <P> Everett, after starting out one for eight, completed four of his five passes on  the drive, for 71 yards.  </P> <P> "I think their defense turned it up a notch, and we just couldn't score,"  Robinson said. "We just couldn't sustain it enough."  </P> <P> With the 49ers' defense harrying Everett into hurried throws and with the  49ers' secondary -- led by free safety Dave Waymer and cornerback Don Griffin  -- swarming all over the timing patterns the Rams usually hit to Henry Ellard  and Flipper Anderson with ease, the Rams' defense was under intense pressure to  stuff the 49ers' offense. Too much pressure.  </P> <P> Then the Rams started the second half by fumbling away a snap on the second  play of the third quarter to set up Cofer's second field goal of the night, a  31-yarder to push the 49ers' lead to 19-7.  </P> <P> The Rams came back with Lansford's chip shot field goal to narrow it to 19-10  late in the third, but Carter's gallop came just as the final period began.  </P> <P> When did it hit the Rams that they were absolutely out of the playoffs?  </P> <P> "When we walked in here right after the game and looked at each other," Pete  Holohan said.  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> Ram inside linebacker Frank Stams suffered a right knee sprain in the first  quarter and did not play after returning for one play. He will be examined this  morning for possible cartilage damage. Guard Tom Newberry sprained his left  ankle in the first half and rookie Bern Brostek played at his spot the rest of  the way. Safety Vince Newsome suffered a left shoulder contusion. . . .  Fumble-prone tailback Cleveland Gary did not get into the game until eight  minutes remained in the third quarter, carried three times for 11 yards, caught  two passes and did not fumble. Gaston Green started in his place and gained 34  yards in 12 carries. Gary had no comment when asked about his playing time.  </P> <P> Although the Rams were logically thrust from the playoff race after last  month's loss to the Dallas Cowboys, Monday night's loss put the mathematical  finishing touches on the season. The best the Rams can finish is 7-9, which  would at best tie them with the Dallas Cowboys. Because the Rams lost their  game against the Cowboys and also cannot finish with a better conference record  than Dallas, the Rams cannot gain the one NFC wild-card berth still up for  grabs.  </P> <P> The Rams also clinched their first losing record under John Robinson since  1987, and their first losing record in a non-strike season in Robinson's eight  years as coach.  </P></p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Bonds: D-Mark sector absorbs heavy flow THE D-Mark sector is absorbing a heavy flow of paper as investors lock in historically high coupon levels on the expectation that rates are set to fall. The market absorbed more than DM2bn of fresh supply last week, and new issues totalling in excess of DM2.5bn, including a further DM500m yesterday, have been launched so far this week. Yesterday, Saskatchewan, the Canadian province, launched a DM300m seven-year offering via CSFB Effectenwave of enthusiasm for Quebec's DM500m 10-year deal, which has performed strongly relative to the underlying Bund market. However, the Saskatchewan deal met rather less demand, trading at a discount to co-managers' fees. Two other offerings, each totalling DM100m, were targetted at retail investors. Teollisuuden Voima, a Finnish nuclear power company, brought a seven-year offering via Dresdner Bank and Europaische Hypotekenbank also launched a seven-year deal. In the dollar sector, the US' General Electric Capital Corporation launched a Dollars 200m four-year deal, via Kidder Peabody. The deal was considered aggressively priced, but the name is well liked by Swiss retail investors.</p>

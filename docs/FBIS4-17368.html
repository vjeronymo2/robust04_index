			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Styazhkin] </F>   [Text] Pyatigorsk, Stavropol Territory, April 24 TASS --  "We insist that the president, the government and the Federal  Assembly of Russia immediately take measures to adjust taxation  policy, streamline managerial bureaucracy, resolutely curb crime  and ensure strict compliance with laws", said a statement issued  here by participants in a visiting session of the Union of  Entrepreneurs and Lease-Holders of the Russian Federation.    The members of the union drew attention to the urgent  necessity to increase efforts to combat crime also because, in  their view, a large proportion of the population come to view  entrepereneurs -- the main taxpayers -- as a mafia-like corrupt  set.    "Democracy means a strong authority, not anarchy". The  entrepreneurs want to see a realistic transition from intentions  to carry on reforms to specific actions, the statement  emphasised.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / UN's Somalia military role attacked United Nations troops had been 'a little more trigger-happy than they should have been' during Operation Restore Hope, the peace-enforcing operation in Somalia, a UN envoy to the country said yesterday. Mr Michael Harper, director of the United Nations Association UK, said on his return from a Unicef-funded mission to Somalia that the UN had 'come unstuck at the military level'. The humanitarian effort had been largely successful, but the military operation had failed to achieve its aim of disarming the Somali warlords, and had alienated the Somali people. He criticised the role of the US soldiers in Somalia, saying that 'for the past six months, the Americans have been looking after the Americans,' seeking to minimise casualties. He would recommend to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, that there 'should never be a UN military presence and a unilateral non-UN international military presence, be it the US or anyone else, working simultaneously.' His criticisms indicate the degree to which the operation has damped UN peace-enforcing ambitions. He acknowledged Amnesty International's allegations of human rights abuses by UN personnel, saying he suspected they were 'basically founded'. He stressed the absence of military wisdom in New York combined with disorganisation in Somalia. 'The individual national units ..tended to operate in their own way and decide which bits of the (UN) mandate they would or would not implement.' Mr Harper's attack came amid allegations of a cover-up of a report on the massacre in June last year of 23 Pakistani soldiers serving as part of the UN forces. The UN-commissioned inquiry has never been released.</p>

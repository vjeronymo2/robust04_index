			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: Dieter still wants Mannesmann post Mannesmann, the big German industrial group, said its management board chairman Mr Werner Dieter was still campaigning for a post on the supervisory board, but had withdrawn his bid to be group chairman, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. He would not run for supervisory board chairman until an investigation into allegations of fraud against him was over. 'Mr Dieter has informed the supervisory board that in the event of his election to the supervisory board he would not be available as the board's chairman as long as there is no result of the special investigation,' Mannesmann said. Shareholders will elect supervisory board members at the annual general meeting tomorrow. Landis &amp; Gyr, the electrical engineering group, said it was reorganising its two Building Control and Energy Management product divisions into three customer-oriented market segments, Reuter reports. Landis said the new divisions will be known as Utilities, Commercial Buildings and Residential Buildings. The creation of a market segments organisation is a consequence of Landis' strategic direction of becoming stronger oriented toward end-user markets.</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / International Company News: Higher costs restrict ITC Launch expenses of low-cost cigarette brands and an oilseeds business decline restricted sales and profit growth of India's biggest tobacco company, ITC, Reuter reports from Bombay. ITC reported an 11 per cent increase in gross sales to Rs22.77bn (Dollars 726m) and a 30 per cent rise in net profit to Rs1.16bn for the half year to September 30 but the earnings increase was modest compared with the general trend of many companies posting more than 100 per cent rises for the half year, analysts said. 'It is a little disappointing for a market which is used to better results from ITC,' said one. 'They focused on high volume sales of low cost brands in rural India. This is a good strategy in the long run, but marketing expenses eroded margins.' ITC, which is 31.5 per cent owned by BAT Industries of the UK, recorded a 6.4 per cent increase in cigarette sales in value terms after several years of stagnant growth. Cigarettes contribute to more than 60 per cent of ITC's sales.</p>

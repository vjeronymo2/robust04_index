			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Nato Summit: US revives Bosnia air strikes threat US President Bill Clinton warned European allies yesterday that the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation must be ready to carry out threats of military action in Bosnia or risk the credibility of the alliance. 'If the situation does not improve, the alliance must be prepared to act,' he said on the opening day of the Nato summit. However, he later made clear there was no question of an immediate decision to launch air strikes. He told other Nato leaders that threats of action 'cannot be seen as mere rhetoric'. Those who attacked the Bosnian capital Sarajevo must understand that Nato was serious, he said. Arguments over Bosnia threatened to undermine the image of renewed purpose which Nato sought to project at the summit, primarily through the forging of new links with former enemies in central and eastern Europe. At a press conference, Mr Clinton said Nato's opening to the east, less than three years after the disbandment of the Warsaw pact, was the real issue of the day. The 16 leaders yesterday launched their Partnership for Peace project inviting former Warsaw pact countries, including Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union, to negotiate military ties. The plan is a compromise which holds out the prospect of eventual membership for some former communist countries while acknowledging the opposition of Russian hardliners who fear encirclement by Nato. The alliance hopes eastern European partners will join in task forces for regional conflicts. The summit is also due to approve a new command structure designed to help Nato deal more effectively with crises such as Bosnia. Last night allied leaders met for in-depth discussions on Bosnia and possible use of air-strikes to halt the fighting between Serbs, Croats and Moslems and ensure that United Nations troops carry out relief missions. But even before the evening talks, divisions resurfaced among allies. Canada expressed reservations about the risks of military action, including possible reprisals against their troops serving with the UN. Mr Andre Ouellet, Canadian foreign minister, told reporters: 'An air strike might solve a minor circumstantial problem but could create a number of other difficulties and make our troops be perceived as belligerents.' Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign minister, warned that any action would have to be considered carefully but said the threat of air strikes - which was first made last year - 'might well be implemented'. Late last night, in what appeared to be a shift in the UK stance, Reuters news agency said Britain was in favour of threatening Serbian forces with limited air strikes unless the airport in Tuzla, north-east Bosnia, was reopened for aid deliveries and the road to Srebrenica, a Moslem enclave, was freed for UN troops. France was also reported to be in favour. Laura Silber adds from Belgrade: Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday reacted angrily to Nato warnings of air strikes against Serb targets ringing Sarajevo, warning that any such decision would jeopardise talks on Bosnia's partition due to be held later this month.</p>

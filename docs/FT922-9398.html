			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: Chiron wins FDA approval for kidney cancer drug CHIRON, the US biotechnology company, has received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to market Interleukin-2, a long-awaited treatment for aggressive kidney cancer. The approval marks the end of an eight-year struggle to bring to the US market what had widely been regarded as one of the most promising products of the US biotechnology industry. Interleukin-2, to be sold under the brand name Proleukin, was developed by Cetus, a biotechnology concern acquired by Chiron last year after the long and expensive approval process drained Cetus's resources. Proleukin, which harnesses the power of the body's immune system to attack cancer cells, was originally hailed as a breakthrough in cancer therapy. However in clinical trials the drug was found to benefit only a minority of patients and to have severe side effects. Proleukin shrank tumors in about 15 per cent of patients, with 4 per cent achieving complete remission, but another 4 per cent died from side effects of the drug. However, the trial results were better than for those patients receiving conventional chemotherapy treatment, of whom only about 5 per cent survived. Chiron's share price rose sharply on Monday, gaining Dollars 6 1/2 to close at Dollars 48 1/4 in anticipation of the approval. Chiron's stock fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 46 5/8 at close of trade yesterday.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Kleinwort Benson rejects US allegations by PaineWebber THE UK investment bank Kleinwort Benson defended itself yesterday against allegations that several new senior officers at its US asset management affiliate conspired to steal the core of a fixed income asset management department run by PaineWebber, the Wall Street securities house. In announcing the appointment of Mr Stephen Canter as executive chairman and chief executive officer and Mr Emad Zikry as president and chief investment officer of its New York-based subsidiary Kleinwort Benson International Investment, the UK bank denied that the two men, who until last week were employed at the PaineWebber unit Mitchell Hutchins Institutional Investors, had solicited employees or clients of MHII, or had denigrated MHII, while still at that company. Angered by the defections, PaineWebber yesterday filed a civil lawsuit in New York against three former MHII executives and Kleinwort's US affiliate. In the suit, PaineWebber alleges that Mr Canter and Mr Zikry, along with Mr Thomas Goepfert, another senior MHII officer who left to join Kleinwort, recruited other MHII employees while still at the firm and used confidential and proprietary client information, including investment objectives and fee structures, to solicit MHII clients. PaineWebber also says that the executives undertook a mass solicitation of MHII clients one day after they resigned from MHII, and persuaded other MHII staff to leave the firm and join Kleinwort. In London late yesterday the UK bank said that it had not yet received notification of the lawsuit. But Mr Lesley Knox, chairman of Kleinwort's US money management subsidiary, said the accusations outlined in press reports of the impending legal action were 'totally unfounded'. In New York meanwhile, PaineWebber was playing down the significance of the staff departures at MHII - in total, 10 people left the firm - while still angrily decrying the actions of the three executives who left for Kleinwort. Ms Joyce Fensterstock, president of PaineWebber's mutual fund unit and the executive who has taken over as president of MHII, said that only one client had removed its account from the firm because of the uncertainty surrounding the defections. She was confident the client would return, but said she may lose others: 'We will lose some accounts because when there's this kind of upheaval . . . some people use it as an excuse to move their money.' PaineWebber insisted that the financial impact of the defections would be minimal. The fixed income unit where the departed executives worked manages Dollars 4bn of assets and generated revenues of almost Dollars 8m last year, out of a total of more than Dollars 300m in recurring fee revenues generated at the PaineWebber group.</p>

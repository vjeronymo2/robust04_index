			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chen Daxiong (7115 1129 7160): "Present Improper </F> Consumption by Some Peasants and Their Mental Attitudes"]    [Excerpts] Improper consumption presently observed among  some peasants manifests itself mainly in the following ways:    Ostentatious and extravagant displays at marriages and  funerals Using up the entire family savings accumulated  over years, and even borrowing money, in order to stage big  shows at weddings or funerals is a rather common occurrence in  the rural areas. A questionnaire-survey of 100 peasant  households in the rural districts of Leping City in Jiangxi  Province revealed that generally 8,000 to 10,000 yuan are spent  on a wedding, and on funerals money is spent as if it were  water, and any burial will be undertaken only after consuming  several thousand jin of grain and slaughtering one or two pigs.  No wonder that some people say: "Today one cannot afford to  marry, and cannot afford to die."    Vying with each other in generosity when it comes to  entertaining guests or presenting gifts As found out in  Yongxiu County in Jiangxi Province, there are presently as many  as somewhat over 40 reasons in the rural areas for entertaining  guests or presenting gifts, and there is an increasing rage to  purposely ingratiate oneself into the favors of others. The  sample investigation of 70 peasant households in Yongxiu County  revealed that in 1993 the average per capita expenditure on  gifts was as high as 125 yuan, which amounted to 14.7 percent of  a peasant's cash income. In Jiangxi Province in 1992, the  average per capita cash expenditure on gifts was 39.18 yuan,  which amounted to 10.6 percent of the total personal cash  consumption, an increase of 11.1 percent, compared to 1991.    Rampancy of feudal superstitious activities  Alarmingly large amounts are spent on such utterly foolish items  of consumption as building ancestral temples, compiling family  genealogies, sculpturing Buddha statues, building earth god  temples, burning incense and Buddha worship, engaging spirits to  drive out evil ghosts, and fortune telling and logomancy. To get  into the family genealogy each male has to pay 50 to 100 yuan,  for the ancestral temple each household is assessed several  hundred yuan, even more money has to be spent on masses for the  souls of the deceased, a Taoist priest has to be paid somewhat  over 150 yuan, to which must be added his food and drink, spirit  money, candles, and firecrackers, raising the expenses to over  1,000 yuan. It is even more absurd that in some instances a tomb  is built before a person's death. In Lingang Village within  Leping City, long rows of tombs line both sides of the highway,  all built with concrete tops and marble tablets, at an  expenditure of altogether over 3,000 yuan.    Houses are built in a grandiose way If the  peasants have money to do so, one cannot reproach them for  wanting to improve their housing conditions. The problem is only  that some peasants are in too much of a hurry to build houses  just as soon as their living conditions have improved, or they  take on new debts even before old debts had been repaid. Some  blindly strive for a higher status and expend on a consumption  for which they are not yet ready.    Some peasants go very much the wrong way in their  consumption  and are thereby the cause of huge economic wastage. On the other  hand, they show themselves extremely stingy when it comes to  spending on what is necessary, rational, and beneficial. For  instance, they are seldom ready to spend money, and particularly  larger sums of money, on such activities as intellectual  investments, reproductive input, the development of public  welfare enterprises, and on the development of new things useful  to improve their livelihood or economic condition.    Analyzing how some peasants get to these improper ways of  consumption, we find that they are mainly motivated by the  following mental attitudes:    Ostentation of wealth and hedonistic attitude Some  people believe that as long as one lives in this world one might  as well live more comfortably and dignifiedly. On certain  special occasions they will therefore invite in all their  relatives, friends, and neighbors and on other occasions show  themselves generous in sending gifts. They will take these  opportunities to show off their wealth, go in for ostentation  and extravagance, vie with each other in style, and all this to  gain a certain amount of "face."    Feeling obliged to reciprocate Having been invited  or received gifts, one always feels under social obligation to  the other parties, therefore at a suitable opportunity will have  to also feast them or send gifts to reciprocate.    The compensation mentality The idea: We all  contributed our share when someone else was in need, now that an  opportune moment has come for us, we also want those other  parties return the favors, so that we will get back what we had  laid out for them.    The "self-enrichment mentality" People who have  this mentality will purposely leak out information about certain  events in their families and make them evident to as large an  audience as possible.    The "cannot-help-it" mentality Being compelled by  public opinion and pressured by circumstances. Having been  feasted and having received presents, how can one pretend to be  deaf and dumb? One simply has no alternative but to do something  about it. When it comes to extravagant outlays for ancestor  worship or superstitious activities, people are afraid to be  called disrespectful of their ancestors, and even more afraid  that their names will be struck from the "clan register," if  they don't join clan activities.    The "material benefits" syndrome Many peasants,  affected by the commodity economy around them, feel that rather  than spending money on further schooling of their children, they  better have them leave school earlier, come home, and help earn  money, thus getting some "material benefits" out of them.    Conservatism and fear of possible changes Some  people believe after several decades of farming, relying on  one's long-practiced skills and experiences will leave one not  too far off. In particular, some farmers will not spend money to  improve the soil or invest in afforestation for fear policy may  change. They worry that one day an official letter may come  ordering "readjustment," and "readjustment" it will have to be,  or ordering "confiscation," and "confiscation" it will have to  be. As the saying is, how can the arm overcome the strength of  the thigh.    The "bad-conscience" syndrome Some people are very  much afraid that if they would expend money or effort on public  enterprises, others would get more out of it than they  themselves. They have therefore no desire to get involved, and  if someone would want them to contribute money or labor to  anything labeled "public," they would be out of sight as fast as  possible.</p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Survey of Malaysia (10): Factories' Achilles heel - Immigrants fail to ease skilled labour shortage The colourful banners fluttering outside what seems like every other Malaysian factory signify an increasingly rare phenomenon: a seller's market for labour. The banners invite passers-by to walk-in interviews for a wide range of production jobs, with no previous experience required. The lack of Malaysians taking up the invitations is, however, stoking up wage-pressure and intensifying the debate about how the country shifts from assembly-based operations - premised on cheap labour  - to a high wage, high value-added, manufacturing base. The country has reached full employment (unemployment this year will be below 3 per cent of the 8m workforce) six years before planned, with jobs growth outstripping labour force growth 3.2 per cent to 2.8 per cent since 1988. The difficulty of finding workers is a constant refrain of Malaysian businessmen. And when workers are found they often have that bothersome self-confidence associated with full employment. 'When they come it is not us interviewing them it is them inteviewing us about fringe benefits,' says an exasperated Chinese business leader. Not surprisingly, wages have been rising rapidly although there is some dispute about how rapidly. In the electronics sector, official surveys show wages rising at over 10 per cent per year, while inflation hovers around 4 per cent. But electronics workers are an elite benefiting from big productivity increases and booming demand in the mainly foreign owned plants. They comfortably top the monthly average earnings table on MDollars 886, ahead of furniture workers. On some estimates average monthly earnings for the 200,000 electronics workers are over MDollars 1,000. The picture for the economy as a whole is less dramatic with the Manpower Department estimating that earnings increased by only 5 per cent in the economy in 1993, compared with 8.7 per cent in 1992. But it is not clear whether those figures capture the growing array of fringe benefits or the 10 per cent annual seniority increments usually built into collective agreements. Collective bargaining only covers about 20 per cent of the workforce, but the figure is closer to 50 per cent in the manufacturing sector which has just overtaken agriculture, forestry and fishing as the biggest category of employment, now covering about 25 per cent of the working population. Nevertheless, Malaysia's rather dispirited trade unions cannot claim much of the credit for the full-employment generated wage pressure. One measure of that pressure is the dramatic rise in job-hopping. Mr O K Lee of the northern branch of the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers, says annual labour turnover is now about 45 per cent in Penang. In response to the tight labour market employers have been allowed to bring in more foreign workers - mainly from Indonesia and Bangladesh - usually on five year contracts. This has helped to check wage pressure, especially in the rubber plantations and in construction where the 1.5m official immigrant workers are strongest. But neither immigrant workers nor the latest government initiative to restrain wage increases, expected in next year's budget, can alter the fact that Malaysia is no longer a cheap labour economy. The World Bank classifies Malaysia as an upper middle income country - and therefore no longer a developing country - and its GDP per capita is nearly Dollars 8,000 (using purchasing power parity) just above Greece, the poorest European Union country. For that reason some industrialists view the future in rather apocalyptic terms. 'This situation is a trap. We cannot stand-still because we will gradually lose more and more labour intensive foreign investment to lower cost countries in the region. Yet we cannot move forward at the speed required because we do not have a sufficiently educated workforce,' says a businessman, who refuses to be named. The argument, which quickly becomes a political one (hence the anonymity), runs like this: Malaysia inherited from Britain an elitist, arts-inclined, higher education system and very little technical or vocational training infrastructure. This weakness was, however, compounded by the quota system designed to promote the advance of the ethnic Malays and the compulsory use of Malay as the language of instruction at all levels, both introduced in the early 1970s. The quality and quantity of the education provided in Malaysia by seven universities, two colleges and five polytechnics, at a total annual cost of about MDollars 1bn, has thus been inadequate. The result has been about 60,000 Malaysians studying abroad at any one time (many of them never returning), one of the lowest per capita ratios of science and engineering graduates in the region (with 63 per cent of graduates preferring arts subjects), and only 7 per cent of Malaysians in the 20-24 age group in tertiary education compared with 28 per cent in the Philippines and 16 per cent in Thailand. As a result, research and development claims only 0.8 per cent of GDP (and most of that in agriculture) compared with 4.7 per cent in Japan and 4.3 per cent in Germany. How much de-regulation to improve standards is achievable without upsetting the delicate ethnic balance which underpins the country's stability? The answer appears to be quite a lot. The prime minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, has relaxed the rules on using English, encouraged 'twinning' with Western universities, and promoted a big expansion in private colleges. More broadly, the government machine, like the Singaporean machine 15 years ago, is starting to focus single-mindedly on the transition to a high value-added economy. Mr Lay Ah Oon, of the Malaysia Industrial Development Authority, says that labour intensive projects from foreign investors are now being turned away, some companies are even being encouraged to relocate in Thailand or China, and there is much greater emphasis on high local content. This policy emphasis is already making a mark. For every MDollars 1m of investment approved by MIDA last year seven jobs were generated compared with 14 jobs in 1989. There is some patchy evidence of more sophisticated manufacturing techniques and more research and development being done in Malaysia, backed by generous R&amp;D grants and tax breaks. To improve vocational and technical training a levy system was established last year under which all manufacturing companies with more than 50 employees have to pay 1 per cent of their wage bill to the Human Resource Development Fund (a total of MDollars 61m last year) which then subsidises in-company training. Also, the government plans to build a further seven polytechnics by the year 2000 and is aiming to double to 8,000 the number of annual science and technology graduates. Even before it starts producing the workers required by a high value-added economy, Malaysia will remain more attractive than the pessimists concede. Labour may be more expensive than some other countries in the region but Malaysia has reasonable infrastructure, good basic education and widespread use of English. Nonetheless, even some of the optimists concede that its slow recognition of the need to upgrade means that the country still faces a difficult decade of transition.</p>

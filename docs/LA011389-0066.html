			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TRAFFIC OFFICIALS SEEK TO BAN SKATERS FROM SEPULVEDA BASIN BRIDGES  </P> <P> Los Angeles traffic officials want to put the brakes on roller skaters and  skateboarders who use two bridges in the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area.  </P> <P> City transportation officials have concluded that the two bridges, though safe  for bicyclists and joggers, are unsafe for roller skaters and skateboarders,  and have urged the City Council to prohibit such use.  </P> <P> In response, the council's Transportation and Traffic Committee recommended  Thursday that the council give the Department of Transportation authority to  regulate bicycling, roller-skating and skateboarding when it considers such  uses to be unsafe.  </P> <P> The bridges over the Los Angeles River -- one on Balboa Boulevard and the other  on Burbank Boulevard -- contain metal plates designed to slide as the bridges  expand and contract because of temperature changes, according to a Department  of Transportation report to the committee.  </P> <P> Transportation officials were unaware of any serious injuries to roller skaters  or skateboarders on the bridges.  </P> <P> Though barred from riding across the bridge, roller skaters and skateboarders  can use the sidewalk in the rest of the basin, officials said.  </P></p>

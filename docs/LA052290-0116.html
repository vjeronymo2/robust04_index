			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUD OFFICIAL TO HEAD BAILOUT AGENCY'S BOARD  </P> <P> Peter H. Monroe, a Housing and Urban Development official and former Florida  developer, was appointed president of the Resolution Trust Corp.'s Oversight  Board, a key policy-making agency in the thrift cleanup effort, the agency said  Monday.  </P> <P> Monroe, 46, whose appointment takes effect June 11, succeeds William Taylor,  who has been acting head of the agency since February, when former Oversight  Board President Daniel Kearney abruptly resigned in a dispute with Bush  Administration officials.  </P> <P> Taylor, who will return to his job as the Federal Reserve Board's top banking  regulator, was recently mentioned by President Bush as a possible successor to  L. William Seidman as chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  </P> <P> Monroe has been HUD's general deputy assistant secretary and deputy  commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration for the past year. Before  joining HUD, he was president of Rutenberg Commercial Developers in Clearwater,  Fla., where he has held various positions since 1978.  </P> <P> "Peter Monroe's extensive experience in real estate and finance make him an  excellent choice to assume this critical leadership role at the Oversight  Board," said Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who chairs the Oversight  Board.  </P> <P> The Oversight Board's other four members include Federal Reserve Chairman Alan  Greenspan and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp.  </P> <P> Kemp said Monroe has had a key role in reforming HUD's insured and assisted  housing programs, which were plagued by influence-peddling and other scandals  during the Reagan Administration. Monroe, a native of Grosse Pointe, Mich., is  also a lawyer.  </P> <P> The Oversight Board acts as the voice of the Bush Administration in determining  policy for the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency created last summer to  dispose of hundreds of insolvent savings and loans.  </P> <P> The RTC is operating more than 300 other insolvent institutions and has  liquidated, sold or transferred the federally insured deposits of 110 other  dead thrifts.  </P></p>

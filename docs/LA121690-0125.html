			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TIES THAT BIND  </P> <P> Supervisor John MacDonald made a rather incredible admission at the board  meeting Dec. 4 when he stated he had previously made a commitment not to site a  landfill at Merriam Mountain while he was a member of the Oceanside City  Council in 1982.  </P> <P> This admission calls into question the integrity of the selection process.  </P> <P> Are there other sites that were rejected, not because they were inappropriate,  but because of undisclosed political commitments previously made?  </P> <P> Shouldn't Supervisor MacDonald now disqualify himself from any discussion of  the Merriam Mountain sites in the upcoming months?  </P> <P> Has Supervisor MacDonald's previously unknown commitment caused him to continue  to consider the Aspen Road site rather than look at a potentially more  appropriate site because of a political deal?  </P> <P> MICHAEL A. PORTIGAL, Temecula  </P></p>

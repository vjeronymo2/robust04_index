			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Wicked Scheme of Dishonest Force in Slandering Ill of </F> Confederacy Formula in View of Yemen Situation" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- A NODONG SINMUN analyst  today hits out at the Japanese reactionaries and the South  Korean puppets for speaking ill of the DPRK's proposal for  reunification through a confederacy in view of the current Yemen  situation.    In an article on the civil war in Yemen the Japanese SANKEI  SHIMBUN wrote that on the Korean peninsula, too, a confederacy  in which the North and the South are supposed to be reunified  without political integration while leaving their systems as  they are, is unstable and it may lead to a war. And the South  Korean newspaper CHOSUN ILBO reported that reunification through  a confederacy is as good as promising a bloodlet through a civil  war later.    These arguments of some Japanese and South Korean media are  a  sinister jargon to defend the sophism of the separatists within  and without, create obstacles in the way of Korea's  reunification and incite division and confrontation, the news  analyst says, and goes on:    The cause of the civil war in Yemen rather testifies more  clearly to the validity and reasonableness of the DPRK's  confederacy formula.    The confederacy formula calls for the establishment of a  national unified state on the basis of patriotism and the idea  of national independence and on the principle of promoting  co-existence, co- prosperity and common interests.    It provides an institutional guarantee of fairly  distributing  the functions and authority of the confederal government and  regional governments and enabling the political forces  participating in them to exercise equal rights, such as  establishing above the regional governments a unified national  government consisting of an equal number of people from both  sides and the North and the South running it on a rotatory basis.    It also envisages organizing a United National Army through  a  drastic reduction of the armies of the North and the South and  their amalgamation and placing it under the unified command of  the confederal government, thus providing a military arrangement  so that the fear of invasion from both South and North and the  ideas of prevailing over communism and communization may be  dispelled and a durable peace be preserved.    The proposal of achieving national reunification through a  confederacy on the basis of one nation, one state, two systems  and two governments is the most just and feasible programme  which makes it possible to achieve the reunification of the  country independently and peacefully at the earliest possible  date without neither side conquering the other or being  conquered under the conditions where different ideas and systems  exist in the North and the South of Korea.    The process of reunification in Yemen is fundamentally  different from DPRK-proposed reunification through a confederacy  in the principles, ways and content of reunification. It is  motivated by their sinister political aim that they are speaking  ill of the DPRK's confederacy formula by connecting it with the  incident in Yemen in a far-fetched manner, without so much as a  study of it.    The Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean puppets have  desperately tried to block peace and reunification of the Korean  peninsula, objecting to the DPRK's proposal for reunification  through a confederacy, in order to perpetuate the division of  Korea. The slander of some Japanese and South Korean media on  the DPRK's reunification proposal represents the real intention  of the dishonest force seeking to perpetuate the division.    It is a disgraceful behavior like tarnishing one's own image  by himself for the press which regards justice and truth as what  keeps it alive to play into the hands of the separatists opposed  to peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula.</p>

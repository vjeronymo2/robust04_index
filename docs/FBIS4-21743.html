			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The brother leader of the revolution received  leaders of the Palestinian alliance forces: the Popular Front  for the Liberation of Palestine, the Democratic Front for the  Liberation of Palestine, the Islamic Jihad Movement, Fatah  Movement-Intifadah, the Palestinian Liberation Front, the  Palestinian Front for the Popular Struggle, the Palestinian  Communist and Revolutionary Party, the Vanguards of the  Palestinian Liberation Party, the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine-General Command, and the Islamic  Resistance Movement -- Hamas.    The Palestinian alliance forces have issued a statement in  which they stressed that their meeting with the brother leader  of the revolution falls within an awareness of the historic  responsibility shouldered by the pan-Arab forces that are  resisting the plans of submission and Zionist dominion. Within  this framework, developments on the Arab and international  arenas were discussed, in particular developments related to  occupied Palestine in the aftermath of the massacres that are  being committed by the Zionist enemy against the Palestinian  people, the latest of which is the sacred Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre.    The statement reiterated the rejection of the Palestinian  people and its revolutionary and pan-Arab forces of the unjust  and unfair measures that are imposed against the Great  Jamahiriyah by the so-called UN Security Council. [passage  omitted]    ``We do not practice terrorism, and we do not target unarmed  innocents, as they do, but we seek freedom, which is guaranteed  by all laws and divine codes and confirmed by human rights  conventions.''

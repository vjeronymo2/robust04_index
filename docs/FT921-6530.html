			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: CP programme goes from strength to strength - The first anniversary of a rapidly-expanding German market LAST week, an important anniversary was celebrated in the German financial markets - it was a year since Daimler Benz launched Germany's first commercial paper (CP) programme. Since that first DM1.5bn (Dollars 937m) programme in mid-February, the market has grown in leaps and bounds. The total value of programmes amounts to DM25bn and the Deutsche Bank, arranger and chief dealer to the overwhelming majority of issues so far, is predicting the figure will rise to DM40bn by the end of the current year. Of this, half will be issued and outstanding in the market place, the bank said. The market came into existence because of the abolition of stock turnover tax early last year and the waiving of the requirement that German companies should seek Ministry of Finance permission for domestic debt issues. Before then, costs and complications meant the only way for German companies to issue D-Mark denominated paper in short maturities was via the Euromarkets. Treasurers have seized the opportunity to raise funds on more favourable terms than conventional bank borrowings. There have been a total of 34 issuers so far, 14 of them tapping the market since October. The majority of the issuers are large German corporates - Volkswagen, Bayerische Motoren Werke, Hoesch and Hoechst are among those represented. The biggest issuer by far is the Treuhand, the German government's privatisation agency for the east of the country, which last week announced plans to double the size of its existing programme to DM10bn, saying that CP was a particularly flexible and cost-effective form of borrowing with interest rates at an average of 20 basis points lower than equivalent money market loans. With so many issuers issuing so much paper in so short a time, it is not surprising there is jubilation in the corporate finance department of Deutsche Bank, which has been involved as arranger or dealer in all but seven of the issues - and in the German financial community as a whole, which sees the rapid development of the market as an important boost for the country's status as a financial centre. The German market has quickly grown to be larger than its UK counterpart - where outstandings total Pounds 5bn (Dollars 8.5bn) according to IBCA, the London-based rating agency - but it is still only a fraction of the size of the US market, where outstandings are USDollars 560bn compared with the DM20bn forecast by Deutsche Bank for Germany by the end of the year. As a recent commentary from Standard &amp; Poors, the US rating agency puts it: 'Despite the positive signs . . . to become an effective source of short-term funding the market must continue to expand. To establish a sufficient critical mass for depth, liquidity and efficiency, the numbers of issuers should ultimately grow by several times its current base - drawing on a diversified group of issuers as the market builds up outstandings.' Observers say that for the market to develop in this way, two conditions must be fulfilled. Firstly, international investors should play a much bigger role - at present they own only 20 per cent of all outstandings whilst the other 80 per cent is in the hands of domestic German investors. Second, medium-sized and smaller companies should be encouraged to become issuers, thus broadening investors' options - at present the bulk of issuers are very large German companies. It is not just the rating agencies such as S&amp;P's and Moody's - both of which set up German operations last year - which say the key to both these developments is the wider use of ratings. In an interview with the Financial Times last week, Mr Frank Heintzeler, Deutsche Bank's head of corporate finance, said his advice to all clients seeking a listing was to get a rating. 'In the long run, it will help them with their cost of funds,' he said. It would also allow investors, especially overseas investors, to come to a better assessment of the risks attached to each individual issue, he said. So far, Volkswagen is the only German company to have published a rating for its domestic CP programme. The only other three issuers to have had their paper rated were the German subsidiaries of large international companies - Alcatel, Procter &amp; Gamble and Fiat. Otherwise, in a reverse of the practice on the US and other markets, no issuers have had themselves rated at all. German issuers have been able to get away without a formal third-party assessment of their creditworthiness because of their good name with domestic investors - and also the good name of the sponsoring bank. Mr Heintzeler, of Deutsche Bank, said: 'Up until now they all achieved good terms, but there is already a definite trend towards differentiation on the part of investors, and with higher volumes there will be more discrepancies between the terms individual issuers can obtain.</p>

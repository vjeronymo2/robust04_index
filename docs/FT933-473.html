			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Thatcher fires a warning shot BARONESS THATCHER has granted an interview to a Sunday newspaper in a move timed to cause maximum discomfort to the Tory leadership ahead of next week's annual conference in Blackpool. The interview, which is expected to be published in the next Sunday Times, follows Lady Thatcher's inflammatory remarks on the government's tax and European policy during a private dinner attended by Tory activists on Monday night. At last year's conference, the former prime minister used an article in The European newspaper to launch a vitriolic attack on the Maastricht treaty in a move which shattered Mr John Major's hopes that divisions over Europe had been put to rest. The Sunday Times is also serialising Lady Thatcher's forthcoming memoirs but will not start publishing extracts until after the conference, in accordance with the conditions of its serialisation contract. Lady Thatcher's outburst on Monday - in which she criticised the government's plans to extend VAT to domestic fuel - reopened Tory divisions over the proposals and undermined the party leadership's hopes of a quiet week in the run-up to the conference. In a wide-ranging speech to party activists in Southend, she warned it would be very damaging for the Tories to become known as the high-tax party. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said he strongly agreed with Lady Thatcher's emphasis on the need to 'get the nation's finances right'. He added: 'I do not like putting VAT on fuel. We have, nevertheless, to get some revenue. If we do not get this revenue here, we would have to get the money from somewhere else.' Mr William Powell, MP for Corby and one of two Tory MPs who voted against the plan, said he was 'glad' Lady Thatcher had spoken out. But he doubted whether Mr Major would pay much attention. Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the influential 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers, said there was 'enormous sympathy' for the views she expressed. But 'we must leave every option open in dealing with this massive deficit or we cannot look forward to a prosperous future.' Mr Peter Temple-Morris, Tory MP for Leominster, said the speech was 'frankly not quite the behaviour we expect from an ex-prime minister . . . a period of restraint and a period of political dignity would not go amiss'.</p>

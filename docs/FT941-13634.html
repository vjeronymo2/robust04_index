			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Seeing the future in the Mirror: The Independent's survival plan Some of the mist surrounding the negotiations on the future of The Independent was blown away yesterday to reveal a smile on the face of Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the paper's main founder. Mr Whittam Smith has successfully put together a consortium linking the founders, the main existing shareholders - El Pas of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy - and Mirror Group Newspapers to bid jointly for the 52.92 per cent of the shares not already held by the consortium members. If the bid is successful - and so far no price has been agreed nor formal bid submitted - MGN would take a 40 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing, publisher of The Independent and the Independent on Sunday. It would also see Mr Whittam Smith becoming chairman of the company as well as editor-in-chief. 'El Pas and La Repubblica asked me to be chairman; I would not have suggested it myself,' said Mr Whittam Smith. He said he was convinced the titles' independence had been protected. 'I think it is just the right balance, having partners but not being smothered,' he said, arguing that MGN's 40 per cent would not amount to financial control of the equity. MGN has also given undertakings that it will not vote on the removal or appointment of editors. The consortium proposal, which would give El Pas and La Repubblica together just over 50 per cent of the equity, means that if Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Independent Newspapers in Ireland, pursues his interests he will almost certainly have to submit a full bid for the company. Mr Whittam Smith was yesterday emphasising the cost savings involved in joining with a larger newspaper group. There will be separate editorial and a separate 'marketing brain' to develop the Independent brands, but virtually everything else will be shared. Mr David Montgomery, MGN chief executive, emphasised yesterday: 'We are not in the business of putting talented people on the streets.' A slimmed down staff and joint operations in the 'back office' would remove, it was suggested yesterday, the need for a high-profile chief executive at Newspaper Publishing such as Mr Patrick Morrissey who now holds the position. As printing contracts come up for renewal, MGN will print The Independent at its plants in Watford and Oldham and its new plant in Glasgow. Under the plan, the Independent's staff would join MGN and the Telegraph group in the Canary Wharf complex in London's Docklands, creating the outlines of an informal grouping against Mr Rupert Murdoch's concentration of five national newspapers in nearby Wapping. 'We are in the front line of trying to develop the collegiate system of producing newspapers,' Mr Montgomery said yesterday. Such a collegiate system would involve rival newspaper groups sharing as many services as possible to save costs, while continuing to compete on areas such as editorial and advertising. For MGN the Independent investment would be 'a long and tough process'. But it would take the popular newspaper group into a new sector of the market with the hope of 'producing more titles from the same resources'. In a sideswipe at Mr O'Reilly, the MGN chief executive suggested that without such economies of scale The Independent refinancing 'would not be a proposition'. But Mr Whittam Smith is not home and dry yet. One Newspaper Publishing adviser yesterday referred scathingly to 'an unpriced non-bid after five weeks'. Pressure will now be applied to the consortium to come up with the money as soon as possible so that the end game can begin.</p>

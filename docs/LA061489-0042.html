			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> HUW LEWIS IN RECITAL  </P> <P> In his approach to music of the Romantic era, organist Huw Lewis certainly  likes to pull out some of the more spectacular stops. Monday night at the First  United Methodist Church in Pasadena, a solo concert by the Welsh-born musician  demonstrated a comanding showmanship in a program dominated by some very  demanding 19th-Century works.  </P> <P> Although the evening offered standard fare with no real surprises, Lewis  performed with flair and finesse, evoking a broad spectrum of emotional  intensities. His technique flowed seamlessly while well-chosen registrations  avoided the easy temptation of bombast.  </P> <P> Julius Reubke's ambitious, precocious Organ Sonata was the centerpiece of the  evening. Based on the 94th Psalm and influenced by the Romantic  transcendentalism of Liszt, the three-part sonata tested Lewis' versatility  with contrasts and dynamic levels representing the many moods of a vengeful  God.  </P> <P> The 65-rank, Romantic-style instrument at hand provided the necessary resources  to bring out sforzando trumpets while at other times expressing a delicate  pianissimo. Lewis met each virtuosic demand of the multifaceted score, and kept  the pace fresh and vital.  </P> <P> In two pieces by Widor, the second movement from "Symphonie Gothique" and the  first movement from Symphony No. 6, Lewis again took advantage of the grandiose  organ and its capabilities. Passages demanding difficult pedalling seemed  effortless.  </P> <P> Warm-up performances of Bach's Toccata, Adagio and Fugue in C and Mozart's  Adagio and Allegro in F minor completed the program with minor flaws. Lewis'  approach to the Baroque and Classical sensibilities was appropriate, although  an abundant use of tremolo created a less convincing aspect.GREGG WAGER  </P></p>

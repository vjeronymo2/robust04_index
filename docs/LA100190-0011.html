			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> In the Nick of Time: A benefit concert for political candidates who support  abortion rights -- featuring Bonnie Raitt, Rickie Lee Jones and others -- was  abruptly canceled after the Veterans Administration said that its Los Angeles  theater could not host a partisan event. The concert, whose lineup also  included Robin Williams and Melissa Etheridge, was scheduled for Thursday.  </P> <P> The Hollywood Women's Committee, a political action group, hoped to raise  $200,000 from the invitation-only concert for the campaigns of congressional  candidates. Margery Tabankin, executive director of the group, said that the  committee got permission in July to use the V.A.'s Wadsworth Theater from UCLA.  But UCLA officials said they did not know the purpose of the concert until last  week. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

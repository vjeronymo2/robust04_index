			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jorge Witker: "NAFTA: Some Practical Indicators"] </F>   [Text] Four months following NAFTA's entry into force, the  northern border offers some negative indicators that contrast  with the acceleration processes being currently implemented by  the government in the tariff and financial areas. The northern  border, where a de facto economic and commercial integration is  supposed to exist, constitutes the practical scenario to show  the advantages of the commercial agreement in a natural and  everyday manner.    In Chihuahua, however, the situation appears to be the same,  at least in regard to regional exports from the state to U.S.  markets. Despite everything, as far as imports are concerned, it  is possible to find in the supermarkets a variety of U.S.  products that are being sold without Spanish labels and even  foods with expired dates on them. Is the Mexican Customs  opening in keeping with the "free flow of foods" that is being  promoted by NAFTA or is it simple premodernistic [premoderno]  smuggling.    As for Chihuahua's exports, there is discouragement and  disappointment. Apple producers who process the fruit and sell  it as concentrate or syrup must, before every shipment, wait for  lab tests in order to introduce their product. The product is  kept by Customs for days, which entails additional expense since  apples are a perishable product. Apparently, the elimination of  nontariff barriers has not reached the U.S. Customs officials  yet.    Another case in point is that of a renowned producer of  Mexican bread and tortillas, which are exported to the United  States. To preclude surprises in each shipment, he asked that a  customs office be set up at his plant where compliance with the  rigorous U.S. health requirements is documented, verified, and  certified. Despite this, tortilla shipments and exports are  stopped and sent for lab tests, thus delaying and raising the  Mexican exporter's operating costs.    In addition to these protectionist examples, typical of U.S.  praxis and insensitive to NAFTA, there is a very significant and  well documented "free trade" experience. An executive of a  business association or chamber accompanied by Mexican and U.S.  notaries tried to determine levels of bias and ambiguity among  U.S. Customs officials. For this purpose, he bought several  gallons of U.S. milk (the milk sector of the state refuses to  let go, despite efforts by the sector's industrialists via  subsidized imports and official policy). He shipped it and  imported it into Mexican territory. Subsequently, he switched  the packaging (not the containers) and replaced them with others  that had Mexican labels. When the same milk was exported to the  United States, Customs officials stopped the shipment and  conducted the lab tests that have become customary for Mexican  perishables. The milk was rejected because it yielded negative  results (unhealthy bacteria and foreign objects). How can one  interpret this Customs behavior that milk producers have  documented with Mexican and U.S. notaries?    In sum, the cases described have nothing to do with promises  of "clear and objective regulations for permanent access to the  national exports" that were used to justify this national  decision to sign and approve NAFTA.    Therefore, before further lowering tariffs and beginning the  new opening for the announced banking services, the government  should demand the effective dismantling of nontariff  restrictions because thus far, neither commercial reciprocity  nor NAFTA have reached Chihuahua's border.</p>

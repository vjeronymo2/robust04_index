			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Decelerated Growth of Textile Exports"] </F>   [Text] The government considers the slow growth in the  export of textiles and textile products between January and  November 1993 to be a serious matter. The total export growth  of non-oil/non-gas commodities last year reached 21.89 percent,  but exports of textiles and textile products only increased by  2.8 percent. Hartarto, coordinating minister for industrial and  trade affairs, said this to reporters on Tuesday (8 March) after  meeting President Suharto at the Bina Graha Presidential Office  in Jakarta. He said that as a result, the government is going  to handle the matter more seriously and will review existing  policies by holding a coordinated meeting with the Department of  Industry, Department of Trade, the Office of the Coordinating  Minister for Economy and Finance, and the Bank of Indonesia.    According to Hartarto, efforts to look for new ways to make  Indonesian textiles and textile products more competitive in the  global market will be discussed at the coordinated meeting. The  coordinating minister of industry and trade and other concerned  ministers have already gathered all the facts relating to the  textiles issue, and they will find concrete measures to solve  the problem of slow export growth comprehensively. We can  understand why the government is very concerned about the  decelerated export growth of textiles and textile products.  This is because they have always been the prime export  commodities from the non-oil/non-gas sector. The fact that  state receipts from the export of textiles and textile products  earn the biggest foreign exchange earnings among exports outside  of the non-oil/non-gas sector means that last year's slow export  growth was acutely felt.    It is worrisome to see that the export of textiles and  textile products rose by only 2.8 percent in 1993 compared to  the growth of 35.59 percent in the export of processed wood.  The export of processed wood is currently the second biggest  contributor to foreign exchange earnings after textiles and  textile products.    The decelerated export growth of textiles and textile  products will probably disrupt the smooth flow of foreign  exchange earnings into the country. The impact will be more  serious this year with the price of oil in the international  market falling to about $13 per barrel, largely due to  oversupply and OPEC's indecision over what to do with the glut.    The fluctuating world oil price is expected to create a  deficit in the 1994-1995 state budget. Finance Minister Mari'ie  Mohammad says the government will be forced to draw on its 3.5  trillion rupiah development fund reserves in order to offset the  possible shortfall in revenue. The development fund reserves  would not need to be drawn upon, however, if the export of  non-oil/non-gas commodities could be accelerated to a level that  would balance the declining exports of oil and gas. In any  event, the export trend of non-oil/non-gas commodities depends  on the export growth of textiles and textile products, which  earn the biggest foreign exchanges.    The government was right when it decided to take serious  measures to overcome every obstacle that is causing the slow  export growth of textiles and textile products. There is no  doubt that it will not be easy to solve the export problem,  especially when it concerns textiles and textile products.    On one side, the producers and exporters of textiles and  textile products have been urged to boost the export of their  commodities to increase exports from the non-oil/non-gas sector  and balance the budget deficit caused by the decrease in state  receipts from oil and gas taxes. On the other side, the  producers and exporters of textiles and textile products are  bogged down by all kinds of impediments that hinder them in  producing market quality products that can face stiff  competition in the global market.    We often hear the exporters of non-oil/non-gas commodities  complaining about the decelerated growth of their exports. They  say that the high interest rate of bank loans, complicated  export procedures, difficulties faced in importing raw  materials, and the payment of other unnecessary costs that are  not stated in the trade regulations have contributed to the slow  export growth. It looks as if the time has come for the  government to seek a comprehensive settlement on the issue of  export procedures. Likewise, we used to ask the National Export  Development Agency (BPEN) to look into ways to overcome problems  faced by the Indonesian exporters. Do we need another  institution, besides BPEN, to help exporters overcome their  problems?    It is hoped that the inter-departmental coordinated meeting  proposed by Hartarto will comprehensively discuss the factors  that are causing the slow growth of commodity exports,  especially textiles and textile products. We should take  concrete measures to seek an effective solution to the problem  in order to expedite and boost the export of non-oil/non-gas  commodities.</p>

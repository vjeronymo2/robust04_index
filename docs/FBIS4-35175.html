			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Daniel Pensamiento] </F>   [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez -- After agreeing to the immediate  sale of 44,000 hectares of land in the conflict zone, small  landowners and cattlemen have given authorities eight days to  evict Indian and peasant groups from approximately 400 tracts of  property; otherwise, they will begin the evictions themselves.    During a meeting, the small landowners rejected the  government's proposal to begin the evictions on 31 August at the  conclusion of the negotiations on the sale of the land and the  relocation of the groups.    Rodolfo Ulloa, secretary general of the state government in  Chiapas, said the state administration is willing to carry out  the evictions but that dialogue and consensus must prevail in  order not to hinder the peace negotiations. "We are willing to  undertake the actions you demand, but we must contribute to  reaching peace agreements," he said.    Francisco Escudero, a representative of small landowners in  the Soconusco area, warned that the region's producers will  begin to recover the land if the government continues to be  indifferent to the eviction of the Indian and peasant groups.    Escudero said: "We can no longer tolerate this. We are sorry  the government is closing the door on us. How can the  government wait until 31 August to begin the evictions?" He  added: "We cannot accept this. This is why we made it very  clear that if by 4 July there is no reply, we will begin to  evict people from our farms, and the government will be  responsible for what happens."    The small landowners have been picketing the Government  Palace, and their trucks and tractors have been blocking the  city's main square for the past 72 hours to demand the evictions.</p>

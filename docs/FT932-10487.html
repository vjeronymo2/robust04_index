			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Leading Article: The electorate strikes back THE FULL measure of Conservative disenchantment with the government elected in April 1992 became apparent this week. On Thursday the voters of Newbury returned a Liberal Democrat in what was previously regarded as a safe Tory seat. The 'swing' - the transfer of support from Tory to Liberal - was not the highest in the history of postwar by-election upsets, but at 28 1/2 per cent it exceeded the benchmark established in a similar dramatic reversal of fortune at Orpington 31 years ago. In the local elections Tory councillors were swept out everywhere. They lost especially badly in the shire counties of the south-east, the Conservative party's natural homeland. As the prime minister said yesterday, the people have given the government 'a bloody nose'. It is possible to offer a charitable interpretation of these results. Homeowners in the south-east were particular beneficiaries of the Thatcher boom of the 1980s. House prices soared; most voters did not notice that their apparent gain was largely the product of inflation. Increases in property values were more apparent than real. When Mr John Major became prime minister he set himself the creditable task of reducing inflation. He has succeeded, but at the cost of prolonging the recession and attracting the opprobrium of Conservatives who were previously enriched but now see themselves as the victims of the government they put in office. Yet no prime minister who sought to conquer inflation could have done anything different. Dismal ratings This explanation of Thursday's election results is fine so far as it goes, but it is not the whole story. According to a Gallup poll in yesterday's Daily Telegraph, Mr Major presides over the most unpopular government since 1945. Its approval rating has fallen below 20 per cent for the past seven months in a row. This is a worse score than that recorded by the then Mr Harold Wilson's administration during the depths of its unpopularity in 1968, and far worse than the record of the Callaghan government at the height of the 1976 devaluation crisis. According to Gallup, the public regards Mr Major's government as ineffective, short-sighted, incompetent, divided, out of touch, weak, and unaware of what it is doing. A fairer characterisation would be that it is not all of those things all of the time. The prime minister inherited a poor hand of cards. With the best will in the world it has to be said that on occasion he has played it badly. Small comfort In consequence the country has a government that it does not respect - and an opposition that it does not trust. It chose the government rather than a Labour administration a year ago, when the recession was biting hard and the green shoots of recovery were figments of the chancellor's imagination. People are now saying that they would vote for a Labour administration, but in Newbury the Labour candidate lost his deposit. It was to the Liberal Democrats, the traditional vehicle for mid-term protests, that the unhappy voters turned. Labour did well in the local elections, but the Liberal Democrats did better. It is for this reason that the government can comfort itself with the thought that, in spite of everything, it will not be turfed out when the next general election comes. By that time boundary changes favouring the Conservatives will be in place. The economic recovery should be well under way. The Labour party may look less anaemic than it does today, but the non-Conservative vote will still be split, going to Labour in Scotland and the North and the Liberal Democrats in the south. Even if the two parties of opposition agree to work together, many voters will not be tempted, unless Labour has by then won their trust. Meanwhile, Mr Major is in for a bumpy ride.</p>

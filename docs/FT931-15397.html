			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Treasury to forge business links THE 100 top officials at the Treasury have been told to spend at least one day a year visiting industry as part of a scheme by Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary, to build better links with business. The programme is starting after widespread criticism of Britain's top government department for being too remote from industry and failing to understand the forces behind Britain's longest recession for 60 years. The notion of Treasury awaydays was received enthusiastically by some of Britain's biggest companies, although a few businesses said the scheme did not go far enough. Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, the electrical retailer, said: 'It's an excellent way to foster better relationships. Treasury officials will be welcome to come to Dixons and get their hands grubby.' Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman of the food manufacturer Northern Foods, said: 'Any effort by Treasury officials to leave the isolated cocoon in which they live is to be applauded.' Sir Terry launched his proposals without publicity just before Christmas, On top of the industry visits, the 100 top officials have been told to arrange at least three annual 'contacts' - such as lunches  - with industrial representatives. The scheme - which will encourage outings to factories, as opposed to commercial offices - is expected to lead to a substantial increase in Treasury meetings with industry. The Treasury said the scheme was intended to make officials 'better informed' about business, particularly manufacturing. Mr Neil Gracey, employee services manager at chemical company Associated Octel, welcomed the plan but said it was 'too little, too late'. Mr Paul Lester, chief executive of Graseby, the electronics group, said: 'One day a year is not enough.' The Treasury yesterday hosted the first meeting of its new panel of private sector forecasters which will report next month on the medium-term economic outlook. The seven-member panel is to meet again on February 9 after a discussion yesterday, mainly about the procedures to be adopted in assembling the report. Quiet coup, Page 17</p>

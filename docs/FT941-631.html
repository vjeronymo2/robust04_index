			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rutland 65% ahead at Pounds 10.9m - Sale of a stake in its soft drinks business helped fuel the advance The sale of part of its soft drinks business helped Rutland Trust, the financial and business services group, to boost pre-tax profits by 65 per cent for the year to end-December. They rose from Pounds 6.67m to Pounds 10.9m on turnover of Pounds 100m (Pounds 94m). The latest turnover figure includes Pounds 5.1m from acquisitions. Early this year Rutland sold part of Ben Shaw's, the Yorkshire soft drinks manufacturer, 84 per cent of which it acquired last August for Pounds 5.7m. The buyer was Cott Corporation of Canada, the rapidly expanding North American soft drinks company, which paid Pounds 6m for 51 per cent of the Pontefract canning line. The latest pre-tax figure includes Pounds 3.3m profit on the sale. Mr Michael Langdon, chief executive, said the group would realise a further Pounds 3m of profits in the current year from a second payment from Cott, which has the option to raise its stake in the canning line to 82.5 per cent. Rutland will retain the remaining 17.5 per cent, and will continue to own and develop the Huddersfield division of Ben Shaw's, which concentrates on the local returnable soft drinks market and spring water production. Operating profits from the corporate finance and investment division, which did the Ben Shaw's deal, rose from Pounds 1.51m to Pounds 2m. This mainly reflected a Pounds 1.93m (Pounds 904,000) contribution from the group's 42 per cent stake in Capital Industries, the laminated paper maker. The asset financing division, which is involved in vehicle contract hire, doubled operating profits from Pounds 858,000 to Pounds 1.72m on the back of improved second-hand car values. Profits from professional services, including Ellis &amp; Buckle, the loss adjuster, eased from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 3.92m. At the year end the group had Pounds 14.6m cash. Mr Langdon said Rutland would continue to look for suitable acquisi-tions. Earnings per share rose from 1.68p to 3.17p, or 1.97p excluding the exceptional item. A final dividend of 0.6p (0.53p) is proposed, making the total for the year 0.87p (0.8p).</p>

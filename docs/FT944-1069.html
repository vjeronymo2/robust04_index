			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Cheese market - As prices rise, dairies are adopting new strategies When brothers Ian and David Skailes tuck into their Christmas lunch, the Stilton on their cheeseboard is likely to absorb more of their attention than usual. As specialist cheese-makers supplying London retailers Fortnum &amp; Mason, Selfridges and Harrods, their priority is to produce the best cheese money can buy. But this year's deregulation of the milk market  - accompanied by a surge in the cost of milk  - has spurred them to find new ways of adding value to their cheeses. 'There's a strong market for jars of Stilton and presentation packs,' says Ian Skailes, production director of Cropwell Bishop Creamery, the family company based outside Nottingham. 'We do a lot of sales at airport shops. We're looking at new packaging and presentation and making sure quality is always at the top end of the market,' he says. Since deregulation on November 1, cheesemakers have had to pay up to 20 per cent more for their milk from Milk Marque, the dairy producers' co-operative that replaced the statutory Milk Marketing Board and controls more than 65 per cent of supplies. Both specialist and mass producers are moving further upmarket in an attempt to maintain margins and market share. Last month the Nottinghamshire creamery cut output of its lower value Cheddar and Leicester by 40 per cent. It is now making about 800 tonnes of Stilton and 500 tonnes of Cheddar and Leicester a year, a dramatic change from three years ago when the respective balance was 600 tonnes of Stilton to 1,500 tonnes of 'hard-pressed' cheese. 'There's no money to be made out of Cheddar,' says Skailes. Milk represents 75-90 per cent of the cost of making Cheddar, but nearer 60 per cent of the cost of producing Stilton, which is more labour-intensive. Cropwell Bishop hopes to pass on its increased costs to its customers in January in the form of a 10 per cent rise in prices. Singleton's Dairy in Lancashire also foresaw an increase in milk prices as deregulation loomed. It decided to move away from its 60 per cent dependence on block Cheddar into higher-value cheeses. Last year, it launched Truckledown, a new cheese made from 'a mixture of a few of our old family recipes', says Bill Riding, director. This year it introduced Grandma Singleton's Strong Lancashire, matured for a record nine-10 months. 'We got a feeling the cheese market was looking towards more mature cheeses,' Riding explains. 'Cheese consumers are also becoming more cosmopolitan and trying more varieties.' The dairy is now building up its supplies of traditional farmhouse cheeses to supermarket delicatessen counters. Like Cropwell Bishop, it is also enjoying a growth in demand for its cheeses from the continent. At the mass end of the Pounds 1.2bn cheese market, adding value is just as important, although the spur is the threat of imports rather than the promise of exports. The industry believes higher prices will draw in more imported cheese, which already accounts for 30 per cent of the market and is dominated by mild Cheddar, notably from Ireland. The Cheese Company, Britain's biggest independent manufacturer, is busy trying to differentiate its product from such imports to hold on to its 24 per cent market share. It has adopted a marketing tactic known as 'sub-branding'  - where the name of the creamery is carried on the label alongside that of the retailer. 'Our research has shown that way above the price and appearance of the cheese people like to know its origins,' says Sharon Rudd, product manager. The company has just launched a range of mostly mature cheeses from three of its five creameries  - Taw Valley in Devon, Reece's in Cheshire and Castle Loch near Lockerbie in Scotland  - in partnership with Marks and Spencer and Somerfield. The M&amp;S labels provide a brief description of the cheese. Reece's Wensleydale is described as 'a young cheese with a clean, tangy flavour and a crumbly texture'. This is one way for manufacturers to make inroads into a market that is 85 per cent dominated by retailers' own-label cheese. But does it amount to more than adding a few well-chosen words to a label? Roger Davenport, the Cheese Company's managing director, believes it does. 'We're making a contract with the consumer that cheese comes from where it says, and that the product is consistently delivering the expectations all the way through the year.' Although it has started with its most characterful, premium quality cheeses, the company hopes to pursue sub-branding throughout its range. It says other retailers are interested in the idea and aims to be in partnership with another leading multiple next year.</p>

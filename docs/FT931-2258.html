			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Getting to grips with the R-word - The world's greatest white grape does not have to be sweet to be good, as Jancis Robinson confirms WINE NAMES are full of pronunciation traps. Cos, Montrachet and Moet can all sort out the Moutons from the lambs, but the most commonly mispronounced name of all must be Riesling, which is 'Reece-ling' and not 'Rise-ling'. This is all the more lamentable since Riesling is the greatest white wine grape of all, lives for ever and, as demonstrated eloquently at recent tastings held in Paris and London, and New York on Monday, does not have to be sweet to be good. The tastings could not be concurrent since they were the child of one brain, whose owner was understandably keen to attend each one. Stuart Pigott is a dedicatedly non-partisan wine writer in his early 30s who divides his time between south London and Germany but sees his mission as sniffing out some of the finest wines being made today, wherever they may be. His particular speciality is Riesling, about which he has written four books (two of them self-published guides to the best wines made in Germany in 1989 and 1990), and he has for years wanted to set up a blind comparison of the finest Rieslings of the world. The super-concentrated 1990 vintage at last provided him with an even playing field for the Rieslings of Germany, Austria and Alsace in France. And he had to choose the razor-sharp dry style of Riesling since that is just about all Alsace produces. Germany and Austria used to make predominantly sweet wines, and British and American wine merchants still import little else, but within Austria and Germany there has been a winemaking revolution, partly provoked by the 1985 diethylene glycol scandal in which only sweet wines were implicated. Thus, since about 1988, almost all regions of Germany and, in particular, the cool and dramatic Wachau district of Austria make a wide range of fully fermented, non-sweetened Rieslings in the racy style of Alsace (which style has in any case been the only acceptable form of Riesling for many younger British and American wine drinkers). The Pigott tasting, held at the Gavroche with Riedel glasses as indications of seriousness of intent, comprised six flights of wines (this collective noun for once seeming appropriate, given the airborne quality of fine dry Rieslings) of which a dozen came from each of Austria and Germany and 10 from Alsace. 'This tasting is in many ways the most impossible thing I've ever tried to do, because of the impossible combination of political interests,' was his somewhat devigorated comment on the machinations involved in persuading the three generic promotional bodies concerned to underwrite such a potentially damaging exercise. In the event, what was extraordinary to me was the similarity in style between the wines, yet the dissimilarity between that style and the stereotypical description of Riesling. There was hardly a wine that could be described as 'flowery', while Riesling, like any great grape variety, proved itself as a vehicle for transmitting location. Virtually all of the producers seemed to be trying to pack such concentrated and local character into the bottle as possible, so that many were marked much more by a distinctly mineral note, with explosive, but definitely dry fruit on the palate. Lime, wet stones, gunsmoke, paprika, honey and even salami cropped up in my tasting notes, and they were all beautifully balanced, except for some very ripe wines in which the alcohol was just a bit too much for this delicately transparent grape variety. As has become customary at any serious blind comparative tasting (especially one funded by the participants), we were urged at the beginning that this was Not A Competition. But, as has also become customary, there was a show of hands for favourite wines at the end. The London favourite seemed to be an Austrian, a Durnsteiner Kellerberg Smaragd from the Wachau magician F X Pichler, which had been second favourite in Paris where, perhaps not surprisingly, an Alsace wine had been favoured; Marcel Deiss's Schoenenburg (Pounds 22.50 from Lea &amp; Sandeman, see below). It is difficult to exaggerate how well a top quality dry Riesling goes with food - far better than most Chardonnays which can be extremely blunt instruments to apply to the palate and head at the start of a meal. High acid plus relatively low alcohol, now minus sugar, should equal success for this exciting new style of fine wine. Where to buy dry Rieslings: It is near impossible to find the lovely Wachau Rieslings outside Austria, and the dry Rieslings so treasured by Germans are only slowly escaping that country - although try Philip Eyres of Amersham (tel: 0494-433823), Gelston Castle in Scotland (0556-3012), Oddbins and Summerlee Wines of Earls Barton (0604-810488) for names such as Juliusspital, Koehler Ruprecht, Lingenfelder, Muller Catoir. Expatriated top quality dry Alsace Riesling is much easier to find. Adnams of Southwold (0502-724222) sells Blanck wines; Lea &amp; Sandeman of London SW10 and W8 on (071-376- 4767) has Deiss; O W Loeb of London SE1 (071-928-7750) has Faller, and Hugel; Morris &amp; Verdin of SW1 (071-630-8888) has Ostertag; Thresher/Wine Rack/Bottoms Up has Zind-Humbrecht; and La Vigneronne of London SW7 (071-589 6113) has a wide range of Alsace including Kreydenweiss.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Sutherland firm on farm accord THERE CAN be no reneg-otiation of the farm trade agreement made last year between the US and the European Community, Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of the Gatt world trade organisation, warned Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, yesterday. After talks between the two in Paris, Mr Sutherland said 'a significant number' of the 108 countries negotiating in Gatt did not want the draft agreement to be reopened, which meant 'there could not be a renegotiation'. France, under pressure from the militant French farmers' lobby, has demanded changes to the accord, which foresees cuts in EC agricultural export subsidies. Both EC and Gatt officials have warned France that reopening the deal would scupper prospects for an agreement in the Uruguay Round of Gatt talks being reached by a December 15 deadline. There was 'only one opportunity left' to finish the Gatt negotiations, Mr Sutherland told the French prime minister, and that was to conclude them by December 15. The deadline, he added, 'has been set by the negotiating parties, not by me'. But Mr Balladur indicated that legally the Blair House transatlantic farm accord had never been properly concluded. He insisted - and Mr Sutherland conceded the point in remarks after his meeting - that 'there is no European position until the EC Council of Ministers decides'. Mr Balladur, according to French officials, characterised the December 15 deadline as 'an American date', inserted for US political convenience. But he went on to assure the Gatt director: 'Be sure that I want a Gatt agreement, but I ask that all should make an effort, not just the French'. The Blair House accord will be discussed by EC foreign ministers this weekend and by farm and foreign ministers at a special session on September 20.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report A sharp post-US electoral rally in SILVER prices to the highest point in nearly three months sparked a turn-round in precious metals markets from morning levels that saw gold hit its lowest fix since late August. Silver pushed up through resistance at 382 cents a troy ounce in early Comex trade on US fund buying and peaked near 387 cents. The move had been widely signalled by an increasingly constructive technical picture. The expected Clinton victory also generated hopes of an economic stimulus package for the US economy and provided the fundamental excuse for silver's rally. GOLD, however, remains under pressure from producer forward selling, notably from South Africa and Australia where gold remans attractive in local currency terms as the rand and Australian dollar have slid against the US unit. Recent large sales of what appears to be central bank gold, have also weighed on values. Dealers said the sales had the feel of institutional selling. Compiled from Reuters</p>

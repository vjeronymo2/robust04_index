			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / S Korea-Taiwan pact signed SOUTH KOREA and Taiwan yesterday signed an agreement establishing unofficial ties after breaking diplomatic relations last August when Seoul recognised Beijing as China's only legitimate government. The pact, which was signed in Osaka, Japan, after several rounds of talks, is likely to lead to the lifting of commercial sanctions against South Korea imposed by Taiwan in retaliation. An import ban was imposed on Korean cars, which amounted to 11,000 vehicles valued at Dollars 110m last year, and air and sea links were suspended. Anti-dumping suits were filed against Korean steel, chemical and petrochemical products. South Koreans seeking to work in Taiwan also faced restrictions. A deadlock on restoring relations was broken when Taiwan dropped its demand that its offices in Seoul and Pusan bear the name of the Republic of China. It instead accepted the name of Taipei. It also originally sought to keep all its government assets in Korea, but has now agreed to negotiate directly with China on the ownership of non-diplomatic property, such as state-sponsored schools. China took over Taiwan's embassy building in Seoul last year, while Taiwan retained its office in Pusan. In return, Seoul agreed to recognise the Taiwanese offices as 'missions,' which suggest they have higher diplomatic status than representative offices.</p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Personal View: How to cure an industry's ills The European steel industry is in a state of crisis. Western European steel companies are losing large amounts of money, operating with historically low prices, experiencing low-capacity utilisation and are involved in trade skirmishes with North America and eastern Europe. The eastern European steel industry, like other heavy industries in the east, is struggling to identify the appropriate structure, scale and operating formula for the future under free-market capitalism. This 'state of crisis' has brought vociferous requests for support from Community and state institutions to aid restructuring: reductions of 30m tonnes of capacity and 50,000 employees are commonly mentioned. Conditions in western Europe echo those in the late 1970s and early 1980s which resulted in a declaration of 'manifest crisis' in the industry and the famous Davignon plan. This plan was to solve the problem of capacity and to produce a healthy industry; even as late as 1990, industry leaders were proclaiming its success. Current cries for help raise fundamental questions: is there overcapacity in the industry and will its elimination result in a healthy industry? The answer to the first question is yes, but to the second is no, unless the industry also adopts a different approach to technology, cost structure and capital investment. If overcapacity is reduced now, there may well be under-supply when demand next peaks. This will lead to new capacity being introduced, replicating the problem through the next business cycle. Any 'overcapacity' is a symptom of a disease rather than the underlying cause. The causes can be found by examining why the steel industry is not capable of making a profit during this recession. Integrated steel manufacturers, those using blast-furnace technologies, have cost 70 per cent fixed and 30 per cent variable. With volumes 20 to 30 per cent off their peak and prices similarly depressed, losses are made. The industry is also over-invested. Investment in the last 20 years has concentrated on modernising technology, increasing the asset to sales ratio, the proportion of fixed costs and assets in downstream activities such as galvanising. These investments have pushed the 'overcapacity' from an earlier to a later stage in the process, on a higher fixed asset base. Despite a history of cyclicality and limited demand growth, the industry has invested 30 per cent more than depreciation over the last 12 years. So how has this progression into a high fixed-cost structure and over-investment come about? A large percentage of the industry is still state-owned: Usinor-Sacilor in France, Ilva in Italy, Ensidesa and AHV in Spain. In the recent past even some of the now private sector companies were state-owned, such as British Steel. Governments and EC institutions have provided capital to facilitate the industry's 'modernisation'. These investments have not been governed by return on investment, except by those companies which have had the discipline of private sector shareholders. There is no technological necessity for this over-investment and overly fixed-cost structure. Many steel companies, notably the mini-mills, have survived, prospered and returned profits even in the most vicious economic climates. They have invested in technologies with cost structures that are 70 to 80 per cent variable, and in technologies which are significantly less capital-intensive, often by a factor of 1:4. This accounts for their health and the integrated industry's disease. The integrated industry has a growing plethora of technology options available to it to achieve these costs and asset objectives. Cheap capital is a cause of the illness, not its cure. So what will create health in the European industry? The overriding need is the operation of commercial rules on the allocation of capital to the steel industry. This will probably be achieved only when there are no significant assets remaining in state ownership, when plants are less integrated in nature and when the EC ignores cries for help. The introduction of capital market disciplines will result in a reversal of the traditional fixed-cost structure to a more highly variable one and to lower asset intensity. This will enable the steel industry to operate at or above break-even in the worst economic climates. The author is chairman of Beddows &amp; Company, a strategy consultancy</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Odessa [no dateline as received] -- Today, Vice  Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovynyy, commander of the Ukrainian Naval  Forces, who arrived from Nikolayev, met Captain 1st Rank Dmytro  Ukrayinets, Odessa senior naval chief, appointed by Ukraine's  Defense Ministry on 13 April, and the command of Ukraine's  Defense Ministry First Brigade protecting the Odessa water  basin. During a break in the conference, Volodymyr Bezkorovynyy  granted a brief interview to a UNIAN correspondent.    "The 12 April meeting in Kiev between the unofficial  delegations of Ukraine and Russia in connection with the Odessa  incident does not evoke my optimism," said the Ukrainian Naval  Forces commander. "We supplied the Russian side with all the  documents that confirm the illegitimate and criminal nature of  the actions by the Russian officers who were on board the survey  vessel, the Cheleken, and also on the part of the command of the  former 318th Division of the Black Sea Fleet conservation ships.  We submitted explanatory notes, eyewitnesses' evidence that the  cargo on board the Cheleken was loaded in secret, and the order  to use arms against Ukrainian sailors was immediately passed to  Captain 2d Rank Oleksandr Zelenko from Sevastopol by the Black  Sea Fleet command.    ``We also provided proof of the legitimacy of the actions by  Captain 1st Rank Volodymyr Orlov, the senior naval chief of  Odessa. All the documents are irrefutable, from the legal  viewpoint. One can only refuse to acknowledge them -- to be  more precise -- to refuse to be aware of them, what, correctly  speaking, the Russian side, headed by Admiral Feliks Gromov,  demonstrated at the meeting. There can be no other explanation  of the fact that Admiral Gromov did everything possible so that  we, like him, would fail to meet the participants in the Odessa  incident in Sevastopol. The meeting with the crew of the  Cheleken was obviously not to his advantage. When he arrived in  Sevastopol, the Russian military sailors would not allow the  procurator, a customs official, and border guards to go onboard  the Cheleken. This gives grounds to assume that not only the  hydrographic unit RLS-5 `Mars' was taken away from Odessa in a  criminal manner, but, probably, other valuable equipment from  Ukraine's untouchable mobilization resources, as well. We  insist and we will continue to insist that the stolen military  cargo be returned to Odessa.''    Replying to the question as to what his answer to President  Leonid Kravchuk was concerning the proposal made by the U.S. top  leadership on 13 April to mediate in solving the Black Sea Fleet  issues, Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy said: "Of course, it is time  that the leaders of the two states and peoples -- the Ukrainian  and Russian -- should themselves sort out every aspect of the  matter. Where there is a will, there is a way. I would speak  out in favor of adopting the proposal of the U.S. top leadership  to be a third arbitration party during the Black Sea Fleet  division."    Also today, Vice Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy had a  businesslike meeting with Lieutenant General Volodymyr  Shkidchenko, the Odessa Military District commander.</p>

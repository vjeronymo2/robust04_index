			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Angolan president dismisses minister ANGOLAN President Jose Eduardo dos Santos announced yesterday that he was dismissing his finance minister and central bank governor following a controversial move to narrow the gap between the official and black market exchange rates, Reuter reports from Luanda. A note from his office said minister Salamao Xirimbimbi and bank governor Sebastiao Lavrador would be replaced temporarily by former planning minister and current trade minister Emanuel Carneiro and deputy central bank governor Generoso de Almeida. The note did not detail reasons for the move. However, analysts said the decision appeared to be linked to a controversial move several weeks ago to abandon the official unrealistic exchange rate of 580 kwanzas to the dollar and peg it closer to the black market rate. The official rate, which covered some transactions including imports by state bodies, was adjusted to 7,000 kwanzas to the dollar. The move, which made the prices of some imported goods and services soar, provoked criticism by local businessmen as well as some parliamentarians. The black market rate jumped back to around 10,000 kwanzas after falling back initially.</p>

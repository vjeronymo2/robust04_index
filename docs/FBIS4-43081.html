			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' reaction to </F> UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's second report on  Cyprus on 10 June -- recorded]    [Text] [Begin Denktas recording] Undoubtedly, the TRNC  [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] Government will assess the  esteemed UN secretary general's report and give the necessary  reply to it. I wish to outline the following: The report  briefly referred to the Greek Cypriot side's arms. However, it  failed to mention that the Greek Cypriot side has a strike force  of nearly 100,000 men -- 80,000 of them in the reserves. The  remaining part of that force is made up of Greek Cypriot and  Greek military units.    Meanwhile, the report said that some 30,000 Turkish troops  are based in north Cyprus. In a strange approach, it compared  the number of the Turkish troops with the population in north  Cyprus and described the situation as the most intense military  fortification in the world. That description alone indicates  how the esteemed UN secretary general views the problem.    The Turkish troops have not arrived to quarrel with the  Turkish population. They are there to defend Cyprus, and the  Turkish Cypriots, against the Greek Cypriot military forces that  wish to eliminate the Turkish Cypriot population. They defend  the peace in Cyprus.    As I have already mentioned, the Greek Cypriot side is  capable of organizing an army of 100,000 men in a short period.  The Greek Cypriots are in the process of allocating naval  facilities and an air base to Greece. However, the esteemed UN  secretary general has ignored all that.    Another point, which has drawn my attention, is the UN  secretary general's accusation that the Turkish troops have  created problems in the efforts to have military units in  certain border points withdrawn. He noted in his report that  Turkish troops informed the UN officials that they should  contact the Turkish Cypriot authorities because the matter is of  a political nature. The Turkish troops cannot be blamed. They  only explained the situation in north Cyprus. They informed the  UN officials that the matter should be discussed with the  politicians in the north and that they would comply with the  instructions they would receive on the withdrawal of troops.  However, the esteemed UN secretary general, who acts on behalf  of the UN Security Council, does not wish to recognize the  Turkish Cypriot authorities. Consequently, he has not contacted  us on the matter. He has done that deliberately. So, he has  been unable to pursue the UN Security Council's proposal on the  withdrawal of troops from the confrontation line. We ask that  they recognize the regime in north Cyprus, agree that we exist,  and hold talks with us. They cannot achieve anything without  holding talks with us.    That is what I wish to say at this point. The TRNC  Government will assess the situation and give the necessary  reply.    Another point is the UN secretary general's complaint that  we  have converted the St. Barnabas Church into a museum. I have  found that very strange because the Greek Cypriots have  destroyed 117 mosques in the past. However, no reference has  been made to that at all. We have been trying to preserve the  unused Greek Cypriot churches as much as we can. Furthermore,  we have been trying to use them in an appropriate way.  Unfortunately, they have complained even about that.    Considering all that, we shall protest against any complaint  from the UN secretary general on the question of the churches in  north Cyprus if he fails to recall the fate of the 117 mosques.  We have lost 117 mosques. In view of that, we want that matter  to be continually stressed. We lost many of our cemeteries. We  also want that to be stressed. All this indicates the stand of  the two communities against each other. [end recording]</p>

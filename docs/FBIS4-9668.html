			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Luiz Augusto Mendonca] </F>   [Text] President Itamar Franco has rewritten the text of  the provisional measure that creates the Real Value Unit, URV.  The new text will be published in the official gazette today.    The new text of Provisional Measure 434 establishes that the  date for conversion of salaries into URV's is the 30th of each  month. The difference resulting from the judicial and  legislative branches decision to convert their employees'  salaries into URV's on 20 March will be paid to them as a bonus,  which will have to be authorized through a legislative decree.    These decisions were made during a cabinet meeting at  Planalto Palace last night. The joint proposal for rewriting  Provisional Measure 434 was approved during the meeting. The  text now establishes that all public employees' salaries be  converted into URV's on the 30th of each month based on the  salaries paid for the last four months. This rule does not  apply to state-owned companies and other self-supported  government organizations.    The 10.94 percent difference resulting from conversion into  URV's of judicial and legislative branch employees' salaries on  20 March will probably be paid to these employees as a bonus,  which will be authorized through a legislative decree.    President Itamar Franco began the meeting yesterday by  saying  that as head of the administration and chief of state he must  protect the national interests and influence administrative  measures of the other government branches. President Itamar  Franco later said that, as should always occur in a state of  law, he will comply with the Federal Supreme Court decision and  continue to adopt and propose measures against unfair and  unequal treatment of public issues. He added that he will  coordinate proposals for amendments to the Constitution through  the government leaders at the Chamber of Deputies and at the  Senate. He established that these proposals be analyzed with  the help of illustrious jurists. He said that these will be  effective measures seeking to ensure an overall and legal  reorganization of the Brazilian Government.</p>

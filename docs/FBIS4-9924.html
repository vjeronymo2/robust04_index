			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Claudio Pereda Madrid] </F>   [Text] The National Renewal [RN] party will be submitting  to the Chamber of Deputies a draft bill that strives to avoid  corruption at the civil servant level. This draft bill includes  legal measures not in current Chilean law, such as influence  peddling.    The draft bill, which will be submitted in the next few  days,  also adds regulations to the law on bribery, expands measures  regarding conflicts of interest, and adds measures on illegal  exactions.    The measures proposed by RN, which were disclosed by RN  President Andres Allamand during a news conference, intend to  punish officials or civil servants who seek to obtain profit for  themselves or third parties through the illegal use of secrets  or privileged information through influence peddling. According  to Andres Allamand, influence peddling is the most common form  of corruption at the civil servant level but it goes unpunished  in Chilean law:    [Begin Allamand recording] It must be noted that in the last  20 to 25 years, the majority of countries have held in-depth  discussions to penalize influence peddling, which, I repeat, is  not punished in Chile. [end recording]    The draft bill also intends to punish bribery, not only when  the action takes place, but also when it is offered. The law  currently establishes that bribery is a crime only when the  illegal payment is made.    The draft bill also expands the list of people with whom  government workers cannot negotiate, among whom are their  business partners and direct relatives, such as spouses and  direct ancestors or descendants. It also punishes public  officials who are entitled to make any payments and who request  a sum higher than what is established. The law currently  punishes those who demand an additional payment but not when it  is requested.    [Begin Allamand recording] Consequently, we are building  [words indistinct] introducing in Chile the legal measure of  influence peddling, which currently is not included in Chilean  law. We are perfecting the law on bribery by establishing the  punishment I mentioned before: when the public official either  requests it or it is offered.    We also are expanding conflicts of interest and, last, we  are  perfecting the measures regarding illegal exactions. [end  recording]    Finally, Andres Allamand explained that the draft bill is  completed by measures expediting the defense of public officials  unjustly charged with the crimes included in the draft bill.</p>

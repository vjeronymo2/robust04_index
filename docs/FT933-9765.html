			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Court rejects compensation in Hoover free flights case A RETIRED headmaster yesterday lost the first case to come to court against Hoover over its controversial free flights promotion. But the company was criticised by the court for 'slackness'. Mr Sandy Jack, from Methil, Fife, was suing Hoover for Pounds 380 - the cost of two flights to Orlando, Florida - at Kirkcaldy Sheriffs Court. In what had been seen as a test case, Mr Jack claimed the company failed to supply two free tickets after he bought a Pounds 350 Hoover dishwasher. Thousands of people have made similar complaints after Hoover ran a promotion last year offering free flights to the US and Europe if customers spent more than Pounds 100 on its products. Sheriff William Christie said Mr Jack was not entitled to compensation as he had not complied with the conditions of the offer. He ruled Hoover was 'not in material breach of contract' by failing to send Mr Jack a ticket voucher within the 28-day time limit specified in its rules. 'At no time did the defenders (Hoover) fail to honour their obligation under the contract,' he said. Mr Jack argued that Hoover had broken its contract by sending him a flight voucher 19 days outside the 28-day limit. He did not complete the voucher because it arrived only days before he hoped to travel. However Sheriff Christie described as a 'blunder' Hoover's original defence that it did not receive Mr Jack's registration form. That led to the Post Office checking tens of thousands of receipts for proof that Mr Jack's registered letter had been delivered. 'This situation arose from careless drafting of the defence,' the sheriff said. Mr Jack said yesterday: 'I may not have won the actual battle, but I think we gave them a hell of a hammering in the war.' Mr Richard Rankin, co-chairman of the Hoover task force sorting out the promotion, said Mr Jack was 'representative of customers who mistakenly believe, or are encouraged to believe, that they have a right to two free flights when in fact they have not followed the rules and are therefore not eligible'. But the Consumers' Association said: 'The law clearly considers there is one set of rules for consumers and another for Hoover.' Hoover dismissed its European president and two directors responsible for the promotion in March and set up a Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.1m) 'rescue' fund. It ran into problems after underestimating the response to its offer and the commission it would earn on associated travel bookings.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Army Commander-in-Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit warned  yesterday that criticism made against the military at a protest  rally in front of Parliament would benefit no one but could lead  to disharmony and violence.    "I don't see how criticism against the military would  benefit  the country or help strengthen national unity. Instead I think  it could instigate violence," said Gen Wimon, apparently  referring to social critic Sulak Siwarak who took a snipe at the  military while addressing a rally in support of hunger striker  Chalat Worachat last Sunday.    "Some groups might want to see that (violence) happen. But  we  in the Army do not want to see it happen to Thai people," said  the Army chief.    Asked if he would take legal action against Mr Sulak, Gen  Wimon said he believed the Thai public understood what was going  on.    "Some people tend to attack everyone around them, believing  no one is good except them themselves. However, there are not  many of this kind of people," he said.    Gen Wimon then asked one reporter whether she had voted in  the last general election. When the reporter answered with a  nod, he said: "We have already exercised our political rights.  Now it's time for us to let our representatives solve the  country's problems through the parliamentary system."    The Army chief said he has never interfered with the  country's administration.    In a democratic society, he said, one should learn to  respect  rules and regulations and try not to be too stubborn since "no  one can do or get everything he wants".    "Like in a sport, we players have to observe its rule," said  Gen Wimon who had earlier pledged full support for Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai against any move to force the Government  to give in to Mr Chalat's demands.    Meanwhile, Navy Commander-in-Chief Adm Prachet Siridet said  he was optimistic the current political situation would not  become explosive if all sides tried to tackle problems with  reason.    But he warned that a political confrontation might be  inevitable if there was interference by outsiders who wanted to  see the situation worsen.    "We want to see the problem (concerning Mr Chalat) resolved  with understanding," said the admiral.    He added that Thai people should not repeat their past  mistakes. "We have gained much experience and should find a good  solution to the problem without repeating the same mistakes. "    Another top military officer, First Army Commander Lt-Gen  Chettha Thanacharo, dismissed suggestions that Mr Chalat's  demands had gained support from the public.    Lt-Gen Chettha said he was confident the majority of people  still adhered to righteousness and democratic principles.    He warned that one should be cautious in dealing with the  Constitution which was "most important to the lives of 59  million Thais."    Lt-Gen Chettha, who is also a senator, said the Government  had made the right decision not to set up a House committee to  redraft the Constitution as demanded by Mr Chalat's supporters.    In an apparent show of sympathy for the Government, Lt-Gen  Chettha asked: "What should we do if we are doing the right  thing but other people see it as wrong?"</p>

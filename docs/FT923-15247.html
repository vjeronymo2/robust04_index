			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Retiring governor defends his record LORD WILSON, Hong Kong's outgoing governor, yesterday defended his approach to negotiation with China, saying talks were best conducted in private where patience and explanation were required to overcome mutual suspicion. 'You do not get many plaudits for this approach, but it is the only way to do it,' he said a day before he gives up his post. 'That is in no way what is sometimes characterised as a policy of weakness; it is just a commonsense approach.' Lord Wilson hit out at 'intellectual Luddites' in Britain who suggested a knowledge of China was of little use in governing the colony or in dealing with China. That was 'akin to saying 'let's have ignorance rather than knowledge',' he said. Lord Wilson, a leading Foreign Office sinologist before his appointment as governor five-and-a-half years ago, has accepted retirement earlier than he wished. His replacement by Mr Chris Patten, a professional politician, was widely seen as the result of dissatisfaction in London with the performance of a senior bureaucrat in a job which increasingly required sensitive political antennae. Lord Wilson praised Mr Patten's political talents, saying the former Conservative party chairman would make a good governor. Mr Patten takes over next Thursday. During his term in office Lord Wilson had to deal with the influx of Vietnamese refugees, the aftermath in Hong Kong of the June 1989 Tiananmen incident, and gruelling negotiations with the Chinese government over democracy in the colony and plans to build a new airport. He won widespread praise for his leadership after June 1989 and his forthright stand on the issue of British nationality for Hong Kong people. But he has been criticised by colony liberals for being too prepared to see Beijing's point of view in dealing with other issues, notably the pace of democratisation. Sectional dissatisfaction with his leadership was made plain on Wednesday when members of the United Democrats, who swept popular elections last September, pointedly failed to applaud his valedictory speech to the legislature. Yesterday, Lord Wilson said there was a general wish in Hong Kong to move to a more representative form of government but the community was divided on the speed of that development. China has given the Shenzhen special economic zone power to make its own laws, Reuter reports from Beijing. Just over the border from Hong Kong, Shenzhen, has had to rely on Guangdong province for its legislation until now. The decision was taken by the standing committee of China's parliament. The Shenzhen had argued it needed the power to help regulate its booming economy.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Cowie cash call for Pounds 16.3m buy - Acquisition of last of London Regional Transport's bus franchises Cowie Group, the car leasing and motor trading company, yesterday became London's largest bus operator, through the purchase of the last of London Regional Transport's 10 franchises, South London. The company is to raise Pounds 33.1m from a rights issue to fund the Pounds 16.3m acquisition, which follows Cowie's recent Pounds 29.9m purchase of Leaside Buses, based in north London. The 1-for-8 rights issue is priced at 190p. Cowie's share price rose 6p yesterday, to close at 224p. The group will now operate 1,000 local London buses. It has forecast that its bus and coach businesses - including Hughes Daf, the bus distributor, and Grey-Green bus and coach operator - will account for 25 per cent of next year's profits. Mr Gordon Hodgson, chief executive, described South London as a 'distressed sale'. It has been threatened with the loss of its licence if it does not improve vehicle maintenance standards by April 30. He is confident this can be achieved. The franchise made Pounds 23,000 profits on Pounds 18.8m turnover last year. However, a programme of fleet renewal will substantially lower maintenance costs. In addition, management will be centralised to cover Cowie's two London franchises, taking out more costs. Cowie is targeting 15 per cent operating profit margins, representing profits of Pounds 2.8m. Mr Hodgson said Leaside was already achieving double digit margins, compared with the 1.4 per cent achieved last year. The consideration for South London includes the payment of Pounds 6.2m of intra-group loans and goodwill of just Pounds 1.4m. Cowie also announced that pre-tax profits for 1994 would be at least Pounds 41m and that it would propose a final dividend of 6.4p, making 9.125p for the full year, up from 7.85p. Mr Hodgson said the group was looking to build up its bus operations in the UK further. 'We don't intend to stop here.' The group gets the additional benefit of selling new vehicles through its distribution arm. COMMENT Yesterday's rise in Cowie's share price was a fitting response to an astute realignment of the group. Motor retailers are hitting harder times, and their shares have acted accordingly. But by the end of next year, Cowie will make more money from buses than from car sales. Bus operators benefit from substantial economies of scale, and with three London operations, margins should rise sharply. Meanwhile the finance business continues to perform well, making up for flat car sales. On the company's own forecast, the shares are on a 1994 p/e of 9.8. Profits should reach Pounds 50m next year, representing a 9.5 p/e. Given the higher quality of earnings, and the management performance at Leaside, they offer good value.</p>

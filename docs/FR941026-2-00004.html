Risk analyses, which form the bases for the environmental assessments, have led us to conclude that shipment of the unlicensed veterinary biological products for field testing will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Based on our findings of no significant impact, we have determined that environmental impact statements need not be prepared. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Copies of the environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact may be obtained by writing to the person listed under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Please refer to the docket number of this notice when requesting copies. Copies of the environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact (as well as the risk analyses with confidential business information removed) are also available for public inspection at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. Persons wishing to inspect those documents are requested to call ahead on (202) 690&hyph;2817 to facilitate entry into the reading room.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Dr. Jeanette Greenberg, Veterinary Biologics, BBEP, APHIS, USDA, room 571, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782; telephone (301) 436&hyph;5390; fax (301) 436&hyph;8669.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  A veterinary biological product regulated under the Virus-Serum Toxin Act (21 U.S.C. 151  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> ) must be shown to be pure, safe, potent, and efficacious before a veterinary biological product license may be issued. A field test is generally necessary to satisfy prelicensing requirements for veterinary biological products. In order to ship an unlicensed product for the purpose of conducting a proposed field test, a person must receive authorization from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining whether to authorize shipment for field testing of the unlicensed veterinary biological products referenced in this notice, APHIS conducted risk analyses to assess the products' potential effects on the safety of animals, public health, and the environment. Based on those risk analyses, APHIS has prepared environmental assessments. APHIS has concluded that shipment of the unlicensed veterinary biological products for field testing will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Based on these findings of no significant impact, we have determined that there is no need to prepare environmental impact statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

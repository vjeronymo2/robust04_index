			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Fletcher Challenge sharply up Fletcher Challenge, the New Zealand-based forestry, energy and construction company, yesterday reported sharply higher group profits for the six months to end-December as a substantial restructuring led to exceptional gains in revenue. Consolidated group pre-tax profits rose to NZDollars 442m (USDollars 255m) from NZDollars 76.5m in the same period last year, on turnover down 13 per cent to NZDollars 4,313m from NZDollars 4,949m. Earnings per share were rose to 35.3 cents from 7.9 cents. The restructuring included a series of asset sales and the partial sale of the company's forestry division, which led to abnormal gains of NZDollars 350m. Mr Hugh Fletcher, chief executive, said that in the half year the company finalised five major sales, raising NZDollars 2.4bn, although payment for a number of these items was not received during the period. Fletcher Challenge floated the former stock and station agent Wrightson, and its retail property company, St Lukes, on the New Zealand stock exchange. Various Canadian assets were floated, and the company also sold its interest in Fletcher Challenge Canada and completed the sale of Methanex, the world's largest methanol maker, to Canadian interests. But immediate prospects for cash flow and earnings were difficult, reflecting problems in world commodity products. Sir Ron Trotter, chairman, said half-year earnings were in line with expectations - the success of the restructuring had been offset by deteriorating prices in many of the group's international product markets. He expected operating profits to be slightly higher in the second half. Sir Ron said that the restructuring had led to an improvement in the balance sheet, cutting the company's debt-to-equity ratio to 42.5 per cent from more than 60 per cent 18 months ago. The group's earnings after tax, excluding abnormals, were NZDollars 142m compared with NZDollars 98.4m. Earnings after abnormals were NZDollars 492.1m against NZDollars 153.5m. Sir Ron said future dividends will carry full imputation for New Zealand residents, who will receive a tax-free dividend of 6.25 cents a share, and 3 cents for each Forestry Division share. The restructuring has created three sets of financial results, with the formation of two subsidiaries, Fletcher Challenge Ordinary Division and Fletcher Challenge Forests Division, which have their shares listed in New Zealand, New York, London, Australia and elsewhere.</p>

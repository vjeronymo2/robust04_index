			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Arts: 'Bouncers' at the Riverside Much of our most important fringe theatre occurs in the London Borough of Hammersmith, which contains the Bush Theatre, the Lyric Theatre's Studio Theatre, and the three auditoria of the Riverside Studios. Right now, Riverside - under new management and with a new facade - has become again one of London's most important theatrical venues, valuable not least for bringing the city several of the most important shows seen during the Edinburgh Festival. John Godber's Bouncers - as performed by Godber's own company Hull Truck - is in Studio 2. Few Londoners realise quite how vital a part of British theatre Godber is today. Various Godber plays are staged by numerous regional theatres; and like Alan Ayckbourn, Godber writes plays conceived practically for regional small or medium-scale theatres. The success of April in Paris, which came to the West End for several months earlier this year, reminds us that he is by no means 'merely' regional. Bouncers is a finer, darker, and more complex work than April in Paris. It is a social satire about clubs and clubbing, and it looks the grimmest aspects of club life in the face. Yes, it shows us homophobia, misogyny, crass promiscuity, male aggression, sexual competitiveness. I was surprised to find how often it reminded me of the work of Steven Berkoff and how much more humane and subtle it invariably proved. Godber can make us laugh and shudder at the most grotesque depths of behaviour - men side by side at the pissoir, girls blatantly showing their sexual availability, gruesome jokes about snot and other excrescences, bouncers obliging each other to watch porno movies as a male-bonding ritual - but part of what is rare in his work is its eventual tenderness. He shows us human beings at their worst, and then he reminds us that, for all their fatuity, they are still utterly human. A misogynistic bouncer suddenly remarks 'Women. Weird. Why? They laugh at yer when you're naked' - and suddenly his vulnerability, which Godber leaves hanging in the air, becomes as interesting as, and connected to, his misogyny. Another rare feature of Godber's work is its selflessness. He does not draw attention to his own cleverness or wit; he simply keeps drawing our attention to new facets of his subject. The four performers in the current Hull Truck touring production do virtuoso stuff in changing persona - each one is a bouncer, a club girl, a club boy in turn, if not other roles too. But virtuosity is not the point of the show; transparency is. Damien Cruden directs; all four men - Chris Walker, Peter McNally, John Kirk and oh] especially the hilarious Andrew Williams - give performances that are at times astonishingly acute in the way they dissolve themselves into their various grim, funny, tough, hopeless, wounded characters. A few blocks north is the Bush Theatre, which is just about as important as the Royal Court for presenting new plays. As part of the London New Play Festival, it is currently showing Two Horsemen, a 65-minute one-acter by 'Biyi Bandele-Thomas (author of the recent award-winning Resurrections). Two Horsemen is one of those waiting-for-Godot existential affairs in which nothing happens to two men as they talk about life, death, resurrection, gender, sex, farting, and identity. The two men (acted by Colin McFarlane and Leo Wringer) are black, but their sense of identity changes during the play. They seem to commute between various lives even while they seem suspended in one eternal present, and occasionally they refer to themselves as female. The mixture of poetry, mystery, humour, and scatology is always arresting, and the play (directed by Roxana Silbert) receives a warm hand from its audience. But the taste it leaves in the mouth is ultimately contrived, fancy, precious. Bouncers is at the Riverside Studios, W6, until December 3; Two Horsemen is at the Bush, W12, until November 19</p>

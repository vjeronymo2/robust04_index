			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 1 (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general  secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of  China (CPC), called at the homes of a factory director, a  textile weaver and a bridge builder here on the occasion of the  International Labor Day today.    Accompanied by Wu Bangguo, secretary of the CPC Shanghai  Municipal Committee, and Huang Ju, mayor of Shanghai, Jiang  arrived at the home of Liu Tianfu, director of the Shanghai  General Factory of Corduroy, at about 9:00 in the morning. He  greeted Liu's family and praised Liu's spirit of fighting  against difficulties to extricate his factory from the  predicament of general debility. He said that he believes the  factory will surely get better and better.    Liu was former director of the Shanghai No. 17 bleaching and  dyeing mill, an advanced and profitable enterprise in Shanghai.  But he voluntarily gave up the post to become director of the  factory of corduroy, which had experienced general deficits.  Although his monthly income has been greatly reduced, Liu has  been mobilizing the workers and staff members of the factory of  corduroy to turn the factory around.    Jiang and his contingent next arrived at the home of Du  Yuying, a female weaver of the Shanghai Longtou Co. Ltd.  (formerly the Shanghai No. L7 Textile Mill) who has developed an  advanced method of looking after the looms and now studies the  subject of management at the China textile university. Jiang  encouraged Du to persist in studying and set an example for  other workers.    Afterwards, Jiang called on Zhu Zhihao, chief commander of  the construction of both the Nanpu and Yangpu bridges and one of  the ten top model workers in Shanghai. The two bridges are  among the biggest cable-stayed bridges in the world. Jiang  asked about the design and construction of the bridges and  encouraged Zhu and other bridge builders to catch up with world  levels in construction of bridges. He also had pictures taken  with the members of Zhu's three-generation family.    Hearing the news that General Secretary Jiang was calling at  the workers' living quarters, many residents lined the road or  stood on their balconies to applaud and extend regards to Jiang.  Smiling, Jiang waved back to the crowds and said to them:  "Happy festival."</p>

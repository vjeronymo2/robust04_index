			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Freddy Martin Perez] </F>   [Text] Guadalupe Tepeyac, Mexico, 5 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The  self-styled Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] allowed 17  journalists into this area in observance of the agreement with  Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation  in Chiapas State.    The caravan of journalists was received by some 150  inhabitants in downtown Guadalupe de Tepeyac, a village in  Chiapas State in southeastern Mexico. Local resident Manuel  Jimenez Santis said that residents are hopeful that hostilities  will end. The EZLN accepted Camacho Solis' proposal to create  two "free zones" or neutral areas in San Miguel and Guadalupe  Tepeyac and on 2 February ordered its followers to withdraw from  both areas.    The peace commissioner's proposal stipulates that once the  two "free zones" are created, the International Red Cross will  begin humanitarian aid and support operations for the civilian  population in these two places. Jimenez Santis said that  several dozen Lacandona jungle inhabitants have transferred  their sick for medical attention in response to the announced  arrival within the next few hours of International Red Cross  members.    Jimenez Santis summoned Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner  for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas State, to come and learn  the communities' most urgent needs. "We peasants have no land,  no work, we have no good food, housing, education, or health  care. What we want now is peace," Jimenez Sanits said.    NOTIMEX toured several communities and was able to verify  that food and medicines had become scarce, while here in  Guadalupe Tepeyac, where about 160 [as published] inhabitants  live, the Solidarity Hospital was unharmed by the conflict.    The Mexican Government and the EZLN have maintained a  cease-fire since 12 January following armed clashes that began  on 1 January and left, according to official reports, about 100  persons dead. Maria Gomez Hernandez, a housewife, said milk,  sugar, rice, flour, oil, and other basic staples are urgently  needed. She requested that Camacho Solis visit the area to work  within the peace process in communities isolated by the conflict.    Possibilities increased this weekend for the first direct  talks between the EZLN and the peace commissioner. "The  dialogue may start," Camacho Solis said when announcing last  night that both sides agreed on the discussion agenda after the  EZLN proposed on Friday to include the topic of "national  political life" without seeking agreements on this point.    In a message broadcast from San Cristobal de las Casas,  1,200  km southeast of Mexico City, Camacho Solis said that the  contents for the direct dialogue "is the agenda on which we have  mutually agreed."</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / International Company News: Argentina sets terms for YPF share flotation ARGENTINA hopes to raise a maximum of Dollars 2.5bn with the sale of 35 per cent of its national oil company YPF, scheduled for July 8 on local and international equity markets, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo said yesterday. Mr Cavallo said he plans to offer a minimum of 110m and a maximum of 126m shares out of a total 353m shares, at a price between Dollars 17 and Dollars 20 each. The government would thus raise about Dollars 1.87bn-Dollars 2.52bn. The final price, which is being constructed through the book building method, is to be announced closer to the planned flotation date. But Mr Cavallo said he expects YPF shares to be priced at about 10 times earnings. A further 24 per cent of the company will be reserved for the holders of government debt consolidation bonds, mainly old age pensioners. They would either be able to swap their bonds - valued at market price plus a 15 per cent premium - for cash raised through the flotation, or convert their bonds at par for YPF equity on condition of holding their YPF stock for a minimum of 12 months. The federal government will hold 20 per cent of the company, provincial governments 11 per cent and employees 10 per cent. Mr Cavallo said that YPF's statutes would contain anti-takeover clauses discouraging a single investor from taking more than 15 per cent of the company.</p>

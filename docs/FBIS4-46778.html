			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Choice of the Plants and </F> Factories Is To Live: They Are Saying This at the Top of Their  Voices to the Authorities Who Are Burying the Industry"]    [Text] The production slump in machine building over the  last 2 years amounted to more than 50 percent. In April, more  than 300 enterprises were operating on a reduced schedule, while  60 were shut down completely.    The wages of the majority of machine builders do not exceed  100,000 rubles, but even those are being paid on an irregular  basis. The enterprises' social sphere is being ruined, an  intensive exodus of skilled personnel is occurring and hidden  unemployment is growing.    The enterprises' privatization has not produced any positive  results and the unfair redistribution of collective property is  continuing.    The majority of the machine-building enterprises cannot  survive under the tax, price and financial conditions which the  government has proposed. The Russian machine builders' trade  unions have repeatedly proposed changing the orientation of the  economic reforms and easing their consequences, however, the  government is not adopting or is adopting very belatedly actual  measures based on our proposals.    Under these conditions, at the decision of their elective  organs, the Russian Federation Machine Builders Trade Union, the  Motor Vehicle and Agricultural Machine Building Workers Trade  Union, the Machine Builders and Instrument Makers Trade Union  and the All-Russian Elektroprofsoyuz [electrical machine  builders trade union] intend to organize on 1-3 June collective  protest actions against the policy of the organs of power and  administration, which is aimed at ruining machine building and  making the lives of the sector's workers worse, including the  picketing of the Russian Federation Government House on 2 June  by representatives of the machine-building enterprises' labor  collectives.  <H5>  The Demands of the Russian Machine Builders' Trade Unions </H5>   1. Support should be given to domestic machine building,  including on the basis of the implementation of the approved  special-purpose federal programs.    2. Urgent specific actions to overcome the mutual payments  crisis should be carried out.    3. The state's portions should be returned completely to the  agricultural producers, the defense departments and the MPS  [Ministry of Railways] -- the users of machine-building products.    4. The priority of payments for wages over other payments  should be established.    5. The government should ensure the fulfillment of  obligations based on the Agreement on Social Harmony and on the  General and Sectorial Tariff Agreements.    6. The number and amount of taxes should be reduced, the  procedure for their collection should be simplified and the tax  system should provide incentives for commodity producers.    7. Effective state regulation of prices for energy  resources,  transportation services, communications, individual types of  products, medicines and other services in the interests of the  basic mass of the population should be implemented.    8. An effective public employment system should be  established as quickly as possible.    9. The safety of Russia's citizens should be ensured.</p>

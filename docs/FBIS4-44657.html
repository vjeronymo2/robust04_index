			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sally Croft article: "Employment: JET Goes Critical"] </F>   [Excerpts] Moves by the European Parliament to remedy the  plight of British scientists working on the JET [Joint European  Torus] European fusion project near Oxford could lead to the  experimental programme grinding to a halt in April, and closure  of the project later this year, if a long-standing industrial  dispute is not resolved.    In an attempt to force the hand of the European Commission,  the Parliament voted in December to hold back a third of the  1994 European fusion budget plus ECU2 million (&pound;1.6  million)  to compensate British staff for discrimination they have  suffered in the past. The Parliament said it is withholding the  ECU59 million until the parties concerned are seen to be  cooperating with goodwill and determination to resolve the  underlying problems. [passage omitted]    As the JET project draws to its scheduled close in 1996 and  the AEA [Atomic Energy Agency] heads for privatization, the 220  British staff are becoming increasingly concerned about their  chances of getting a job on JET's successor project, ITER  [International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor], or elsewhere  in the Commission -- external candidates are only permitted when  there are no suitable internal applicants. On top of that, the  AEA says that its staff must resign before applying for Euratom  posts, a position endorsed by JET's ruling council. "Out of the  50 engineers and scientists appointed to ITER, so far about 20  people from JET have been selected, but only one of them is  British -- and he's an administrator," said one senior JET  physicist. [passage omitted]    The European Parliament's decision to withhold one-third of  the 1994 fusion budget is now beginning to bite. Although the  funding freeze has been spread across all the Commission's  fusion laboratories, JET is suffering a shortage of ECU28  million out of its ECU100 million budget. "Things are nearing a  critical stage," says George O'Hara, director for administration  at JET. "From 1 April we will have to start laying off staff  and making other cuts." [passage omitted]    At JET, O'Hara says, "it's impossible to be either  optimistic  or pessimistic at this stage, but I don't believe the project  will come to an end because of this wrangle." But Andreas Pott  [European Parliament Budget Committee secretary] sounds a note  of warning: "If they try to keep the project going by saving  money, they will be creating a very bad precedent for the next  project, when it comes to justifying how much money is needed."</p>

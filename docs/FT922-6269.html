			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Baker to join trade talks with EC TRADE NEGOTIATORS from the US and the EC will meet in Washington tomorrow in a test of whether last week's EC farm reforms can provide a basis for breaking a long-standing deadlock in the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation. Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, will for the first time join negotiations, which will tackle differences on farm trade, trade in services, and on market access. The EC yesterday described his entry into the talks as 'significant', suggesting the US gives high priority to finding a settlement. EC agreement on reform of its common agricultural policy, finalised after four days of negotiation last week, has raised hopes of a breakthrough on farm trade, over which the US and the EC have been at loggerheads for five months. US officials have persistently complained that they could not negotiate with an EC which was constantly changing its position on farm trade. However, EC negotiators have also made it clear that the CAP reform package is a 'take it or leave it' deal in which further EC concessions cannot be expected. The main EC concession is to cut wheat prices by 29 per cent over three years. This far exceeds US demands that EC domestic price supports for wheat should be cut by 20 per cent. It is also expected to lead to deep cuts in subsidised farm exports. The US has been demanding a 24 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised exports, and a 36 per cent cut in value terms. The EC wants the US to accept that the compensation payments to farmers, agreed under the CAP reform, do not distort production. It also wants the US to restrain exports of cereal substitutes.

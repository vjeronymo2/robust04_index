			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OIL FIELD OF DREAMS;  </P> <P> PARKLANDS: THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT DONATED LAND FOR A SANTA CLARITA VALLEY  SPORTS COMPLEX. BUT A TITLE SEARCH SHOWS PETROLEUM COMPANIES, AMONG MANY  OTHERS, HOLD RIGHTS TO THE PARCEL.  </P> <P> In the beginning, everybody agreed that the desolate stretch of land in Castaic  inhabited by lizards and a few hardy steers would make a great spot for some  ball fields.  </P> <P> Scouts for the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation reached  that conclusion after scouring the Santa Clarita Valley for a spot to build a  much needed sports complex. With private land too exorbitant to buy, parks  officials were happy when the Sheriff's Department offered to donate the land,  which it considered to be surplus.  </P> <P> The land was flat. It was conveniently located next to the county's regional  parks office. And the property was vacant except for two oil wells on the  periphery.  </P> <P> But the county's luck ran out quickly. The trouble began when county officials  learned that oil investors, who they didn't know existed, had rights to drill  almost anywhere on the property. If they wanted, they could legally erect an  oil well in the future on a baseball field pitcher's mound.  </P> <P> "We figured the Sheriff's Department had clear title, then the more we looked  the worse it got, the more complex it got," said Ruth Roess, a county park  planner.  </P> <P> A title search of the 51-acre spread uncovered more problems, said Jane Graham,  a senior real property agent in the county's Internal Services Department, who  is trying to help untangle the mess.  </P> <P> The real estate report showed that the title was clouded with 55 entities that  had current or old interests in the property. Many of the interests were held  by utility companies that have easements running through the property.  </P> <P> There also were some odd entries. The county discovered that the federal  government had reserved the right for someone to live on the property decades  ago. The federal government also had protected its right to enter the property  for purposes spelled out in the "Act of June 10, 1920 (42 Stat. 1063)." No one  has looked that up yet.  </P> <P> What's more, the county was surprised to learn that it doesn't even own the  entire acreage. Two or three acres are owned by Southern California Gas Co.,  with oil rights on that small plot shared by people who hold as little as 2/108  interest, the title report showed.  </P> <P> "It's unusual to have a little piece of property out there in the middle of  nowhere," Graham said. "You wonder, 'Gee, how did that happen?' They might not  know they've got it," she said, referring to the gas company.  </P> <P> The real estate snags have delayed the project for two years, said Etsel  Yamasaki, the park project coordinator. Neither Yamasaki, nor anyone else, can  say with any certainty whether the entire project can be saved. County  officials, however, said they are confident that at least part of the complex  can be built by designing the park to accommodate oil wells.  </P> <P> Plans call for the construction of a swimming pool, gymnasium, softball and  baseball fields, tennis courts and a playground.  </P> <P> The sports facilities are greatly needed, said Cecilia Foley, recreation  superintendent with the city of Santa Clarita. Several thousand softball  players now share just four city ball fields. Numerous teams have been waiting  for a baseball diamond for at least a year. The city triggered a barrage of  complaints this year when, in an effort to free up the fields for more teams,  it started limiting the number of teams a person could play on. "Everyone is  competing for the same space," Foley said.  </P> <P> The county is spending $80,000 to study whether the sports complex project is  feasible as proposed, should be cut in size or shelved. The studies should be  completed by January.  </P> <P> As part of the study, a consultant will try to pinpoint the location of the  many natural gas, oil, water and phone lines crisscrossing under the property  to see if they would interfere with the park's construction plans.  </P> <P> Others will try to contact everyone mentioned in the title report. The people  will be contacted to see if they would be willing to either abandon or sell  their claims to the property.  </P> <P> Elaborate efforts must be made to find all the missing people. Phone books,  motor vehicle and voting records and military rolls will all be used in the  search. And the hunt doesn't end if the person is deceased.  </P> <P> "Then you have to find out who their children were and where they are. That's  what we're up against," Graham said.  </P> <P> If a person cannot be found, the county must demonstrate to a judge that it has  exhausted all avenues before his or her claim is nullified. Sometimes it takes  a year to locate people or their heirs, but the county would not have to  postpone all work on the project until everyone is located, Graham said.  </P> <P> Perhaps the biggest decision for the county is whether it wants the sports  complex to coexist with oil wells.  </P> <P> The county received the encumbered piece of property in 1953 in a swap with the  federal government for land in the Angeles National Forest. As part of the  transaction, the federal Bureau of Land Management retained the mineral and oil  rights to the land. This fact never mattered because the land, fenced off as  part of the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho, wasn't used for much except cattle  grazing and crops.  </P> <P> Initially, county officials believed that they would only have to work around  two wells on the property that are owned by Commander Oil Ltd. But one day they  were contacted by a representative of another oil venture, which plans to erect  up to seven oil wells on or near the park site. The venture leased the oil  rights from the BLM five years ago and is only now getting ready to drill.  </P> <P> Kaye R. McCown, the geologist for the joint oil venture, said he has assured  the county that he and his partners want to cooperate.  </P> <P> "We hope to get all these oil fields in before they build the park, then it  will be easier for them to work around it," McCown said.  </P> <P> L.P. Brown III, the president of T&amp;F Co. in Beverly Hills, which is the  venture's financial backer, said the wells don't have to be eyesores.  </P> <P> "If anything, it might make this whole Santa Clarita Valley sports complex  aesthetically intriguing or interesting."  </P> <P> "You can paint them any number of colors," Brown said. But he added, "we won't  make them Art Deco or anything."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Ankara/Bonn (DPA) -- On Tuesday [5 April],  Turkey denied reports that weapons supplied by Germany are being  used in the fight against militant Kurdish separatists. Turkish  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman told DPA in Ankara that  the Turkish Armed Forces do not use the German weapons in  contradiction to bilateral agreements or their own commitments.  Turkish Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan had also reaffirmed this  last Friday, he said.    On Tuesday, in a letter to his Turkish counterpart, Hikmet  Cetin, FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel again called for the  observation of the NATO restrictions on the weapons supplied by  Germany. According to the Foreign Ministry, Kinkel referred to  the "recurrent assertions by politicians and media" that the  German weapons that were supplied according to NATO provisions  are used, contrary to the agreement, against the banned Workers  Party of Kurdistan (PKK). As early as on Monday, Kinkel had  appealed to the Turkish Government to use means of the  rule-of-law state for the prosecution of the Kurdish extremists  and to refrain from using weapons from Germany in the fight  against the PKK.    Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ataman said that the  representatives of the German media are apparently confusing the  BTR-60 and BTR-80 armored personnel carriers that had been  bought in Russia with the vehicles from the arsenals of the  former GDR [German Democratic Republic] People's Army supplied  by Germany.

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / EC applicants overcome the first hurdle THE FIRST and easiest round of EC membership negotiations with Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway was largely concluded yesterday, after two days of meetings in Luxembourg between foreign ministers of the 12 and the applicant countries. These set the seal on a four-month review of EC and applicant country legislation, to ensure a match and iron out the wrinkles. EC officials said this process was now 85 to 90 per cent complete. The enlargement negotiations are aimed at bringing the four countries - members of the loose European Free Trade Association (Efta) - into the EC in 1995. Anti-EC sentiment is running high in all four countries, which are committed to holding referendums before entry. They and the EC hope that Danish voters' change of heart in ratifying the Maastricht treaty in their second referendum last month will overcome Nordic and Alpine reticence. If all four were to enter, that would be the biggest expansion of the EC. The UK, Denmark and Ireland entered in 1973 - when Norwegian voters overturned their government's recommendation to join. Greece joined in 1981, followed by Spain and Portugal in 1986. 'I think it's fair to say the first part of the enlargement negotiations has been very successful,' said Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, foreign minister of Denmark, the current EC president. But the screening of legislation, supposedly easy after the EC and Efta agreed on a common free trade zone last year, has already thrown up problems, and far greater hurdles lie ahead. A range of problems has been ironed out, ranging from training regimes for Austrian dentists, Norwegian seatbelt regulations, and the number of bears Swedes can cull. The only really substantial agreement is to exempt Finland's privately administered public pensions scheme from current EC regulations, provided the companies concerned separate their life assurance operations from their other business. Finnish industry and trade unions regarded this accommodation as essential. After the summer, however, the placid flow of the negotiations will hit the rapids. All four want expensive regimes for their Arctic and Alpine farmers, subsidised at up to eight times the already high EC average. The Scandinavians also want to retain lavish regional policies to keep people in their empty northern territories. And Norway is determined to keep control of its own fisheries and energy. All four, moreover, fear the EC will lower their environmental standards, arguing that they constitute barriers to trade. The applicants also risk becoming embroiled in an emerging intra-EC struggle over whether to lower the threshold for decision-taking under the EC's weighted majority voting system. Federalist countries want a lower threshold - making it harder for countries like the UK to block EC decisions. The applicants are primarily concerned to get enough votes in the new arrangement.</p>

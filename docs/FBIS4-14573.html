			<p>BFN     [Text] A well-informed source in the Black Sea Fleet  headquarters reported to INTERFAX that in autumn of 1993 ships  of the Black Sea Fleet headed for Georgia's western coasts only  to stabilize the situation in the region of the port city of  Poti. Their second goal, and the main one, was to prevent a  large group of NATO ships from entering the Black Sea for  permanent duty.    In his words, late October 1993 representatives of NATO  Joint  Naval command held a sitting which passed a decision to include  the Black Sea into the zone of NATO's political interests. A  8-9-strong group of ships was supposed to be stationed for  permanent duty in the Black Sea to exert control over this  region. The source reported that the ships were to enter the  Black Sea on November 14.    This is why the Black Sea command made a decision to gather  an operative-tactical grouping which departed to the Caucasus'  coasts.    "If we had not done this they would have entered the Black  Sea," emphasized the source in the Black Sea Fleet headquarters.    He also underlined that on the whole, the activity of NATO  ships in the Black Sea is increasing. As an example, he  mentioned the fact that last year 15 NATO ships which were  conducting joint naval maneuvers together with Bulgarians and  Romanians in close vicinity to Russia's and Ukraine's southern  boundaries visited the Black Sea.</p>

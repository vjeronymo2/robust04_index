			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Survey of New Zealand (7): Unpopular sales prompt caution - Privatisation has proved to be a political liability Political problems have slowed the National government's plans to sell further state assets, in spite of the philosophical view of most of the cabinet that they should be in private hands. The government this year stalled speculation that it was preparing New Zealand Post and Electricorp for sale. It said it was honouring pre-election commitments not to sell them. However, intense behind-the-scenes pressure is being applied persuade it to sell other assets, such as state radio and television, the former ministry of works, Workscorp, the government computer services company and parts of the property company Landcorp. But conservative elements in the government are treading warily, and not all of these sales may happen, because of opposition from other political parties and the approach of the new 'mixed member proportional' (MMP) electoral system. Opposition parties are irate that the issue has even arisen, given the 'consensus' that is supposed to exist due to the government's narrow majority. Privatisation has proved a political liability. It was a major factor in the defeat in 1990 of the reformist Labour government, after it had rushed the sale of some NZDollars 12bn of state assets. On the campaign trail that year, Jim Bolger, the National leader, implied that there would be no further sales. So there was anger in some circles when the Bank of New Zealand was subsequently sold. Since then, despite the presence of staunch advocates of privatisation in the cabinet, only one other major asset, New Zealand Rail, has been sold. The Bank of New Zealand went to the National Bank of Australia for NZDollars 1.4bn, and New Zealand Railways to US railway company Wisconsim Central and a consortium of New Zealand investors for NZDollars 320m. Both sales proved unpopular with large sections of the public. Small shareholders in the Bank of New Zealand, who had no option but to sell, mounted a spirited protest campaign, saying it was being sold too cheaply. They now say that BNZ's subsequent strong profit recovery and reduction in bad-debt provisioning has proved them right. There were similar complaints over the sale of the national railway network. Trade unionists - embroiled in a bitter fight over plans by the new US owners to cut staffing levels on the Cook Strait ferries, the vital link between the North and South islands - are making much of the fact that the new owner is introducing American work practices and seeking to cut jobs. Polls suggest that most voters oppose selling 'the family silver', although there is a widespread acknowledgement that it is vital to reduce the country's indebtedness. Part of the problem is that Labour used little of the money it raised in paying off debt, in spite of promises to do so. National has been careful to use any money raised in asset sales for debt repayment. There is also continuing public concern that many assets were sold too cheaply. Telecom, for example, was sold for NZDollars 4.25bn to US phone companies Bell Atlantic and Ameritech, amid suggestions that it was worth twice that. It has proved a profitable investment for its US controlling shareholders. Philip Burdon, minister of state owned enterprises, said in May that public disquiet was the major reason why the privatisation programme had slowed. It was the reason why Electricorp and New Zealand Post were not being privatised. Mr Burdon said he had no philosophical objections to the government's selling the enterprises. 'I do not believe that state ownership is an effective form of administration.' He said there was public disquiet over the selling of public utilities. However, that did not extend to the sale of other assets such as the government computer company, GCS, which has been put on the market. Most interest appears to centre on the sale of Television Two, the second state-owned television channel. A number of buyers have indicated their interest, including both major newspaper publishing chains, Independent Newspapers, which is controlled by News Corporation, and Wilson and Horton, publisher of the country's biggest daily, the New Zealand Herald. Television New Zealand is fighting doggedly to retain the ownership. The 40-strong commercial radio network operated by Radio New Zealand is also expected to be sold. The major problem appears to centre on the future of public radio, the BBC-style network of the Concert Programme and national services broadcasting. The systems are linked, sharing news and current affairs staffs. The government is expected shortly to offer some NZDollars 2bn of low-interest mortgages owned by the Housing Corporation. Earlier it sold NZDollars 500m-worth to a consortium led by merchant bank Fay Richwhite. Maurice Williamson, one of the leading reformers in the cabinet, has been lobbying hard for the sale of the three major airports, in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, but has won no public support from his colleagues. The most imminent sale is that of the computer company, GCS. This runs a major installation at Wanganui, in the North Island, which centralises all police files and other confidential information on individuals. The government says that GCS will not be sold until a code of practice protecting confidential information is in place. The minister of finance, Bill Birch, said last month that there would be no fire sales, and that assets would be sold only when the government was confident of getting the best prices. 'But we do have a list of businesses for possible sale, which we consider are no longer appropriate for the government to own in today's environment.' Supporters of privatisation look bleakly at the future. They feel that this is the last chance to sell many of the remaining state assets. It is believed New Zealand will have minority governments under the MMP political system; and this, they say, would tie the hands of any minister of finance who might wish to sell any of the NZDollars 2bn of assets that have been prepared for sale.</p>

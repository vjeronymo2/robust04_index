			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with former South Yemeni President 'Ali </F> Nasir Muhammad, by Hasan Sabra; place and date not--first three  paragraphs are AL-SHIRA' introduction]    [Text] Former [South] Yemeni President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad  warns of the perils of the ongoing war in Yemen, asserting that  the "Yemeni states" that the ongoing war threatens to create  pose a threat to the entire region.    In a telephone interview with AL-SHIRA', the former Yemeni  president asserted that the crisis will be resolved through  dialogue only and noted that the "entire Gulf is for Yemen's  unity and for a peaceful solution to the problem."    Former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad pointed out that there  are taboos in the ongoing war, saying that "whoever approaches  the oil fields commits suicide" and that "it is difficult to  establish a fundamentalist regime in Yemen." Following is the  text of the interview:    [Sabra] What is your information on the progress of the war?  Will it turn into a war of attrition and of positions? Is there  a possibility of resolving it?    [Muhammad] What is going on now is attrition of Yemen's  military and material resources. The balance of power is what  will determine the course of the war on the ground.    [Sabra] There is talk now about a salvation government in  the  southern part of the country. Do you think that the return of  each part to its previous borders is projected as a solution?    [Muhammad] In principle, I am opposed to separation. I was  the first to sign the 1972 unity accord. My name has been tied  to numerous unity accords, to a united Yemen, and to some other  accords. I am opposed to secession.    [Sabra] How are matters proceeding now?    [Muhammad] The issue is no longer an issue of separation of  North from South or of returning to the pre-1990 condition.    [Sabra] There is repeated talk about mini-states.    [Muhammad] Yes, Yemen may break up.    [Sabra] Hadhramaut may become a state, for example, Ta'izz a  state, and Aden a state?    [Muhammad] Yes, more than one state may come into existence  and they may become a source of concern for the entire region  because of the strategic position Yemen occupies in the Red Sea,  the Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea, the Horn of Africa, and the  Arab Peninsula.    [Sabra] If there is danger from this war to the countries  adjacent to Yemen, then can these countries intervene and is it  possible that the entire issue will seem to be an invitation to  the neighboring countries to intervene?    [Muhammad] My information is that the neighboring countries  have declared their support for unity and that they are for  resolving the problem [peacefully]. GCC [Gulf Cooperation  Council] statements, the statements of Saudi sources in the  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and of all the other countries support  a peaceful solution to the problem. I haven't personally heard  of any plans for intervention.    [Sabra] Christopher has said that there are some countries  that help the South and others that help the North and that  weapons from neighboring countries are being amassed by the  Southerners and the Northerners. What do these statements mean?    [Muhammad] I know nothing specific about this issue. If the  Americans have learned of this matter, then I don't have  adequate information on the accumulation of weapons on both  sides.    [Sabra] Pelletreau [U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state  for Near Eastern Affairs] arrived in Muscat in this period  during which war is flaring in Yemen.    [Muhammad] I believe that his visit to Muscat came as a part  of a tour of the region. He also visited Yemen, Muscat, the UAE  [United Arab Emirates], Doha, and Bahrain.    [Sabra] Accidentally or what?    [Muhammad] I don't think that Pelletreau planned the tour to  coincide with the battles in Yemen. He happened to be in the  region on the first day in which the battles erupted.    [Sabra] Do you think that the war broke out because the  south  wants to return to the pre-1990 condition and because the north  wants to control both parts of Yemen?    [Muhammad] In fact, I am opposed to the names North and  South.    [Sabra] Well then, let us call them the YSP [Yemeni  Socialist  Party] in the South and the GPC [General Peoples Congress] in  the North.    [Muhammad] The problem isn't a problem of North and South.  We  are now a single people in Yemen. We can talk about the dispute  between the YSP and the GPC.  <H5>  They All Use Excuses </H5>   [Sabra] What does the YSP want of the war?    [Muhammad] They all use the Pledge and Accord Document as an  excuse. They all emphasize the issue of implementing the  Document. The YSP puts the emphasis on implementing the Pledge  and Accord Document.    [Sabra] But what has happened is the opposite.    [Muhammad] In one of my interviews with AL-SHIRA', I said  that the Pledge and Accord Document needs institutions to  implement it. I said that if the institutions, such as the  Presidential Council, the Cabinet, and the House of  Representatives don't agree, the alternative will be anarchy,  tension, and war.    [Sabra] It seems that agreement has turned into a devouring  act.    [Muhammad] What we are interested in is agreement, harmony,  understanding, and dialogue.    [Sabra] Is there still a chance of understanding and  dialogue?    [Muhammad] The door of dialogue is always open, and it can  never be shut.    [Sabra] Even if 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih reaches the gates of  Aden and occupies it?    [Muhammad] The door of dialogue remains open. People fight  and then engage in dialogue.    [Sabra] When 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih occupies Aden, what  dialogue will there be?    [Muhammad] I embrace the principle and I mean that the door  of dialogue remains open. I am not talking of who will occupy  what    [Sabra] Dialogue is possible if there is equality between  the  two sides. But if the situation turns into a situation where  there is a victor and a vanquished, then there will be  capitulation, not dialogue.    [Muhammad] One statement I have heard is that they haven't  closed the door of dialogue with the YSP. In his latest  statement, which I have heard through the media and on  television, the House of Representatives speaker said that he  will not close the door of dialogue with the YSP.    [Sabra] But words change completely when one of the two  parties is fighting at the gates of the other party's capital.  In this instance, the language of dialogue is suspended and the  language of bone-crushing begins. So, is there a possibility of  dialogue?    [Muhammad] I still stress the principle of dialogue. There  can be no solution without dialogue, even under the canopy of  war.    [Sabra] This is true. But who will conduct the dialogue?    [Muhammad] Didn't you have war and conflicts in Lebanon and  wasn't there dialogue afterwards?    [Sabra] Yes, but Syria entered Lebanon and conducted  dialogue  among the parties concerned after separating the combatants and  ending the war. Do you think that there is an Arab country that  can lead the dialogue in Yemen?    [Muhammad] In Yemen, Arab countries and the Arab League can  help the country overcome this crisis through dialogue, because  intervention will not help resolve the crisis.    [Sabra] What is the mechanism for Arab intervention? An Arab  League delegation arrived in Yemen and stayed there for four  days, but 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih didn't receive it. Salih didn't  answer Egyptian President Husni Mubarak for four full days.    [Muhammad] But he did receive the delegation recently.    [Sabra] He received it on Husni Mubarak's insistence. It  took  him four days to answer Mubarak's telephone call! This means  that he rejects any dialogue and any intervention by another  party. In your opinion, can an Arab country, such as Egypt,  Syria, or Saudi Arabia, conduct dialogue between the two sides  after putting a halt to the war first?    [Muhammad] Efforts by Egypt and Syria and, as I have already  pointed out, by the countries which contributed initially, such  as Amman [Jordan] and Oman, are needed.    [Sabra] How about the United States and France who have  their  observers?    [Muhammad] And the UAE and the Arab League as well.    [Sabra] And what about Saudi Arabia?    [Muhammad] I urged the brothers in the GCC at an early phase  to cooperate and help Yemen contain the crisis, because Yemen  and the Arab Peninsula are like one body. If a part of the body  is ailing, the rest of the body rallies to help it.    This is why I urge the brothers in the GCC to take any  initiative to halt the war, to conduct dialogue, and to impose a  peaceful solution. I have heard that they are eager to do so.  <H5>  Opposed to Arab Forces in Yemen </H5>   [Sabra] You have constantly opposed the presence of an Arab  army to separate the combatants because Yemen is a single  country and, therefore, there is no need for an Arab army. Do  you still hold to your opinion?    [Muhammad] By God, I do. President Mubarak has said: we  cannot be a policeman to separate the combatants. The Egyptians  have asserted that they are not for the intervention of forces  to separate the combatants. I still hold to my opinion because  the problem will not be solved by Arab forces but by dialogue.  The efforts of the Arab League committee can help.    [Sabra] When do you think the Arab countries will intervene?    [Muhammad] I have learned that the Arab League delegation  returning from Sanaa has asserted that the door of dialogue has  been reopened.    [Sabra] But this delegation was a military delegation,  headed  by Major General Sa'id Bayraqdar, former commander of the Syrian  forces in Lebanon. What I mean is that this delegation has no  political dimension.    [Muhammad] I have learned from reliable sources that Yemen  has emphasized its willingness to receive a delegation from the  Arab League and from the Arab countries.    [Sabra] Under the shadow of guns? 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi has  stated that in all battles, dialogue takes place on the  peripheries. It is dialogue under the canopy of war and guns.    [Muhammad] We went through this experience in the 1972 war,  the 1979 war, and the 1981 war. There were battles and there was  dialogue [simultaneously].    [Sabra] Could the war last another month?    [Muhammad] In my experience as prime minister, there were  wars with Sanaa. Through dialogue, we settled our problems and  contained the crisis.    [Sabra] At the time, you were two states. Now, you are a  single state in which one of the two sides excludes dialogue. It  is the opinion of this side that the other side is a group of  outlaws, not another state.    [Muhammad] We were two states, and yet we engaged in  dialogue. Now, there is a coalition government that includes all  sides.    [Sabra] Have you asked President Hafiz al-Asad to intervene  in the Yemen issue?    [Muhammad] I haven't asked President al-Asad to intervene  because Syria took the initiative on its own. Through telephone  calls with President Salih and Vice President al-Bid and with  the delegations dispatched to Damascus, President al-Asad has  asserted that Syria is keen on Yemen's unity and on a peaceful  resolution of the problems.    [Sabra] Is there a mechanism to activate this assertion and  turn it into a reality? Do you imagine that Syria would send an  army to Yemen to separate the combatants?    [Muhammad] This question should be addressed to the Syrians.    [Sabra] Could you, as a [former] Yemeni official and a  Yemeni  conscience, ask Syria to send forces to separate the combatants?    [Muhammad] I couldn't make such a request officially. But by  virtue of my friendship, I have urged the Syrian brothers to  redouble their efforts to contain the crisis, not to dispatch  forces. I cannot really talk about this issue.  <H5>  My Supporters Here and There </H5>   [Sabra] What does the presence of Brigadier General  'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur, who is one of your supporters, as defense  minister mean?    [Muhammad] It means that he is the defense minister.    [Sabra] What does it mean to you? Were you consulted or is  his appointment meant to please you and to solicit your  participation?    [Muhammad] Brother 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur is a YSP Permanent  Committee member. He is well known as my supporter, and I don't  deny this. He is also a certified military capability in Yemen.    [Sabra] Was he selected on agreement with you?    [Muhammad] You know that during the honeymoon between the  GPC  and YSP in 1989 and after my departure from Sanaa to Damascus,  there was, regrettably, a division...    [Sabra] Of power and weapons.    [Muhammad] And wealth and the clique. In the past, the  brothers in Aden used to call my faction the "clique."    [Sabra] And you called them the "band."    [Muhammad] This is why I say they divided power, wealth, and  the clique.    [Sabra] They ruined everything when they imitated  al-Qadhdhafi...    [Muhammad] When some brothers, including 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur  and Ahmad 'Abdallah al-Husayni, who was appointed navy commander  recently, joined the GPC, other brothers joined the YSP,  including Amin Hasan Yahya, 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Qadir, and  Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad, who are the latest to join the YSP.    [Sabra] Is this a Yemeni tactic?    [Muhammad] I have nothing to do with the way in which the  brothers have shared the clique. I left it up to the colleagues  to make their own choice, letting each select the party it  wishes to join because political action is subsidiary action.    [Sabra] There are those who believe that when 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih settles the situation in the South finally and isolates  the YSP, he will enlist your help so you will become the  alternative.    [Muhammad] I am not interested in power. What interests me  is  a studies center.    [Sabra] You need a country to establish a studies center.  Will there continue to be a Yemen so there can be a center?    [Muhammad] I am certain that Yemen will remain united, that  the capital will be Sanaa, and that the center will be in Sanaa.  But as to when the time to inaugurate the center will come, this  is something that I will leave for the future.  <H5>  Except Oil </H5>   [Sabra] If the oil fields are exposed to danger, do you  think  the Americans will intervene, either directly or indirectly?    [Muhammad] I don't believe the brothers will play with fire  in this region.    [Sabra] Will these battles spare the oil fields?    [Muhammad] It isn't permitted to get close to the oil  fields.    [Sabra] And if they do?    [Muhammad] It isn't permitted. Moreover, this oil doesn't  belong to the Americans. It belongs to the Yemeni people.    [Sabra] This is true theoretically. But practically, the  Americans are the party that will benefit form the oil.    [Muhammad] The fires will not burn the Americans and [their]  firms but the Yemeni people's interests and wealth.    [Sabra] Will the United States intervene to protect the  Yemeni people's interests or its interests?    [Muhammad] I don't believe that the fires will get close to  the oil fields. The battles that have taken place so far haven't  affected the wells or the companies operating there.    [Sabra] If one of the two sides senses that it will lose the  war, is it possible that this side could use the oil card to  blackmail, pressure, or ambush other countries to intervene?    [Muhammad] It is my assessment that whoever does such a  thing  will commit suicide and will meet his end. Whoever thinks of  such a thing is a madman who doesn't deserve respect and doesn't  deserve to live in Yemen.    [Sabra] What is the solution to the current situation in  Yemen?    [Muhammad] God knows.    [Sabra] It seems that you aren't pleased with the conditions  in Yemen.    [Muhammad] And neither are you.    [Sabra] When I first called you, you expressed your  willingness to speak as if you possessed new given facts.    [Muhammad] All the statements are conflicting statements  now.  I believe that what is going on in Yemen now is a crime against  the Yemeni people.    [Sabra] How do you explain the emergence of 'Abdallah  al-Ahmar with such prominence in the past two days?    [Muhammad] He is one of the coalition leaders.    [Sabra] His statements have been so overwhelming they make  it  sound as if he is the actual ruler in Yemen.    [Muhammad] I don't think so. He is one of the parties to the  ruling coalition.    [Sabra] Salim Salih says that Yemen is approaching a  fundamentalist regime.    [Muhammad] It is difficult for me to confirm this. I don't  believe that the fundamentalists can gain power. Anyway, the  religious tendency is a participant in the coalition, with the  GPC and YSP.    [Sabra] It is also a participant in the conflict.    [Muhammad] Yes.    [Sabra] Do Salim Salih's statements sort of incite the  United  States and the neighboring countries against the fundamentalists  and scare them with the fundamentalist presence in Yemen?    [Muhammad] I have heard no such statements.    [Sabra] He made them this evening.    [Muhammad] It could be some sort of propaganda warfare.    [Sabra] May God protect Yemen from what is more dangerous.    [Muhammad] We appreciate your concern for Yemen and your  followup on the situation there.    [Sabra] We have supported Yemen's unity enthusiastically.    [Muhammad] We are torn by the news we hear. My heart aches  for Yemen because this issue concerns unity of the entire Arab  nation. We appreciate your interest in and your followup on  Yemen. We hope that problems will be solved, that the wounds  will heal, and that we will meet soon.    [Sabra] God willing.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arab affairs correspondent Ehud Ya'ari] </F>   [Text] As Israel's disengagement from the Gaza Strip  continues, here is some food for thought. The IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] completed its pullout one week earlier than  originally agreed upon in Cairo. This of course was carried out  with the agreement of the PLO and the subsequent result is that  only one third of the Palestinian forces slated to enter the  area have indeed assumed their stations and the Palestinian  Authority has yet to be established.    Second, the first impression made by the Fatah units  entering  the Gaza Strip was better than many Israelis had initially  feared. Now, however, things are not looking so good. Looting  has become quite widespread in the Gaza Strip and many telephone  cables, air conditioners, and other objects have been stolen.  The Fatah army has no money. It cannot afford to purchase gas  for its vehicles or even food for the troops. In several  places, complaints have been received that soldiers are eating  at restaurants without paying. The majority of the troops have  not received sufficient training in police work.    Third, if money does not arrive quickly from foreign  sources,  Israel may have to supply the Palestinians with urgent financial  aid in order to pay for immediate expenditures. This sum could  reach several million shekels.    Fourth, there is a great deal of tension among Fatah  operatives in the Gaza Strip who fear that they are being pushed  aside by 'Arafat's veteran officers. The open tension between  the Fatah activists and the police commanders occasionally  precludes cooperation.    On the political level, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]  has adopted a wait and see approach, while forbidding prisoners  to sign any declarations of support for the peace process.    Meanwhile, Fatah has failed to drum up support for an  agreement on the establishment of new municipal councils in  Nabulus and Hebron. These are all labor pains, of course.  'Arafat wants to differentiate between the Israeli withdrawal  and the establishment of his authority. However, seeing as at  the present time, there is no real authority in the Gaza Strip  to replace Israel's partial control, difficulties can be  expected even in the event of a best-case scenario.</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT;  </P> <P> FINAL BARING OF 'OH! CALCUTTA!' SET  </P> <P> They're baring all for the last time.  </P> <P> "Oh! Calcutta!" will close Aug. 6 after a Broadway run of 5,959 performances by  the nude revue, executive producer Maria Di Dia announced today.  </P> <P> "It's been an exciting ride, and I'm sad to see it end," Di Dia said. "But I'm  also happy because no one ever expected this show to succeed."  </P> <P> The current edition of the show opened Sept. 24, 1976, at the Edison Theater.  It was the second major incarnation for the revue, which premiered in 1969 at  off-Broadway's Eden Theater, moved in 1971 to Broadway's Belasco Theater and  ran there until the following year. The show has been seen by more than 85  million people in 18 countries and has grossed more than $350 million.  </P></p>

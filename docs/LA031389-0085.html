			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE  </P> <P> Walking the Coals With Baby No Sweat to Moms  </P> <P> Is the way to the delivery room paved with burning coals?  </P> <P> Mary Russell, a North County hypnotherapist, thinks maybe so. For years she has  taught a course on "Childbirth Fulfillment With Hypnosis" in Escondido to  reduce the fear and pain of childbirth. Now she's added a new (and optional)  touch: fire walking.  </P> <P> Russell figured that if expectant mothers saw how hypnosis allowed them to walk  pain-free across 7 feet of hot embers, their terror of the delivery room would  diminish. So four of her students gathered recently in the back yard of  Russell's home in the San Pasqual Valley.  </P> <P> First came a three-hour lecture by Russell's husband, who is also a  hypnotherapist and regularly conducts fire walking exhibitions. Next, The Walk.  </P> <P> "There was no heat and no pressure," said Kari Hillstrom, 24, of Oceanside, who  is expecting her first child in August. "It was so amazing; it was staggering."  </P> <P> "I wanted to reassure myself that this hypnosis stuff really works," said  Carolyn Peterson, 42, a reading specialist for Fallbrook schools, who is  expecting her second child. "Now I'm a believer."  </P> <P> Mary Russell says the four-for-four success rate is not surprising, and she's  thinking of adding fire walking as a regular feature of her class.  </P> <P> "It's all a matter of increasing the frequency of your personal vibrations to  direct your mind away from pain," she said.  </P> <P> It may be a while before the American Medical Assn. adds fire walking to its  prenatal suggestions. None of the four mothers-to-be dared tell their  obstetricians in advance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Those Are Fighting Words  </P> <P> The editor calls it "an unfortunate simile."  </P> <P> The activist calls it "the most lowdown, degrading, awful thing I've seen in my  50 years of politicking." She's talking to her lawyer.  </P> <P> At issue is a punchy paragraph in the recent pre-election edition of the  Residential Reporter, an intermittent publication of the Coronado Residential  Assn. since 1954. Of Coronado City Council candidate Susan Keith, the Reporter  reported:  </P> <P> "In the minds of many people, Keith is  </P> <P> associated with a small band of articulate, ultra-conservative citizens, whose  inflammatory rhetoric and untempered accusations in and out of our council  chambers mimic the antics we have come to expect from the children of the  Ayatollah."  </P> <P> Lula Coleman, a Keith supporter and longtime civic gadfly, says those are  fighting words, and she's not pacified by the fact that Keith, a slow-growther,  won a narrow victory last week over the candidate endorsed by the residential  association.  </P> <P> "You can't compare people to the Ayatollah and get away with it," she said.  "What if my grandchildren read that?"  </P> <P> Jane Winn, the editor, says the paragraph was trying to show how the activists  who besiege Coronado City Hall and the demonstrators in Tehran both rev up  their rhetoric when the press is present.  </P> <P> "It wasn't meant in a political way," she said. "It was only meant to show they  act alike when the cameras appear."  </P> <P> </P> <P> News From the Front  </P> <P> The guerrilla war against the SDG&amp;E sellout to Southern California Edison  continues:  </P> <P> * San Diego City Atty. John Witt was in Washington on Friday to brief the  county's  </P> <P> congressional delegation on the city's opposition to the merger. So far, the  four local reps have stayed neutral, which they insist is unrelated to the fact  that they've all received campaign contributions from either SDG&amp;E or  Edison.  </P> <P> * Encinitas Mayor Anne Omsted, a member of the San Diego County Water  Authority, is wearing a "Being Sued by SDG&amp;E Is a Power Trip" T-shirt. On  the front, an orange lightning bolt; on the back, a copy of the cover sheet of  SDG&amp;E vs. County Water Authority.  </P> <P> * Consumer advocate Michael Shames, who last week revealed an internal  SDG&amp;E memo suggesting that rates may increase under Edison, has established  a hot line for utility employees seeking to leak inside information: 270-7880.  </P></p>

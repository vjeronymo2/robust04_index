			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Example 2A_Investment Grade Rating Applied to Portion of Pool Covered by Standby Letter of Credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The XYZ Company is seeking the highest possible credit rating on an asset-backed commercial paper issuance that is backed by a large, well-diversified pool of trade receivables. A total of $200 million of commercial paper is issued against the pool, which contains $212 million worth of trade receivables. Thus, there is $12 million of overcollateralization available to provide loss protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To obtain the highest rating for the commercial paper, the XYZ Company also purchases a standby letter of credit from Bank B that covers the next $20 million of losses after the $12 million of overcollateralization. This letter of credit provides loss protection analogous to the middle-level subordinated class of securities in Examples 1A and 1B above. A nationally recognized statistical rating organization provides a formal credit rating of investment grade for the position, i.e., that portion of pool losses that represents the exposure to be covered by the $20 million letter of credit. As a result, under the Agencies' first alternative for application of the ratings-based multi-level approach to this type of transaction, risk-based capital would be assessed against the $20 million standby letter of credit at the 100% risk-weight, based on its credit equivalent amount. That is, Bank B would not be required to hold capital against the additional $180 million supported by the standby letter of credit. If the rating given to the letter of credit was not at least investment grade, then Bank B would be required to hold capital at the 100% risk-weight against the credit equivalent amount of its letter of credit and all senior classes that it supports (in this case, against $200 million).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Example 2B_Investment Grade Rating Applied to the Entire Pool of Assets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The details of the transaction here are identical to those of example 2A, except that the investment grade rating provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization is not on the second loss position, but on the entire $212 million pool,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> prior <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to the addition of Bank B's standby letter of credit. As a result, under the Agencies' second alternative for application of the ratings-based multi-level approach to this type of transaction, risk-based capital would be assessed against the $20 million standby letter of credit at the 100% risk-weight, based on its credit equivalent amount. That is, Bank B would not be required to hold capital against the $180 million of the pool that the standby letter of credit supports, but does not cover. If the rating given to the entire pool prior to the addition of the letter of credit were not at least investment grade, then Bank B would be required to hold capital at the 100% risk-weight against the credit equivalent amount of its letter of credit and all the senior classes that it supports (in this case, against $200 million).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Example 3_Investment Grade Rating on First Loss Position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the Agencies adopt the proposed alternative to treat certain ``first dollar loss'' enhancements that have a formal credit rating of at least investment grade in the same manner as qualifying second dollar loss enhancements, the following example would apply:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank C issues two classes of securities that are backed by a $212 million, well-diversified pool of auto loans_a subordinated class of $12 million and a senior class of $200 million. Bank C retains the bottom-level class and sells the other class to either a banking organization or thrift.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the high credit quality of the underlying loans, a nationally-recognized statistical rating organization gives the $212 million pool of auto loans a rating equal to one level above investment grade on a stand-alone basis. The $12 million subordinated class is given an investment grade rating. Since this class is rated investment grade, risk-based capital would be assessed against it at the 100 percent risk-weight, based solely on its carrying value. That is, Bank C would not be assessed any capital against the senior class it supports. On the basis of the high credit quality of the underlying loans, and the loss protection provided by the subordinated class, the same rating organization gives its highest credit rating to the $200 million senior class. Since this is the most senior class, has the highest possible credit rating, and all prior enhancements are performance risk-free, risk-based capital would be assessed against this class at the 20 percent risk-weight. Table 3 summarizes this example.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

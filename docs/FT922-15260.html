			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Hogg disappoints with decline to Pounds 16.8m DEPRESSED investment income and losses in its Australian business held back profits at Hogg Group, the insurance broker, despite strong growth in new business. The group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 16.8m, down from Pounds 17.1m in 1991. Earnings per share were down to 15p compared with 16.4p last year. The final dividend is maintained at 5p making a total for the year of 8.15p, up just 1.9 per cent. The group's dividend cover is 1.85 and it has cash available for potential acquisitions. The City, however, was unimpressed marking the shares down 19p to close at 167p. The fall in investment income to Pounds 7.45m (Pounds 9.56m) masked an 11.4 per cent rise in profits from insurance broking to Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 11.9m) on the back of a 10.7 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 111m (Pounds 100.2m). The UK operations performed strongly with revenues rising to Pounds 60.1m (Pounds 51.9m), with rates rising by an average of 5 per cent. Profits from the group's Lloyd's members' agents fell to Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 1.04m) and from divested managing agents to Pounds 2.27m (Pounds 2.87m). Other activities contributed Pounds 210,000 and exceptional items Pounds 490,000 (Pounds 750,000). COMMENT Of all the listed UK brokers, Hogg is most dependent on low margin retail business - which accounts for 75 per cent of its income. Over a third of its business is generated in the US where insurance rates remain depressed and about 60 per cent of its investment funds are in dollars. Add in the maintained final dividend, the fact that about 15 per cent of its business is with the Lloyd's market and that its Lloyd's agency business faces a couple of troubled years ahead and it is easy to understand the market's negative reaction to yesterday's dip in profits. Even so there were some positive aspects. Outside Australia new business growth has been strong, expenses were reduced by two percentage points last year and, in the longer term, the group has more than doubled its broking profits in the last five years. For 1992 profits of Pounds 18m can be expected lifting earnings per share to about 16p, which on yesterday's closing price of 167p leaves the group on a prospective p/e of under 11. That seems cheap for a sector trading on a historic multiple of over 15.</p>

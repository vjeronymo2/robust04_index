			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MODJESKA CANYON;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS CHALLENGE PLANS FOR HOUSE  </P> <P> In what some members of this sleepy canyon community called the largest show of  civic unity in years, Modjeska Canyon residents on Thursday challenged county  plans to renovate the historic house once owned by renowned Shakespearean  actress Helena Modjeska.  </P> <P> Fearful that a county proposal to build a 14-acre historic park around the  century-old home would shatter the pastoral calm of Modjeska Canyon, more than  100 residents of the 180-home tract filled a community center to object to the  plan.  </P> <P> The Modjeska house would be a centerpiece in county plans to create a historic  park in Modjeska Canyon.  </P> <P> In addition to planning guided tours of the historic home, the county wants to  install a nature trail, picnic grounds and exhibit hall on the site. Special  events, such as music recitals, poetry readings and art exhibits, could be held  at night under the county proposal.  </P> <P> However, alcohol and amplified music would be banned, said Kathie Matsuyama,  senior landscape architect for Orange County and project coordinator for the  Modjeska home.  </P> <P> Helena Modjeska settled in Orange County more than 100 years ago, and the  Polish native entertained internationally known luminaries in the sprawling  bungalow's heyday.  </P> <P> Designed by Stanford White, one of America's finest architects, the building is  said to emulate architecture of the East Indies, most notably in its open  porches at both ends.  </P> <P> The county plans to open the home to the public in 1991, when structural  repairs are expected to be finished. The county may allow weddings, receptions  and other events to take place on the grounds.  </P> <P> Residents of the village under Modjeska Peak fear increased traffic and  boisterous wedding parties would destroy the solitude they enjoy.  </P> <P> The county bought the house when it was severly decayed in 1986 for $1 million.  In addition to the purchase price, the county invested $320,000 to do emergency  repairs, which are still under way.  </P> <P> The county has several plans to hold down traffic when the home opens to the  public, such as free on-site parking intended to keep visitors from leaving  their cars along public streets and an off-site parking lot served by shuttle  buses. The county may also require buses for wedding parties or other groups  that receive permits to use the grounds. FRANK MESSINA  </P></p>

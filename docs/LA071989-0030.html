			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Senate brushed aside complaints that President Bush is packing the ranks of  the nation's envoys with unqualified political cronies and defeated a bid to  restrict political appointments to 15% of the diplomatic corps. The vote  rejecting an amendment by Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) was 79 to 20. Gore  said he would try again today and offered an amendment to hold to 30% the  number of ambassadors and senior State Department officials nominated for their  political contributions. But Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and others contended  that the proposed restriction would represent an intrusion on the President's  ability to conduct foreign policy.  </P></p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec struggles to reach consensus on output cuts MINISTERS FROM the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries were struggling last night to find common ground enabling them to agree a cut in production that will support world prices. Meanwhile the oil market took fright at the hard task confronting the thirteen ministers. Oil prices dipped on reports of unease at the meeting when North Sea Brent crude for March delivery dropped by 22 1/2 cents to Dollars 18.27 1/2 a barrel. The producer's club has focused on the need for a cut in output of 1.2m barrels a day to 1.5m b/d, representing a 5 to 7 per cent cut on overall production of 24.2m b/d. But ministers were in tense negotiations over the details last night. Saudi Arabia is being pressed by some smaller producers to agree to a new round of production quotas which shows meaningful cuts in individual countries' production. The kingdom has in the past preferred a more informal approach and, in any case, insists that any new quotas should be based on current capacity rather than historical production. Saudi Arabia is more sanguine over the outlook for oil demand in the second quarter and puts the call on Opec oil at 23m, and doers not want to cut its own output much more than 500,000 b/d from the present 8.5m b/d. On the other hand, Mr Celestino Armas, Venezuelan oil minister, believes demand will be lower than 22m b/d and that Opec should cut output accordingly. Ministers from countries such as Venezuela and Algeria are under intense political pressure from home to secure an agreement that will give some fillip to oil prices. Many traders believe that a cut of 1.5m b/d will do little more than support prices and that the producers must cut by much more if they are to boost prices during the traditionally weak second quarter.</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Company car tax proposal attacked THE CONSULTATION period for the Inland Revenue's proposed new regime for taxing company cars closed yesterday amid a chorus of criticism, with at least one accountancy group warning that 'there will be considerably more losers than winners' if it is adopted unchanged. The Revenue proposes 12 price bands with each higher band covering a successively wider range of car prices. The advantage seen in such a structure is that it would be particularly sensitive in the Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 19,500 region in which company cars are concentrated. The Revenue claims that about 1.2m company car drivers would gain. It also acknowledges that there would be 700,000 losers, some of whose tax bills could rise by up to 40 per cent. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders voiced 'profound' opposition to the proposed retention of price 'banding' to assess the tax benefit payable on the personal use of company cars. The SMMT argued that any new regime should be based solely on a fixed percentage of list prices, with the exception of very expensive makes such as Rolls-Royce and Aston Martin. The Revenue's proposals aim to make what is in effect a crude banding system  -unchanged in all essentials since it was introduced 16 years ago - fairer to company car users. The proposals are also intended to meet criticisms from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The commission says the current system distorts the market by obliging manufacturers to produce 'tax-break specials' - which cause market bunching - and may disadvantage specialist manufacturers such as Jaguar. The system uses a combination of price bands and engine sizes to determine tax liability. Honda results, Page 10</p>

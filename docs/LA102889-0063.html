			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY SPOT: BOAT SHOW AT MUSEUM IS A MODEL OF PERFECTION  </P> <P> The remote-controlled boats in the channel next to the L.A. Maritime Museum  this weekend are definitely not those little $19.95 kit models. No way. This is  serious stuff. These are one-of-a-kind boats ("scratch boats" in model-boat  parlance) and they cost $300 and up. Most are 4-5 feet long: tugs, fishing  boats, steam wheelers and more.  </P> <P> Model Boat Clubs of Southern California is sponsoring this two-day  Radio-Controlled Model Boat Show at the museum. It's a chance for local  builders to show off the fruits of their long labors. The boats will be on  display inside the museum for close inspection of the intricate handwork  involved and then taken outside to the channel for maneuvers. Some squirt water  and have whistles. Boat builders and operators will be available to answer  questions.  </P> <P> Save time to explore the museum itself. The exhibits include 15-foot cutaways  of the Titanic and Lusitania as well as more than 200 boats of all  descriptions. The museum is at Berth 84, at the foot of 6th Street, San Pedro.  Show hours today and Sunday are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Donations of $1 are requested  in lieu of admission. Information: (213) 548-7618.  </P></p>

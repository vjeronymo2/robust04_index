			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Navy believes a Trident 2 missile that failed during a launch attempt last  week suffered a mechanical failure in the first-stage nozzle mechanism, the  Pentagon said. Dan Howard, the Defense Department's chief spokesman, said the  Navy had managed to recover some parts of the missile from the ocean floor off  Cape Canaveral, Fla., and to analyze more of the radio telemetry data from the  launch. "They have determined from the telemetry at this point that the  difficulty was not with the guidance system or any of the electrical systems,"  Howard said. "The most likely suspect is a mechanical failure in the nozzle  mechanism."  </P></p>

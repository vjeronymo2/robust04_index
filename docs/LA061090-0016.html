			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: ANTIQUES;  </P> <P> MAKING THE OLD NEW  </P> <P> IF THE TERM antique prints conjures up dull images of black-and-white bird  studies, then you've never paid a visit to Emma-Louise Hayley's gallery. The  white walls of the gallery are covered from floor to ceiling with beautifully  framed prints spanning the late-17th to early-20th centuries.  </P> <P> There are early-19th-Century engravings of monkeys ($1,050 each framed),  eccentric 17th-Century designs for fountains (about $400) and illustrations  from the "Voyages of Captain Cook" (starting at $495 each).  </P> <P> Hayley, who scours Europe for her pieces, says it's time for people to stop  associating antique prints with the cluttered look of the Victorian period. "A  lot of things that are very old can look very modern," she says. "What I'm  trying to do is create new ways to present (the prints) so that it's possible  to use them in contemporary interiors."  </P> <P>  Emma-Louise Hayley, 8642 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles; (213) 657-9580.  </P> <P> NICOLE YORKIN  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Vodeau in Moscow] </F>   [Text] In an interview with THE BALTIC OBSERVER in Moscow  March 5, out-spoken Russian nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  said that "my people and supporters are safeguarding the  interests of Russians wherever they live, including the Baltic  states."    He added that his views, which many regard as harsh if not  insane, are a defensive reaction to the assault on Slavic  nations from the Baltics to the Balkans and beyond.    "The present government," said Zhirinovskiy with a wave of  this hand "has betrayed the nation and doomed it to extinction.  This is real genocide. Look at Bosnia. Nobody but us  prevented Sarajevo from being bombed by the allied NATO forces.  I made it quite clear that the NATO attack on Sarajevo would  mean an outbreak of war with Russia, and the generals over in  the West figured it out."    In Zhirinovskiy's view, NATO is trying to isolate Russia by  inviting the Baltic countries and other Eastern European nations  to join the Partnership for Peace program, and by surrounding  Russia and the Serbs with enemies.    "NATO plans to completely isolate Russia and Bosnia. In  Bosnia, part of its population is to be converted to  Catholicism, while the rest are to become Muslims.    "Now look, Russia is surrounded by Islamic countries in the  south from the Balkans to Turkey and Central Asia. In China,  there are 1.2 billion Chinese, in the West, Germans and Balts.    "In fifty years, there won't be any Russians left, except in  Moscow, Vologda, and Arkhangel'sk in the north. The last 10 to  15 million Russians would kick the bucket there," Zhirinovskiy  said.    He added that these strikes against Russia and the Bosnian  Serbs showed that "the Third World War is on, but in the West  they're afraid of Russia's powerful arsenals, so they destroy us  economically."    He bemoaned the passing of great Russia, saying that "once  Russia was proud of its ballet, space explorers, science, and  powerful army, but no more."    Another problem confronting Russia, in Zhirinovskiy's view,  is the influx of refugees from other countries.    "We must stop this wave of refugees, except for Russians.  Many of them are fleeing oppression in the Baltic and Asian  states    "A ban should be introduced for traders and profiteers, they  mustn't be let in our towns and villages. And send away all  foreign students," Zhirinovskiy said.    All foreigners, he said, have to have visas.    As for his future plans, Zhirinovskiy told THE BALTIC  OBSERVER that he has his eye on Russian President Boris  Yeltsin's job. He believes that the presidential elections will  take place long before June 12, 1996, and that "if we elect the  wrong leader again, and take the wrong path, it would be  unpardonable."    On a final note, Zhirinovskiy said "for three months now,  they have been calling me a Russian Hitler. Can you imagine?  All these years, my people and I have been honest and sincere."</p>

Mr. Ruan, reviewing last year's economic progress, said that  the island province had produced a gross national product (GNP)  of RMB [renminbi] 19.14 billion, 18.9 percent up over the  previous year while the total industrial output value was RMB  9.3 billion or a 28.9 percent rise. The agricultural output  value was RMB 8.45 billion or a 6.2 percent gain. Fixed assets  investment was RMB 13.5 billion or a 55 percent increase and the  actual use of foreign investment was U.S.$730 million or a 62  percent growth.    The balance of bank savings deposits at branches of national  banks operating in the island was put at RMB 33.5 billion by  late last year, 22 percent up over earlier in the year. All  these figures indicate healthy economic development in the  province.    The island, Mr. Ruan said, would grab the opportunity this  year to quicken its economic exploitation. The planned GNP  aimed for in Hainan this year is put at RMB 25 billion, 18  percent up from last year. The island will concentrate its work  in several sectors to achieve this end.    First, the rural economy will be strenuously exploited in a  bid to increase the peasants' income and protect their  interests. The planned agricultural output value set for this  year is RMB 9.3 billion or a rise of ten percent over last year  and township enterprises RMB 7.5 billion or a gain of 60 percent.    Second, technological renovation of industrial enterprises  will be speeded up, including the automobile industry,  construction materials, natural beverages, pharmaceuticals,  clothing and electronics. The building up of industrial bases  will be accelerated to bring in domestic and foreign advanced  technology. The expected industrial output value set for this  year is RMB 12.1 billion, 30 percent up over last year.    Third, domestic and foreign markets will be earnestly  developed while tertiary industry will be exploited at an  extraordinarily fast pace with tourism as its driving force in  order for the island to get into the international market.    Fourth, the investment pattern will improve with an emphasis  on the building up of 24 key projects with a planned investment  of RMB 7 billion this year. A number of projects including an  airport, power plant and expressway will see their construction  speeded up while work on the start of the Yangpu Economic  Development Zone and the Haikou Bonded Area must be quickened to  bring in foreign investment.    Fifth, social order will be strengthened while various  social  undertakings will be carried out, a move creating a sound  environment for domestic and foreign investors.    Mr. Ruan stressed the importance of legislation in the  market  economy and the pushing forward of reform. A legal system must  be established as soon as possible to keep pace with the market  economy, putting basic economic relations, market behaviour and  market transactions in order.</p>

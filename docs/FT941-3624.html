			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Amoco plans restructuring to cut costs Amoco, the fifth largest US oil company, is considering a big internal restructuring to reduce costs and raise its performance. The plan would replace Amoco's three operating companies with leaner business units, and reduce the corporate staff to a minimum. At the moment, the operating companies, in production, refining and chemicals, represent the core of Amoco's operations. Mr Larry Fuller, Amoco chairman, told staff the restructuring would eliminate much of the company's cost structure but there would also be a significant transfer of personnel and a net loss of jobs throughout the corporation. He said it was too early to be specific about the impact of these changes, but he hoped decisions would begin to be made by early summer. The reorganisation follows the disappointing performance of Amoco stock which lagged behind the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year. The present three-company structure dates from the 1960s and has left Amoco less competitive than it should be, Mr Fuller said.</p>

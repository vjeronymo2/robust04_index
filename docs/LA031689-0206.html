			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BUSH TALKS WITH ASTRONAUTS IN ORBIT  </P> <P> Discovery's astronauts took a long-distance call today from President Bush and  set off a spectacular ice storm in space.  </P> <P> Reviving a presidential space tradition that had lapsed since 1985, Bush  praised shuttle commander Michael L. Coats and his crew as "today's pioneers,"  invited the Discovery astronauts and their families to visit the White House  and pledged "to go forward with a strong, active space program."  </P> <P> The astronauts also thrilled Mission Control with video of a 10-minute  artificial blizzard -- 23 pounds of water that turned instantly to ice off  Discovery's port wing during a routine fuel cell purge.  </P></p>

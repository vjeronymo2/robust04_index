The party has made big gains among the middle classes so it  is, for the first time, level pegging with the Conservatives  among this group of voters.    The latest MORI poll for The Times underlines how Labour has  advanced strongly since the late summer, largely at the expense  of the Liberal Democrats. Labour now stands at 48 per cent,  compared with 42 per cent last August, while the Liberal  Democrats have slipped from 25 to 20 per cent. The Tories are on  28 per cent, the same level, plus or minus one point, they have  been on since the Newbury by-election nine months ago.    It is striking that the party's rating has not shifted over  the past month, despite the headlines about the personal lives  of some Tory ministers and MPs, the row over back to basics and  the recent arguments about tax increases. This suggests that  Tory support has probably bottomed out and is now down to a hard  core.    That can be read as either some comfort for the Tories that  their position is not deteriorating, or worrying that there is  no sign of any pick-up -- especially since this is the same  level of support that Labour had at its low point during Michael  Foot's leadership.    The Labour advance has been most striking among the middle  classes, now two-fifths of the electorate. Tory support in the  middle classes has fallen steadily since the late 1970s, even  though its national share of the vote has declined only slightly.    Even when the Conservatives were in serious trouble in the  middle of previous parliaments, the party was still well ahead  of Labour among these voters. In the late summer of 1990, when  Labour was last at 48 per cent nationally, it trailed the Tories  among the middle classes by 32 to 49 per cent.    At the 1992 election, the Tories were ahead of Labour among  the middle classes by 54 to 22 per cent. Now, the two parties  are level at 37 per cent. Labour remains well ahead of the  Tories among working class voters.    This shift in the middle classes is particularly serious for  the Conservatives since it threatens their heartlands in the  South of England. The latest poll shows that Labour has moved  into the lead in the South, including Greater London. The party  now has 39 per cent support, ahead of the Tories on 31 per cent  and the Liberal Democrats on 28 per cent.    Both the opposition parties have advanced at the Tories'  expense in the South since the general election -- Labour doing  well in the South East and the Liberal Democrats in the South  West. This means that a sizeable number of Conservative marginal  seats are under threat.    Also worrying for the Tories is that Labour has moved well  ahead among the elderly. It now has the support of 50 per cent  of pensioners.    There is no sign of any recovery in the ratings of either  the  Government or John Major. Just 13 per cent are satisfied with  the way the Government is running the country, with 80 per cent  dissatisfied, the same as last month.    A mere 21 per cent are satisfied with the way Mr Major is  doing his job as Prime Minister, with 71 per cent dissatisfied.  This is only just above the low points touched last summer. Only  just over a half even of the reduced number of Tory supporters  are satisfied with Mr Major's performance.    Even though Labour has strengthened its position over the  past month, John Smith is still not making much impact with  voters as Labour leader. Exactly the same number are satisifed  as dissatisfied with the way he is doing his job as Labour  leader, following three months when his rating has been  positive. Paddy Ashdown's rating as Leader of the Liberal  Democrats remains favourable, though it has slipped steadily  since the autumn.</p>

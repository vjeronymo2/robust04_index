			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Bosnia plan put at risk by flare-up in fighting: Izetbegovic likely to recommend parliament's rejection of peace proposal THE FUTURE of the Bosnian peace plan appeared to be hanging in the balance yesterday, with reports of renewed fighting and growing civilian suffering in Bosnia. Amid confusion about the proposed role of the United Nations and the European Community in the peace plan, an EC official yesterday admitted that the Community had not been fully consulted about the plan's unexpected suggestion that it should take over administration of the disputed southern city of Mostar. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, announced that he would call a meeting of the Bosnian parliament on Friday to discuss the plan, which was presented to the three sides in Geneva last Friday. But, speaking in the central city of Zenica, he indicated he would probably recommend that the assembly reject the plan, in spite of pressure from the international community to accept the deal - a move likely to exacerbate the splits in the multi-ethnic Bosnian leadership. The three sides in the conflict have until next Monday to decide on the plan, which would give the Moslem-dominated Bosnian government up to 28 per cent of Bosnia - considerably less than its delegation originally demanded. Reports of renewed fighting yesterday left all three sides accusing each other of seeking to grab territory in the run-up to the resumption of talks next Monday. Sarajevo radio reported fresh Serb attacks around Brcko, the port designated under the peace plan for Bosnian access to the River Sava in the north, and Radio Belgrade reported overnight Moslem attacks near Serb-held Doboj, northern Bosnia. An Unprofor spokesman in Zagreb said the UN could not confirm reports of further fighting in central Bosnia, but confirmed clashes between Croat and Bosnian forces around Mostar. Ms Lyndall Sachs, UNHCR spokeswoman in Sarajevo, bitterly criticised the Croat forces around Mostar for their refusal to let aid convoys into the city, where up to 50,000 mostly Moslem inhabitants have been trapped in the east of the city for more than two months with minimal food and water. Although the UN managed to take a token supply of medicine into Mostar over the weekend, Ms Sachs yesterday said negotiations between the Spanish peacekeeping troops and Croat forces about access for food convoys had so far failed to yield results. Mostar residents now faced a real danger of starvation, Ms Sachs said. When the UN vehicle went in there over the weekend it was besieged by people begging for food. 'Our colleagues have seen people thin and starving there. It is a desperate situation,' she said. Meanwhile, amid the signs of growing confusion about the future role of the UN and EC in any future settlement of Bosnia, the 12 EC member states were last night locked in consultations on the administration of Mostar. Foreign ministries of the 12, and the European Commission in Brussels, were still digesting the idea, EC officials said. 'There is at present not that much detail on how this would work, or who exactly would deal with it,' said a spokesman for the Belgian presidency of the EC. 'This idea was floated in a rather haphazard way and there certainly wasn't any previous consultation with anybody in the 12.' But officials are not ruling out a role for the EC in Mostar analogous to the suggested role for the UN in Sarajevo. EC member states, in most reckonings, would have to guarantee the military security of Mostar, and would have to pledge new money to Brussels' now exhausted humanitarian aid budget.

"Arrangements are now being made in that direction," vice  finance minister Jiro Saito told reporters.    Bentsen will make a stopover in Tokyo on his way back from  visits to other Asian nations.    Saito said no official decision on the meeting has been  made,  nor has a possible time been set.    The meeting, if realized, would probably be to "exchange  views frankly," he said.</p>

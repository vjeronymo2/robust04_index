			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed ALB/MTH: "Claes: You Must Fight for Peace </F> and Stability Every Day"]    [Text] Oslo/Brussels, 16 Jun (BELGA) -- "West Europe has  enjoyed 50 years of peace and prosperity. Contrary to what many  young people believe, this is not to be taken for granted. You  must fight to maintain this stability every day," Belgian  Foreign Minister Willy Claes declared at a NATO seminar in Oslo  on Thursday [16 June].    The Belgian minister spoke of the "new strategic triangle"  formed by the European Union (EU), the United States, and  Russia. "It is vitally important for all of us to build a solid  and balanced collaboration between these three major players,"  Mr. Claes declared in a communique issued by the Foreign  Ministry in Brussels.    As regards the United States, the minister welcomes the fact  that it wishes to continue to fulfill its role in Europe,  coupled, however, with a greater effort by the Europeans  themselves.    On the subject of Russia, Claes stressed the difficulty in  predicting the country's future, as well as its future internal  and external policy. It was clear last week at the NATO meeting  in Istanbul that Russia is increasingly emerging as a major  power. The problem is also to know how Russia can be positively  included in the "strategic triangle" of which the minister spoke.    As regards the EU, the minister regretted that the joint  foreign and security policy still has a great deal of progress  to make and that the Union does not have adequate resources to  deal with a crisis such as in the former Yugoslavia.    Mr. Claes pointed out that under the Belgian EU presidency,  no effort had been spared in promoting dialogue with the United  States, and that the EU was going to sign a partnership  agreement with Russia in Corfu. "It is hoped that this  agreement will support the country's economic reforms and  stability," the minister said.</p>

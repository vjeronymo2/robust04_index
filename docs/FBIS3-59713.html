			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Japanese Aero Engines Corporation (JAEC)  (Director, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries President Kosaku  Inaba) has opened the ``Preparatory Office for Small Engines''  within JAEC in order to officially conduct a study for the  development of small engines to be mounted on the  next-generation small jet liner, the YSX. Planning Division  Director Kuniyo Yamanaka of Aerospace Operation Headquarters,  Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, has been selected as an  acting director of the office. The work began with several staff  members beginning preparations for the development/manufacture  program and basic design.    Originally, the study of development of small engines for  the  75-seat YSX was conducted by engine makers such as IHI under  contract from Japan Aircraft Development Corporation (JADC).  When MITI switched its role as a contractor to a supporter after  FY91, JAEC ended up taking charge. JAEC has conducted a  feasibility study on overall plans for engine design, cycle, and  structure/weight, and has completed the small engine design  concept.    Intending to promote international efforts to develop the  engines, JAEC presented their concept paper to major U.S. and  European engine manufacturers for comment. JAEC has conducted  market surveys in the United States and Europe and technical  evaluation of engine performance and configuration as they  pursued and upgraded the program, which started in FY91, in both  FY92 and FY93. In addition, they have held discussions with  engine manufacturers in the United States and Europe, as part of  their effort to internationalize the development program.    Decisions have been made on the technical concept and  partner  selection, on the other hand, on the airframe development  program. The Preparatory Office was established to expedite  development of the engine area to a level which corresponds to  the progress made on the airframe program. MITI has requested  &yen;200 million in the FY94 budget for the small engine  development study. JAEC will assign the Preparatory Office to  conduct a study in FY94 of the development/manufacture program  and basic design.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BULLDOZERS SCULPT ORANGE COUNTY'S 'CROWN JEWEL'  </P> <P> The rumble of earthmovers can be heard above the roar of the surf these days  along the coast between Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach in Orange County.  </P> <P> The work signals the start of development of a 9,400-acre expanse of coastal  land, the crown jewel of Orange County's old Irvine Ranch and one of the last  large undeveloped shoreline tracts in Southern California.  </P> <P> Development plans were hammered out over more than two decades of debate  between the Irvine Co., which owns the land, and local environmentalists.  </P> <P> Finally, a year and a half ago, they agreed on a plan that will keep  three-fourths of the area as public parks, including nearly all the land on the  coast side of the highway, while still allowing creation of a resort community  with two golf courses, 2,600 mostly hilltop homes and up to four hotels.  </P> <P> Now an army of yellow bulldozers, earthmovers and water trucks can be seen  traversing the hills inland from Coast Highway, cutting a path for Pelican Hill  Road, a 55 m.p.h. artery that will link the planned new coastal development  with the city of Irvine.  </P> <P> The $40-million road, scheduled for completion in late 1991, will stretch 6  miles inland and link up with the proposed San Joaquin Hills Transportation  Corridor, which will intersect MacArthur Boulevard.  </P> <P> The Irvine Co.'s project manager for the coastal development, Bernard  Maniscalco, said the planned community will contain "some of the most expensive  housing in Orange County."  </P> <P> He said the company is working with "five major Orange County builders," whom  he declined to identify, on plans for construction of 570 "very special" tract  homes.  </P> <P> Perched on slopes adjacent to Pelican Hill Road, they will sell at prices "in  the order of $1 million" when they begin to hit the market in late 1990,  Maniscalco said.  </P> <P> In addition, he said, the company in 1991 plans to open the golf courses,  including four holes on the ocean side of Coast Highway, and to begin selling  custom home sites, including 55 parcels in a golf course-ringed seaside enclave  to be called Cameo del Mar, and large hillside lots with expansive ocean views.  </P> <P> On a slope called Wishbone Hill will be gated communities of homes with 10,000  to 25,000 square feet on estates of 2 to 7 acres.  </P> <P> Maniscalco said the company is also talking with hotel operators. Although no  one has made a firm commitment, he said, those who have expressed interest in  the proposed hotel developments include Marriott Corp., Stouffer Hotel  Management Corp., Hyatt Corp. and Princess Hotel International. He said his  "best guess" is that the first hotel will open in 1993.  </P> <P> While only the well-to-do will be able to afford homes in the resort  development, Irvine Co. officials stressed that there are substantial  provisions for public recreation and wildlife conservation in vast reaches of  coastal and interior land.  </P> <P> Much of the canyon land yet to be deeded to the county over the 10- to 15-year  build-out of the project is not visible from Coast Highway. It has been  off-limits to the public while under the ownership of the Irvine Co., which  used it for cattle grazing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Park of the Park  </P> <P> Most of the land on the ocean side of Coast Highway plus one inland canyon are  already part of Crystal Cove State Park, which the state acquired from the  Irvine Co. in 1979. There will also be a 2,666-acre county wilderness park,  three separate canyon parks totaling 1,100 acres and 367 acres of golf courses.  </P> <P> Eric Jessen, chief of planning and acquisition for county harbors, beaches and  parks, said that from the top of the proposed wilderness park hikers will be  able to see "everything from La Jolla 50 miles to the south to Palos Verdes 40  miles north and beyond. . . ."  </P> <P> Planners are trying to keep the parkland dedications contiguous, company and  environmental officials said, to reduce disturbance to wildlife, including  coyotes, deer, foxes and even some badgers and mountain lions.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, there are foes of the development who want more of nature  preserved. A sign on Coast Highway announcing the Pelican Hill Road project has  been repeatedly splattered with paint by protesters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wildlife Corridors  </P> <P> Elizabeth Brown, a biologist and president of Laguna Greenbelt Inc., an  environmental group fighting to retain open space, said she fears that Pelican  Hill Road will obstruct wildlife corridors in the canyons and force deer and  coyotes into the path of traffic.  </P> <P> Irvine Co. officials, who are providing technical support to the county in  construction of Pelican Hill Road, contend it has been carefully sculpted to do  minimal environmental damage.  </P> <P> Carol Hoffman, the Irvine Co.'s vice president of entitlement for the coastal  project, acknowledged that "there had to be trade-offs" in plans for the resort  development.  </P> <P> For instance, she said, the company agreed to avoid construction in canyon  bottoms, where native vegetation and animals abide, on the condition that it  may grade and build on ridge lines that offer scenic vistas.  </P></p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Bosnia on the Brink: Clinton urges Europe to back decisive action THERE was one overriding message in US President Bill Clinton's stern but measured reaction to the vote by the Bosnian Serb assembly, and it was not directed at a Balkan leader, but squarely at western Europe. 'America is willing to do its part,' he declared, 'but Europe must be willing to act with us. We must go forward together.' In case these words were insufficiently clear, he talked of the dangers of 'further instability in other parts of Europe that could be exceedingly damaging'. He had ordered his secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher, now in Europe, to be 'insistent that the time has come for the international community to unite and act quickly and decisively'. He would not act 'rashly' in Bosnia, he said. The US was seeking 'not to do things that would draw the US into a conflict not of its own making and not of its own ability to resolve'. This is perhaps the first public recognition by Mr Clinton that the divisions between the US, western Europe and Russia over what to do next in Bosnia are serious. There have been plenty of reports of the problems Mr Christopher has encountered on his mission but no admission from the president himself that they could not be overcome. His warning reflects the most fundamental of political realities at home, reinforced almost daily by senior members of congress, that there is a minimal domestic constituency for US intervention in Bosnia unless it is part of a collective operation. Mr Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House foreign relations committee, was yesterday merely the latest in a long line of political heavyweights to wonder if the US would be right to act alone. Military strikes, he said, were probably now more likely than before, 'though not, I think, for a few days'. But, he added, 'there really is great confusion as to what the American national interests are and what we ought to do'. Mr Clinton has probably still bought himself a little time, at least now until the conclusion of the Christopher mission, suddenly more vital than ever, or some outcome in the UN Security Council acceptable to the US. But the US political and public discontent with Europe is now quite palpable. Senator Richard Lugar, the Indiana Republican just back from Russia and the Balkans, expressed some sympathy with the European dilemma, pointing to its problems of waging a war while in recession, but he also warned of the wider consequences to the continent, from Greece to Germany, if the conflict were not stopped. Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, who had travelled with Mr Lugar, talked of militarising the current UN presence in Bosnia and of setting a clear deadline for offensive strikes. Like Mr Clinton and Mr Christopher in Europe, neither thought the promised Bosnian Serb referendum should be considered a factor. Both stood foursquare behind Mr Clinton. In the current and intensifying US debate, less attention and justification is now being accorded to the moral imperatives in Bosnia, though the president again referred yesterday to 'ethnic cleansing that offends the world's conscience and our standards of behaviour'. But, having spoken, Mr Clinton was back working the international telephone lines, with President Francois Mitterrand of France reportedly first on his immediate agenda.</p>

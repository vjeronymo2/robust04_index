			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Judgment on hold in Latin America IN what was billed as the first important indication from the Clinton administration about its views on Latin America, the US will tell the InterAmerican Development Bank today that the region is to be a top priority in Washington. Whether Latin Americans will take these words at face value is another matter. The official due to give this keynote speech - Mr Larry Summers, the deputy to treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen responsible for international affairs - will be in Washington working on the package of support measures being proposed for Russia. The words will instead be delivered by Mr James Fall, deputy assistant treasury secretary for developing nations at the Treasury. 'It's an interesting signal,' said Mr Enrique Garcia, a former Bolivian planning minister, on Mr Summers's absence. Latin Americans may further be led to question US intentions when they learn that some relief agreed by the Bush administration on debts of some Latin American countries to the US government has been cancelled by the Office of Management and Budget in its search for budgetary cuts. A US official said much of the debt relief announced in December and January  -when agreements were signed with Argentina, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador Jamaica and Uruguay - has been struck out for budgetary savings of about Dollars 90m. This debt relief was one element of the Enterprise for Americas initiative launched by President George Bush in June 1990. This initiative, hailed in Latin America as offering a new basis for partnership with their powerful northern neighbours, included relief on modest sums of debt owed to the US government, the establishment of a fund to encourage reform of investment regimes and the prospect of a free trade area from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. The loss - perhaps only until another tax year - of a small amount of debt relief, and Mr Summers's non-appearance may be only symbolic. But then the Enterprise for Americas was at least as important symbolically as in substance. A slap in the face is unlikely to be intended by the Clinton administration - but that may be what is inferred. As the thousands of bankers and investors in Hamburg for this conference testify, Latin America does not, at least for now, present the administration with a foreign policy crisis. Mr Summers's speech will underline that the furtherance of the region's economic and democratic reforms 'remains a priority'. There will be continued encouragement for market-oriented reforms of which privatisation remains an important element. The InterAmerican Development Bank will be the main vehicle in support of these objectives, along with a heightened concern for social issues: health, education and the environment. But for most of Mr Fall's listeners today, the most important words will be on trade, in particular on how the Clinton administration views the idea of a hemispheric free trade zone. Latin American governments, having unilaterally lowered trade barriers, worry that the hitherto open US may become more protectionist under Mr Clinton. 'Latin America is the fastest growing market for US goods,' said Mr Enrique Iglesias, president of the IADB. 'We have to convince the US that we are part of the solution, not part of the problem.' The administration is also committed to negotiating a trade agreement with Chile. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, says he favours the extension southwards of the North American Free Trade Agreement, already signed with Canada and Mexico. Yet it is clear that this vision differs in important respects from that of President Bush, with its emphasis on economic growth. Mr Kantor talks of the importance of Nafta in 'harmonising upwards workers' standards' and emphasises that the US supports Nafta on the basis that new side accords are negotiated on labour standards and the environment. Some Nafta supporters worry that the tougher the restrictions imposed by the side agreements, the fewer the companies that will be interested in moving south to take advantage of Mexico's cheaper labour. That would please American trade unions but render the accord less useful to a Mexican government seeking investment. Indeed, if the Clinton administration's vision of a hemispheric free trade area includes ideas such as these, it is less likely to receive widespread acceptance in Latin America's capitals.</p>

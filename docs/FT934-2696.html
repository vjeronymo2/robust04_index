			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Haggling clouds Gatt hopes on services: Negotiators on financial, shipping and audio-visual sectors at loggerheads US and European Union negotiators were still at odds last night over some elements of the key services sectors, providing one of the main hitches in what appeared early today to be significant progress towards a wide-ranging Uruguay Round agreement. While Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt's director general, railed at the US and the EU for failing to settle their differences, negotiators on financial, shipping and audio-visual services remained at loggerheads in spite of intensive meetings throughout the weekend. Trade officials questioned what would be left of any agreement to liberalise trade in services if commitments in banking, securities, shipping and the entertainment industry were minimal. In literal terms, it would include trade in insurance services, tourism, construction, professional services, consultancies, and limited easing on the movement of workers, but these are small by comparison with the three sectors blighted by dispute. One senior official called for negotiators to rein in their ambitions in order to make compromise possible. He reminded negotiators that present disputes ignored how much more ambitious the agreement to liberalise services had become since the decision in Punta del Este in Uruguay in 1986 to bring trade in services into the Gatt. 'At Punta del Este we were talking only of a framework of rules for services. It was only in 1990 that countries raised their sights to the idea of getting commitments to liberalise. It is true that most of the offers today offer little more than standstills, but at least that is a start. They provide a foundation for us to work from in future rounds.' Mr Larry Summers, US deputy treasury secretary, yesterday challenged this view: 'We have not achieved what the US financial services industry was hoping to achieve in 1986,' he said shortly after arriving in Geneva He insisted the US had 'very substantially modified its position' since summer, when negotiators were warning they would withdraw their financial services offer completely if other countries did not come forward with better market-opening offers. 'We think that everyone's legitimate interests are protected by the two-tier most favoured nation option we have proposed. Those who have made serious commitments to national treatment will get a full set of commitments from the US.' He complained that many countries were still refusing to guarantee access to foreign banks and brokers no worse than that currently available. Negotiators are understood to be considering whether some kind of carve-out could be managed for financial services which would allow negotiations to continue beyond the December 15 deadline for completion of the Uruguay Round agreement. Officials question how a services agreement could be completed in such circumstances, or even whether the entire Uruguay Round package would not be jeopardised if commitments on financial services remained unclear. On maritime services, negotiators gloomily predicted that ocean shipping now seemed unlikely to remain in the Uruguay deal, after EU officials discovered on Thursday that a US offer was much more limited than originally expected. The most critical 'round-breaking' issue remained the US-EU row over access to Europe's television and film industries. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said yesterday he felt all other differences could be settled if compromise could be found on the audio-visual issue. Mr Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, insisted that 'we are really trying to be flexible'.</p>

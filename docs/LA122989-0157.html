			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GEORGIA MAY CUT SHRIMP SEASON OVER COLD WEATHER  </P> <P> The Department of Natural Resources is reconsidering its decision to extend the  shrimping season through January because of a recent cold snap that decimated  the shrimp population in coastal waters, a department official said today.  </P> <P> Informal talks with shrimpers this week indicated that the cold spell had  reduced the shrimp population. The department confirmed the damage Thursday  when the majority of shrimp caught during test trawling near Brunswick were  dead, said Duane Harris, director of the department's coastal resources  division.  </P> <P> "The water temperatures got extremely low, probably as low as we've ever  recorded. The majority of what we caught yesterday are dead," Harris said. "At  this point we're reconsidering the decision to extend the season to January."  </P> <P> The agency decided last month to extend the commercial season because shrimp  were abundant in coastal waters. But, Harris said, that decision appears moot  since most of the adult shrimp have died. He said the department wants to  protect the small number of shrimp that survived the freezing temperatures.  </P> <P> Commercial shrimpers are concerned about the weather's impact on juvenile  shrimp, also known as "over-winter" shrimp, which make up the spawning  population for the 1990 harvest, said Frank Mathews, owner of Mathews Seafood  in Savannah.  </P> <P> "There may have been damage to the juvenile shrimp that stayed on the inside  (in shallow coastal waters), the ones that didn't migrate (to deeper, warmer  water)," Mathews said.  </P> <P> "Over-winter" shrimp do not migrate from shallow waters until spring when they  mature and hatch a new crop of shrimp, Mathews said.  </P> <P> Test trawling will continue next week throughout coastal Georgia, and Harris  said he expects the news to become grimmer.  </P></p>

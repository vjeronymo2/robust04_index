			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL DISTRICT'S BAN ON R-RATED FILMS TOSSED OUT  </P> <P> In a case closely watched around California, a school district's ban on R-rated  films, including such acclaimed movies as "Apocalypse Now" and "Rain Man," has  been declared unconstitutional.  </P> <P> The Contra Costa County Superior Court ruling Friday by Judge Richard Patsey  stops the district from enforcing a 1986 policy that banned movies based solely  on the Motion Picture Assn. of America's rating system.  </P> <P> The San Ramon Valley Education Assn. filed a lawsuit against the district in  1988, maintaining that the ban violated teachers' rights to free speech.  </P> <P> Teacher Dianne Mayer, one of four teachers named in the lawsuit, used to show  "Das Boot" when teaching World War II history to juniors at California High  School.  </P> <P> "I feel (the ruling) is just another vindication for the teachers trying to  keep education open for the students," Mayer said. "I think the teachers are  professional enough to make decisions of what is of educational value.  </P> <P> "If they can get away with (outlawing films) with schools, then they can get  away with it with books and newspapers and freedom of speech, press, assembly,"  she said. "It's a dangerous first step."  </P> <P> Patsey's ruling states that the board cannot rely on the MPAA's guidelines for  rating films.  </P> <P> "Those who do the rating for the MPAA need have no qualifications or experience  in education," Patsey wrote. "The rating system does not concern itself with  educational quality or utility."  </P> <P> The policy was spurred by a parent's complaint about "The Emerald Forest" being  shown at Del Amigo Continuation High School.  </P></p>

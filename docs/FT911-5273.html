			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Rolls-Royce discusses Thai joint venture ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine maker, is in discussions to expand its capacity in the Far East which may include a joint venture in Thailand to make components for its products and supply the local market. Senior officials of the company, including Sir Ralph Robins, the chief executive, held talks in Thailand, Indonesia and Japan on a visit that ended last Monday. 'We held initial talks in Thailand about the local manufacture of components for our range of aerospace products,' Rolls-Royce confirmed yesterday. 'We are interested in gaining new sources of manufacturing . . . But we are at a very early stage of discussions.' The company is still closely associated with the British engineering industry, a legacy of its days as part of the group that also made Rolls-Royce cars. While a large percentage of the company's components is manufactured in Britain, a significant proportion is sourced overseas, including some high-technology elements such as turbine blades. Rolls-Royce has joint-venture arrangements with companies in Australia, Spain, and Italy. The Rolls-Royce executives also discussed possible future orders in Japan and plans for engine production at the Indonesian plant during their visit.</p>

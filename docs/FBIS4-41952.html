			<p>BFN     [Text] The additional powers granted to the law-enforcement  bodies by the president shall only be used in relation to  individuals suspected of banditry or membership in a group of  criminals who have committed serious crimes, says the joint  directive on the procedure of implementing the decree, signed by  acting Prosecutor-General Aleksey Ilyushenko, Interior Minister  Viktor Yerin and Director of the Federal Counterintelligence  Service Sergey Stepashin.    The document says that the term "gang" shall be applied to  two or more armed individuals who have formed a group for  carrying out one or more attacks on organizations, enterprises  or individual citizens.    Pending the initiation of legal action, checks on suspects'  financial and economic activity, and property and financial  status, shall be made only if reliable evidence is available  pointing to the individual's or organization's involvement in  criminal activity. Preliminary checks shall be made following  the issue of a permit by inquiry bodies, approved by the  prosecutor.    Prosecutors, investigators and specialists involved in the  implementation of the decree shall be warned about their  responsibility for disclosing or mishandling state and  commercial secrets.    Banks and commercial organizations shall present documents  on  their financial and economic activity, and information about the  deposits and operations of juridical entities and individuals  involved in serious organized crimes, following the receipt of a  motivated inquiry from the prosecutor, investigator or head of  an inquiry body, based on a suit or results of a check.    An individual suspected of committing a crime and detained  for more than three days shall have full access to the rights  envisaged in the constitution and the Criminal Code, including  the right to have a lawyer.    If there is sufficient evidence, charges shall be brought  against the detainee, after which he shall be put in custody for  a term of up to 30 days.    The directive instructs the prosecutors to take proper  measures to reveal and exclude instances of illegal detention of  citizens without prior checks on their financial and economic  activity, and property and financial status, particularly the  suspects' and defendants' relatives, physical entities and  public associations. They shall also exclude actions which can  inflict damage on citizens' property or reputation, promptly  respond to complaints, take urgent measures to restore violated  rights and initiate legal action against criminals.</p>

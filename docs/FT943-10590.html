			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Mortgage loan data cast doubt on upturn Further doubt was cast yesterday on the strength of the housing market recovery as Bank of England figures showed that new mortgage lending was broadly flat in June compared with May. There was a mixed picture in the forward-looking indicator of monthly statistics on mortgage loans approved. This is a guide to the loans which will be undertaken in the following few weeks. The amount approved increased - Pounds 4.95bn in June against Pounds 4.72bn in May - but the number of loans fell to 84,000 from 86,000. Seasonally adjusted figures showed new gross mortgage lending at Pounds 4.73bn in June, as it was in May and up slightly from Pounds 4.49bn in June last year. New net lending strengthened in June, to Pounds 1.61bn from Pounds 1.44bn in May and Pounds 1.18bn in June last year. The increase over last summer appears to be due largely to building societies lending more aggressively and regaining market share. In June last year banks undertook Pounds 711m new net lending while the figure for societies was Pounds 772m. In June this year the figures were Pounds 713m and Pounds 1.1bn respectively. Significant debt repayment by building societies and other financial service companies was one of the factors behind a sharp fall in lending by the nine largest UK banks in the three months to the end of June, the British Bankers' Association said yesterday. Its figures showed that borrowing by building societies fell Pounds 530m in the second quarter of the year, after rising Pounds 617m in the first quarter. Lending to the financial sector fell Pounds 660m in the quarter - the first such fall since 1992. Lending by the largest banks was Pounds 1.35bn in the second quarter of the year, compared with Pounds 3.76bn in the first quarter. The association said the decline might have been slightly exaggerated by the timing of Easter, which had pushed some transactions into March rather than April, although this probably did not affect the figures by more than Pounds 500m. In the financial sector borrowing by securities houses fell Pounds 855m, or 15.2 per cent, in the three months to June, compared with the previous three months. This was partly offset by a 14.2 per cent rise in lending to pension funds and insurance companies. Bank lending to the corporate sector continued to decline in the past quarter, partly due to a switch in corporate funding away from bank borrowing and towards internal financing and borrowing on the financial markets. The largest falls occurred among retailers and construction companies, which both reduced borrowing by more than 4 per cent. Lending to the personal sector continued to rise, providing further signs that consumer confidence remains relatively unaffected by April's tax rises.</p>

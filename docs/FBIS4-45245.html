			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Duncan Campbell, crime correspondent: "Cannabis </F> Hidden in Cars of Unsuspecting Visitors to Spain and France;  Smugglers `Dupe Tourists Into Bringing Back Drugs'"]    [Text] English drug smugglers are using unsuspecting  tourists in France and Spain to bring drugs into this country,  according to lawyers and travellers who have been arrested on  the Continent.    They claim that smugglers befriend visiting tourists and  businessmen and hide drugs in their cars before they cross the  Channel.    Ron Williams, aged 55, of Newport, Gwent, is a transport  manager and HGV driver who had no criminal record. In January  1993, he travelled to Spain to meet potential clients.    In Fuengirola, he met an English couple in a bar who said  they were touring Spain. Mr Williams told them he had a problem  with his car, and they said they knew a mechanic who could fix  it. The mechanic returned the car saying he had repaired an  electrical fault. He also said that a relative might be  interested in a business deal and asked for Mr William's  address. Mr Williams gave him his business card.    Mr Williams set off home, taking the sleeper from Malaga and  putting his car on a separate train. At the French border at  Hendaye he was searched by Customs officers and he told them of  his car.    Two and a half hours later Mr Williams was woken at Bordeaux  by customs officers and told that 16 kilos of cannabis had been  found in the rear inner panels of his car at the border. He was  arrested.    His trial took place in Bayonne. The judge had been told  that  a Ronald Williams had previous convictions for robbery in  Britain and armed robbery in Germany. Mr Williams protested that  the records shown were of another Ronald Williams, that it was a  common name in Britain and his full name was Ronald Watkins  Williams.    "The judge was not interested and the trial was over in 25  minutes," Mr Williams said last week. "There was a school party  in the court being shown how the court worked and while the  judge was out, the children were told in front of me that this  was how foreign drug smugglers were dealt with."    He was jailed for two years. "I was told that the penalty  was  heavier because there were the schoolchildren there." After  serving a year he was told that if he agreed to pay &pound;5,000  he  would be released early. He returned in February.    "I have never been involved with the police before but now I  have lost my business, I have bills from when I was locked up to  pay. If I had really been smuggling drugs surely I would have  got off the train as soon as it was obvious they were going to  search my car."    Mr Williams has contacted Stephen Jakobi, a lawyer and the  chairman of Fair Trials Abroad, who specialises in cases  involving British subjects in foreign jails. Mr Jakobi said it  was one of a number of cases he is handling where people are  "befriended" in France or Spain and drugs are later found in  their car.    In one case, Doug Belcher, an electrical engineer, is due to  stand trial in Bayonne on May 5, accused of importing 44 kilos  of cannabis. He met English people in a Malaga restaurant and  told them his travel plans. He has said he believes drugs could  have been hidden in door panels during the meal.    In another case, Raymond Bickley, aged 49, from Brighton,  who  is in the travel business, was arrested in St Malo in December  1992 in the car of a man he had met a few days earlier. His  family were not told of his arrest for two weeks. "I have never  taken, bought, sold, imported or exported drugs," he said. "The  only time I have been offered drugs was during my incarceration  in Rennes."    The use of travellers by drug smugglers is an old ruse;  Customs officers would say it is also an old excuse used by  people when arrested. But Mr Jakobi said the pattern of  complaint to him indicated that innocent people are being  arrested.    "Either it's people using unwitting travellers or else  setting people up as decoys," he said yesterday. "What is of  concern is that the latest figures show that there are 270  British people in prison in France, of whom a quarter are in  Bayonne. The judges do not have the time or the patience to  listen to and investigate their cases, and as a result innocent  people are being imprisoned."</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Crackdown on Criminal Trading: A click of the mouse is all it takes to track the share raiders The stockmarket's Big Brother, watcher of every share deal carried out in London for signs of criminal activity, lives in a seedy suite of rooms on the fourth floor of the Stock Exchange's dirty grey tower in the City. If it were not for the presence of some spanking new computer hardware, it could be the set of the 70s cop show The Sweeney, all plywood chairs and threadbare synthetic multicoloured carpeting. These are the offices of the 19 members of the Surveillance Group, whose role is to identify possible insider deals, market manipulation or other criminal activity involving share trading and also to carry out investigations, which can last up to three months. The task of identifying possible insider deals has always been mind-boggling because of the vast number of share price movements or transactions which have to be examined every day for possible breaches of trading rules as well criminal activity. On a typical day, the exchange scrutinises between 1,000 and 1,200 such trading 'events'. Inevitably, most of the cleverest insider dealers are not caught. But the Integrated Monitoring and Surveillance System (Imas), a computerised tool the exchange has been using since the end of last year, has made it harder for insiders to hide. According to unpublished figures, the exchange's surveillance group opened 101 cases for investigation in the first seven months of the year, of which 75 were into alleged insider trading. That compares with 100 investigations in the whole of last year including 57 insider probes. However, in the nine months to date, 18 insider trading case files have been passed to other agencies such as the Department of Trade and Industry, the Securities and Futures Authority and the Takeover Panel for further investigation - compared with 15 in the whole of 1993. The DTI, which has the power to launch its own insider dealing investigations under the Financial Services Act and also decides whether to prosecute, has received 10 referrals from the exchange so far this year. It received seven in the whole of last year. The rise in the surveillance group's investigation tally reflects improvements in the detection rate, not in the incidence of the offence, the exchange believes. The surveillance group, headed by Mr Mike Feltham, was hampered for many years by slow and cumbersome methods for obtaining basic share trading information from a variety of sources within the exchange. It could frequently take a fortnight to collate and analyse all the relevant data. One effect of Imas has been to improve the quality of the analysis of trading information, since the raw data and the trends can all be seen on the same screen. At the click of a mouse, it provides: The time of all transactions in any UK shares; The name of the broker or marketmaker who carried out the deals; The coded names of the clients who placed the orders; A great variety of graphical information which allows trading patterns to be identified. Its more important benefit is that it has compressed the process of identifying sinister trading patterns and who is behind them from weeks to hours. 'The element of surprise is vital in obtaining a confession from an insider trader', said one former member of the department. That requires the suspect to be interviewed soon after the alleged offence took place. The more time that elapses before this interview, the greater the risk that he or she will be tipped off that a probe has commenced and will concoct an apparently legitimate reason for trading. A recent example of the speed with which the group can now complete its probes was the case of alleged insider trading involving Lord Archer. After the media group, MAI, made a takeover bid for Anglia Television in mid January this year, the group carried out - as a matter of routine - an analysis of Anglia share deals in the preceding weeks. Within three days it had compiled a case file on the best-selling novelist's orders to purchase 50,000 Anglia shares. It passed the file to the DTI, which investigated the affair for five months before deciding not to prosecute him. The surveillance group typically measures its performance by reference to its counterpart at the New York Stock Exchange, whose international reputation in fighting insider trading is probably stronger. But Imas is in one important respect superior. The NYSE does not have any electronic access to information on investors who place share orders. Its computers show only the securities firms which have carried out the deals on investors' behalf. So the NYSE has to telephone the firms to get any investor details, which brings with it the risk that the firm will tip off the probe target. The group in London cannot obtain from Imas the names of investors behind deals. But each investor is given a code by every broking firm which is a member of the exchange, and Imas supplies these coded names. This allows the group to establish trading patterns and possible links between transactions without having to make any telephone calls. The Imas information is not comprehensive, however. The group can match full names to codes for only a limited number of investors, since there are millions of different codes. It will frequently have to ring a broker in the end to establish who placed a share order. Another significant omission from Imas - and indeed from any electronic information source in the exchange - is details of the enormous equity exposures taken on by securities houses and their clients in the over-the-counter derivatives market. These OTC positions can on occasion be the dominant influence on a company's share price. But at the moment only the Securities and Futures Authority collects detailed information on these deals - which it passes to the group in response to requests. Given the importance of price movements in generating probes - 67 of the investigations in the first seven months of the year were to an extent initiated by price 'jumps' - lack of access to derivatives market information is quite a handicap. As well as being a database and analytical tool, Imas is an early warning system. It produces 'alerts' every time there is an unusual price jump, or a substantial transaction, or unorthodox pricing by market makers - the wholesalers of shares - or an apparent breach of the exchange's rules on the reporting of transactions. These alerts are initially scrutinised by the market supervision department, which is responsible for making sure that trading rules are followed by exchange members and that dealing remains 'orderly' or not excessively volatile. But when it detects possible criminal activity, the surveillance team takes over. The 19-strong team is split roughly down the middle between the intelligence gatherers, who operate Imas and collect information from other sources, and investigators who conduct interviews of suspects and witnesses. The intuition and experience of the intelligence gatherers, led by Mr Alan Wilson, plays an important role in deciding which transactions should be passed to the investigators for further scrutiny. For example, substantial purchases of an FT-SE company's shares prior to a price-sensitive announcement would probably not be considered sinister if they had been carried out through a big securities house, such as Warburg Securities, since Warburg is carrying out substantial deals continually. However the group would almost certainly conduct further enquiries if a minor Scottish broker, whose typical deals are small, were shown by Imas as a substantial purchaser of that company's shares. There is a split between those team members who think that its most valuable tool is human intuition and those who place more of their faith in computerised analysis. This battle may take a decisive turn in the coming months with the integration of new computer software into Imas. A prototype system, based on advanced artificial intelligence programmes developed for the exchange by University College, London, has been able to identify links between different share traders which were hitherto impossible to establish. The model has for example uncovered possible concert parties consisting of up to 15 different clients of a series of securities firms, by noticing that groups of the 15 almost always trade in the same securities at the same time, even if all 15 rarely trade together. But establishing who traded in any particular case is only half of what the group does. Before passing a dossier to the exchange, it needs to gather evidence of why investors carried out particular transactions. Even if trades in a company's shares ahead of an announcement turned out to be by the company chairman's mother, that would still not be deemed sufficient evidence to pass to the DTI. In most cases, the group's investigators would interview the woman to ask her why she traded. In around 70 per cent of the cases where the beneficiary of a suspicious transaction is identified, he or she will be interviewed. 'It is the exchange's job to try to establish whether information was passed and how it was passed', said a former official. Again this is very different from the NYSE, which never talks to any outsiders. It passes only trading data to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which then takes responsibility for all further investigation including interviews. The exchange's investigators behave very much like policemen. They are trained in interviewing techniques and how to obtain testimony admissible in court. Frequently they will caution interviewees, using the standard form of words employed by the police. Unlike the police, however, they very rarely meet an overtly hostile response from interviewees. The investigators opening gambit of 'I am from the Stock Exchange and I have come to ask you about some share deals you carried out' is frequently met with at least a partial confession, according to past and present officials. However, evidence is far more difficult to obtain once any transaction is routed through offshore financial centres. Switzerland is now co-operating to an extent with UK insider dealing investigations and providing some details of the beneficiaries of share trades carried out by Swiss banks. But it remains almost impossible to establish the identity of anyone trading though a nominee company in the Cayman Islands or the British Virgin Islands. Some brokers and fund managers question why the exchange should invest so much time and money investigating insider trading, given that obtaining a successful prosecution appears so difficult. One fund manager said: 'The exchange is pretty good at investigating, but to what end? Sometimes I think someone should do a cost benefit analysis on their surveillance unit. Is it really worth the cost?' The exchange's reply is that deterrence is not just about putting people in prison or fining them heavily. One official said: 'You would be surprised how often executives mysteriously resign from their companies after the surveillance group has conducted a probe.'  ----------------------------------------------         INSIDER DEALING PROSECUTIONS  ----------------------------------------------           NUMBER OF      NOT            TRIALS      GUILTY       GUILTY  ----------------------------------------------  1980         -           -            -  1981         1           -            1  1982         2           -            3  1983         -           -            -  1984         2           2            -  1985         1           1            -  1986         2           1            1  1987         2           -            2  1988         2           1            1  1989         7           7            3  1990         4           3            3  1991         4           5            3  1992         2           2            4 *1993         4           7            -  1994         1           -            2  ---------------------------------------------- Not guilty verdicts include prosecutions where case against a defendant was withdrawn  ---------------------------------------------- *figures include one individual acquitted on appeal in 1994  ----------------------------------------------</p>

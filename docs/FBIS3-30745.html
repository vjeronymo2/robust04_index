			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Srdjan Radulovic: "Martic Is Being Tested"] </F>   [Text] After the election, the everyday life in Krajina is  still characterized by consideration of the political outcome of  the conflict between the two Milans -- Martic, the Krajina  president, and Babic, the leader of the strongest party in  parliament. If they do not reach a compromise, the Krajina  political scene could turn into a merciless struggle between the  two enemy camps. The continuation of the media campaign against  Babic, also supported by television reporters and politicians  from the Socialist Party of Serbia, points to this possibility.  According to the method used so far, public opinion is being  prepared for the message that Babic is to blame for a  parliamentary crisis that could happen if his party does not  support the personnel changes proposed by President Martic.    A coalition between Babic's Socialist Democratic Party (SDS)  of Krajina with 30 seats in parliament, and the Radical Party  with 16 is the only one that could possibly achieve the simple  majority of 84 representatives. The creation of this coalition  was announced before the election by both Babic and the Radical  Party. After the second election round, Babic's supporters had  the feeling, however, that the Radical Party did not keep it's  promise to vote for Babic in the election, so that there is now  suspicion about this coalition. Lazar Macura, a SDS Krajina  representative, said in a statement for BORBA that he could not  assess the behavior of the Radical Party members in the election  in general, but that "it seemed to him that not everybody voted  for Babic."  <H5>  Who Will Be the Prime Minister? </H5>   "Babic and Vojislav Seselj agreed on the coalition, and I do  not believe that they will change their attitude, especially  because the Radical Party wants to have one leadership, so that  there will be no postion of party chairman for Krajina. On the  other hand, it is also possible that some members of parliament  might change to some other party, but this cannot lead to an  imbalance of power," Macura says.    In his opinion, it is quite logical that Martic propose a  new  prime minister from the SDS Krajina. Asked what he thinks about  opinions that this function could be offered to Djordje  Bjegovic, the present prime minister, or to Borislav Mikelic,  Macura answered that Krajina Socialist Party members cannot  nominate the new prime minister since they only have 6 seats in  parliament. He added that Mikelic should have better "run as a  member of parliament to see what the people think of him."    President Martic avoided answering this question in the news  conference held in Knin on Friday [28 January 1994], stating  that "consultations with representatives of the parties are  under way." He can count on the support of the Socialist Party  and of the 15 SDS members of parliament who support the idea of  united Serbian countries. As far as the eight independent  members of parliament are concerned, some of them allegedly  support Martic, and some Babic. Apart from that, even if he  gets the votes of eight members from two small parties, he will  not have the necessary majority in parliament.    Martic offering Babic the position of the prime minister and  giving him the authority to form the new government in order to  soothe passions has also been considered. It would be  interesting if the man who was anathematized in the election  campaign and almost declared an enemy of the nation became prime  minister. It is very questionable, however, whether Babic would  accept this offer.  <H5>  Between Pale and Belgrade </H5>   There are also similar considerations among the inhabitants  of Knin. A quick opinion poll carried out in the streets of  Knin proved that most of the people believe that "everything  will hopefully be fine." Young people avoid making comments on  the election. Some people alluded to worries over their  personal safety if they made comments on the election. Martic's  supporters speak the language recognizable from Sarajevo Radio  and Television, whereas Babic's supporters cannot explain the  turn in the election results. The attitude that "everything  will hopefully be fine" is understandable in the present  situation, which is difficult not only because of the exhausting  three-year war, but also because of the present threats from  Zagreb and because of political partitions in Krajina. Apart  from that, there are -- for simple people -- inexplicable  measures from Belgrade (the Geneva agreement between Tudjman and  Milosevic) and Pale (the announcement that the Serbs who live in  the areas up to the Una River will be united first; the regions  up to the Kupa River will follow later). Mitar Vujnovic, a  40-year-old man from the vicinity of Knin, says that "in the  end, people always say what they want" and that "nothing can be  decided without the people." Lazar Macura thinks, however, that  political divisions have been imposed and sees the Geneva  agreement as the "old Yugoslav syndrome" of making agreements  "behind somebody's back," which harms Krajina.    Between the hope that "everything will hopefully be fine"  and the suspicions, there remains the question of why Belgrade  supported Martic. Both Babic and Martic supported the idea that  all Serbian countries should unite and that the president of  this newly established state should be Slobodan Milosevic. The  only difference is that Martic would call this new state  "Serbia, that is to say Yugoslavia," and Babic exclusively  Serbia. Other election messages, which referred to defense, the  economy, stamping out crime and so forth, remained at the level  of the usual election phrases. Babic was presented in the  campaign as the man who "only thinks of how to reach power" and  who intends to "give Krajina back to Croatia," whereas Martic  was given the aura of the unifier and of the most responsible  man for the defense of Krajina (as if there was no Krajina Army).  <H5>  Obstinate and Subordinate </H5>   Experts on Krajina think that Martic's support from Belgrade  resulted from Babic's obstinacy (in his relation to Milosevic)  and from Martic's subordination to Milosevic's influence (it  must not be forgotten that Martic is inclined to the Communist  Party-Movement for Yugoslavia). These interpretations will soon  be checked. It is indicative that Vladislav Jovanovic, the  minister of foreign affairs of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia, announced talks with his Hungarian colleague, Mr.  Geza Jeszenszky. He also expressed the hope that the oil  pipeline through Croatia would be opened soon, an issue that  could be solved in talks between the representatives of Croatia  and Krajina "after the agreement on an absolute cease-fire" is  signed.    Does this mean that Minister Jovanovic already knows that  such an agreement will be signed soon, in spite of the  impediment that could not be removed so far -- that the Croatian  forces withdraw from the occupied Krajina areas. Martic cited  this problem in his first address. Croatia has not agreed to  this condition so far, but, in spite of that, the joint  declaration was signed in Geneva and it was announced that the  oil pipeline and the highway between Zagreb and Belgrade, which  both run through Krajina, would be reopened.    This means that Martic is already being tested. Should there  be a crisis in connection with forming the government and with  the work of parliament, he could make use of the constitutional  power he has as president, especially in a state of war. Apart  from the considerable influence he has on the police, Martic has  additionally obtained the position of the supreme commander of  the Krajina Army, where he has already announced "quality  changes."  <H5>  [Box, p 12] </H5> <H5>  Conflict With Karadzic </H5>   Lazar Macura claims that he has never said that Radovan  Karadzic is a foreign citizen, stating that this allegation  comes from Sarajevo Radio and Television, which misinterpreted  his statement that "it is sad that Mr. Karadzic joined the  election campaign in Banija [part of Krajina] walking in company  of Mr. Mile Paspalj." Macura adds that Paspalj got the least  votes in the election in Glina. He also denies the stories that  the police of the Republic of Serbian Krajina took away his  passport and threw him off the bus because of this statement, so  that he had to wait for a train in order to return to Knin.  <H5>  [Box, p 12] </H5> <H5>  Unitary SDS </H5>   The SDS leadership wants to neutralize the importance and  the  influence of the party through renewed attempts to create a  unitary SDS before the Krajina Parliament is formed. The SDS  Main Committee agreed in principal with the creation of a  unitary SDS, on condition, however, that the election is  completed and the new leadership in Krajina is constituted.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THERE IS NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT FOR STANFORD'S SANDERS  </P> <P> While the anthropology professor explained that the expectation level is the  primary difference between humans and monkeys, a few students skimmed The  Stanford Daily.  </P> <P> Others thumbed through the syllabus, making notations for a research paper that  had just been assigned.  </P> <P> Suddenly, though, the professor made a declaration that caught the attention of  Summer Sanders, the lanky blonde in the 15th row of the lecture hall.  </P> <P> "Human beings live in a world that doesn't exist," he said. "A world of worries  and dreams that have not occurred yet. Monkeys live only in the present, not in  the past or the future."  </P> <P> For Sanders, there is no better time than the present. If her freshman year at  Stanford is anything like her freshman year -- which she calls the best year of  her life -- at Oakmont High in Roseville, Calif., she has it made.  </P> <P> Moreover, if she thinks ahead to this weekend's U.S. Open or the World Swimming  Championships in January or the 1992 Olympic Games, she'll go crazy.  </P> <P> "You only have so much worrying in you," Sanders said. "I hate worrying and  being nervous for races. I like to talk and laugh."  </P> <P> Perhaps Sanders can excuse the swimming world for wanting to press fast  forward. Expectations are high since her triple gold-medal performance in the  Goodwill Games last July.  </P> <P> Sanders' clocking of 2 minutes 9.46 seconds in the 200-meter butterfly was the  second-fastest ever by an American and the fastest in the world in 1990.  </P> <P> Despite qualifying last in the 200 individual medley, she struck gold again in  2:14.06, the fastest time by an American since Tracy Caulkins' effort in the  1984 Olympic Games.  </P> <P> And in the meet's biggest upset, Sanders handed Janet Evans her first defeat  since 1986, knocking an astonishing 8.68 seconds off her 400 individual medley  best. Sanders' clocking of 4:39.22 is the fastest in the world this year.  </P> <P> Though Sanders is 3.12 seconds shy of Petra Schneider's 1982 world record,  Stanford Coach Richard Quick believes Sanders eventually will break it.  </P> <P> "There's absolutely no question in my mind," said Quick, who also serves as  U.S. national team women's coach. "Summer Sanders has the potential in the 400  individual medley to go under the world record."  </P> <P> Ironically, Sanders despises that event, a sequence of 100 meters of butterfly,  backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle that some coaches call the toughest race  because of the stroke versatility and stamina it demands. "If I never swam  another 400 IM in my life, I'd probably be the happiest person in the world,"  Sanders said. "It is the hardest thing ever."  </P> <P> Like many medley swimmers, Sanders was an age-group breast-stroker. A pulled  muscle prevented her from training in the breast-stroke for a few months and  sparked her interest in and mastery of the butterfly.  </P> <P> "Her butterfly rivals the efficiency of Mary T. Meagher," Quick said of the  world record-holder in the 100 and 200 butterfly.  </P> <P> Until recently, Sanders' second leg was a weak link. But her club coach, Mike  Hastings of California Capital Aquatics, developed her into a national-caliber  backstroker.  </P> <P> The third leg, breaststroke, has always been a strength.  </P> <P> All that remains for Sanders to improve is her freestyle, a segment that most  medley swimmers don't struggle with because much of their training is in  freestyle. Although Sanders' freestyle is above average, it doesn't compare to  her other strokes.  </P> <P> Her ability to stave off Evans, the world record-holder in three distance  freestyle events, was a breakthrough. "(Rivals) always pass me," Sanders said.  "I've been passed many times."  </P> <P> The most painful of those occurred at the 1988 U.S. Olympic trials in Austin,  Tex. Sanders led by a body length with 50 meters left when Mary Wayte and  Whitney Hedgepeth passed her and became the two representatives the United  States sent to Seoul.  </P> <P> At Oakmont High, Sanders' classmates staged a rally that cheered her up,  despite her reluctance to be in the spotlight.  </P> <P> "I didn't know about the rally," Sanders said, "because if I'd known about it,  I wouldn't have shown up. I was kind of embarrassed. I started crying up there  in front of the whole school. I felt (foolish). But it was nice. . . . I was  real honored."  </P> <P> Although Sanders yearns to be accepted, she wants the option of being  unconventional. That is what binds her family in their own definition of  togetherness.  </P> <P> Sanders' parents divorced when she was 7.  </P> <P> "I had no idea what it was," Sanders said. "All I remember is that my friend's  parents had just gotten divorced. Her parents were buying her all these toys so  when my parents told me they were getting divorced I said, 'Yes. Toys! Woo!' I  had no idea what a divorce was."  </P> <P> Sanders found out soon enough that it meant moving from one parent's home to  the other every six months.  </P> <P> "Every time I would move from one house to another, I seriously probably  couldn't talk for a day," she said. "I was so sad. I'd sit there and cry for  about most of the day. You get so used to coming home and there's your dad and  you do certain things with him, and then you all of a sudden move and your dad  is not there. And me with my swimming, I didn't see him that much, you know. I  maybe talked to him a couple times a week. We'd go out to dinner every once in  a while and go to a movie, but it wasn't the same."  </P> <P> It became more difficult at 15 when her older brother, Trevor, stopped making  the switch.  </P> <P> "That was kind of a bummer when I had to leave him," Sanders said. "But I like  going to my mom's so I kept at it."  </P> <P> That has been the key to Sanders' sunny disposition, maintaining warm  relationships with her father, her mother, her brother and her stepfather.  </P> <P> "I'm really close to all the parts of my family," Sanders said. "I think I want  my kids to have the same family I do. God, they're so laid back. You know, it's  not like you have to do this, otherwise you'll be a bad person. Like, if you  want to, you can. It is totally up to us. When I think about church, it was up  to us. My swimming was up to me. "  </P> <P> Summer Sanders, nickname Scum, reveals nothing about swimming on the canvas of  collegiate personality, her dorm room walls.  </P> <P> They are plastered with Michael Jordan posters and she wears Air Jordans that  Trevor gave her on graduation day, the ones she slept in that night.  </P> <P> Sanders' roommate didn't even know she was living with a world-class swimmer  until one of Sanders' swimming friends told her.  </P> <P> Sanders is equally eager to conceal her academic prowess. She makes no mention  of her U.S. Swimming Academic All-American status. Sanders is intimidated by  Stanford.  </P> <P> "When I first got here, I was real worried because people were using these huge  words, and I'm into the simple kind of stuff," she said. "One day my friend Lea  Loveless and I were walking down the hall when someone said something about  mendicants.  </P> <P> "I said 'Lea, my vocabulary is not very good, what is mendicants?' and she  said, 'Oh God, Summer, it is a singing group.' "  </P> <P> It is not something she's going to worry about, however. Sanders tries not to  look back or forward.  </P> <P> Her faithful watch ever on her wrist, she simply follows her demanding academic  and athletic schedule, including predawn swims while the rest of the campus  sleeps.  </P> <P> Her idea of a good time? Whatever is going on right now.  </P> <P> "I could just sit here in my dorm room looking at my pictures," Sanders said.  "I could listen to music. I could read this Homer book ('The Iliad') . . . oh,  just kidding."  </P></p>

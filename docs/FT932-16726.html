			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Arts: Singer at the top - Andrew Clark talks to Jose van Dam, an artist in control of his destiny WHEN THE Salzburg Easter Festival opens tonight, one of the few surviving links with its past will be Jose van Dam, who sings the title role in Luca Ronconi's new production of Verdi's Falstaff. For nearly 20 years, van Dam was the favourite bass-baritone of the festival's founder, Herbert von Karajan. That did not stop him turning down invitations from Karajan to take on roles he considered unsuitable. Nor has it prevented van Dam finding favour with Karajan's successors. Sir Georg Solti, who conducts Falstaff and has been the Easter Festival's artistic director since 1990, chose him for last year's recording of Die Frau ohne Schatten - even though van Dam did not want to sing the role of Barak in the festival stage production. His Belgian compatriot Gerard Mortier, the new broom at the Summer Festival, engaged him at the Monnaie in Brussels throughout the 1980s, and built last year's Salzburg production of Messiaen's Saint Francois d'Assise around him. Now 52, van Dam is at the summit of his career. After more than 30 years in the profession, his smooth, well-coloured voice is still in perfect condition. He is equally at ease in the lyric bass roles of Massenet, Gounod and Verdi, as in heldenbariton parts like the Dutchman and Hans Sachs. He is a master at marrying text to music so that it makes sense. Despite his modest physical stature, he is a commanding presence on stage, because of the conviction he brings to each role. Van Dam is what the French call un homme de bon sens - he has his feet on the ground in a profession where it is easy to get carried away. The clearest evidence of this is the astute control he has exercised over his vocal development: he has never sung a role which was beyond his means. He attributes this partly to instinct, partly to the influence of his teacher, the late Frederic Anspach, and also to his own understanding of voice and technique. 'A teacher can only give you so much. When you're on stage, you're alone. You yourself have to know what you can and can't do, and that means knowing your own voice. Many people will say 'You must sing this role', but only you can judge if it's possible. You have to have that confidence and knowledge.' Van Dam made his professional debut at the Paris Opera aged 20. The next 12 years were spent as an ensemble member in Paris, Geneva and Berlin's Deutsche Oper. He sang Masetto before moving on to Leporello in Don Giovanni, tried out Paolo and Fiesco before tackling the title role in Simon Boccanegra, observed experienced Germans singing Sachs from the vantage point of Kothner. For his debuts at the Met, La Scala and Covent Garden (under Solti) in the early 1970s, he sang Escamillo. To other French roles like Golaud he brings a native speaker's understanding of what he calls 'this typically French line of song'. He has kept clear of 'belting' roles like Telramund and Luna, and is only now debating whether to sing Wotan. He is more suited to thoughtful, philosophical parts than buffo - though his Figaro was always beautifully sung. His next new role is Scarpia, but he talks of retiring from the stage and devoting himself to recitals and teaching. That leaves little hope for British admirers, who will have to be satisfied with a single Wigmore Hall recital next year. His last appearance at Covent Garden was in 1986. Why the long absence? Van Dam pins the blame on the previous Royal Opera management of Sir John Tooley. After two visits as Escamillo, he was asked back to sing the same role. 'I said if I was offered another contract alongside Escamillo, I would come. But they didn't offer anything. It was quite a few years before I was invited back for Wozzeck and Salome. Now my diary is full till 1996. It's a pity - I always had good experiences there. The people know how to work, and my wife and I like London.' Which makes a stark contrast to the Bastille in Paris, where van Dam says the acoustic is poor and the atmosphere dreadful. 'It's so badly managed - they have three or four chiefs running round at the same time, to no purpose. Chung (the Bastille's young Korean music director) is too inexperienced to have responsibility for such a huge operation. How can he know which singers are suitable for each role? 'They've spent all that money on a building which doesn't even resemble a theatre - it's more like a tube station. The Met in New York may be big, but at least the acoustic is good. The problem with the Met is that the work is uninteresting. All through my career I've said that wherever I go there must be some bait - either artistic or financial. At the Met you have neither. They're more concerned with show than music. It's the same at the Bastille: the priority is to fill seats. 'Of course, if I was well paid, I admit I would go for the money. But when the rewards are so small, the best thing is to stay away.' Van Dam's professional satisfaction comes increasingly from recording rarely performed French operas and from song recitals. He learns the text and music separately - reciting the words like a poem, whistling the vocal line - before bringing them together. Adjusting to the disciplines and repertoire of the recital hall has not been easy, 'but you don't make this sort of career in order to live simply. My belief is that if you're an artist, you have to deny yourself the easy path. It's part and parcel with being an artist. If you only take the easy path, you never move forwards, you don't give art the chance to develop. If there's no struggle, there's little point doing it.'</p>

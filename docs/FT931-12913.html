			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / The Base Rate Cut: Retailers' responses mixed - Consumer fillip expected THE one point cut in base rates yesterday delighted retailers and industrialists but left many economists doubtful about prospects for inflation. The reduction in borrowing rates should provide a fillip to consumer spending by easing the burden of household debt but economists fear that further depreciation of the pound and the resulting rise in import costs will put upward pressure on inflation. Mr John Clare, group managing director of Dixons, the UK's biggest electrical retailer, said: 'We are very pleased with this latest cut in rates. Our business has historically moved in line with interest rates and we believe that lower rates are a prerequisite for getting the country out of recession.' But he was cautious about further reductions. 'It is also important for us that the exchange rate is protected as far as possible, because we import a lot of products and we are starting to see prices go up.' His thoughts were echoed by Mr David Kern, chief economist at National Westminster Bank. He said: 'The news is good but it entails a cost - higher inflation and rates back up again by the end of the year.' Retailers were divided about the extent of the benefit lower interest rates would bring. Mr Nigel Whittaker, corporate affairs director of the Kingfisher retail group, was less concerned about the price implications of lower base rates. 'It is very good news. Even though there is some inflationary impetus from a lower pound, there is such a weak level of demand that there is some question as to whether higher import prices will get passed on,' he said. At Ikea, the furniture group, Mr Jeff Dolin, finance director, said he was not convinced that base rates of 6 per cent, rather than 7 per cent, would make a big difference. 'It is welcome as a step in the right direction, but whether it will help our business depends on whether it is enough to stimulate the housing market,' Mr Dolin said. Manufacturers also reacted differently. Mr Ken Minton, chief executive of Laporte, the speciality chemicals group, said the rate cut came too late. 'It will make the situation for our German competitors even more uncomfortable, but we won't be tempted to cut prices to gain market share,' he said. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI, said the cut in rates should improve the investment climate in the UK and be helpful to British industry in its efforts to recover from the recession. The Engineering Employers' Federation gave a grudging welcome to the base rate cut, repeating its warning that lower interest rates could simply lead to a consumer boom without increases in exports and investment. Mr Ian Thompson, economist at the federation, said: 'It isn't just a case of getting spending going again. The economy needs restructuring so that consumer spending grows more slowly and exports and investment grow more rapidly.' The news was greeted more sceptically by Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at James Capel. He said: 'Interest rates have fallen from 15 per cent to 6 per cent and still nothing is happen-ing. 'The government believes that chopping interest rates will generate a recovery, but all the polls tell us that it is fear of unemployment which is generating an impasse in the economy. Cutting rates won't necessarily help.'</p>

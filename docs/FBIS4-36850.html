			<p>BFN     [Text] The AICC [All-India Congress Committee] session  unanimously adopted the economic resolution here tonight after  senior ministers handling core economic subjects told the  members that the reforms underway are meant to make India strong  so that it could stand on its own feet.    Urging the members not to be misled by the vicious  opposition  propaganda about the Government's new economic policies, Finance  Minister Manmohan Singh and Commerce Minister Pranab Mukheriee  maintained that the country's economic sovereignty would not be  compromised at any cost.    Interestingly, former Union Mimster N. D. Tiwari moved the  economic resolution, which was seconded by Mr Mukherjee. Mr  Tiwari emphasised that the economic reforms were meant to  overcome challenges of the future particularly in the 21st  century.    Mr Tiwari said the economic reforms were not for improving  the stock markets and the like but to give a push to socio  economic policies envisaged by Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Lal Bahadur  Shastri and Rajiv Gandhi. He had no doubt that India would be  one of the big powers in the 21st century. "We will ensure that  nobody can dictate to us."    Mr Tiwari said one must be realistic about where the world  was heading and these reforms were necessary for allround  development and the uplift of the poor. In this context, he said  China was also looking outwards and wanting to become a member  of GATT as also Vietnam and Fidel Castro's Cuba.    Mr Mukherjee attacked the Opposition accusing it of  spreading  misconception. Stoutly defending the Centre's decision to  initiate steps to attract more foreign direct investment, he  said these were required for higher growth.    "Our economic reforms are not a pipe-dream", Mr Mukherjee  said and lauded the middle path adopted by his Government.    Dr Manmohan Singh made it clear that the Government was  providing all possible encouragement to the public sector. He  said they wanted the public sector to be profitable because  these could be ploughed for the benefit of poorer sections in  the rural areas.    Dr Singh said the Government was committed not to retrench  public sector employees while restructuring PSUs [public sector  units].    "We will not allow the Indian working class to suffer."    Agriculture Minister Balram Jakhar charged the BJP with  misleading the farmers on the GATT agreement even though the  Opposition did not know about all the existing varieties of  seeds.</p>

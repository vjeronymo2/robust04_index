			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Unilever rises 9% to Pounds 571m in third quarter SHARES in Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group, edged back from Pounds 11.09p to Pounds 10.80p yesterday in spite of a 9 per cent increase in third quarter pre-tax profits to Pounds 571m, against Pounds 525m. The decline marked disappointment over the company's performance in North America, where operating profits dropped from Pounds 108m to Pounds 100m at constant 1991 exchange rates. However, analysts said the overall return for the period to September 30, struck on sales 3 per cent higher at Pounds 6.1bn (Pounds 5.92bn) had been respectable. Pre-tax profits for the nine months rose 10 per cent to Pounds 1.46bn (Pounds 1.33bn) on sales 4 per cent up to Pounds 17.7m (Pounds 17.1bn). 'In trading terms this is a reasonable result, nothing special, but certainly nothing to be ashamed of,' said Mr John Campbell of County NatWest. Mr Campbell was maintaining his forecast of Pounds 2bn for the year to December 31, based on the stronger-than-expected performance from the Latin American and Asian operations. The disappointing return from the US during the third quarter was put down to extremely difficult trading conditions and a switch to longer term contracts with ensuing lower prices in Chesebrough-Pond's. The company also said a strong US consumer products business had been offset by difficult conditions in the industrial products sector. The contribution from the Asian and Latin American companies jumped by 22 per cent to Pounds 121m. The increase was achieved by strong growth in the detergents and personal products ranges. The Japanese business continued to incur losses, although less than last year. Europe contributed Pounds 385m, against Pounds 373m, despite tougher conditions in its two biggest European markets - the UK and Germany. Cold weather in the third quarter hit ice cream sales, which had been particularly good in the second quarter. Unilever cut net debt to Pounds 1.2bn, against Pounds 2bn the previous year. Gearing at the end of the period stood at 19 per cent (34 per cent) and interest costs were Pounds 26m lower at Pounds 47m. Net profits in the three months, at constant exchange rates, were 6 per cent higher at Pounds 346m. However, using rates current in each period, the increase was 8 per cent to Pounds 350m. Earnings per share rose 8 per cent to 18.77p (17.4) in the quarter and by 7 per cent in the nine months to 48.84p (45.82p). The company declared an interim dividend of 5.2p (5.03p) for UK shareholders and maintained the Dutch dividend at Fl 1.48. See Lex</p>

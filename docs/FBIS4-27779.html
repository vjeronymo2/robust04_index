			<p>BFN     [Text] As attention is focusing on the issue of  remittances to North Korea by ethnic Koreans residing in Japan,  Japanese banks are in a dilemma. Some Japanese banks, including  the Ashikaga Bank, which are said to have been handling direct  remittances to North Korea by ethnic Koreans in Japan, appear to  be increasingly concerned about UN moves to impose economic  sanctions against North Korea.    According to a financial source, 18 Japanese banks,  including  city banks, have concluded correspondence agreements with the  Korea Trade Bank and other North Korean banks. North Korea had  delayed payments since 1975, and a Western consortium declared  North Korea insolvent in 1987, prompting a majority of the  Japanese banks with correspondence agreements with North Korean  banks to halt financial transactions. The Japanese banks have  since entrusted the Ashikaga Bank to handle remittance requests  from their customers.    The Ashikaga Bank is a joint-venture bank that was  established by North Korea and [pro-North Korea] ethnic Koreans  residing in Japan and the bank with a long history of banking  transactions with North Korea still maintains its correspondence  agreement with North Korean banks. The bank, however, has  suspended the handling of dollar-denominated remittance requests  from other Japanese banks to North Korea since last April.  According to the same financial source, "the bank has handled  almost no dollar-denominated remittances to North Korea and the  bank's decision to suspend dollar-denominated remittances to  North Korea has had little impact on the total remittances by  ethnic Koreans in Japan to North Korea." If all the remittances  by ethnic Koreans in Japan to North Korea are halted, however,  its impact would be more extensive, and the ethnic Koreans  residing in Japan are expected to react against the halt.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich by Ze'ev Kohen </F> at the Tel Aviv studio on 30 April -- live]    [Text] [Kohen] Christopher is conferring today, perhaps  right now, with President al-Asad with the package from Israel  under his arm. Does that package contain anything that can  bring about a breakthrough in the stalemate?    [Rabinovich] We think so. The term package can arouse the  wrong associations because it has a physical connotation. We  should talk about a series of issues and positions which  together constitute a whole. In our view, the parcel is such  that if the Syrians respond to it as a whole and to its  components adequately, there can be a breakthrough in the  negotiations.    [Kohen] In reference to the physics of the package, as you  referred to it, what does it contain: maps and lines or just  principles?    [Rabinovich] The Americans are not carrying any map with  delineated lines. Some of the things uttered are broad  speculations. They went with ideas and impressions, and I think  that these ideas are sufficient for a very interesting  conversation to be conducted with President al-Asad in Damascus.    [Kohen] To the best of your knowledge, did Rabin's public  pronouncement about his readiness to evacuate settlements have  an impact in Damascus?    [Rabinovich] I think it must have strengthened among the  Syrians the feeling that should have been aroused there a long  time ago, that we are a serious partner, that we are interested  in a settlement, that we give it serious thought, that we are  prepared to pay a reasonable price for a good agreement. The  other side, however, is very tough and does not always  understand us fully. It he does not understand how an open,  democratic, parliamentary system like ours operates. The fact  that the direct contacts with the other side is very, very  limited makes mutual revelation and understanding difficult.  Therefore, the intensity of some of our moves, proposals,  gestures, are not always sufficiently understood by the other  side.    [Kohen] Sir, we disclosed a formula under the headline  "Majdal Shams First." What can you tell us about it? Is that  the bridge that will permit us to cross the river?    [Rabinovich] I said before that many of the speculations  being heard in recent days are exaggerated, some speculative and  some based on incorrect information. I think it is important  right now not to focus on any detail, no matter piquant it is,  but to think in more conceptual terms about the parcel with its  ideas. We must perhaps stress one point: Majdal Shams is a  village in which people live.    [Kohen] No, we are talking about all the Druze villages,  with Majdal Shams only serving as the headline.    [Rabinovich] I do not want to focus on any village or area.  I want to talk about the fact that when such negotiations are  being conducted, we do not talk only in abstract terms. We  should always remember that people and their fate are involved.  We, as negotiators and anybody else involved, have to remember  that such speculations involve the future of people.    [Kohen] I understand, of course, Mr. Ambassador, that you  cannot refer concretely to the package or Majdal Shams First,  but in an academic analysis, can you see the advantages such a  formula has for al-Asad, as well as for Rabin?    [Rabinovich] I must temporarily forfeit the pleasure of an  academic analysis because I am currently dealing with concrete  negotiations and not academic life, but as I said previously,  the package of ideas Secretary Christopher is carrying to  Damascus is interesting and contains more than enough to permit  the Syrians, if they wish to do so, to respond in an adequate  fashion, and thereby to get the negotiating cart moving forward.    [Kohen] Ambassador Rabinovich, what influence do you think  the time element has on the negotiations with the Syrians? Is a  situation of continued stalemate -- for instance until 1996, the  date of the Israeli general elections -- possible?    [Rabinovich] Of course, a deadlock and slow progress can go  on without a time limit. In these negotiations we have never  manifested to the Syrians a feeling that we are in a hurry. I  think that from time to time the Syrians have learned that time  is not a one-dimensional element and does not necessarily work  against Israel or impose pressures on us. I think that last  year the Syrians dragged their feet in the autumn and early  summer and the outcome was that they found themselves facing the  Oslo agreement with a different element. I think that was a  bitter lesson for them, showing them that time does not  necessarily move in one direction. From time to time we recall  in a very relaxed way, without being pressured by time, that  this window of opportunity is not unlimited time wise so that  everybody involved in these negotiations remembers it. But, we  do not have and do not transmit a feeling of concern or panic  because of the passing of time.    [Kohen] Within the framework of Christopher's demands from  al-Asad is there a demand to hold a summit meeting with Prime  Minister Rabin?    [Rabinovich] There are no demands. The diplomatic and  negotiating style of the Americans in general and Secretary  Christopher in particular, is not one of making demands and  applying pressures. He acts more like an attorney who  transfers, not in a mechanical fashion, the positions of the  sides, points to overlapping areas, and from time to time points  to an interesting point where the sides meet, but he does not  make demands or apply pressure. The Americans, like us, believe  that more personal contact at the political echelon is good for  the negotiations. This is for two reasons: First, meetings at  the political level are part of the normalization process and  evince a message to both societies -- Syrian and Israeli -- that  their leaderships are in a process of conciliation, which is  important. Second, in direct negotiations between leaders, who  can make decisions, faster progress is sometimes possible since  gaps can be closed by eliminating an emissary and transmittal  time. That position is highly acceptable to us and I think is  also acceptable to the Americans, and in fact, any objective  observer of the negotiations.    [Kohen] To conclude, Mr. Ambassador, in your view, is their  any chance that Christopher will return to Jerusalem early in  the week with an iota of good tidings from Damascus?    [Rabinovich] I do not want to make forecasts, but if I look  objectively at the package of ideas he took with him, then it  would be very disappointing if the Syrians do not give him an  adequate response in order to create an impetus in these  negotiations.</p>

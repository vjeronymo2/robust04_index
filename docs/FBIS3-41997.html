The deputy minister for petrochemical affairs in the  Petroleum Ministry, who is also the director general of the  National Petrochemical Company [NPC], announced yesterday: The  units of the Arak Petrochemical Complex have begun full  production. In an exclusive interview with the Voice and Vision  of the Islamic Republic of Iran, he provided more details:    [Begin recording] Unidentified  correspondent: Can you give us details regarding the latest  petrochemical units that have recently become operational at the  Arak Petrochemical Complex?    Deputy minister: I can give the glad tidings to  our dear compatriots that the Islamic country of Iran is now the  primary producer of raw materials for the plastics industry in  Arak. We now produce various plastic substances while formerly  this industry was dependent on foreign imports. Fortunately,  today we produce 350,000 tons of such materials in Arak, which  fulfills most of the needs of our 1,500-2,000 indigenous  factories engaged in the plastics industry.    In the near future we will eliminate all the remaining  shortages with the production at the Bandar-e Imam Petrochemical  Complex. These products entered the market about two months ago.  Today, fortunately, the first phase of the Arak Petrochemical  Complex, which includes six industrial units, has become  completely operational and will cater to the needs of numerous  domestic factories. It may be worth mentioning here that  plastic materials are byproducts of petrochemicals, which have  extensive value-added uses and consumption in the areas of  foodstuffs, clothing, housing, hygiene, and health. You will  see the large variety of such products in these fields as they  replace natural materials such as minerals, iron ore, other  metals, and cotton.    I personally wish to stress that since we have been  successful in producing these goods from crude oil, the entire  country should endeavor to boost its use of these products in  the country and to reduce their use of natural products,  especially since synthetics are cheaper to use and produce. We  intend to replace natural products with plastics.    The production of petrochemicals in Arak marks a quantum  leap  and a change of the climate in the petrochemicals industry in  Iran, praise be to God. In the near future we will be quite  (?self-sufficient) in this area.    Correspondent: Thank you.    Deputy minister: You are welcome. [end  recording]</p>

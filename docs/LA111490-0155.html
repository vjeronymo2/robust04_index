AFRICA LAND REFORM  </P> <P> The African National Congress today called for urgent land redistribution to  end the white domination of property and to restore land that blacks lost under  apartheid laws.  </P> <P> In its first comprehensive report on a future land policy, the group said that  nationalizing property was one of several options for reaching a more equitable  distribution of land.  </P> <P> "In the context of a mixed economy, there would only be selective  nationalization, and . . . the distribution of this land would be based on  land-use needs," the report said.  </P> <P> It said landowners in those cases would be compensated in cash and bonds.  </P></p>

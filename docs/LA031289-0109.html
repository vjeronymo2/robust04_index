			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY LINES: COMFORT OF LOVE SEATS  </P> <P> The so-called "decorative arts" -- everything from pottery to love seats --  often fall into the abyss between the "high" arts and commerce. Putting  furniture in museums to be gazed upon as art objects is a relatively modern  notion.  </P> <P> The new Center for the Study of Decorative Arts in San Juan Capistrano is the  first of its kind on the West Coast. Situated in a delightful cluster of  Mission-style buildings centered on a patio garden, the center opens its doors  with an exhibition titled "California Style: Collectors and Collections."  </P> <P> The exhibition features room settings composed of the furniture, ceramics,  needlework, textiles and other decorative arts.  </P> <P> "Because our homes and environments leave lasting impressions on our  intellectual and spiritual growth, we are committed to (integrating) the  history of furniture, architecture, decorations and gardens," said center  director G.P. (Gep) Durenberger.  </P> <P> The great social virtue of the decorative arts is the way they reassure us  about the continuity of our culture. Unlike painting or sculpture, love seats  comfort our bottoms rather than challenge our complacencies. Visitors to the  center are certain to come away smiling with pleasure. LEON WHITESON  </P></p>

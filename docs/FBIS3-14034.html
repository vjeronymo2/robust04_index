			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Quotation marks as published] </F>   [Excerpt] General (Retd) Mirza Aslam Beg has further  elaborated his theory about the `encirclement' of China by the  United States and the role of Pakistan and India are required to  play in this programme. He had earlier expressed the view that  an `independent' Kashmir was being sought by Washington so that  it could serve as `spying post' against China within the grand  strategy of `encirclement'. According to him, the continuation  in force of the Pressler Amendment was a victory of Jewish and  Hindu lobbies against Pakistan. On the American insistence that  India and Pakistan should normalise their relations, the general  is of the view that the two South Asian states are sought to be  brought together as a par tof the `encirclement' policy by  Washington.    Needless to say, the retired chief of the army staff is  saying things that people want to hear, given the political  environment in Pakistan. Because there is such a uniformity of  intellectual opinion in the country, some rules of debate are  not being observed, somewhat like the one way debates shown on  PTV. At the risk of being called Jewish agent, let us look at  the views expressed by the general who, it must be said in all  fairness, believes in debate. Would an `independent' Kashmir be  a good listening post against China when a much less isolated  Nepal or even Pakistan would be available? What kind of  `listening' would Washington want in addition to the satellite  surveillance it already has over China? Would it want to use  Kashmir militarily when it has missiles that can be delivered  effectively and probably more accurately from the Indian Ocean?  [passage omitted]  *</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Morgan Crucible After more than Pounds 200m of rights issues since 1989, it comes as a relief to discover that Morgan Crucible can finally generate some cash. Since the Holt Lloyd car-care business is also suddenly making much larger profits, it should turn out to be worth more than the Pounds 50m or so of disposal proceeds previously pencilled in. Once it is sold, the rights issue fears which have held the shares back should be a thing of the past. That, at least, was yesterday's market reading. The danger is that, having been down on the company for so long, sentiment will swing too far in the other direction. That Morgan managed a Pounds 24m reduction in working capital during a period when sales rose nearly 20 per cent suggests that management tolerated a lax approach in the past. Other features of its interim results suggest the business is being run with an eye to cash. The more limited use of provisions, though, may simply reflect a dearth of new acquisitions. Morgan's bad old habits could quickly re-assert themelves once gearing pressures are lifted. From this perspective, any sale of Holt Lloyd could turn out a mixed blessing. Not only is it likely to be dilutive; without Holt Lloyd underlying operating profits would not even have risen by 1 per cent. Since trading conditions look set to remain lacklustre in Morgan's main markets, the temptation may be to go for something flashy - and risky - in a new activity or location. Once it has sold Holt Lloyd, Morgan Crucible must show it can use its new freedom wisely.</p>

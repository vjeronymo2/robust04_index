Yegorova, EAN, and ITAR-TASS:  "Ames' Trail in the Caucasus"]    [Text] The case of the murder of CIA staffer Fred Woodruff  last year in Georgia will most likely be reopened.    Commenting on the wranglings in the world of international  espionage, Tbilisi's newspaper REZONANS reported certain  details. Attention was, for instance, focused on the fact that  Aldrich Ames was in Georgia a week before Woodruff died.  Attention was not paid to this fact at the time, but Ames's  visit to Georgia is now arousing definite suspicions.</p>

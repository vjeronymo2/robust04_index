			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Move to allow incentives for workers to quit trade unions THE GOVERNMENT is to move quickly to strengthen employers' rights to derecognise trade unions and introduce personal contracts. This follows a Court of Appeal ruling that it is unlawful for workers to be offered financial incentives to give up union membership. A last-minute amendment to the employment bill going through the House of Lords will make clear an employer's right to withhold a pay increase from any worker who refuses to sign a personal contract. A separate late amendment to the bill will deal with workers who refuse to transfer to a new employer under the EC Transfer of Undertakings Regulations (Protection of Employment) - known as the Tupe regulations. The current uncertainties surrounding Tupe have been of particular concern to companies bidding to take over work from the public sector. Last Friday the Court of Appeal ruled that employers' use of financial incentives to workers to leave a union amounted to unlawful discrimination against those who wished to continue their membership. The court upheld two appeals by members of the RMT transport union and the National Union of Journalists whose employers, Associated British Ports and Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail, had offered pay rises to staff prepared to sign personal contracts but not to those who wanted to remain union members. The Department of Employment said yesterday that an amendment to the trade union reform and employment rights bill would be brought forward at the bill's third reading in the Lords, probably in the next few days. The amendment would 'clarify the law to allow employers to derecognise unions if they so want', said the department. The move provoked a sharp reaction from unions yesterday. Mr John Foster, NUJ general secretary, said: 'This is corruption. They are seeking to change the law with no consultation and no green paper. It is treating judges with contempt. This amendment is a blatant encouragement for firms to derecognise unions and further destroy workplace rights in Britain.' The separate amendment relating to Tupe will mean that any worker who refuses to transfer to a new employer after an organisation is taken over - or work in the public sector is contracted out - will be deemed to have left their job voluntarily. In the case of Katsikas v Konstantinidis in the European Court of Justice in December, it was decided that an employee had a right not to be transferred, but that it was up to member states whether employees had a right to continue to be employed by the previous employer.</p>

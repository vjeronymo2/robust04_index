			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMOG ALERTS  </P> <P> The Times' editorial ('Smog Watch: Breath Tests," Sept. 15) that supported the  proposed change in ozone first-stage smog alerts showed greater understanding  of the health issue involved than the final vote of the state Air Resources  Board (ARB).  </P> <P> The ARB decision to issue a "health advisory" message to the public instead of  a first-stage smog alert message undermines years of effort by the South Coast  Air Quality Management District and the American Lung Assn.  </P> <P> Our efforts have been directed at increasing the awareness of exercising  adults, parents of young children, school districts and individuals with  breathing problems that strenuous physical activities should be rescheduled  when smog alerts are forecast or attained.  </P> <P> Until we achieve healthful air quality, timely advice for self-protection is  our lungs' only defense. The ARB decision appears to be a compromise that is  not in the best interest of public health. We can, and should do better.  </P> <P> JEFFREY ALPERT, Chairman  </P> <P> Environmental and Occupational Health  </P> <P> Committee, American Lung Assn.  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

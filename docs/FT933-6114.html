			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / More long-term pay deals as inflation stabilises STABLE inflation is encouraging negotiators to reconsider long-term pay deals, according to a study from Incomes Data Services, the research organisation, Lisa Wood writes. Agreements for two years and more are now a significant feature of pay bargaining for manual workers in a number of manufacturing sectors. These include motor vehicles and components, shipbuilding, general engineering and chemicals. The study found that while most of the new long-term deals applied for two years, a number of three-year agreements had been reached at companies such as Avon Rubber, BAT, Borden (UK), Rhone-Poulenc and Royal Ordnance. The study also recorded one four-year deal. Study 536 from IDS, 193 St John Street, London EC1V 4LS. By subscription.</p>

			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WAR PLANNERS SKETCH STRATEGY FOR DESERT FIGHT  </P> <P> President Bush's plan for blocking an Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia combines a  deployment of American ground troops with sophisticated air and naval weaponry  designed to shatter advancing armored columns in the desert wastes of the  world's richest oil fields.  </P> <P> Even if they were unable to match an Iraqi invasion force tank for tank and man  for man, U.S. military forces would seek to dominate the battle from the skies,  raining down Maverick missiles and explosive mines on Iraqi tanks and infantry.  </P> <P> As sketched by U.S. military planners, a modern desert war would see  sophisticated fighters capitalizing on air superiority while naval guns bombard  a strategic coastal road and paratroopers dig in at crucial choke-points to  erect anti-tank defenses.  </P> <P> Such a battle would be costly to both sides. But, while it would be unlikely to  send Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his forces fleeing, it at least would  "soak up" Iraq's onslaught and "probably stop" any Hussein advance, a senior  military official said.  </P> <P> The specter of such a conflict -- involving some of the most elite troops and  warplanes that the United States can muster -- provides at last what American  officials say is a credible deterrent that makes it clear any Iraqi land grab  would be met with significant force.  </P> <P> But with Iraq's 1-million-man army dominating the region, there still is major  uncertainty about Hussein's intentions. Although the increased air power might  protect Saudi Arabian soil, experts said, it offers no hope of forcing the  enemy to roll back from Kuwait.  </P> <P> "This is an important step, but it don't get Kuwait back," Michael Dunn, a  Washington-based military consultant, said.  </P> <P> Indeed, military planners said Tuesday that the single most important facet of  the U.S. intervention may be the actual presence of Americans on the ground --  an unmistakable tripwire that virtually guarantees that any new Iraqi foray  would bring the United States to war.  </P> <P> They noted that with Tuesday's troop deployments, America's once-vague threat  of retribution had now been rendered immediate and vivid. The airborne weapons  Bush sent to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday can halt even the most well-armored tank.  </P> <P> "Deterrence means control of the other side's state of mind -- and this is  bound to get Hussein's attention," retired Navy Adm. Thomas Moorer said.  </P> <P> Air Force experts said that with access to Saudi air bases, which has now been  granted, U.S. warplanes could stall and exact heavy losses on any Iraqi ground  attack -- even a blitzkrieg that sent hundreds of tanks thundering down the  highway toward the Saudi oil port of Dhahran.  </P> <P> Under a scenario described by several military sources, such an attack would be  scouted out in advance by high-flying TR-1 spy planes and blunted from its  outset by super-secret Navy EA-6B Prowlers, whose electronic arsenal could  confound enemy communications.  </P> <P> Almost immediately, Air Force planes and Navy vessels in the Persian Gulf would  bombard the coastal roadway, forcing Iraqi columns into the sand. Tank-killing  F-16s and AH-64 Apache helicopters would join in the attack, firing Maverick  and Hellfire missiles.  </P> <P> Any Iraqi breakdown would quickly be compounded as tanks bogged down in traffic  and became more vulnerable to airborne raids.  </P> <P> "That terrain is very hard to hide tanks in," one Pentagon war-planner said.  "They would look like a fleet of ships floating out in a big, featureless  desert."  </P> <P> At the same time, American and Saudi ground forces, dug in at crucial points  and armed with thousands of antitank weapons, would fire additional salvos at  the narrow spaces where increasingly unfriendly Saudi Arabian terrain would  force the tanks into a single file.  </P> <P> "You could delay them, you could stop them, you could hurt them badly," said  Benjamin Lambeth, a former combat fighter pilot who is now a RAND Corp.  consultant and expert on tactical air forces.  </P> <P> "What you're dealing with is a situation in which U.S. air assets would be used  as a spoiling factor, with a view to making any such operations prohibitively  costly," Lambeth added. "And the sooner you have them there, the easier it is  to do this."  </P> <P> To be sure, Pentagon planners caution that military operations are inherently  uncertain, and often even the best-laid plans do not work out. Moreover, they  concede that U.S. forces have little experience in desert warfare, particularly  against troops like the war-hardened Iraqis.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, strategists say that the size and type of the force that the  President has ordered deployed makes the prospect that the mission might  succeed a credible threat to Iraqi commanders -- and that in itself may be  sufficient to forestall any new attack.  </P> <P> The optimistic scenario envisions U.S. aircraft quickly assuming control of the  skies, leaving American fighters and helicopters free to strafe oncoming  armored forces without fear of being blindsided from the air.  </P> <P> In such early dogfights, early-warning radar surveillance planes operated by  Saudi forces would play a crucial role in managing the battle from the air. But  experts warned that despite the presence of the AWACS planes, the air battle  still might bring heavy casualties.  </P> <P> Top-of-the-line Air Force fighters, such as F-15s and older F-111s, would joust  with advanced Soviet-made MIG-23s, flown by Iraqi pilots whose skill and  experience makes them among the most feared flyers in the Middle East.  </P> <P> And even if the American forces prevailed aloft, they would still have to  contend with French-made Mirages and tank-protecting Iraqi aircraft called  Su-25 "Frogfoots." Among the planes that the Frogfoots would have to face: RF-4  reconnaissance/attack planes that the Air Force calls Wild Weasels.  </P> <P> "This is not a fight that we're looking for," one Pentagon planner said. "But  those forces are ready to go to war today."  </P> <P> If the defensive effort foundered -- or perhaps even if it did not -- American  forces might well respond by widening the battlefield and striking deep into  Iraqi territory at supply depots and airfields, the military analysts said.  </P> <P> Among the weapons that might be brought to bear: A-6 Intruders and A-7 Corsairs  from American carriers, F-111s based in Turkey or even long-range B-52s now  believed to be in the Indian Ocean -- any of which could attack behind Iraqi  lines.  </P> <P> But the more likely assault would come from Tomahawk cruise missiles, armed  with conventional explosives and launched from Navy vessels from as far as  1,600 miles.  </P> <P> "There is no doubt in my mind that we would blow the hell out of every airfield  in Iraq," said one retired Army general, who insisted on anonymity.  </P> <P> Iraq has one of the best air defense networks in the world, military analysts  say.  </P> <P> Added Moorer, the retired Navy admiral: "This is all just part of deterrence,  to make Hussein stop and think."  </P> <P> RELATED STORIES: A8 through A12, D1, D6, D7 and E1  </P></p>

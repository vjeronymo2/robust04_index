			<p>BFN     [Text] The forthcoming visit to Riga by U.S. President Bill  Clinton may become an important political event strengthening  the international security of the three Baltic states, says a  statement by right-wing opposition leader Vytautas Landsbergis  which was made public today. Lithuania should support the  positions of Latvia and Estonia in two separate and not linked  issues: a speedy and unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops  and a citizenship law, Vytautas Landsbergis notes.    As is known, the Presidents of the United States and the  Baltic states are to meet in Riga 6 July.    In Landsbergis's opinion, at this meeting Lithuania should  ensure support for its government's stand, which is supported by  the Seimas opposition, that Russia's demands to conclude a  bilateral military transit treaty with Lithuania are political  and should be rejected as contrary to the provisions of the  Lithuanian Constitution and Lithuania's national interests.  According to Vytautas Landsbergis, it is also very important to  know whether the principles of equal rights and opportunities in  the relations of states with NATO are still being adhered to, or  whether the West will be drawn into an Orwellian world where one  NATO partner is (?more equal) than the others.</p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NORIEGA ORDERED ATTACK, ENVOY SAYS;  </P> <P> U.S. AMBASSADOR CALLS ON PANAMANIANS TO TOPPLE REGIME  </P> <P> U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis, recalled for consultations with President Bush,  today accused military leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega of directing his  supporters to kill an opposition leader during an attack on a protest rally  last week.  </P> <P> Davis, in a statement issued before returning to Washington, said the  Panamanian military should topple Noriega, echoing a call made by Bush after  the attack on the opposition rally and the annulment of the May 7 election.  </P> <P> "What happened was a deliberate Noriega-directed attempt on the life of one of  the candidates," Davis said. "From eyewitness reports and from the evidence of  the wound suffered by the bodyguards of second vice presidential winner  Guillermo Ford, the attack was meant to kill him."  </P> <P> Ford and other candidates and supporters of the Civil Democratic Opposition  Alliance were beaten by members of the pro-Noriega paramilitary squad during a  rally Wednesday that was called to protest fraud and violence in the election.  </P> <P> Davis said only "the courage and quick thinking" of Ford's bodyguards saved  him. He quoted witnesses and reports of gunshot wounds suffered by Ford's  bodyguards as evidence but declined to elaborate. One of Ford's bodyguards died  in the attack. The government has accused Ford's bodyguards of firing on a  group of Noriega supporters.  </P> <P> "Nor should anyone be mistaken about who carried out the attack. There is clear  evidence Noriega's goons did it," Davis said.  </P> <P> Davis echoed a call by Bush for the 15,000-man Panamanian Defense Forces to  overthrow Noriega but said, "I do not have that many contacts any more . . . to  incite a rebellion." He said most people agreed that the best way to remove  Noriega "would be for his own Panamanian Defense Forces to take care of it."  </P> <P> Anti-Noriega demonstrators Sunday waved white handkerchiefs and shouted  "justice, justice" in churches across Panama. The protests appeared to indicate  further distancing of Panama's powerful Catholic Church hierarchy from Noriega,  </P></p>

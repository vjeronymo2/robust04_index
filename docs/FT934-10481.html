			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Rail sell-off bill to become law today THE RAILWAY privatisation bill was expected last night to become law today. Its passage was cleared when the Lords shied away from a constitutional clash with the government. The Lords' final decision yesterday to back down means that British Rail's opportunities to bid for franchises to run services will be restricted to routes where no credible bidder emerges. Ministers were visibly relieved by the bill's successful passage through the Lords, which ended more than 190 hours of debate in both Houses. The bill is expected to receive royal assent a few hours before the end of the parliamentary session today. However, the frantic manoeuvring which preceded the final stages undermined the government's attempts to suggest that the difficulties of the past 18 months were over. The government was seriously embarrassed on Wednesday when it was forced to interrupt Commons business to reverse three defeats inflicted in the Lords. The defeats - and the uproar which followed in the Commons - threw doubt on claims that the Conservative party had united in the wake of ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Mr John Major, the prime minister, told MPs at question time that the rowdy scenes on Wednesday night were 'a disgrace to parliament'. Officials said the prime minister was particularly upset by Labour's whips, who challenged the count on a division reversing the Lords defeats, in effect accusing the Conservative tellers of lying. Conservative MPs said Labour had indulged in a number of unparliamentary tricks, including jamming the doors open in the division lobbies to delay the vote, switching tellers halfway through, and deliberately miscounting. Opposition MPs said the unparliamentary behaviour was not one-sided. Mr James Wallace, a Liberal Democrat MP, said he was jostled by a Conservative whip as he tried to vote. Labour leaders were unrepentant about the unruly scenes. Mr Brian Wilson, deputy transport spokesman, said it was one of the few occasions when the opposition had been able to make procedural tactics work against the government. Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment secretary, said Labour had 'done a marvellous job' in delaying the bill. 'The government got everything they deserved,' he said. Mr Prescott said few private-sector companies were likely to bid for franchises. He claimed that the government would quietly drop the bill, but warned that a Labour government would recreate a publicly owned national rail network. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said he expected at least seven of the proposed 25 route franchises to be awarded by 1995.</p>

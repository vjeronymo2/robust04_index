			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed NN/AB: "The Chairman of the Council of </F> States at UN Headquarters in New York -- Blue Helmets and  Election Monitoring Missions on Agenda of Talks"]    [Text] New York, 17 May (ATS) -- Chairman of the Swiss  Council of States Riccardo Jagmetti met with several  high-ranking UN officials in New York on Monday [16 May] and  Tuesday. This visit provided the opportunity to assess the  current state of relations between Switzerland and the United  Nations. The creation of a contingent of Swiss blue helmets was  a main point on the agenda of the talks.    Mr. Jagmetti told the press that he had been "impressed by  the prestige that Switzerland enjoys at the United Nations."  His guests highlighted the quality of Switzerland's performance  in the different UN missions, mainly in Namibia, Western Sahara,  and South Africa. In this respect, the officials in charge of  UN election operations would appreciate an increased commitment  by Switzerland during election monitoring missions principally  during the preparation phase, Mr. Jagmetti said.    Marrack Goulding, deputy UN general secretary for political  affairs, showed a marked interest in the possible creation of a  contingent of Swiss blue helmets. The participation of  militiamen [miliciens] in peacekeeping operations would be most  welcome at a time when the United Nations lacks specialists  active in civilian life. Finally, the conditions set by  Switzerland, as a result of its neutrality status, are fully  accepted by the United Nations, Mr. Jagmetti added.    The upper house chairman underlined the importance of the  role played by members of Parliament in the relations between  the different states and the United Nations. He said that their  involvement in UN affairs is essential for forming public  opinion. Parliament must pass the information from the United  Nations to the citizens.</p>

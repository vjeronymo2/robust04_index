			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Specialeyes cuts loss to Pounds 187,000 Specialeyes, the USM-traded optical retailer, reported a reduced first half deficit as sales were maintained despite a highly competitive market. Pre-tax losses emerged at Pounds 187,000 in the 24 weeks to May 14, down from Pounds 333,000 last time. Sales totalled Pounds 9.5m. Mr Jim Power, chairman, attributed the improved gross margin to 'better buying' while pressure on costs was maintained. Trading in the early weeks of the second half, however, remained 'difficult and uncertain'. Sales of contact lens solutions had come under pressure following the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's decision to widen the availability of such products. Mr Power said the group was attempting to counter the problem by promoting a new scheme to build customer loyalty and repeat business.</p>

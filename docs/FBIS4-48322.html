			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Tyrone August] </F>   [Text] The independent political magazine WORK IN PROGRESS  will close down next week because of a long-standing financial  crisis. Funding problems will finally achieve what several  National Party governments failed to do -- silence one of the  most articulate voices against apartheid.    "WIP's funding base -- primarily donor agencies in Europe --  has all but disappeared as (they) have cut back on support for  projects in South Africa," said editor Chris Vick in a statement.    "Because several funding pledges have not materialised, or  have been delayed considerably, the magazine is heavily in debt."    Vick said there was no possibility of getting substantial  funding for the magazine in the near future. "Although we are  entering a stage when those in power will be committed to  democracy, justice and reconstruction, there is still going to  be a need for watchdogs when can bark and bite."    Vick criticised the lack of support from potential  advertisers and the commercial print media.</p>

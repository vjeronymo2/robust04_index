			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / International Company News: Credit Suisse in talks to buy Baden bank CREDIT SUISSE, Switzerland's third-largest bank, is in talks to buy Gewerbebank Baden, the leading bank in the Baden region with assets of SFr1.66bn (Dollars 1.21bn) at the end of June. The talks are with BBC Brown Boveri, the Swiss partner in the ABB Asea Brown Boveri engineering group, which holds a 38 per cent voting stake in the bank. Winterthur Insurance, which holds 13 per cent of the votes, is also co-operating. Mr Leo Menz, senior vice-president, finance, of BBC, said the shares would be sold at slightly above market prices, and that minority shareholders would be offered identical terms in a public offer. Gewerbebank Baden's bearer shares last traded at SFr760 earlier this week and its registered shares at SFr255, valuing the bank at SFr123.8m. The sale is part of BBC's policy to sell off participations in businesses other than ABB. Following the sale of the bank, ABB would account for 99 per cent of BBC's interests.</p>

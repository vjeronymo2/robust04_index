			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Punch drunk and proud The hook is a snappy punch. The proper technique is to get close to your opponent, pivot quickly from feet and hips, and deliver a sharp blow to the side of the head, ideally the temple. The object is to cause an abrupt sideways impact; in ringside parlance, to make your opponent's brain 'wobble'. Even in the short distance of an amateur boxing bout, a wobbled brain is dangerous. The opponent is momentarily disoriented, and cannot focus on subsequent attacks. That is why a well-timed, well-placed hook is probably the most effective move in any fighter's repertoire. Boxers and their trainers will be perfectly candid about this. Many punches hurt, but the hook hurts in a particular way. Apart from jolting the co-ordination powers of the central nervous system, a good hook will leave even the most bovine-shouldered boxer with a headache for hours, perhaps days. Boxing is quintessentially about giving and receiving pain, and that pain may include temporary or permanent damage to the brain. So for a group of Royal Navy surgeons to 'prove', as they have done in this month's Lancet, that boxing has damaged the intelligences of some of the servicemen who participate in the sport, is hardly a revelation. In this Lancet report, the incidence of 'cerebral profusion' is demonstrated to be significantly higher among boxers than among comparable fit young servicemen. The brain wobbles have left their mark, and that mark has been scientifically measured. But no boxer or trainer is going to be at all surprised. The amazement would come if it were ever proven that taking a hook to the temple did not affect one's subsequent powers of reaction and response. So what is the upshot of this new report? Obviously, the neuro-surgeons at Gosport would like to see no more inter-regimental boxing in the services. As yet, a ban seems unlikely. But if the services do decide to dispatch with boxing, it will not be a victory for good sense. It will go down as yet another triumph of liberal busybodyism. Busybodyism is often myopic: focusing on tiny problematicals, when giant monsters loom. Such is the busybodyism which gave us rear seat belts, while doing so little to prevent the poisoning of our atmosphere. And medical busybodyism is often empirically suspect. Few doctors box: so boxing is a soft target for their busybodyism. They are much quieter about rugby, which is popular in the training hospitals. And yet anyone who has tried both boxing and rugby will vouchsafe that the chances of serious and lasting injury are far higher in rugby than boxing. Which brings us to the most feeble element of the ban-boxing logic. Not long ago, a survey was carried out on the risk factors of all sorts of sports and pastimes. The statistics revealed, of course, that no one concerned about safety should ever take up DIY, rock-climbing or white-water canoeing. Curiously, fishing emerged as the most danger-ridden sport of all. If ever boxing should be banned, one hopes for consistency from our legislators: let us be rid, then, of not only fishing, but motor-racing, yachting, and skiing too. To charge down an icy slope on two strips of plastic is to flirt with paralysis: since this is a component of training for the Royal Marines, perhaps it too shall come under medical scrutiny. But what is most insidious about this busybodyism is its class-based bias. Boxing is chiefly disapproved of by the middle-classes. It has disappeared from even the heartiest of British public schools. It is a sport which notoriously offers disadvantaged youths the chance to leave their disadvantages behind them. Hence its survival - in urban boys' clubs, among the Newmarket stable-lads, and the volunteers for the Territorial Army. If boxing were ever banned, the prediction is that it would go underground, and we would be flung back to bare-knuckle prize-fighting. No one is claiming that boxing is a 'civilising' sport. But it is often disciplining, and to aggressive, working-class youth it is probably also a therapy. The busybodies would like such youth to be sitting down quietly with copies of Tolstoy and Voltaire - for this, we are told, is how jailed heavyweight champion Mike Tyson is spending his time. This is to wish not only for a quiet world, but also a dull one. The French philosopher Michel Foucault said: the proximity of danger is an essential part of being alive.</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / International Company News: Tisch abandons plan to bid for Macy MR Laurence Tisch, the US businessman whose interests range from the CBS media group to insurance and property, last night abandoned plans to acquire a controlling interest in R. H. Macy, the ailing New York-based retailer - less than 12 hours after it emerged that he might be riding to the rescue of the heavily-indebted company. Loews Corporation, one of Mr Tisch's companies, was reported as saying an unamed 'major Macy creditor' had rejected the acquisition terms. Throughout the day, neither Mr Tisch's office, nor Macy itself would comment on the situation although Macy junk bonds surged on the speculation. In absence of any firm news, traders were left to speculate on the shape of the Tisch package and its chances of success. 'It all depends on the board, and getting bondholders to agree,' commented one at lunchtime. Mr Tisch is a member of Macy's colourful and prestigious board - which includes the likes of Henry Kissinger and Mr Alfred Taubman, owner of Sotheby's - and already held a 15 per cent stake in the retail group. Under the proposed recapitalisation plan, it was rumoured that Mr Tisch's interests would have invested heavily - perhaps to the tune of Dollars 1bn - and taken a controlling stake in Macy. As well as shareholders, certain debt-holders would have been bought out at well below par value. Macy has three junk bond issues, with a total face value of Dollars 1.3bn. In the face of the Tisch withdrawal, there remains pressure on Macy and further decisions over its future may be made over the weekend. Earlier this month, Macy delayed payments to trade suppliers, in the hope of meeting certain 'clean down' provisions attached to a Dollars 587.7m revolving credit facility. These demanded that Macy cut borrowings under the facility to Dollars 150m for 30 days between mid-December and mid-February and to Dollars 75m for seven consecutive days in that period. When it announced the delay, Macy said it intended to resume payments to its suppliers on January 25, once it was able to draw down funds under the facility. But there have been more recent suggestions that Macy and its banking group - led by Chemical Bank and Bankers Trust - were still in negotiations. Macy, believed to have about Dollars 3.7bn of long-term debt, lost Dollars 155m in the three months to early November.</p>

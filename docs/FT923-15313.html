			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / International Company News: Playing politics with a country's top jobs - The last phase of the French cabinet's review of the corporate elite WHEN Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, contemplated the latest three-yearly review of the top jobs at France's state-controlled companies, he made clear that he did not envisage any dramatic changes. His reasons were clear. The general election is only a year away. Many of France's nationalised companies are struggling to adjust to intense international competition. The last thing the French premier wanted was to add to that instability with by stiring controversy over government's role in industry. Yesterday, Mr Beregovoy's cabinet completed the third and final phase of the review, which encompassed the top jobs at 45 of France's state-controlled companies, including the two biggest banks, three large insurers, the gas and electricity groups, and a string of key industrial concerns ranging from Air France to Thomson electronics. Mr Beregovoy achieved the stability. The only changes in the financial sector concerned smaller banks, such as Compagnie Financiere du CIC and Societe Marseillaise de Credit. Most of the chairmen to lose their jobs in the industrial sector, apart from Mr Francis Lorentz of Bull, did so because they were about to pass the mandatory retirement age of 65. But Mr Beregovoy has been less successful at averting controversy. The background story of this summer's three-yearly review is a neat illustration of the pervading influence of politics over corporate life in France. Initially, it had looked as though there would be changes at the top of at least one big bank, Banque Nationale de Paris, where the chairman, Mr Rene Thomas, 63, is due for retirement, and at an insurer, probably Groupe GAN, to create a job for Mr Daniel Lebeque, number two at BNP. At one stage, it even seemed feasible that Credit Lyonnais, the other big bank, would also lose its chairman, Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, because of the controversy over his aggressive strategy. In the end, Mr Thomas stayed at BNP. His job is said to have been offered to Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, head of the French Treasury, who turned it down reportedly for fear of upsetting Mr Lebegue, his predecessor at the Treasury. Mr Thomas, a close friend of President Francois Mitterrand, was prevailed upon to postpone his retirement. This meant that all three insurers - Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), Assurances Generales de France (AGF) and GAN - kept their chairmen as there was no need to make way for Mr Lebegue. Meanwhile, Mr Haberer remained at Credit Lyonnais despite the fact that one director abstained from the board's vote on his renomination. Mr Haberer had seemed vulnerable until March when his good friend, Mr Beregovoy, became prime minister. The changes in industry show the same pattern of political patronage. Mr Lorentz lost his job at Bull mainly because, like Mr Haberer, he had pursued a highly controversial strategy, but unlike the Credit Lyonnais chairman, he had no powerful friends to protect him. Mr Lorentz's dismissal prompted Le Point, the news magazine, last week to run a feature entitled 'Les Presidents du President', arguing that Mr Mitterrand's intervention was making a nonsense of Mr Beregovoy's attempts to depoliticise the review. Another controversy erupted this week when Mr Gilles Menage was named as the new chairman of Electricite de France (EDF), replacing the retiring Mr Pierre Delaporte. Mr Menage, 49, is the head of President Mitterrand's private office. The EDF trade unions immediately protested against his appointment. Despite the rows over Mr Lorentz and Mr Menage, the concept of political control over industry is so well-entrenched in French society  - where the state sector represents 12 per cent of the economy according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  - that there is no groundswell of demand for radical reform. However, there are signs of pressure for moderate changes within the system. Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister, recently suggested that the three-year tenure should be extended to five to give more continuity to the public sector. The pressure for change is likely to intensify as the government proceeds with its privatisation programme and is certain to accelerate if the right returns to power next year and accelerates privatisation. Even some of the state chairmen favour changes. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, who has just been renominated for the top job at UAP, recently said he believed nominations should be left to the board, not to the government. However, he did add, with the self-confidence typical of France's corporate elite, that 'the same people would probably end up in charge anyway'.</p>

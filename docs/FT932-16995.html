			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: IBM Europe faces anxious time - A novel experiment has yet to gain approval The European operations of International Business Machines will come under increasingly critical scrutiny in the next few months, as the troubled US company's newly appointed chief executive maps out his recovery strategy. Mr Louis Gerstner was quick to impress on senior foreign IBM managers in a conference telephone call last Friday that he sees IBM as a worldwide, rather than a US company. Europe, together with the Middle East and Africa, is the computer manufacturer's largest market with sales of Dollars 24.97bn last year compared with Dollars 24.63bn for the US. Its ailing economies are a main source of IBM's problems. Operating profit was halved last year to Dollars 1.5bn compared with Dollars 3bn in 1991. After taking restructuring charges into account, the area recorded an overall loss before tax of Dollars 1.7bn. The UK subsidiary with pre-tax losses of Pounds 616m (Dollars 927m), was the company's worst individual performer. It costs 25 per cent to 30 per cent more to lay off a worker in Europe than in the US, IBM reckons. Some 10,000 of the area's 90,000 jobs were scheduled to go this year. Mr Gerstner may well decide that thousands more are called for. Mr Renato Riverso, head of IBM Europe, said this week: 'At the core of IBM's interest is the development of the European market.' He was speaking before travelling to the US for a first meeting with Mr Gerstner to discuss European strategy. IBM's own projections make gloomy reading. It says that European investment in machinery and capital equipment, which includes computers, software and peripherals, will fall by 2.1 per cent in 1993. The greatest fall will be in Germany, where investment is expected to decline by 5.7 per cent, and in Italy where the decline will be 4.4 per cent. In France, a decline of 2.5 per cent is projected; the only bright spot in Europe is the UK where IBM expects positive growth of 4.1 per cent. Mr Riverso said that although he could not yet measure a difference he believed that the strategy put in place by IBM UK management was taking effect: 'I am sure that the UK will recover,' he said. Operations in the former Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland were showing profitable growth of some 30 per cent a year from a very low base, Mr Riverso said, but little or no contribution could be expected from the former Soviet Union where operations had been pared back after a series of disappointments. A plan to build about 40,000 school rooms equipped with personal computers foundered when funds ran out after 1,250 school rooms had been completed. The company broke even on that project but it is still awaiting the initial payment on a Dollars 150m contract to build a computerised airline reservation system for Aeroflot, the Russian airline. 'This is not an area on which we are focusing for immediate investment,' Mr Riverso said. In the past two years, IBM's European operations have undergone a transformation from a megalithic, hierarchical organisation which 'moved like an army' according to Mr Riverso, to a federation of small units organised along a multiplicity of axes. Some deal with vertical industry sectors such as finance, others with whole businesses such as personal computers or computing services. The company has been analysing manufacturing capacity and likely demand for its products and concluded before the turn of the year that it had excess capacity in semiconductors, mainframes and data storage products. Several European plants were at risk of closure. In the event, Europe is at the earliest stage of a novel experiment which has yet to have Mr Gerstner's approval. Four of the company's best-known manufacturing sites, Havant in the UK, Montpellier in France, Valencia in Italy and Jarfalla in Sweden have been redesignated as industrial business centres. They will continue to be owned and operated by IBM but will be largely controlled by local management. They are to find new business outside IBM and be designated as preferred suppliers to IBM's businesses. Eventually, these IBCs may be sold, or become independent subsidiaries with their own terms and conditions of employment, IBM said. However, the IBCs must prove profitable or face closure. IBM Havant, on the English south coast, manufactures small disk drives and controllers, circuits and communications products. It has a distinctive reputation, having twice been chosen as sole source for vital IBM components. Mr Ken Wilkie, newly-appointed chief executive, says he sees the change as one of ownership and direction rather than an alternative to closure. 'I could not conceive of Havant being shut down,' he said yesterday. Havant is still producing devices vital to IBM's product offerings. It is far advanced, Mr Wilkie says, with negotiations which could lead it to manufacture products for other companies. Jarfalla, a printer plant, is selling a new print head it has developed to other companies However, IBM Europe is moving ahead with schemes created before Mr Gerstner's appointment and without any guarantee that the new chief executive will find them acceptable. Mr Riverso says the plan is 'the right direction' and 'a solid product'. But until Mr Gerstner announces his plans, it will be an anxious time for IBM employees in Europe.</p>

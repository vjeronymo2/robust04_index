			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Federal approach to policy urged BRITAIN needs a federal industrial policy which recognises that creating national or even European 'champions' is outmoded, according to a report today from the Institute for Public Policy Research. The left-of-centre think tank argues that industrial policy will fail unless it takes into account the power and importance of worldwide developments in technology, production and products. The report lists elements which should be included in the UK's industrial policy. These include an active competition policy accompanied by social and supply-side policies to minimise unemployment, and stringent environmental targets and quality standards in public purchasing.

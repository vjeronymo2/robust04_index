			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 10 (AA) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet  Cetin said on Sunday [10 April] that the United Nations will be  under moral blame if the claims that say Serbia carried out a  chemical attack on Gorazde become true.    Cetin said he called Bosnian Premier Haris Silajdzic on the  phone to talk about the developments happening in Bosnia and  added that Silajdzic said during their searches in hospitals,  they haven't met any evidence that chemical weapon was used in  Gorazde.    Cetin said there is no specific information that chemical  weapons were used and the number of casualties in Gorazde were  not known either.    The foreign minister said NATO was ready for intervention  however they haven't yet received any order from the UN  representative in Bosnia.    Cetin recalled that the situation in Gorazde was discussed  during a Turkish-Bosnian-Croatian tripartite meeting which was  held earlier this week "we called for the UN to take necessary  measures against the situation" he added.    "We have completed our preparations to call NATO and the UN  Security Council for a meeting if the claims come true" Cetin  said.</p>

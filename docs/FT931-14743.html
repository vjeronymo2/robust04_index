			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Allied-Lyons severs a Seagram trading link ALLIED-LYONS is to end the present contracts under which Seagram markets and distributes the UK group's Ballantine's Scotch whisky and other brands in France and Germany. Seagram, which has handled the brands in France since 1964 and in Germany since 1988, has been given notice that the arrangements will be terminated on December 31. However, talks are continuing between the groups about future distribution of the drinks, which include Courvoisier cognac, Kahlua and Tia Maria. Seagram said yesterday that loss of the contracts would have a relatively small financial impact but the North American group, which built Ballantine's into the best-selling Scotch in France, would clearly like to retain the agency business. It distributes some Allied brands in Korea and a few smaller Far East markets. In the meantime, it said that arrangements had been made to ensure continuity of supply of Allied's products and it would focus its efforts on a portfolio of its own and agency brands, including Jack Daniels and Jim Beam bourbons, and Southern Comfort. Allied said that it was still considering a number of options for distribution in France and Germany and no decision had yet been taken. The move reflects the general trend among international spirits groups to secure direct control of their brands distribution.</p>

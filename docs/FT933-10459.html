			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Arts: 'Il Trittico' and 'The Rake' - Spoleto Festival The first-time visitor to the Spoleto Festival had best obey two rules: wear sound, rubber-soled shoes (the steep, cobbled lanes of the lovely Umbrian town are treacherously slippery); and expect the unexpected. From the time Gian Carlo Menotti founded it, the Festival of Two Worlds  - as he officially calls it - has aimed not only to bring Italy and the Western hemisphere together, but also to foster young talent, encourage artists to explore new paths, and cajole the traditionally staid and unadventurous Italian audience to open its mind and eyes to unfamiliar experiences. As the Festival approaches the end of its 36th year, Menotti deservedly looks back on his achievements with pride. But as he ruefully admits, there have also been some monumental fiascos, like the Visconti Traviata in which the soprano lost her voice before opening night, when, to make matters worse, the tenor got completely lost in the final act. But, to compensate for that awful evening - one of Visconti's worst, too - there were occasions like the Visconti-Schippers Manon Lescaut, a brief, unforgettable recital in the little Teatro Caio Melisso by the unknown Jessye Norman, and the Italian debut of the Tokyo Quartet in the same house. For Spoleto's operagoers this year's festival may well be memorable chiefly for the debut here of a young Chilean soprano, Cristina Gallardo Domas, whose Suor Angelica provided the one real excitement in an otherwise enjoyable, but uneven production of Puccini's Trittico, designed by William Orlandi, staged by Menotti and conducted by Spoleto's new musical director, Steven Mercurio. Of Puccini's works Il Trittico is one of the most problematical; the three short, intense operas are filled with traps for the unwary. In Il tabarro Mercurio and his leading singers decided on a full-blast approach, everything at top volume, addressed squarely at the public. Well, the score is rich and can survive and even repay this unsubtle, but sincere handling. As Michele, the baritone Haijing Fu stood out, sombre and moving and sinister, implacable as well. It was good to see the lovers, Giorgetta (Maria Prosperi) and Luigi (Rick Moon), played unromantically, she rather dowdy, he ordinary, plain. The set was misty, a traditional, recognisable, handsome Paris. Menotti's staging was also traditional, with some of the master's familiar trademarks, including abundant employment of supers. Since Puccini wrote a number of vignettes into the work, the stage at times seemed overcrowded, as if Michele had dropped anchor near the Gare de Lyon. The cloister of Suor Angelica was no more cluttered than necessary, and the girls of the Westminster Choir formed a convincing, varied community of nuns. The interpreter of Anglica ideally must have, besides a warm, supple, melting voice, an expressive face; and Gallardo Domas, while not beautiful in any conventional sense, has the biggest eyes seen on the opera stage since Callas. Though short of stature, she took on heroic dimensions in the conclusion of the piece, from the aria 'Senza mamma', her delivery powerful yet nuanced, to the last gasp of her death. Comic opera is always a problem for inexperienced singers, and most of the Gianni Schicchi cast succumbed to the temptation to mug outrageously. The immensely tall, gangling Alan Held has an impressive voice, but he is not - or, at least, not yet - a Schicchi, lacking that vein of cynical cruelty that belongs to the character. Nevertheless, the work moved fast and securely, and held the public. The Spoleto Festival Orchestra was, as usual, composed of very young players, students or recent conservatory graduates. Inevitably, the quality varies from one festival to the next and, it must be said, 1993 was not a vintage year. Mercurio - not well received by the Italian press - seemed to have clear ideas about the music and he set suitable tempos, allowing the singers just the right amount of liberty. But his players, notably a pesky, shrill piccolo, occasionally did him a disservice and the sound was not always pleasant. The other opera on the Spoleto calendar, Stravinsky's Rake's Progress, made use of a much-reduced orchestra and the conductor - another young American, Arthur Fagen - was able to draw more focused playing from this smaller group. The Caio Melisso is about the size of the Theatre Royal, Wexford, and like its Irish counterpart, the Italian house flatters voices, so singers can relax. Thus, while neither the tenor Michael Rees Davis nor the soprano Ann Christine Larsson seems to have a large instrument, neither had to force; and Stravinsky's sinuous lines emerged with spontaneity and sweetness. Larsson's enunciation was sometimes blurred, but she was a touching Anne; Davis made every vowel and consonant do its job, and the splendid poetry made the proper effect. Richard Cowan's Nick had a bold swagger and a black sound; his interpretation was a hampered by his too-obvious costume. The costumes and the sets were by the British caricaturist-cartoonist-illustrator David Hughes, making his first foray into opera. His designs, somewhere between Steinberg and Hockney, displayed a ready wit and a fertile imagination, but they occasionally went off the rails (why did the crowd at the auction have to wear bird-beaks?). Roman Terleckyj, who has on many occasions acted as Menotti's assistant, staged the work in harmony with Hughes's vision. There were some excellent moments - the finale, with the singers removing their makeup at a row of mirrors, for example - while other scenes, Bedlam for one, were filled with aimless bustle.</p>

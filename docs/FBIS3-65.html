			<p>SUMMARY:      Recent Japanese press articles have detailed the  mushrooming of policy study groups formed among Japanese Diet  members, most of which cross party lines and factions within  individual parties.  Their reported aim is to both promote political  reform and to act as catalysts for the "second phase" of political  restructuring.      Cross-Party Policy Study Groups Have Proliferated      More than ten cross-party policy study groups have been formed  since the inauguration of the Hosokawa administration in August  1993, according to the 8 January 1994 SANKEI SHIMBUN.  These are in  addition to several that were formed in 1992 and early 1993.  The  study groups have been formed, according to a Sakigake (Harbinger  Party) leader, because "Diet members are insecure in the current  chaotic political situation and want to join forces with others" so  as to be ready for the "second stage" of Japan's political  reaignment--the possible formation of new political parties.  SANKEI  notes that the study groups can be "roughly divided" into three  categories:  1) those composed of "conservative centrists" that  include LDP Diet members; 2) conservative centrist groupings that  exclude LDP members; and 3) centrist members of the SDPJ and the  Democratic Socialist Party (DSP).  The paper observes that some  groups are not only inviting participation by members of the public,  but are also actively seeking to "conceptualize" the formation of  new political parties. [See Annex I for membership listings and  other information concerning the major cross-party study groups.  Annex II contains information on the LDP study groups and Annex III  reports on the Socialist Party study groups.]      The 1 January 1994 TOKYO SHIMBUN also reports that the study  groups are actively contemplating the formation of new political  movements.  It asserts that "each group" is striving to form a "new-  new party," coalescing around three groupings: 1) a party comprising  Sakigake, the Japan New Party (JNP), and "about 30" reform-minded  LDP members;  2) a party led by Shinseito and Komeito, which would  follow the line reportedly subscribed to by Shinseito coleader  Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary-General Yuichi Ichikawa, viz.,  that political realignment should center on two major parties;  and  3) a "Yokomichi Party," led by Hokkaido Governor Takahiro Yokomichi,  that will be the political vehicle of "liberal" SDPJ members, and  which will be supported by members of the "Democrats," a recently  established SDPJ policy study group which includes rightist and  centrist groups within the party.      Makeup of Study Groups      One ostensibly influential cross-party group, established  initially by Prime Minister Morihito Hosokawa and others in 1992 to  promote political reform, is the "System Reform Study Group,"  comprising LDP, SDPJ, Shinseito, Komeito, Japan New Party (JNP), DSP  and Sakigake members.  It is reportedly led by Hosokawa, Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, Izumo Mayor Tetsundo Iwakuni,  and other Sakigake members, particularly Shusei Tanaka and Yukio  Hatoyama.  Tanaka and Hatoyama left the LDP in June 1993, joined  Sakigake, and subsequently became "driving forces" behind the birth  of the Hosokawa administration, according to the 3 October 1993  NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN.      This group also reportedly supports the setting up of an  independent organization resembling an omsbudsman's staff in the  Diet to monitor political reform.  On 25 January 1994, group  chairman Naoto Kan put together an outline of a bill, specifying  that this new organization, "Gyosei Kanshi Chosakai," or  "Administrative Supervisory Committee," will include five committee  members approved by the speakers of both upper and lower houses,  according to 26 January 1994 YOMIURI SHIMBUN.  In addition to the  five committee members, the bill also reportedly calls for a staff  of 70.      Another influential grouping, the "Long-Term Basic Problems Study  Group," was formed in December 1993 by SDPJ and JNP Diet members.  Its leader is Hirotaka Akamatsu, former secretary general of the  SDPJ.  The group was formed to coordinate policies among members of  different political parties with an eye toward a possible tie-up in  the second phase of political restructuring, according to the 23  December 1993 YOMIURI SHIMBUN.  This group reportedly discusses  problems related to the decentralization of power, deregulation,  problems of an aging society, U.N. policy and Japan's international  contributions, as well as the nuts and bolts functioning of a new  political party and its leadership.      Another cross-party group that reportedly includes LDP members is  the "Forum on Comparative Study of Political Systems."  This group  is comprised of 21 "younger pro-reform Dietmen" from the LDP, SDPJ,  Komeito, and DSP, according to the 20 February 1993 ASAHI SHIMBUN.  The group reportedly discusses issues such as the functioning of  different political systems, the Japan-U.S. security treaty, and  Japan's "vision" of the future, SANKEI notes.  In order to deal with  the multiplicity of views in Japan, this group reportedly supports a  "multiparty system" rather than a "two-party system," according to  ASAHI.      One large and expanding cross-party study group, the "General  Economic Policy Study Group" promoted by Toshio Yamaguchi, an  independent member of the House of Representatives, has reportedly  "created quite a stir."  When this group was inaugurated in October  1993, it was rumored that Yamaguchi's intention was to unite Michio  Watanabe, leader of the LDP's Watanabe faction, and Ichiro Ozawa to  form a "new party."  But because of opposition within the Watanabe  faction to Watanabe's personal involvement in the new group,  Watanabe refrained from joining the group as chairman.  However,  according to the 3 February NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, it now appears  that Watanabe will participate in the group's activities and will  give lectures on issues such as economic stimulus measures, the FY95  budget, and Japan-U.S. economic problems.  NIKKEI concludes that  such a move by Watanabee could once again stir up speculation  concerning a "Watanabe-Ozawa tieup."      Yet another study group, the "New-WIC Dietmen's Forum," was  established in January, according to the 20 January CHUNICHI  SHIMBUN.  Headed by the LDP's Masayasu Kitagawa, it includes 30  younger Diet members from the LDP, SDPJ, JNP, DSP and Sakigake.  The  group reportedly aims to make recommendations on improving social  welfare and Japan's information and communications networks,  according to the paper.  The paper also observed that this forum has  excluded  Shinseito, Komeito, and the Communist Party from its  ranks.      LDP-Oriented Groups      There are reportedly a number of LDP-oriented study groups in  existence, including "Forum To Promote Pump-Priming Measures and  Political Reform," "Forum To Renew the LDP," "Parliamentary Alliance  To Promote Political Reform," and "Democratic Politics Study Group."  According to a 24 February Kyodo report, 20 legislators mainly from  the  LDP attended a meeting on the same day to prepare for launching  yet another policy study group called "Liberals" in early March.  Organizers of this group reportedly hope to secure the participation  of more Diet members, local assembly members, academics and business  executives.  The group will reportedly be chaired by Diet member  Koji Kakizawa, and will include Seiichi Ota and Shokei Arai.      Hokkaido Governor Yokomichi's Prospective Role      The idea of a "Yokomichi Party" corresponds to Rengo (Japanese  Trade Union Confederation) Chairman Akira Yamagishi's concept of a  "New Liberal Party," TOKYO SHIMBUN notes.  The prospective leader of  this party, Hokkaido governor Takahiro Yokomichi, is regarded by  members of the SDPJ rightist-centrist "Democrats" study group to be  the "last trump card" left in the hand of the SDPJ, the paper adds.  Yokomichi, now in his third term as governor of Hokkaido, left the  House of Representatives in 1983 to run for the Governorship,  stating that he would return to national politics "in 12 or 13  years."  In March 1993, "as expected," he made public his intention  not to seek a fourth term as governor, thus indicating his interest  in returning to the national political scene.   Annex I.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The administration of the Maritime Territory (the  Far East) is to review the location of arms depots, Vice  Governor Valentin Dubinin told Interfax on Thursday.    This decision was taken after an explosion on the arms depot  in Novonezhino, not far from Vladivostok, on May 14, which  inflicted serious damage on the neighboring villages.    Dubinin also stated that the Novonezhino depot would be  eliminated and that he opposed he idea of turning the Maritime  Territory into an "arms graveyard" (a large part of the  ammunition stored in Novonezhino was produced in the 1940s).    Commenting on the dismissal of Pacific Fleet Commander  Georgiy Gurinov following the explosion, Dubinin said that this  move would hardly influence discipline on the Pacific Fleet.  "The government must pay servicemen on time and as much as they  need. How can one talk about discipline when servicemen do not  receive their salaries for months?" he said.</p>

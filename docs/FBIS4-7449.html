			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 31 March reports  fighting in the following parts of the country:    The correspondent from Gorazde, Enes Musovic, reports that  "the chetniks have been pounding all lines of defense of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army fighters with artillery of the largest  calibers the entire night." As he continues to say, "the  situation is extremely fierce on all lines of Gorazde's defense  on the right bank of the Drina River" while "on the left bank of  the Drina River the chetniks are attacking from Ustipraca and  Mesici at Kopaci and Trovrh." "From 1900 last night to 0800 this  morning one person died and eight sustained serious injuries.  Yesterday and the day before, 15 people were killed and 40  injured."    "The activities of the Serbian aggressor against the Bihac  district have continued overnight and this morning,"  correspondent Mirza Sadikovic says. "Yesterday, in the early  evening, Karadzic's terrorists attacked the center of Bihac  [words indistinct] as well as the hospital. New material damage  was caused and, according to incomplete reports, there are  injured civilians. In the course of the night, the intensity of  shelling subsided a little because of low flights by NATO  aircraft." "In other areas," Sadikovic goes on, "antiaircraft  arms' fire and sniper fire were observed in the course of the  night and since early morning." "On the separating lines with  the paramilitary formations of the so-called Kladusa  autonomists, there have been provocative attacks with mortars  and hill guns at various intervals, launched from the area of  Krivaja and [word indistinct] in the Kladusa commune."</p>

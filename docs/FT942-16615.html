			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Wall Street prices weaken on US monetary policy tensions The fragile peace prevailing on Wall Street since midweek was pushed to breaking point yesterday afternoon as underlying tensions over the direction of US monetary policy resurfaced in the financial markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 19 points down at 3,674.26 after falling sharply earlier in the day in the wake of a decline in bond prices. The Dow finished 38 points up on the week. The erosion in bond prices appeared to come in response to comments by two Federal Reserve officials. In separate statements, they said constraints in the labour market and in production capacity were developing in the economy and could lead to higher inflation. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond closed at 7.25 per cent, against 7.21 on Thursday, after touching 7.30 per cent during the session. Recent gains had enabled the Dow to recapture about half its recent fall of about 200 points. Its 82-point jump on Tuesday and a sharp upturn in bond prices came amid relief that a sell-off after the Easter holiday was less severe than expected. Many observers had feared a free-fall in domestic and overseas markets as soon as investors had the opportunity to react to a spurt in US employment figures announced on Good Friday when most exchanges were shut. Elsewhere, Milan was the most lively continental European bourse this week, as heavy buying by domestic funds took prices up by another 2.9 per cent on top of the previous week's near 10 per cent surge. Investors ignored the right wing's war of words and pinned their hopes on a more free market economy. In London, the FT-SE 100 index fell 8.2 to close at 3,120.8.

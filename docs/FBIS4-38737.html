			<p>BFN     [Text] The State Duma leaders have refused to increase  budget spending on defense by 18 trillion rubles (from 37  trillion to 55 trillion rubles - Interfax), Vice Premier  Alexander Shokhin told Interfax.    He told the Federation Council on Wednesday that during a  conference on May 31, attended by Cabinet members, the State  Duma leaders turned down a corresponding proposal by the State  Duma's Committee for Economic Policies, chaired by Sergey  Glazyev.    To quote Shokhin, preference was given to the variant  presented by the State Duma's Budget Committee, chaired by  Mikhail Zadornov, which proposed that the federal budget be kept  within the limits already approved: revenues amounting to 124  trillion rubles and spending - 194 trillion rubles.    Shokhin noted, however, that the State Duma leaders had  taken  the decision to channel all of the additional revenues gained  from the privatization of federal property to the defense  industry. "I think such a decision creates favorable conditions  for the approval of the budget at the second reading," said  Shokhin.</p>

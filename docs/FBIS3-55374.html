			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Leaders of six opposition parties signed a joint  statement on the state of emergency law which is currently under  discussion by the Lithuanian Seimas, ELTA reported.    The statement reads that some articles which have already  been adopted by the vote of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor  party faction are a challenge to the constitutional state system  of the Republic of Lithuania. With the help of the law on state  of emergency the Lithuanian Democratic Labor party creates  conditions for itself to be able to suspend the functioning of  essential clauses of the constitution on the decision of the  party's faction alone on the pretext that it poses a threat to  the public order, thus to violate basic human rights and  freedoms, to introduce the dictatorship of their party by means  of allegedly legal actions of coercion.    We stress, the statement goes on, that the right of the  nation and of every citizen to oppose anyone who encroaches on  the constitutional state system is inalienable.    The statement was signed by the leaders of the Lithuanian  Democrats party, the Lithuanian Christian Democrats Party, the  Independence Party, the Lithuanian Liberal Party, the Lithuanian  Nationalist Union and the Lithuanian Conservative Party.</p>

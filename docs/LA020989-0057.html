			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Broadway's Mark Hellinger Theater, long considered one of the best theaters for  musicals ("My Fair Lady," "On A Clear Day You Can See Forever" and "Jesus  Christ Superstar" are some that have played there), has been leased by the  Nederlander organization to the nondenominational Times Square Church. The deal  is for five years at $1 million a year. James M. Nederlander said it's a  question of product. "There are no shows. We have to keep the theaters filled.  We've got the Gershwin (Theater) with nothing in it. We don't have anything on  the horizon to put in the theater. If I had a show, the show would have gone  in. In show business, you have to take the first booking," he told the New York  Times. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

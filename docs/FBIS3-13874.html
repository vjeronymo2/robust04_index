The Khalil al-Rahman Society and some Palestinian camps near  Amman recently staged mammoth popular demonstrations, during  which the demonstrators chanted against the old man ['Arafat]  and demanded him to cancel the Oslo and Cairo agreements. The  Jordanian newspapers, both independent and party papers, also  launched a campaign in which they called for the cancellation of  agreements with Israel.    Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] said during the Palestinian  leadership's meeting in Tunis that this campaign is directed  against him personally, as well as the PLO leadership. He  blamed the Jordanian Government for not quelling the  demonstrators or preventing columnists from writing against him.    AL-MUHARRIR has learned that 'Arafat's anger was about to  express itself in practice when he proposed transferring 15  Palestinian leaders from Jordan to Tunisia. However, leading  Palestinian politicians rejected this proposal and considered it  an attempt to strain relations with Jordan for no convincing  reason. The proposal was thus frozen pending discussion in  future meetings.</p>

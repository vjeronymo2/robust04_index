			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Fisons sells horticulture business Fisons yesterday effectively completed its troubled odyssey from horticultural company to pharmaceuticals and scientific group. The company has sold its UK horticultural business for Pounds 25.3m in one of the largest management buy-outs so far this year. The operations had sales last year of Pounds 47m and operating profits of Pounds 3.8m. The business was acquired by a consortium led by Prudential Venture Managers, which provided Pounds 50m financing to senior management. The new company, to be called Levington Horticulture will supply garden fertilisers, composts and chemicals to the retail and professional markets. It has the right to market horticultural products under the Fisons name for seven years. The deal virtually completes Fisons' disposal programme announced by management in April 1992. Fisons said it was negotiating with buyers for its last remaining horticultural businesses in France and Benelux. These generated operating profits last year of about Pounds 400,000 on sales of Pounds 20.3m.</p>

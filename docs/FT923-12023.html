			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Dofasco chief quits over strategic planning DOFASCO, Canada's biggest steelmaker, has parted company with its chairman and chief executive amid mounting public criticism of his management style and his role in Dofasco's ill-fated acquisition of Algoma Steel five years ago. Dofasco said yesterday that Mr Bill Wallace resigned as a result of 'differences over how to best implement the company's new strategic plan.' A spokesman declined to elaborate, but insisted that the plan, which includes an emphasis on flat-rolled products and the study of mini-mill opportunities, will remain intact. Mr Wallace had worked for Dofasco for 36 years, but took over as chairman only two months ago. Tensions over his position were clear at the company's most recent annual meeting where a group of dissident shareholders challenged his nomination to the board of directors. Ms Margaret Cornish-Kehoe, analyst at ScotiaMcLeod in Toronto, claimed yesterday that Mr Wallace 'didn't have people skills and was very closely associated with Algoma'. Mr Wallace's departure appears to reflect intense soul-searching over the future of Dofasco, considered one of North America's premier steel producers until its costly purchase of Algoma in 1987. Three years later. Dofasco wrote off its entire CDollars 713m (USDollars 594m) investment in the troubled Ontario-based company, which itself is Canada's third biggest steel producer. Mr Wallace spearheaded the Algoma acquisition, but has always insisted that, in keeping with Dofasco's collegial management style, the decision to go ahead was a joint one. The financial burden of Algoma has been exacerbated by the recession. Dofasco suffered a CDollars 25m loss last year and a further loss of CDollars 17.8m in this year's first quarter. Mr Wallace's place as chairman will be temporarily taken by Mr Jack Leitch.</p>

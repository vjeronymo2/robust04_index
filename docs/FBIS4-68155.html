			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Lima, 13 May (EFE) -- The bomb attacks  perpetrated in Lima last night have made people fear a new  outbreak of terrorist actions in the next few days, to mark the  14th anniversary of the beginning of Shining Path's [SL]  subversive activities.    The Maoist group perpetrated its first attack on 17 May  1980,  and since then more than 30,000 people have died as a result of  political violence.    Several explosions last night shook the offices of local  banks in the districts of Surquillo, San Martin de Porres, San  Juan de Lurigancho, and Brena and in the industrial zone in  Lima, wounding at least four people and causing material damage.    These attacks follow similar ones that occurred between 4  and  5 May in Villa Militar, in the coastal Lima district of  Chorillos, at bank branches and at an office of the public  enterprise Electro Lima.    Since then security forces have stepped up patrolling in  Lima  and in the port of Callao, as a preventive measure in case a  wave of terrorism takes place on the SL anniversary.    The National Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote) has  expressed fear that the Maoist group could unleash a wave of  attacks and crimes in Lima, ordered by its current leader Oscar  Ramirez Durand, aka "Feliciano." [passage omitted]    The SL celebrates its 14th anniversary in the midst of  internal divisions, and weakened by the harassment of the Armed  Forces, which since 5 April have been conducting a new offensive  against the subversive columns in the jungle area of Huanuco  Department.    The SL's attacks are no longer as fierce as they were before  the arrest of its main leader [Abimael Guzman] on 12 September  1992.    Political violence has caused 30,215 deaths in Peru since  1980, of which 14,239 are alleged terrorists, 12,932 civilians,  and 2,737 member of the security forces, as well as 307 drug  traffickers.

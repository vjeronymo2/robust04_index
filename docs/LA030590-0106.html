			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> BUDGET WOES LOOM, CITY MANAGER SAYS  </P> <P> A budget crunch could hit in the new fiscal year, the city manager has told the  City Council.  </P> <P> City Manager George Tindall said tax revenues are below projections for the  first half of 1989-90 and a much bigger gap between income and expenses could  develop for 1990-91.  </P> <P> "About 40% of our budget is based on the economy," principally sales taxes,  Tindall said. Those were about $500,000 below projections because of a slowdown  in retail sales, he said. "On the other hand, our expenses were down  substantially because of a number of vacancies on our staff at this time.  </P> <P> The "problem, though, is that we have a trend," he said. If tax revenues don't  increase, "we'll have to make them (the vacancies) permanent. And that's  alarming."  </P> <P> More ominous for the new fiscal year is an estimated $1.5 million in new costs  and funding decreases from various federal and state agencies, Tindall said.  </P> <P> The 1990-91 budget will be brought to the council in May or June, Tindall said.

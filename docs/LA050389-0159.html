			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> The Associated Press reported erroneously Monday that Glenn Golenberg, owner of  Golenberg &amp; Co. of Cleveland, was among eight people who agreed to  surrender illicit profits for alleged insider trading in Revco stock. Golenberg  agreed to pay a $470,000 penalty, but the federal government found no evidence  that he profited from information he gained as Revco's investment adviser.  </P></p>

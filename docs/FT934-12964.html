			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Permanent interest-bearing shares THOSE WHO bought permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs) when they were first issued have had some healthy profits. As the table shows, all Pibs are trading above their issue prices; in the case of Leeds Permanent, the rise has been 50 per cent. Pibs are fixed interest securities, issued by building societies, which pay income twice a year. They offer a higher yield than gilts because of the greater risks; and Simon Mozley of Hoare Govett, which supplies the table, notes that the spread over gilts has widened during the past month. A major risk is that, if a society collapses, those holding Pibs will be last to be paid back. Furthermore, in normal circumstances, Pibs will never be repaid and there is no guarantee that investors will get back what they paid for an issue. On balance, the higher the Pibs' yield, the riskier the society is deemed to be by the market. Investors also should note that issues from some of the best known societies, such as the Halifax, come in Pounds 50,000 denominations.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Europe may get 180 TV channels: Astra satellites using digital signals could be in place within two years A 180-channel satellite television system could be available over Europe by 1995 using the latest digital technology. Societe Europeenne des Satellites, Luxembourg-based company that operates the Astra satellite system, has decided to launch two satellites with digital television capacity. This gives much improved picture quality and enables a far greater number of signals to be transmitted. Work has already begun on the satellites which could offer unprecedented choice to European viewers. Mr Celso Azevedo, technical director of SES said, at the Financial Times Cable and Satellite conference in London yesterday, that the larger number of channels would be achieved by compressing the digital signal. Astra already operates two 16-channel satellites carrying everything from Sky Television to Cable News Network and Eurosport. A third satellite is now being completed and due to be launched this spring. The fourth and fifth Astra satellites - one due to be launched next year and the other in 1995 - will have the digital capacity. The SES executive said there were also proposals not yet confirmed for a sixth Astra satellite and the company might launch more satellites taking the total number of channels to 360. Apart from a modest expansion in the number of conventional television channels that could be made available the main business opportunity in such a large number of channels lies in charging for individual films. As many as 50 or 60 channels can be devoted, for example, to showing the top 10 films. The transmission times of films would be staggered so that the viewer would be no more than 20 minutes from a start of any film. Digital television could also offer wide screen television pictures. In the US Hughes Communications, part of the Hughes Aircraft Company, is planning to launch a 150-channel system next year using digital compression technology. SES insisted yesterday that it was a myth that the arrival of digital television was 10 years off and the next 24 months would be the testing time. Talks had already begun with microchip manufacturers and SES believes the special decoders needed to receive the digital pictures could be available by 1994. SES emphasised yesterday that if digital television was going to be a success there would have to be agreement on a single transmission standard. It was also vital for there to be a common encryption system. The encryption, or scrambling system, is an essential part of subscription television. It makes the picture unwatchable for those who have not paid. The picture is 'unlocked' by a smart card which looks like a credit card. Mr Pierre Meyrat, the SES director general promised yesterday that it was still not too late to develop an economically and technically efficient path to digital television in Europe and a wide-screen television format, in order to give the consumer a lot more choice.

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Personal View: Trade winds that bode only good - Mexico's President Carlos Salinas, vying to lead the World Trade Organisation, outlines its tasks It was with a sense of relief and achievement that ministers and trade officials from around the world signed the agreements of the Uruguay Round in Marrakech five months ago. Seven years of difficult and often tense negotiations were rewarded by a global commitment to protect and continue nearly 50 years of successful multilateral trade policy. The stakes were, and remain, huge. Trade has been the most powerful engine of economic growth since the second world war, driving a global increase in output and incomes. The resulting unprecedented prosperity - although it still eludes many in developing countries - has been crucial to maintaining the longest period of peace known to much of the world. Trade is a central force in boosting economic activity, employment and welfare. It is the cornerstone in the increasingly complex economic interactions among the industrial countries and between these countries and others. The states of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union have shown courage in entering upon economic transition. To support their commitment to market principles, these countries need secure and expanding outlets for their products. They also need foreign investment which will only materialise if - and to the extent that - export opportunities are available. In Latin America, Africa and parts of Asia and the Pacific, countries which have bravely worked to open their economies know that further progress, and their potential as thriving markets, depends on further development of an open, rules-based trading system. The poorest states, the sub-Saharan countries, also urgently need opportunities to expand trade. Development in this region is a priority for the world community. All countries need the open, rules-based trading system that the Gatt has represented in its half-century of existence. Failing to complete the Uruguay Round would not merely have meant failure to move ahead on certain trade issues; it would have shattered confidence in the entire system. With the successful conclusion of the Uruguay talks, two important tasks lie ahead. First, the participants who invested so much effort in reaching agreement must ensure the accord becomes reality by ratifying it before the end of the year. Otherwise, the Uruguay agreement risks becoming little more than an historical footnote. The process of ratification must be treated with the same determination as the negotiations. To date, most participants - nearly 100 - have not completed the internal processes necessary for ratification. Although the deadline is three months away, it is disturbing that the pace appears slow in a number of capitals. Efforts to solve any outstanding problems they are experiencing should be intensified. Second, Uruguay round signatories should start looking carefully at the needs of the new system to ensure the World Trade Organisation (WTO) functions effectively from the outset. Past experience has shown that the effectiveness of the international trading system cannot be taken for granted. In this respect, the WTO must meet three basic conditions: it must be representative, reliable and responsive. First, membership of the new organisation must be representative of world trade. Creating Gatt in 1948 with only 23 participants was appropriate, given the relatively restricted trade flows of that time. But today, the guiding principle should be universality - long the ideal of Gatt in which 123 countries, in all regions and at all stages of development, now participate. More than 20 countries, including Russia and the Ukraine, are currently seeking admission into the multilateral trading system. Their producers, traders and trading partners need the clarity, predictability and protection that Gatt provides. We must all co-operate to ensure these countries are admitted promptly and satisfactorily. Second, a solid and successful World Trade Organisation must be a reliable instrument and forum. In recent years, serious trade tensions have threatened to erode the reliability - and thus the credibility - of Gatt. Major improvements in the clarity of Gatt rules, the broadening of its mandate and reform of its dispute settlement procedures will increase the reliability of the multilateral trading system and help create a firm foundation for the WTO. National governments may sometimes see advantages in not meeting their international obligations, and be tempted to act accordingly. This temptation can be overcome only if countries are committed to the system and realise that they share an interest in maintaining a rules-based regime. Third, the trading system must be responsive to the evolving needs and challenges that the international economy will always pose if it is to retain political support. This is nothing new: it is precisely through its adaptability that Gatt has demonstrated its resilience. I refer to the important reinforcement of its rules (on issues such as control of subsidies) through the Tokyo Round codes; to the special provisions for developing countries introduced in the 1960s and 1970s; and to agreements reached in the area of agriculture and textiles which became make-or-break issues in the integrated world economy of the 1980s and 1990s, but which did not seem remotely possible only a few years earlier. Looking ahead, it is impossible to predict future challenges to world trade, but some issues are clear. Certainly, the relationship between the environment and trade is a priority. Governments, individually and collectively, must work to increase environmental protection without jeopardising the open and rules-based character of the future World Trade Organisation. Moreover, the increased exposure of our economies to the full force of international trade winds requires the gradual formulation of rules and co-operative arrangements between nations on regulation and competition. Solutions in these and other politically delicate areas will depend on technical expertise and political engagement. Consensus-building will be a key element in this process. The relationships between members of the new World Trade Organisation will become increasingly complex, as new countries join and existing members develop into full participants. It is, therefore, imperative that the WTO itself be effective, both technically and in its relations with members. It should dedicate itself not to offering solutions - for this is up to member governments - but to identifying options, to supporting bridge-building efforts, and in this way facilitating consensus. For this we depend on the highly qualified and dedicated Gatt staff, and on the legacy that Peter Sutherland will leave behind. Only three months remain before the birth of the World Trade Organisation. Ratification of the Uruguay Round is a complex and delicate political process that will demand skill and commitment from all participants. Yet ratification - and I call for ratification now - is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the success of the new organisation. All countries must devote the highest possible level of engagement and support to ensuring the World Trade Organisation functions effectively and successfully from the outset. Speaking for my country, Mexico, we are ready to contribute all our efforts to the successful launch of the next 50 years of the international trading system.</p>

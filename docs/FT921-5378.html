			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Talks fail to end TV listings row NEGOTIATIONS involving a number of secret offers between the BBC and newspaper and magazine groups to try to reach agreement on payments for television listings information have failed. The issue will now be settled by the Copyright Tribunal, which is finalising its decision on copyright fees for programme listings. It is due to make an announcement later this month after holding a hearing from November 12 to December 20 last year. A number of publishing organisations had complained that the broadcasters' fees were too high. The organisations were the Newspaper Publishers Association (NPA), representing national newspapers; the Newspaper Society, representing regional newspapers; Time Out, the London listings magazine; Hello, the celebrity magazine; and the Surrey Advertiser group. While the tribunal has been deliberating on its verdict BBC Enterprises, the BBC's commercial arm, has made a number of 'without prejudice' offers to publishers. These were rejected, even though they envisaged lower payments than the corporation had initially sought. The NPA offered both the BBC and ITV a deal that would involve a single annual payment enabling national newspapers to carry seven-day listings of television programmes. This in turn was rejected by the broadcasters. The wrangle follows the government's decision to end the duopoly enjoyed by Radio Times and TV Times magazines in the television listings market, and to give all publishers access to all programming listings in return for a copyright fee. Since the new regime began in March last year, most publishers have been paying the BBC and Independent Television Publishers, holder of ITV programmes copyright, only a token sum of Pounds 250 a year. Once the Copyright Tribunal has ruled, the actual fees will be backdated to March last year. After the government's decision the BBC initially proposed 10 different band rates for weekly and daily papers. These ran from Pounds 600 a year for a weekly with a circulation of 11,000, to Pounds 210,000 for a national daily with sales of more than 1.7m. While the Copyright Tribunal had been considering its decision some national newspapers have launched seven-day television listings supplements. This, the BBC has argued, proves how valuable television-listings copyright is.</p>

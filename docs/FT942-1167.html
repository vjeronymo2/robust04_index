			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Vistec picks up in second half After a patchy first half, Vistec Group, the USM-quoted computer systems and software concern, made some headway to end the year to April 30 with pre-tax profits ahead by 4 per cent to Pounds 3.41m, compared with Pounds 3.28m adjusted for FRS 3. Turnover rose 16 per cent to Pounds 45m while earnings per share under FRS 3 came through at 2.06p (1.88p). An increased final dividend of 0.275p is recommended for a total of 0.4p (0.375p). Vistec said second half growth was accelerated by the acquisition of ISO Communications last November and Data Logic Communication Services in February 1994. These purchases had broadened the group's range of network service products and expanded its client base.</p>

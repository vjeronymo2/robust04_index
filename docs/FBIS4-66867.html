			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Sitnikov] </F>   [Text] United Nations April 26 TASS -- President Boris  Yeltsin reaffirmed Russia's adherence to continue the moratorium  on nuclear tests, General Secretary of the Geneva Disarmament  Conference Vladimir Petrovskiy said at a press conference held  at the UN Headquarters today.    ``During talks with the UN secretary-general at the  beginning  of April, President Boris Yeltsin had expressed Russia's  adherence to continue the moratorium on nuclear tests which was  initially declared by ex-Soviet president Gorbachev,''  Petrovskiy said.    Petrovskiy noted that similar steps taken by other nuclear  states would considerably help the multilateral talks on  concluding a universal nuclear test ban treaty, now underway in  Geneva. He called ``realistic'' the conclusion of such a treaty  by the end of 1996. He said that a draft treaty will be  presented for consideration in June this year.    In this context, he said that participants in the  disarmament  conference welcome the decision adopted by the United States in  March to extend the moratorium on nuclear tests until September,  1995 as an ``important contribution to the creation of a  favourable climate for talks.'' ``It is important to acknowledge  that for the first time not only the U.S., Russia and Great  Britain, but France and China are also now taking part in the  talks, which directly affect their nuclear interests,''  Petrovskiy noted.</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: European trading volumes European trading volumes declined in October in spite of a 1.2 per cent improvement in the FT-Actuaries Europe index. The fall was a continuation of the trend seen in September, writes Michael Morgan. And, says Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities, international investors were apparently becoming as blase as their domestic counterparts, as witnessed by a 3.7 per cent drop in shares traded on Seaq International in London, after a 1.9 per cent rise in September. There were, however, exceptions to the theme. In the Netherlands, domestic volumes climbed by 32.3 per cent in October, accompanied by a 2.8 per cent rise in the index. The volumes increase, says Mr Cornish, can partly be explained by the reorganisation of the domestic stock exchange at the end of September and, he notes, Dutch volumes on Seaq fell by 12.5 per cent during October. Swiss volumes were also winners, expanding by 19.9 per cent on strong international interest, signalled by a 28.4 per cent rise in Swiss shares traded on Seaq. At the other end of the scale, UK volumes contracted by 10.3 per cent to the lowest level since June last year, in spite of a 2.6 per cent share price index gain. 'The institutions seem to have been sitting on their substantial store of cash, rather than putting it into the domestic market,' comments Mr Cornish.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                      EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER                Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  --------------------------------------------------------------------                       July      Aug      Sept      Oct        US Bourse                1994     1994      1994     1994    Dollars bn  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium              43.50    56.27      62.29    69.68       2.25 France              145.26   146.71     169.87   154.46      29.93 Germany             127.41   152.68     134.81   132.26      87.76 Italy               49,940   46,276     52,060   47,972      31.12 Netherlands          18.40    23.90      19.50    25.80      15.27 Spain             1,282.19   903.85   1,011.44   978.61       7.81 Switzerland          18.58    18.80      19.60    23.50      18.70 UK                   45.16    52.78      48.98    43.91      71.60  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Italian data adjusted to include off-market trading.

The old barrier gate will be protected as cultural relics  and  a tourism spot from now on.    After the frontier post was put into operation, passengers  come and leave Macao will have to go through the entry and exit  passages of the post. All entry and exit procedures will remain  unchanged.    Costing more than 30 million Macao patacas (about 3.8  million  U.S. dollars), construction of the frontier post started in 1990  and it was first put into initial use in February 1993.    During last year's February-November period, there were more  than 15.37 million passengers going through the post and there  were also 1.06 million freight cars passing the post in the same  period.    The barrier gate is the only passage in Macao leading to  China's mainland on land. It is connected with Gongbei of  Zhuhai city, south China's Guangdong Province.    Macao Governor General Vasco Joaquim Rocha Vieira, Guo  Dongpo, director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Macao branch, and  many noted personages in Macao participated in today's ceremony  for the inauguration of the frontier post.</p>

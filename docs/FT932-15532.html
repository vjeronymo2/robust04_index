			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Closer UK/US links The UK government has launched a programme to help medium-sized British companies establish alliances with similar US companies. The three-year pilot programme is intended to help companies, which are already exporting to the US, establish closer links by means of joint product development, franchising, collaborative marketing and licensing agreements. The Strategic Alliance Service forms part of a broader Department of Trade and Industry programme, called North America Now, which was launched last month. The service* will be managed by accountants Price Waterhouse. The new initiative is aimed at companies with turnover of between Pounds 5m and Pounds 50m and employing between 50 and 500 people. Both independent companies and subsidiaries of larger groups are eligible. The DTI estimates that up to 1,500 UK companies will meet its criteria, although it expects to sign up only 50 for the programme each year. Of these it expects between 10 and 15 will find partners. These targets are modest, the DTI acknowledges, but if successful the programme could be extended to other markets. Partnerships represent a less risky way into the US market than acquisitions or setting up from scratch and tie up less capital. The economic climate and the dollar/sterling exchange rates are also favourable, the DTI says. The DTI will spend Pounds 185,000 a year on the programme while the cost to companies which pass through all stages of the scheme and find a partner will be Pounds 14,000 plus travel and other expenses. Profiles of UK companies which meet the programme's criteria and which can show they are committed to establishing US links will be matched with US counterparts through Price Waterhouse's network of US offices. UK companies will be provided with a shortlist of possible US partners and meetings will be arranged. From then on it is up to the two companies to negotiate a deal, the DTI says. *Contact Price Waterhouse, Milton Gate, 1 Moor Lane, London EC2Y 9PB. Tel. 071 939 3000.</p>

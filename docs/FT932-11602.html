			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Patten to plead China's case for trade with US MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, left yesterday for a one-week trip to the US, where he will meet President Bill Clinton and press for unconditional renewal of China's most favoured nation status, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong. Mr Patten will also meet senior administration officials and congressional leaders and brief them on his proposals for Hong Kong constitutional development. The governor will tell US leaders that withdrawal of MFN status could cost Hong Kong 70,000 jobs and lop up to three percentage points off the colony's growth rate.</p>

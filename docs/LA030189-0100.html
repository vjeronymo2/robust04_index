			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ORNSTEIN ANNOUNCES RESIGNATION  </P> <P> Mike Ornstein, a member of the Raiders' front office since the team moved south  from Oakland in 1982, said Tuesday he has resigned his position with the team.  </P> <P> Ornstein, 35, was a senior administrator with the Raiders, primarily involved  in public relations, marketing and promotions.  </P> <P> He had previously served as an administrative assistant to Raider Coach John  Madden in 1976-77 and spent five years in private business before returning to  the team.  </P> <P> "I've just been here a long time," Ornstein said. "It's time to move on to  something else. I've loved my association with the Raiders. It's been  absolutely fantastic. I've been involved with what I believe is the finest  organization in sports.  </P> <P> "But as far as moving ahead in my career and reaching my ambition of someday  becoming a general manager, I felt it was time to move on and explore other  opportunities, hopefully in sports."  </P> <P> Ornstein became a celebrity of sorts when he pushed commentator Irv Cross and  told him to move off the Raider sidelines while Cross was on live television  before the Super Bowl at Tampa, Fla., Jan. 22, 1984.  </P> <P> The Raiders beat the Washington Redskins, 38-9, in that game.  </P></p>

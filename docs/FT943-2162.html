			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / French minister in villa row France's trade and industry minister, Mr Gerard Longuet, yesterday denied a magistrate's report that he had effectively allowed a contractor from his home region of Lorraine to pay for much of the building of his Riviera villa, and that what he had paid came from other corporate sources. The minister claimed the leaking of judge Mr Renaud Van Ruymbeke's report to the Justice Ministry was a malicious attack on him, and dismissed any idea of resigning. Mr Van Ruymbeke has put the head of St Gobain, Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, under formal investigation in an attempt to track down what happened to a FFr4.4m (Pounds 520,000) commission paid by a St Gobain subsidiary to win a water pipe contract in Nantes. In seeking to verify claims that the missing money ended up with Mr Longuet, the judge has unearthed other information about Mr Longuet's St Tropez villa, his Lorraine-based contractor, and his Paris consulting company, which he believes warrants investigation. Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, the justice minister, now has the delicate task of deciding whether to call in another magistrate to investigate his cabinet colleague.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Vietnam Communist party sees writing on the wall: Observers believe the country will have to abandon Marxism-Leninism in a few years THE STATUE of Lenin still stands tall in central Hanoi. A few blocks away you can go jogging around the lake in what is still called Lenin Park, or sit on a bench and read stories in the Vietnamese Communist Party newspaper about fraternal visits by fellow-communists from neighbouring Laos. Political scientists have noted with surprise how third world communist regimes, such as the one in Vietnam, have survived the collapse of their erstwhile patrons in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. Beneath the surface, however, Vietnamese politics is undergoing a change so profound that Vietnamese and foreign observers believe the ruling party will be obliged to abandon Marxism-Leninism, transform itself into a broad-based 'nationalist' front, and perhaps even permit opposition parties - all within a few years. Party leaders, under Mr Do Muoi, their 76-year-old general secretary, nowadays barely mention communism or socialism in their speeches. The 2m-strong party, undermined by the collapse of international communism, finds it hard to recruit new members or to persuade existing members to attend meetings. Since the late 1980s, Vietnam has in any case vigorously pursued a policy of doi moi or 'renovation', a code word for replacing socialist economics with capitalism, foreign investment and the tenets of the free market. "When the Communist Party declared its acceptance of the free market economy, it meant that this party is not truly a communist party; they have dropped the communist system,' says Mr Phan Dinh Dieu, a mathematician in Hanoi whose views are tolerated by the party and who is regarded by foreign diplomats as a sort of licensed dissident. 'The result is that the party is transformed from a communist party into a party of power.' Although it is widely accepted that few Vietnamese, even party members, still believe in communist ideology, the party has tried to smooth the way for traditionalists by suggesting lamely that sharp changes of direction can be explained by the addition of the thoughts of Ho Chi Minh (the communist father of Vietnamese independence in the 20th century) to the policy of standard Marxism. 'Our slogan is: 'Let the people become rich',' says Mr Tran Kien, deputy editor of the orthodox party newspaper Nhan Dan (The People). 'Now we carry out the market economy but regulated by socialism. It means we don't give up Marxism-Leninism but continue to carry out this ideology including Ho Chi Minh's teachings.' The crucial question for Vietnam is whether the ruling party can manage a peaceful transformation of the political system by steering a path between resentful communist hardliners and Vietnamese liberals - especially those living in the US - who demand the rapid creation of a multi-party democracy. Vietnam's economic performance is certainly helping the transition. Revised figures for gross national product show the economy grew by a 8.3 per cent last year, and the country's 70m inhabitants, although still desperately poor, are becoming visibly more prosperous. Vietnamese officials say that Russia and other eastern European states made grave errors by implementing democratisation before economic reform, a mistake which they believe led to anarchy and a consequent inability to pursue any economic reform at all: it is hard to find diplomats in Hanoi who disagree with that analysis. The flexibility of the Vietnamese Communist party, its genuine nationalist credentials (in contrast to some of the Moscow-installed parties of eastern Europe) and the absence of any organised opposition to the cautious liberalisation it is pursuing, also work in favour of peaceful political development. To counter the threat of opposition from Buddhist monks, the party is even said to have spread rumours that Mr Muoi is secretly a Buddhist himself and has been seen in a pagoda. 'They (the Communist party) know it's over, and they are even discussing among themselves the possibility of changing the name,' says one Ho Chi Minh City businessman who used to work for the US-backed South Vietnam government before the communist victory in 1975. 'They know and the people know it's over, but the idea of a collapse scares people. They are afraid of bloodshed and chaos, so even the most anti-communist people want slow change.' But the party's attempts to manage a peaceful transition to a post-communist system will probably not go unchallenged. Unemployment, estimated at about 3.5m in urban areas, and widespread corruption in national and local government are both breeding resentment. Already Vietnamese who must now pay school fees can be heard complaining that the good aspects of communism - free education, for example - are being thrown out with the bad. Party spokesmen are evasive when asked about the future, pointing to the fact that the 1992 constitution enshrines the party as 'the force leading the state and society', and falling back on the official policy of 'democratisation within the one-party system'. Others are more forthright about the imminent demise of the dictatorship of the single party. Mr Dieu, the free-talking mathematician, believes that the possibility of alternative political parties could arise in as little as two or three years. A diplomat in Hanoi says bluntly: 'In five years the (Communist) party will be nationalist or social democrat.' A member of the party, a retired senior civil servant, explains how the party allowed a discussion on political pluralism a year ago. 'Now it's finished; it was decided that it was not a good idea for Vietnam,' he says. 'But it's not forgotten.'</p>

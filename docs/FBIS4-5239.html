			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- The government moved Friday  [8 April] to minimize the possible damage to the economy of  planned hikes in utility and other public service charges by  adopting what it called a set of "basic policies" on the  proposed increases.    Key cabinet members agreed that the suggested hikes in  telephone, taxi, medicine and many other public service charges  should be permitted if they are "really inevitable" and only  after due consideration is paid to their possible impact on the  economy. The timing and scale of such hikes should be  determined so they will not hurt the economy, the ministers said.    They also agreed that the charges should be raised on  condition that services operators implement thorough  restructuring in the future, officials said.    The meeting brought together Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, and other related  government officials.    It came as public concern mounted over a string of proposed  hikes of charges for public services that some critics say will  erode the benefits of the government's planned tax cuts and  hamper the recovery of the economy.    Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), for instance,  has  applied for government permission to raise the basic rate it  charges telephone owners by an average 18 percent, as well as  hiking its directory inquiries rates.    The planned rate hikes run against the Hosokawa government's  much-touted policy of paying greater attention to consumers'  interests.    The cabinet ministers stressed the need to bring Japan's  public services rates into line with those of other countries,  which are generally lower, officials said.    They said the ministers also agreed that the "basic  policies"  should be complied with when local governments give permission  to raise bus fares and other public services charges in their  areas.</p>

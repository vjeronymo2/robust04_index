			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD was fixed at a six-month high of Dollars 341.55 a troy ounce on the London bullion market yesterday morning, but failed to hold the early gain as waves of active selling emerged. Soon after Comex opened, a concerted push to try and breach resistance at Dollars 342.50 emerged, but it fell back quickly as operators turned to profit-taking. However, New York analysts said that improved speculative demand and physical offtake was continuing to support the market. New York raw SUGAR was ahead at midday as general uncertainty over tightening world supplies continued to underpin prices. The fundamentalist view of the market was not changed during the recent volatility, said one commission house analyst, referring to the steep sell-off after the mid-March rally to three-year highs. 'They're all still very friendly toward it.' London COCOA closed with small losses but above the day's lows. It was helped by a small recovery in New York after Monday's slide. But the rally could prove shortlived as further fund liquidation is seen emerging in the US market soon. Compiled from Reuters</p>

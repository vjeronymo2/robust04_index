			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Bolona retains cabinet post Mr Carlos Bolona, Peru's finance minister, will now retain his cabinet post while his principal opponents, Mr Augusto Blacker Miller and Mr Joy Way, respectively foreign relations and industry ministers, have been forced to resign, writes Sally Bowen in Lima. Mr Bolona's conditions for remaining at the economic helm apparently included the departure of both adversaries. The weekend ratification of his position will come as a relief to the International Monetary Fund with whom he has been Peru's chief interlocutor for the past 14 months.</p>

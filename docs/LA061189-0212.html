			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS IN 2 CITIES LEAVE 3 MEN WOUNDED  </P> <P> Three men were wounded in two separate drive-by shootings in Buena Park and  Westminster, authorities said Saturday.  </P> <P> Felipe Angulo, 27, of Fullerton and an unidentified 16-year-old from Buena Park  were shot at 11:30 p.m. Friday while attending a party in the 6500 block of  Kingman Avenue, a residential area in Buena Park.  </P> <P> "It was a large party," a Buena Park officer said. "It was attended by a  significant number of young people who were affiliated with several different  gangs from the Orange County area."  </P> <P> Angulo was shot once in the right shoulder and was listed in satisfactory  condition at United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. The juvenile was shot in  the area of his left chest and arm and was in stable condition at UCI Medical  Center in Orange.  </P> <P> Police said the suspects in that shooting were a group of four or five men who  tried to attend the party uninvited. After they were denied entrance, the men  allegedly climbed into their car, which police describe as a cream-colored GM  vehicle, and fired several shots into the crowd as they drove by.  </P> <P> "We were hiding under the bed," said Jane Vela, 63, a neighbor. "We were really  scared."  </P> <P> In a separate drive-by incident, Francisco Mariscal, 29, of Costa Mesa was shot  in the hip at 3:20 a.m. Saturday while standing on the front porch of a house  in the 7000 block of Plaza Street.  </P> <P> Mariscal was in stable condition Saturday at Humana Hospital-Westminster.  </P></p>

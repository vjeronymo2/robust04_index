According to local officials, last year the autonomous  region's engineering industry had a 7.5 billion yuan output  value, with a sales ratio of 98 percent.    In the same year, enterprises in the engineering industry  generated 1.4 billion yuan in profits and taxes for the  autonomous region, and contributed 30 million U.S. dollars to  the region's finances, from the exports of their products.  <H5>  Yunnan Transmits More Electricity to Guangdong </H5>   Southwest China's power-rich Yunnan Province has transmitted  540 million kw/hour of electricity to south China's Guangdong  Province since late last year.

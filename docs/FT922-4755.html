			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Israel forced to suspend GE deals ISRAEL said yesterday it would have to suspend new aircraft engine contracts with General Electric (GE), a big supplier to the Israeli air force, following corruption allegations involving GE and Israeli officials. Israeli defence officials said that new contracts for GE engines would be halted in line with the Pentagon's own suspension of dealings with GE's engines division, announced on Tuesday. Pentagon approval is required for Israeli military purchases in the US under conditions attached to the US aid. The moves are the latest in a long-running scandal over abuse by Israeli procurement officers of US military aid. The US government has filed charges against officials in GE's engines division, alleging they conspired with Rami Dotan, jailed ex-head of Israeli air force procurement, to defraud the US military sales programme of Dollars 40m (Pounds 22.2m).</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Owners Abroad surges to Pounds 31.6m despite international instability THOSE WHO make their living selling foreign holidays to the British continued to defy the recession yesterday when Owners Abroad, the UK's second biggest package tour company, announced full-year pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 31.6m. The results, which beat City expectations, came at the end of a year in which the travel companies were rocked by international instability. Apart from the general downturn in consumer spending, the Gulf war reduced holiday bookings last January and February to unprecedently low levels. The civil war in Yugoslavia resulted in the industry losing what had previously been the holiday destination of some 500,000 Britons. Owners Abroad did benefit, however, from the collapse last March of International Leisure Group. Although the number of charter package holidays sold in the UK fell from 11.7m to 10.4m last year, Owners Abroad's results suggest that many consumers are continuing to buy foreign holidays, despite cutting back on the purchase of other goods. Mr Howard Klein, chairman, said: 'I believe this is largely due to the fact that a foreign holiday is no longer regarded as a luxury but as a necessity, and that people are extremely reluctant to give up something for which they have worked hard and saved hard and looked forward to all year.' Turnover rose from Pounds 497.9m to Pounds 643.6m. Fully-diluted earnings per share improved to 12.6p (8p). The proposed final dividend of 2.2925p brings the total for the year to 3.2p (2.9p). As a result of the Pounds 28.9m rights issue last March the company held a cash balance of Pounds 73m at the year end. COMMENT It must be galling to see your shares fall after you have more than doubled profits in the midst of arguably the worst recession in living memory. The 3p drop in Owners Abroad's shares yesterday to 117p was, however, widely seen as profit-taking by a market which had largely anticipated the good news. Even so, to anyone unfamiliar with the history of package travel in the UK, the shares look cheap. Expected pre-tax profits for the current year of Pounds 37.5m and earnings of 13.2p put the company on a prospective multiple of slightly less than 9. The low rating partly reflects nervousness about a possible price war. The company insists that the industry has learnt the lessons of the late 1980s and that its price-slashing days are over. It insists it is driven by profit rather than market share and believes the same is true of other large travel companies. However, Thomson, the leading operator, has vowed it will protect its market share against Owners Abroad and Airtours, the industry's number three. While the industry continues to talk tough, it can hardly complain if memories of its misspent youth still linger.</p>

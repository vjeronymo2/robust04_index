			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Banco Santander outlines Banesto assets sale plan Banco Santander, which acquired Banesto last month, intends to sell the bulk of the collapsed group's foreign banking interests over the next few months, according to Mr Emilio Botn, Santander chairman. Confirming expectations, he also told a parliamentary hearing in Madrid that he would dispose of Banesto's corporate interests, which include mining, construction, battery manufacture and media interests. Mr Botn was making his first public statement on the future of Banesto since Santander acquired the group for Dollars 2bn on April 26, in the largest domestic takeover. His evidence to the legislators suggested a strategy weighted towards stripping the assets of Banesto rather than consolidating them within Santander. However, Santander will retain Banco Totta e Azores, the Portuguese bank, which Mr Botn said was a 'high-value' asset and one of the 'main reasons' behind his decision to acquire Banesto. He intends to discuss the future of BTA with the Portuguese authorities next week. The Lisbon government contests the size of Banesto's holding in BTA. Although Banesto directly holds just under 25 per cent of the Portuguese bank's stock, it is estimated to control some 50 per cent of its equity through nominee shareholders. Santander already owns a Portuguese banking group, Banco de Comercio e Industria, BCI. Mr Botn said bluntly he intended to sell Banesto's industrial assets 'in an orderly and prudent fashion . . . without surprises . . . and never at knockdown prices'. Companies in Banesto's industrial holding include Tudor, the battery producer, the mining group Asturiana de Zinc and the construction company Agroman. Banesto's new owners will, in addition, put up for sale the bank's media interests, the most important of which are minority shareholdings in the Antena 3 television network and in the El Mundo newspaper group. Bankers Trust, the US investment bank, has been given the mandate for the media disposals. Mr Botn said Banesto's international banking subsidiaries - Banesto Banking Corporation in the US, Banesto Chile Bank, Banesto Banco Uruguay, and Banco Shaw in Argentina - were 'of little importance'. They would either be absorbed by the Santander group, which has subsidiary banks in Chile and the US, or sold 'to whoever pays the right price'.</p>

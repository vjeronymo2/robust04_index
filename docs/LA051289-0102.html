			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> For New Yorker Gretchen Bender, the media is a two-headed Hydra. TV, video and  print offer us beautifully choreographed realities and access to visual  information that expands consciousness; think of computer programs that  generate 3-D video maps of objects or those amazing photos beamed back from  outer space. But the looming monster "media" also accelerates that tricky,  scary process by which the most assaultive of information quickly becomes  humdrum and every day; consider the slow visual (and psychological)  accommodation that's turned a psychopathic killer like "Freddy" into a  cinematic caricature that our children can laugh at.  </P> <P> In an excellent coda to her work in MOCA's "Forest of Signs," Bender  experiments with the way that information either takes on or is drained of  meaning. She shows an enlarged, fuzzy black-and-white photo of two bound,  battered women hung dead over a ledge with their backs to us. Anonymous and  strangely neutral, the bodies could be a scene from South East Asia, El  Salvador or a still from the next war flick. Bender says she was drawn to the  image's brutality then amazed at how quickly it no longer moved her. Playing  artist, advertiser and political provocateur, she reinvests the photo with  meaning by joining it to an enlarged, saturated color photo of a terribly  mutilated finger. As she investigates her own responses to the piece (and  controls ours), Bender raises hefty questions about the political and  ideological power of what we habitually see.  </P> <P> In an excellent floor installation Bender enlarges photographs taken from video  screens, TV, etc., dry mounts these onto some plastic material that can be  crumpled like rubbish and then heat hardened. Spearing these crinkled, barely  discernable bundles of information onto upright metal lances that project out  of the gallery floor, she orchestrates the perfect sense of horror and  adventure, caution and fascination we all feel toward the images that barrage  us. A wall-hung geometric puzzle painted metallic gray spouts a tendril of  discarded film strips and a painting of an American flag that decomposes in  special effect, 3-D fashion, fill out a handsome, compelling show by a major  young talent. (Meyers/Bloom Gallery, 2112 Broadway, to May 27).MARLENA DONOHUE.  </P></p>

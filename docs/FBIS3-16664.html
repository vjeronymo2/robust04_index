			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eduard Ediberidze: "In the Cabinet of Ministers. </F> With the Aim of Stabilizing the Republic's Energy Supply"]    [Excerpt] It seems that the serious situation that took  shape in the republic in winter due to the acute shortage of  electric power is gradually returning to normal. Elimination of  the consequences of the recent accident at the Tbilisi State  Regional Power Station, the supply of natural gas and fuel oil  from Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan, in spite of the large debts  that Georgia owes to these countries, and the spring high-water  in the rivers, which has increased the seasonal output of  hydro-electric stations, have enabled us to improve to some  degree the supply of electric power to vitally important  installations such as bakeries and hospitals and also to the  population. During the last few days, the Tbilisi subway,  though operating according to a strict schedule, has been  functioning almost normally; it carries more than 90 percent of  all passengers travelling in the Georgian capital. Trolleybuses  have again started to operate along certain city lines.  Telephone communications have been restored in most areas.  However, there is still very much that needs to be done in  order to achieve complete stability in the republic's electric  power complex. As before, the new residential areas in Tbilisi  and individual cities and rayons in the republic are permanently  without electricity. Industrial enterprises remain idle, while  expecting a change in the electric power situation....    This was a topic of discussion at the regular session of the  Georgian Cabinet of Ministers Presidium under the chairmanship  of Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia that was held on 9 March. The  main point on the agenda was the question of urgent measures  aimed at stabilizing the situation that has taken shape in the  republic's electric power complex. A thorough analysis of both  the objective and subjective reasons that have given rise to the  crisis in this most important branch has enabled us to elaborate  a concrete program aimed at bringing it out of this serious  situation and creating real preconditions for a radical  improvement in energy supplies to the economic complex and the  population during the autumn and winter of 1994-95. It is  planned to increase the production of electric power this year  to 11-12 billion kilowatt hours; at the same time, compared with  last year, the rate of increase amounts to 112.2 percent. In  order to implement this program, it has been decided to allocate  3.5 billion rubles to this branch from the credits received by  Georgia; this money will go, first and foremost, on repairing  the equipment at the Tbilisi State Regional Hydro-Power Station  and the Inguri Hydro-Power Station and on increasing the level  of production. In accordance with the adopted decree, the  appropriate instructions have been given to the "Sakenergo"  [Georgian electric power production and consumption] department  and other departments and ministries, the heads of enterprises  and organizations, and the republic's town and rayon local  administrative bodies in order to bring the branch out of the  crisis.

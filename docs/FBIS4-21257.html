			<p>BFN     [Text] Cochabamba -- Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas  assured FIDES NEW AGENCY that the struggle against drug  trafficking will be more aggressive than in past governments;  therefore, the United States and other international  organizations must step up their cooperation for alternative  development.    Regretting the fact that the reduction of coca leaf  plantations did not take place at the pace established in  bilateral agreements with the United States, which undoubtedly  prompted some comments on the reduction of international  cooperation, Cardenas said the reduction process was slow not  because the new government did not have the will but rather due  to the electoral process that had its natural impact on state  activities.    He added that the structural changes proposed by the  government have hindered the fulfillment of those contracts,  "but the executive branch's determination to fight drug  trafficking is greater than that of past governments."    He said the Bolivian and U.S. Governments must negotiate  with  that criteria to establish the goals of the new anti-drug  cooperation agreements and for alternative development.    Regarding U.S. cooperation in these fields, he said that no  cooperation will be enough to solve the drug trafficking problem  the country is enduring.    Cardenas said it is necessary that instead of reducing  cooperation in the reduction of coca plantations, the efforts  for alternative development must be increased. "The people get  involved in coca production or drug trafficking not out of habit  but due to the poverty affecting large sectors of the nation."    He added that although international cooperation is  important  for alternative development, the existence of foreign markets  for Bolivian products is no less important.    He added that if Bolivia finds markets it also will find  important partners abroad that will make coca production  unnecessary to sustain a more stable economy.    Regarding the controversy surrounding the subject of  reducing  coca plantations, which in the opinion of the industry's  authorities increase in a sustained manner, Cardenas said that  only those plantations classified as legal by Law No. 1008  should be maintained, "but that surplus plantations must be  reduced through agreements between coca growers and the  government in a voluntary rather than a compulsory manner."</p>

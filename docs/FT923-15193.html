			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Statement lops 69p off Hi-Tec share price SHARES IN Hi-Tec Sports, Britain's biggest sports shoe supplier, yesterday plunged from 175p to 106p on news that the company was suffering from heavy discounting by overseas competitors such as Reebok and Nike. Mr Frank van Wezel, chairman, told Hi-Tec's annual meeting that the discounting, together with deepening recessionary conditions affecting consumer spending, had adversely affected the UK market for a longer period than previously expected. He said: 'As a result, our UK results so far this year are significantly below those achieved in the corresponding period of last year, and are below our earlier expectations, and we are experiencing a sharper squeeze on margins'. The meeting was told that these factors would 'inevitably have a pronounced adverse impact on our overall results for the first half of this year.' The UK workforce has been cut from 130 to just over 100 and Hi-Tec said it was keeping a tight control on working capital. One reason for the market's sharp reaction to yesterday's profits warning was that it was in marked contrast to the optimistic note sounded by the company on May 9, when it announced a 10 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 9.06m for the year to February 2. Hi-Tec said yesterday that it had seen spending rise after the election and when the good weather started, but that these 'false dawns' had proved short-lived. However, the group emphasised that its street hiking boots were continuing to do well in the US and, while the situation in the UK remained uncertain, it expected results in the second half of this year to show a recovery from the first half.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 16 Dec (XINHUA) -- The State Council  recently issued a circular on implementing the public service  system plan, calling on all localities and departments to  seriously implement the plan in consideration of their actual  situation.    The circular states: To formulate and implement the public  service system is an important event in China's political life.  It is an important content of the reform of the political  system, as well as a necessity in establishing a socialist  market economy. It is of great significance to increasing the  building of clean and honest government as well as to improving  the quality of state functionaries and the efficiency of the  administration. All localities and departments should attach  great importance to the public service system and  conscientiously strengthen leadership over its implementation.    The circular points out: The public service system should be  carried out step by step in a planned manner in conjunction with  organizational reform. The personnel positions, staffing, and  non- leadership jobs must not be finalized before the  "three-fix" plan [san ding fang an 0005 1353 2455 2714] is  approved. Units which have not yet carried out organizational  reform should actively organize the implementation of the  systems for hiring, performance appraisal, awards, discipline,  training, challenge [hui bi 0932 6699], and retirement. During  the course of implementing the public service system, it is  strictly prohibited to enlarge the scope of implementation,  establish unauthorized positions, and rush promotion or transfer  of cadres. Violation of regulations should be corrected in good  time, and leading cadres concerned should be blamed for the  violation.    The implementation plan for the public service system  contains clear and definite stipulations on the scope,  procedures, and methods of implementation. It also sets  specific requirements for the current office staff to transit to  the public service system, for the rank and grade of public  servants, and for the establishment and appointment of  non-leadership staff members. The plan emphasizes the necessity  to implement the public service system under the leadership of  party committees and governments, pay attention to studying new  circumstances and new problems during the implementation,  seriously strengthen the ideological and political work, and  ensure a smooth implementation.</p>

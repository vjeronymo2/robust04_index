			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ZOO UP TREE AS SUN BEARS PLAY HOUDINI  </P> <P> In 73 years, the San Diego Zoo has had a lot to brag about. Its proudest  moments, however, would not fall under the title "The Great Escape."  </P> <P> There was the rare, 600-pound African antelope that thundered across a golf  course.  </P> <P> There was the jaguar that skittered between a keeper's legs and caromed toward  the exit, its claws clicking on the concrete.  </P> <P> And there was the orangutan that left for a stroll, only to surrender -- to  everyone's goggle-eyed amazement -- to a keeper's outstretched palm.  </P> <P> Those were one-shot escapades, easily squelched. Now, however, a pair of  Malaysian sun bears at the zoo appear to be out to break all records, and to  possess the savvy of Houdini when it comes to escaping.  </P> <P> Shortly after 3 p.m. on Sept. 23, the 100-pound Ringo climbed over a wall and  ended up on the patio of Sun Bear Forest. Onlookers apparently thought it was  part of a show and made an attempt to cozy up to Ringo, who was just trying to  act naturally.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Third Sun Bear Escape  </P> <P> Ringo's was the third escape by a sun bear since the animals' new $3.5-million  exhibit opened in June.  </P> <P> Muffin, Ringo's female playmate, escaped the two other times.  </P> <P> The bears' antics have zoo officials worried, so much so that a guard has been  posted at the exhibit during visiting hours.  </P> <P> "Every time these bears get out it's a problem -- and a potential grave hazard  -- for zoo visitors," zoo spokesman Jeff Jouett said with furrowed brow. "We  can't seem to convince the public that, although small, these animals are not  Yogi Bear or Winnie the Pooh. Sun bears have the ability to do a lot of damage  to human beings.  </P> <P> "They have big claws for digging and teeth that could easily deliver a big  bite. We face the dual hazard of a person or a bear getting hurt, and then the  very real possibility of incurring a major lawsuit. So, yes, we're worried."  </P> <P> Escapes notwithstanding, the bears have managed to do considerable damage to  the exhibit, Jouett said, which has the theme of "native habitat." What  zookeepers hadn't counted on was that the cute little bears would gnaw down  every tree in sight, along with plants and grassy slopes, and destroy a $25,000  fiberglass "tree" with an automatic honey dispenser.  </P> <P> Jouett said the zoo resisted using electrical wiring, but, as it turns out, the  bears' claws do not conduct electricity, which keepers didn't know.  </P> <P> He said the bears are "intelligent, curious" animals with "a ferocious climbing  instinct."  </P> <P> They're just more intelligent, more curious and better at climbing than anyone  at the zoo thought they could be.  </P> <P> Sun bears weigh 60 to 150 pounds, Jouett said, and the eight on exhibit in the  1 1/2-acre Sun Bear Forest average about 100 pounds. The bears bear a vague  resemblance to large dogs, especially those of the hound variety, the kind  former President Lyndon B. Johnson might have picked up by the ears.  </P> <P> So far -- and Jouett said the zoo is "incredibly fortunate" to be noting this  -- the escapes have not resulted in injuries to the bears or the passers-by who  find them so irresistibly cuddly and charismatic.  </P> <P> On Sept. 23, however, Ringo had to be felled by a tranquilizer gun, which  Jouett said poses problems, the likes of which the zoo hopes not to encounter  again.  </P> <P> "You never know quite what dosage to give the animal because every animal is  different. An animal gets out, its adrenaline is racing, and that affects the  dosage you select. The instinct of such an animal would be fight or flight once  it escapes. Luckily, Ringo chose flight. Otherwise, some people could have been  hurt -- seriously."  </P> <P> Zookeepers have installed sheet metal behind a row of bars in the area where  each escape took place. They're hoping the metal will prevent claws from  wrapping around the bars to gain traction. The "visitor assistance officer" is  now on duty during zoo hours to make sure no further escapes occur or to  minimize damage if any do.  </P> <P> Jouett said the conventional way of housing bears is in a "sunken grotto." The  zoo had hoped to alter that by having onlookers gaze up at the bears, rather  than down -- "not quite so condescending," he said -- and offering a kind of  minimum-security setting to such creatures of the wild.  </P> <P> But the strength and boldness of sun bears, particularly those on view in San  Diego, have baffled and awed the experts. And now, Jouett said, the zoo may be  inclined to "rethink" the nature of Sun Bear Forest.  </P> <P> "It's like if you designed a human exhibit," he said. "You or I wouldn't be  able to get out -- but (Olympic athlete) Carl Lewis might. He'd probably just  jump over. Much to our chagrin, that's exactly what Ringo and Muffin keep  doing."  </P></p>

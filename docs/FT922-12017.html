			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / European football sponsorship deal SEGA Enterprises, the Japanese video-game maker, is expected to sponsor ITV 's coverage of the European football championship. In February the ITV companies said they were seeking bids of at least Pounds 950,000 for sponsorship rights to UK coverage of the championship, to take place in Sweden in June. A deal of around Pounds 2m has been put together which includes advertising during the programmes. An announcement is expected this week. Sponsorship of the football championships follows Sony's successful sponsorship of the rugby world cup championship last November for a fee of around Pounds 1.25m. Coverage of the European championships will alternate with the BBC until the semi-finals, when ITV will have exclusive rights to the France v England game and the Scottish games against the states of the former Soviet Union and Germany.</p>

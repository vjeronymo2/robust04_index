			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / From delusion to devaluation: Martin Wolf unravels the events behind the collapse of UK economic policy 'The exchange rate mechanism will reinforce our counterinflationary policies, help to provide the stability and certainty that industry needs, and set the right framework for a resumption of soundly-based and non-inflationary growth.' John Major, House of Commons, October 15 1990. 'I do not see that we could readily return to the mechanism without dealing with the problems that have been thrown up in the past fortnight. These need careful examination and consideration before we can decide whether such a mechanism can be made to work to the benefit of all its members.' John Major, House of Commons, September 24 1992. What a difference two years make. Hopes were high when Mr Major put sterling into the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) on October 5 1990. Hopes collapsed when sterling was pushed out of the ERM on September 16 1992. The entry was abrupt, the exit no less so. The ERM has run like a black thread through the garment of British politics. It precipitated the resignations from Margaret Thatcher's government of Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson. It helped bring Mrs Thatcher down. Now it has devastated Mr Major, the chancellor who took sterling in and the prime minister who saw sterling forced out. It is difficult now to recall the strength of the consensus in favour of ERM entry. There was the odd malcontent: Sir Alan Walters, for example. The then prime minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, was undoubtedly among them. But she was too enfeebled to resist a policy she had alway disliked. Those involved in foreign policy supported ERM entry because it represented a commitment to the UK's European future. People in business supported entry because it would provide exchange rate stability. Those responsible for economic policy supported the ERM because it would, they hoped, end a series of policy disasters. Several influential policymakers - Nigel Lawson among them - regarded the targeting of broad money as the god that had failed. From the mid-1980s onwards, they judged the exchange rate to be the best monetary indicator. This judgment was largely determined by the experience of falling inflation and a soaring exchange rate in the early 1980s, despite rapid growth of the broad money aggregates. In the autumn of 1985, Mr Lawson made an effort, then blocked by Mrs Thatcher, to obtain ERM entry at the exchange rate of about DM 3.75. Meanwhile, several senior officials in the Treasury and the Bank of England viewed the ERM as no more than a second-best method of running monetary policy. But Mr Lawson's erratic monetary policies convinced officials that a first-rate monetary policy - one run by themselves - would never be allowed to happen. Along with many others, they concluded that monetary policy was far too important to be entrusted to politicians. Just as there was an official view on why it was necessary to enter the ERM, there is also a view in the Treasury and the Bank of England on why sterling was forced out. The view is not identical to that of the prime minister and chancellor, who have focused their excuses on the allegedly unexpected events of recent weeks and their fervent complaints on the unhelpful behaviour of the Germans. The official view is more subtle. Their story goes roughly as follows. The timing of entry was not ideal, nor was the 1 percentage point interest rate cut that accompanied it. But both were dictated by political realities. In particular, entry could only come after the prime minister and the chancellor had both agreed to it. It also could come only when the conditions set at the Madrid summit of June 1988, which had demanded prior convergence of UK inflation on the EC average, could be plausibly reset in terms of prospective inflation. Finally, it was judged imperative for entry to come before the start of the EC's inter-governmental conferences on monetary and political union. Notwithstanding the long-delayed entry, the first year to 18 months of ERM entry went well. Sterling remained close to its central rate. Interest rates were brought down steadily, from a base rate of 15 per cent on the eve of entry to 10 1/2 per cent in September 1991. The rate was cut still further, to 10 per cent, in May 1992. Meanwhile, inflation - the lodestar of policy - was falling more rapidly than forecast. Unfortunately, the better-than-expected performance on inflation reflected the worse-than-forecast performance of the economy. In the first half of 1992 it was becoming obvious, even to the government, that a severe conflict was emerging between the monetary policy required by ERM membership and that needed by the domestic economy. The 'green shoots' of recovery were withering in the Bundesbank's monetary winter. The unexpectedly weak performance of the UK economy was only one of three things that went wrong. The other two were the high interest rates that were the Bundesbank's response to the inflationary consequences of German unification and the failure of the US economy to show its long-awaited recovery. It was not what the German and US economies were doing individually that mattered so much. What mattered more was the combination of the two. By autumn 1992, the UK was suffering from a Dollars 2 pound, even though the rate against the D-Mark was near its floor, from short-term real interest rates at near unprecedented levels for a recession, and from a weak world economy. With stagnation in the UK economy, the public sector borrowing requirement rising towards 6 per cent of gross domestic product and bound to go higher, and a current account deficit of 2 per cent of GDP in the midst of recession, something had to give. In the end, it was sterling's place in the ERM. There were alternatives, at least in theory. The US authorities might have promoted domestic recovery more successfully. The German government might have taken more drastic action to put its fiscal house in order. The Bundesbank might have been persuaded to ignore the German monetary data. The French might have agreed to a realignment, one that might, in turn, have persuaded the Bundesbank to lower German interest rates. But none of these things happened. Alternatively, sterling might have been realigned, either on its own or with the lira. But since officials at the Treasury and Bank of England believed neither that sterling was overvalued against European currencies nor that a partial realignment of the ERM would lead to significantly lower German interest rates, this option looked pointless to them. It seemed necessary to soldier on, instead, at least until after the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. It was understood that the French referendum would make the more doubtful of the ERM parities difficult to preserve. In the event, the failure of central bank intervention to reverse the weakness of the dollar in late August, followed not long after by the risky and ultimately unsuccessful 7 per cent realignment of the lira on the weekend of September 12-13, set the stage for sterling's humiliation. Unguarded remarks from senior Bundesbank officials - notably those reported on the morning of September 16 from Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank's president - simply put the match to the kerosene. Nonetheless, it did seem as though the Bundesbank was unaware of the dangers for the ERM posed by the French referendum. In the event, the UK base rate increases were inadequate. What, after all, is a 5 percentage point interest rate increase against the likelihood of a 10 per cent devaluation by tomorrow morning? The government simply ran out of money and out of time. For some in the Bank of England, this disastrous denouement even came as a relief. Does this official view make sense? Only up to a point. First of all, the government had no strategy for dealing with the aftermath of the French referendum. It is now clear that France had no intention of realigning the franc. Also, a sterling realignment on its own, while helpful in dealing with the evident overvaluation against the dollar, would have done nothing for the equally pressing problem of the interest rate. Second, while the tactics probably made little difference to what became an unsustainable policy, serious tactical errors were made. Among the most important was the failure to deal sensibly with other ERM members. To enter at a rate the Germans thought ambitious was risky; to hector them was foolish; and to suggest that the UK's failure was reason for suspending the ERM was at least cheeky. Third, economic events were unfortunate, but not unforeseeable. The Treasury failed to understand what had happened to the UK economy during the second half of the 1980s. It failed to foresee the onset of recession at the time of ERM entry. In both failures it was in the company of most analysts, but not, in fact, of all. Furthermore, the Treasury has never accepted what seems evident to many outside observers, that sterling's real exchange rate was seriously overvalued from the beginning, as is clearly suggested by the UK's trade performance, As for the supposedly unforeseen effects of German unification, UK officials needed only ask Karl Otto Pohl, the former Bundesbank president, for his view of the consequences of the errors his government had committed before sterling's entry into the ERM. More fundamentally still, these mishaps are not independent of the decision to fix exchange rates. It was partly because of the attempt to keep sterling down in 1987 and early 1988 that the UK entered the ERM with a huge debt overhang. It was also ERM membership that made it impossible to respond to unfolding economic circumstances. Inflexibility is, after all, the heart and soul of the mechanism. What then is the main lesson? It is that there are no magic wands, certainly not entry into the ERM on its own, probably not the ERM at all. The happy mishap of exit from the ERM gives the government another chance to find the long-term policies and institutions that will give the UK sustained, non-inflationary growth. But for now at least, the government has lost its policy and the country has lost its way.</p>

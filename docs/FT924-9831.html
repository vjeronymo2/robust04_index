			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Victory For Clinton: Incumbents ride out election storm CONGRESSMEN of both parties had braced themselves for a massacre of the incumbents; in the end, however, the traditional advantages of incumbency - coupled, for the Democrats, with the presidential coat-tails of Governor Bill Clinton - seem to have prevailed in yesterday's congressional elections. The most closely contested races, of course, were also the slowest to show a reliable result. Yet by 11pm Eastern time, only two notable incumbents had fallen to their challengers: Senator Terry Sanford of North Carolina and Senator Robert Kasten of Wisconsin. Even Senator Sanford's defeat at the hands of Mr Lauch Faircloth, a Republican businessman, was scarcely typical. His open-heart surgery a month before the election raised doubts about his physical fitness to serve another six-year term. In Wisconsin, however, Mr Russell Feingold, a little known Democratic state legislator, fought a humorous outsider's campaign to defeat Mr Kasten. Democratic women enjoyed a triple success on the west coast as Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer won the two Senate seats at stake in California and, further north, Patty Murray triumphed in the Senate race in Washington state. In the House of Representatives, some of the incumbents who had appeared to be most at risk won re-election: in Kentucky, one of the first states to close its polls, Republican congressmen Harold Rogers and Jim Bunning were among the earliest to be returned, along with Democrat Romano Mazzoli. In North Carolina, Democrats Tim Valentine and Martin Lancaster were returned, as was Nick Rahall in West Virginia. Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican minority whip at the top of every Democratic hit list, claimed victory in his district after one of the most venomous campaigns. Some pundits had held their breath for what would have been one of the biggest upsets of all, the defeat in Illinois of Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House ways and means committee; it did not take place. The first Senate results to be declared showed incumbents winning re-election in Alabama, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Oklahoma and Vermont. Even Senator John Glenn, who had faced a bitter onslaught from his Republican challenger, Mr Michael DeWine, over his involvement in the Keating Savings and Loan scandal, won his race in Ohio. Senator Ernest Hollings, too, won a sixth Senate term in South Carolina in a close race. On the Republican side Senator John McCain, another who had been tarred with the Keating brush, won re-election in Arizona and Senator Alfonse D'Amato was expected to win a fierce battle against Mr Robert Abrams in New York. With 80 per cent of the votes counted, Mr D'Amato - who spent millions of dollars on negative television commercials - had 51 per cent against 49 per cent for Mr Abrams. The senator is a right-wing populist who distanced himself from President Bush. Mr D'Amato, although he has been investigated on several alleged corruption charges and was even censured by the Senate ethics committee for systematically misusing his Senate office, managed to fling plenty of mud and received plenty back from Mr Abrams. One of the closest Senate races was in Colorado, where Democratic Congressman Ben Nighthorse Campbell was running neck-and-neck in opinion polls with Republican businessman Terry Considine. But Mr Campbell - a Cheyenne jeweller, cattle rancher and Olympic judo champion who is the only Native American in Congress - edged out Mr Considine to take the seat vacated by Senator Tim Wirth. Early returns for the House showed mostly incumbents winning re-election. They included Socialist Congressman Bernard Sanders, the only independent in the entire Congress, who retained his seat in Vermont. Results were not yet available for the sitting members who had been most damaged by their abuse of the generous overdraft facilities of the House's private bank. Democratic campaign managers said before yesterday's voting that their polling suggested a consistent 10 per cent disadvantage for incumbents; Congressman Guy Vander Jagt, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, who was himself defeated this year in a primary, estimated the drag at 20 to 30 per cent. Even without the collapse in public esteem for Congress, many sitting members faced hard re-election battles. US House districts are redrawn after the census every 10 years. With population still moving from the north and east towards the west and south, many sitting members have seen their districts dwindle or disappear altogether. All told, Democratic campaign managers estimate that 34 Democratic incumbents were adversely affected by redistricting, and a dozen Republicans. Redistricting has brought a substantial increase in the number of districts where most voters belong to ethnic minorities to comply with the Voting Rights Act. Among the beneficiaries was Ms Eva Clayton, a Democrat who last night became the first black woman ever to represent North Carolina in Congress. Although it was still too early to make any projection of the party composition of the new Congress, Democratic party officials confidently predicted that there would be no change in their party's domination of both the House and the Senate. Before voting began, Democrats said they expected a net loss of between 20 and 25 seats in the House, not enough to dent their 101-seat majority. In the Senate, which the Democrats previously controlled by 57 seats to the Republicans' 43, Republican hopes of reclaiming the majority faded long ago. Their greatest concern in recent weeks has been whether they could prevent the Democrats from picking up three additional seats. The 60-seat figure would be critical to the prospects of pushing through a legislative agenda, as it would deprive the Republicans of the 40-seat bloc which under Senate rules is enough to sustain a filibuster and so hold up any legislation indefinitely.</p>

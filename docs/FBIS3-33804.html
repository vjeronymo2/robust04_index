			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "An invitation To End Captivity"] </F>   [Text] While we deeply respect every sincere effort and the  good offices that have been exerted concerning the issue of the  prisoners, and while we appreciate and understand the motives of  the ongoing visits to world countries to keep this issue alive  in the world's conscience, it is not easy for us to say that  this method will not produce results and will not advance this  issue one iota.    The world may sympathize with our suffering and understand  our insistence and why we are losing patience. The countries in  the world will continue to loudly declare that the prisoners  have every right to be set free. They might couple this with a  condemnation of the Iraqi regime for its violation of human  rights and UN principles. But, none of what we seek will be  realized. Of course, this is neither a call for despair, or an  attempt to absolve an issue that concerns every Kuwaiti, and to  that effect, every free man in the world. We are just stating a  fact with the realization that keeping silent about it, or  trying to hide it will not serve anyone.    You want your prisoners? Then, stop deceiving yourselves and  say it as frankly as possible because you know it well. If you  lack the courage to do so, we find no harm in declaring it on  your behalf:    We will say that it is a political issue before a  humanitarian issue. It is a card in the hands of the alliance  countries, specifically the Western countries. They have their  own strategic calculations, which do not necessarily tally with  our national or regional calculations. It is high time for us  to understand that they do not want to change the current  situation because it represents an ideal state that is needed to  have circumstances that will help bring a new move on the Gulf  map to fruition. They want to keep the area crucified on the  cross of the prisoners and of other outstanding issues until  they complete the rearrangement of the state of affairs in other  areas that have more priority on their strategic agenda.    In light of this reality, we call for a qualitative move to  redress the course and end this state of begging for a solution,  to begin shaping a new reality that will force the Western  countries to change their course and tackle the issue of the  prisoners and the demarcation of borders -- not as a Kuwaiti  issue but as a Gulf issue that endangers regional security.    The best thing that we can do to control this new reality is  to establish a strategic regional group with the Gulf  Cooperation Council countries at the center, flanked by Syria  and Iran. Then, we can tell the Western countries: Leave our  countries, as we no longer need your services, and Saddam's army  is no more than a scarecrow with which we know how to deal. You  will then be astonished to see how well the Western countries  can actively and positively move to align their stand with this  new reality to secure the interests they have in this regional  group, even if the price needed for this is Saddam's head.  Otherwise, we shall remain captives with our prisoners, moaning  in Baghdad's prisons.</p>

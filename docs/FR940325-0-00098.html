			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Injuries Caused by Response Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asked the Department to clarify that State trustee officials are not allowed to recover damages for injuries caused or aggravated by State-ordered cleanup activities if those injuries were reasonably avoidable. Another commenter interpreted the rule to prohibit recovery of damages for any injuries that trustee officials could have reasonably avoided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 11.15(a)(1)(ii), which was not affected by this rulemaking, provides that PRPs are liable for any increase in injuries that is reasonably unavoidable as a result of response actions taken or anticipated. As was stated in the August 1, 1986, preamble to the original type B rule, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;* The Department believes that any response actions undertaken by government agencies should strive to avoid additional injury to natural resources whenever possible. Damages from such ``reasonably unavoidable'' increases in injury resulting from response actions by governmental agencies are not excluded from damage actions, because they are indirectly due to the discharge or release and thus included under section 301(c) of CERCLA. 51 FR 27698. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Therefore, if government response activities cause an increase in injuries, trustee officials can only recover damages for the increase if it was reasonably unavoidable. Section 11.15(a)(1)(ii) deals solely with liability for increases in injuries caused by response actions. Section 11.14(jj), which was not affected by this rulemaking, defines ``response'' as removal or remedial actions as defined in sections 101(23) and 101(24) of CERCLA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Limitations on Liability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters believed that the rule should clarify the application of various statutory limitations on liability, including the ceilings set forth in section 107(c) of CERCLA and the provision in section 107(f)(1) that excludes natural resource damages if those damages and the release that caused those damages occurred wholly before the enactment of CERCLA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department notes that &sect;&sect;11.15(b) and 11.24(b)(1), which were not affected by this rulemaking, already incorporate the ceilings on damages set forth in section 107(c) of CERCLA and the limitation on damages set forth in section 107(f)(1) of CERCLA. Any further clarification of these provisions is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Timing of the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters thought that the information needed to determine the required level of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources would not be available at the time that the Assessment Plan is made available for public comment and review; therefore, the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan should not be prepared until after Injury Determination and Quantification have been completed. Other commenters expressed concern that allowing preparation of the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan to be delayed would lead trustee officials to perform unnecessary and unfocused assessment work during Injury Determination and Quantification. Therefore, the commenters suggested that trustee officials be required to use their best efforts to prepare the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan at the same time as the rest of the Assessment Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department believes that early preparation of the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan is advisable to ensure that the costs of assessments are reasonable. The definition of ``reasonable cost,'' which was not affected by this rulemaking, includes a requirement that Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage Determination bear a well defined relationship to each other. The Assessment Plan, which includes the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan, is designed to coordinate Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage Determination. Therefore, the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan should be prepared as early as possible. In most cases, trustee officials should be able to develop an initial Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan based on estimates of the extent and nature of the injuries and then make revisions as needed. Section 11.32(e)(1) of the rule, which was not affected by this rulemaking, authorizes trustee officials to modify any part of the Assessment Plan at any stage of the assessment as new information becomes available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Department recognizes that selection of a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative depends in part upon the extent and nature of the injuries, which will not be fully known at the outset of an assessment. Therefore, there may be cases where even a preliminary attempt to evaluate restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternatives would be meaningless unless Injury Determination or Quantification had begun. In these cases, premature preparation of the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan could temporarily misdirect Injury Determination and Quantification. Therefore, the rule provides that in those cases where existing data are insufficient to develop a Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan at the time that the rest of the Assessment Plan is prepared, the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan may be developed later. Nevertheless, the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan must always be developed before completion of Quantification in order to ensure that Quantification is correlated with Damage Determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

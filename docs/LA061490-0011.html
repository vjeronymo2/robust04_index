			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACT WATCH;  </P> <P> ODD SLANT ON LATINOS  </P> <P> The redistricting lawsuit Los Angeles County's Board of Supervisors lost last  week is complex, and to fully understand its significance you must know some of  the history of anti-Mexican discrimination hereabouts. Ignorance of that  history accounts for the simplistic analysis being done by otherwise reliable  news organizations in the East.  </P> <P> Recently, for example, the Wall Street Journal's editorial page criticized the  lawsuit, hitting at the "liberals" who filed it for pressing forward despite  the fact a Latina, Sarah Flores, might get elected to the board in November's  election. Their conclusion: local "liberals" are afraid of Flores, a  "conservative" Republican.  </P> <P> Well, L.A. politics isn't so simple. As anyone who knows her can tell you,  Flores is no knee-jerk ideologue. Like most Mexican-American Republicans, she's  "conservative" on some issues, "liberal" on others. And her supporters in the  Latino community reflect that subtle reality, including Chicanos who've also  supported politicos that conservatives love to hate, like Assemblyman Tom  Hayden (D-Santa Monica).  </P> <P> In fact, the lawsuit against the supervisors has less to do with liberal versus  conservative than it does with good versus bad government. If pundits who watch  from afar would take a closer, less ideological, look at the redistricting  case, they'd be supporting the plan put forward by the victorious plaintiffs,  to expand the county board so that not just one Sarah Flores can be elected,  but several.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE BAILOUT FUNDS FOR S&amp;LS  </P> <P> In response to "Scarcely Senatorial" (editorial, Oct. 29):  </P> <P> It really rankles me to watch those who make the laws be the most adept at  breaking them. I guess it should figure that way though, and we shouldn't be  surprised that Cranston's devious scheme to fund his reelection campaign  completely defeated the intent of the Fair Political Practices Commission's  rules.  </P> <P> But the quid pro quo of this money-raising hanky-panky is the big crime  committed against the taxpayers. Was Cranston's role in the failure of Lincoln  S&amp;L any less criminal than Jim Bakker's confidence game which netted him 45  years in prison?  </P> <P> JACK WEBER  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Letter: Time has come for the purpose of NEDO and other British quangos to be re-examined Sir, You should not be surprised that the National Economic Development Office sends the policy debate to sleep. That is what the present government wants it to do. The party which was supposedly opposed to quangos has kept some (British Overseas Trade Board and NEDC/NEDO) and actually created others, including the absurd Training and Enterprise Councils. They are created by and/or turned into creatures of the government, so that they feed back its prejudices rather than tell it what industry really thinks. There was clear pressure on NEDO to do so while I was its industrial director, although at that time (1980-84) we did manage to resist. But the pressure was later increased and government has used this feed-back to promote the idea that industry supports its policies. The purpose of these quangos should be re-examined. Other countries which are more economically successful manage the relationship between government and industry through independent trade associations and chambers of industry and commerce, and any government which really wanted to listen to industry rather than wag its palsied finger at it would do so.

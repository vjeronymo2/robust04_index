			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- New Justice Minister Hiroshi  Nakai pledged Monday [9 May] to protect the Constitution and  remain uninvolved in debates over the enactment of legislation  covering emergencies and whether Japan should claim the right to  collective defense. Nakai told his first press conference after  assuming the ministerial post that he will not be drawn on  debate over collective defense "because it is my duty to protect  the Constitution and uphold law and order."    Nakai replaced Shigeto Nagano who resigned as justice  minister Saturday to take responsibility for his remarks printed  Wednesday in a newspaper in which he said the 1937 Nanjing  massacre was a fabrication and that Japan's war with China and  other countries was not an act of aggression.    Nagano is a former officer in the wartime Imperial Japanese  Army and a former chief of staff of the Ground Self-Defense  Force.    Asked if he thought Nagano's former military career  conflicted with the constitutional principle of civilian control  and the stipulation that ministers of state should be drawn from  civilian ranks, Nakai said he does not think this applies to a  former military officer.    "That debate existed in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but  I  have never heard mention of it in the Diet or anywhere else,"  Nakai said. "Mr. Nagano was made to take responsibility for  causing trouble for the nation and the cabinet and I think he  understands that."</p>

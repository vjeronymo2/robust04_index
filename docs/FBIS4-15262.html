			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Hold the Front Page!" </F> rubric: "They Beat Our Army on All Fronts"]    [Text] The heads of interested ministries have submitted  their proposals for the next Council of Ministers session, which  will look at benefits for servicemen.    To all appearances, officers and retired servicemen of the  armed forces will have to part with many benefits. In his  letter to Chernomyrdin, Deputy Finance Minister Astakhov  proposes that servicemen be deprived of free medical service  (that is to say, the network of military outpatient hospitals  should be closed down), and that compensation for treatment at  sanatoriums and health resorts and transport fares be abolished.  At the same time, Astakhov proposes that staffers of the  Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs entitled to  retirement pensions but continuing to serve should receive  additionally an average of 75,000 rubles each.    Deputy Minister of Economy Mikhaylov, responding to the same  request, thinks that benefits for servicemen cannot be available  in 1994, and he suggests that federal budget possibilities be  studied once again. Deputy Social Protection Minister Kisilev  writes to Chernomyrdin that their agency is against the  mandatory state insurance of servicemen's property, and for  abolishing reduced prices in trade outlets for military  personnel.    The Finance Ministry also insists that even if servicemen  are  to keep their benefits, it should only be done from the Defense  Ministry's own budget -- which has been considerably reduced  through the efforts of this same Finance Ministry.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: Moody's lowers Wells Fargo rating MOODY'S, the US credit-rating agency, yesterday downgraded the rating on Wells Fargo, the big California commercial banking group, in the latest indication of how the US investment community is reacting to the weakening of the California economy. The downgrade, affecting about Dollars 4bn in securities, brings its long-term senior debt rating down to BAA1 from Single-A2, and the rating on commercial paper to Prime-2 from Prime-1. The long-term deposit rating of Well Fargo Bank, the principal operating subsidiary, was lowered by Moody's from Double-A3 to Single-A2. Moody's said the action reflected 'the uncertain outlook for asset quality, especially in Wells' sizeable portfolio of commercial real estate loans'. Moody's noted, however, the bank had a formidable retail franchise in California that continued to generate strong earnings. The bank, traditionally seen as an excellent performer, was subjected to a tough inspection by US bank regulators last December. This led to unusually heavy bad debt provisions, especially in the commercial real estate loan portfolio. Its 1991 net earnings were almost wiped out following some Dollars 700m of fourth-quarter bad debt provisions.</p>

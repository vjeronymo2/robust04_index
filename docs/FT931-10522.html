			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (14): Restoring output to pre-war levels - Oil and gas industries IRAN is on schedule to achieve its target of 4.5m barrels a day (b/d) sustainable oil production by the end of March, according to Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh, the minister of oil. If achieved, it will represent a substantial step in the five-year effort by Iran to repair its war-damaged oil facilities, introduce new capacity and bring output closer to the 6m b/d level achieved before the revolution. 'We do not look at reaching 4.5m b/d on a sustainable basis by next March as expanding our output capacity. It is merely restoring our pre-war production levels', said Mr Aghazadeh in a message aimed at the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 'Every month sees an increase in our production capacity.' Current efforts by members of Opec to agree production cuts in order to support weakening crude prices will help to determine Iran's actual production levels which the minister put at 3.8m b/d in November, 3.5m-3.6m b/d in December and 'no more than 3.5m b/d in January'. Of those totals, some 350,000 b/d is on average produced from Iran's offshore wells and the remainder from onshore sources. The return by Iran to oil production levels closer to those of 14 years ago is just one part of a programme designed also to invest heavily in natural gas, to expand refinery capacity and to improve the products distribution network within the country. The investment made already and that required for the next stages of the programme is substantial and will have increasingly to involve foreign companies, an issue of continuing sensitivity for the Iranian parliament. Mr Aghazadeh stressed that so far the amount of foreign investment had been relatively modest because the majority of the work had been carried out in onshore areas. 'The only part which is very costly for us is the reconstruction of the offshore facilities, because that is being carried out by foreign contractors. In order to reach 4.5m b/d some Dollars 3.5bn has been spent. But the remaining portion still to be spent is in rials.' He added that negotiations were continuing with foreign companies over the development of the Sirri and Balal oilfields in the Gulf and the North Pars and South Pars gas fields. 'We have quite a few foreign companies that have presented their offers to us for the development of those fields. We are now negotiating with them over terms and I hope we will be able in the near future to conclude those talks. The companies will get their return on investment through buy-back arrangements', said Mr Aghazadeh. He added that it was only to be expected that negotiations would be protracted because of the limitations imposed by the Iranian constitution on agreements with foreign companies. 'For instance, we will not accept any production sharing and we will not grant any equity to foreign companies in our oil fields', said Mr Aghazadeh. Even so, he believed that negotiations would be completed shortly. The requirement for investment from overseas is likely to be even greater once Iran moves on to the next stage of development which will concentrate on natural gas and refineries. Sums ranging up to Dollars 30bn over the next two decades have been suggested as necessary if Iran is to carry out its plans for meeting future additional domestic energy requirements with gas rather than oil. Ideally it would like to hold domestic oil consumption to about 1.3m b/d. 'We have prepared a study for the government on the outlook for natural gas for the next 15 years. We looked at many questions, such as domestic demand, volumes needed for gas injection programmes in the oilfields, and the actual sources which would be developed,' said Mr Aghazadeh. 'In this context of supply and demand, we estimate that we will have a surplus of some 50bn cubic metres per year to be exported, which gives us a very bright future.' Iran is involved in talks with Ukraine and a consortium of European companies over ways of transporting the gas, either through a pipeline or in a liquified form. Officials say the plan is for Iranian gas to be supplied to Ukraine and then for the pipeline to be extended into eastern Europe. If all went smoothly, Iran could envisage being able to export up to 50bn cu m of gas a year soon after the turn of the century. Even bigger question marks surround Iran's requirements for additional refining capacity to meet domestic demand. Given the already long queue for access to limited foreign currency earnings, Iran is probably going to have to look to the private sector for funds. Interest has been expressed already by the Bonyad Mostazafan religious foundation. However Mr Aghazadeh dismisses the idea. 'As long as domestic fuel prices remain so low compared to international prices there will not be any seriously interested party from the private sector wanting to invest', he said. 'The economics for this kind of operation is simply not favourable.' Making it more favourable, by raising local fuel prices, is, the minister stressed, 'a very sensitive issue which depends on the economic and social problems of society'. A swift resolution to Iran's present problems over short-term foreign debt will undoubtedly help its ability to attract international finance. But only the politically courageous implementation of structural economic reforms will allow Iran to take more effective domestic advantage of its single greatest asset.</p>

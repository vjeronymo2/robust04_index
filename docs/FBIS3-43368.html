Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama said  the case is already known by President of the Republic Joaquim  Chissano and that it involves a large quantity of weapons. The  Renamo leader said this yesterday afternoon in Maringue, the  general headquarters of his movement, at a news conference to  mark the new year.    [Begin Dhlakama recording] I can give you an example of  weapons being taken to South Africa with the knowledge of  President of the Republic Joaquim Chissano. General Fondo has  been involved in the sale of weapons to South Africa and these  people then try to (?blame) Renamo. Large quantities of weapons  are taken in trucks and sold to South Africa and everyone is  aware of this [words indistinct].    Frelimo has always acted in bad faith. Frelimo officials  have always been warmongering and it was with the war that they  [words indistinct]. It was with the war that they maintained  and continue to maintain themselves in power. Many of them  [words indistinct] that the war has ended. They know that they  can lose elections [words indistinct]. I even believe that  there are still many Marxists in Frelimo, who are not (?aware)  that the war has ended. One of them is Marcelino dos Santos  [Assembly of the Republic chairman]. For example, you must have  heard recently [words indistinct] in the Assembly of the  Republic [words indistinct]. We have in fact reached the  conclusion that some of these people did not want the war to  end. There is a recent example [words indistinct] in Nampula  [words indistinct] and it was not just propaganda. We caught a  police sergeant, who was hidden in a hall where [words  indistinct]. He was there. Two of them were there with  pistols. There was also the case of [words indistinct] he will  try to hide but we know, we have proof, that he has a plan  [words indistinct] in Maputo. [end recording]    Meanwhile, the Renamo leader expressed satisfaction with the  political situation in the country and the steps made so far in  implementing the General Peace Accord, despite the observed  delays.</p>

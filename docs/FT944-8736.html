			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Ukrainian virtue The Ukrainian parliament made the world a safer place this week, by endorsing the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Kiev's decision to renounce nuclear weapons categorically is further proof that Ukraine sees economic reform - rather than nuclear stockpiles - as its best guarantee of enduring independence. When President Leonid Kuchma visits Washington next week it will be America's turn to return the favour by giving Ukraine appropriate financial assistance. Although parliament voted for the treaty by an overwhelming margin, it was not an easy decision. Mr Kuchma himself has undergone a remarkable metamorphosis: the former director of the Soviet Union's largest nuclear missile factory gave the keynote address which secured the parliamentary endorsement. Mr Kuchma's change of heart is directly connected to his decision earlier this year to implement a radical reform programme. Ukraine's leaders have belatedly realised that nationalist rhetoric is too weak a glue to hold together a fragile new state. On the strength of its reform plan, Ukraine last month concluded its first deal with the International Monetary Fund. Mr Kuchma has begun to prove he is in earnest by administering some of the most unpopular measures demanded by that deal: price increases, exchange rate unification and land privatisation. Renouncing nuclear weapons was the logical next step. As Mr Kuchma told parliamentarians, it is another sign that Ukraine is choosing to forgo what he described as the 'illusion' of security offered by nuclear weapons in favour of the more lasting stability which only economic prosperity can bring. Of course, ratification of the treaty also means that Mr Kuchma will be bringing the White House the best news it has had all month. President Bill Clinton, who orchestrated the agreement earlier this year in which Kiev first promised to give up nuclear weapons, can now claim credit for disarming Ukraine. Ukraine's accession also improves the chances of an indefinite extension of the treaty next year. Yet Mr Clinton should not forget about Kiev, now that the worrying prospect of a nuclear Ukraine has disappeared. By endorsing the treaty, Ukraine has given up its most powerful bargaining chip. Mr Kuchma is gambling his country's survival on successful economic reforms. The west should do everything in its power to improve his odds. Right now that means offering Ukraine substantial financial aid.</p>

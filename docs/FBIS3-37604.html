			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unidentified correspondent: "Directive-Like Tone </F> Does Not Befit the Duma"]    [Text] Our correspondent asked Gennadiy Seleznev, deputy  chairman of the State Duma Committee for Information Policy and  Communications, to comment on the decree it has adopted "On  Coverage of the Activity of the State Duma and Federal Assembly  by Federal Television and Radio Companies."    "In my view, the Duma deputies have made a reasonable  decision by not obliging anyone to cover the legislators'  activity in a directive-like tone. That would violate the Law  on the Mass Media. The Duma has agreed to adopt the `Ostankino'  Russian State Television and Radio Company and the Russia  channel's offer to cover the deputies' work within the programs  that already exist. Total coverage time will be at least two  hours a week. This procedure will stay in place until the  federal law `On the Procedure for Covering the Activity of  Russian Federation Organs of State Power in State Mass Media' is  adopted. Note carefully that in the future the law will deal  with the regulation of coverage of all branches of power,  including the undeservedly forgotten judiciary.    "The Duma will have its own press service and press center  and will actively operate the `RTV-Parliament' studio and  equipment complex.    "As of 28 February, our committee has been scheduled to  conduct parliamentary hearings on the extremely topical issue of  `The Economic Position of the Mass Media in Russia.' It is  hoped that we will jointly be able to find ways to ensure the  mass media's survival."</p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / German insurance plan in disarray CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl's plans to build a new pillar of Germany's social security system in time for next year's elections were in disarray at the weekend, after compromise talks with the opposition Social Democrats were abandoned. The project for a new multi-billion D-Mark insurance scheme to pay for residential care for the old and handicapped, to be jointly financed by contributions from workers and employers, faces opposition from business and trade unions. Hopes for a cross-party consensus were dashed by the liberal Free Democratic party (FDP), the minority partners in the ruling coalition, which rejected on Friday any suggestion of renegotiation with the opposition SPD. Mr Kohl has called the leaders of the ruling coalition for talks today in an attempt to end the dispute, which is beginning to threaten the government's cohesion. The cancellation of negotiations with the SPD led to bitter recriminations, above all from Mr Norbert Blum, the employment minister from Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and Mr Rudolf Dressler, deputy parliamentary leader of the SPD. Both accused the FDP of breaking its promise to discuss the issue. At its heart is a promise by the government to compensate German employers for their extra contributions towards the cost of the nursing care scheme - estimated at DM13bn (Dollars 8bn) in the first year. The present proposal, already before the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, proposes cancelling one day of paid sick leave for workers, thereby reducing the guaranteed payment from three days to two. That has aroused opposition from the SPD and trade unions, who have announced a 'hot autumn' of protest against the plan. The employers oppose the entire public insurance scheme, saying it should remain a private, voluntary scheme until the economy recovers enough to pay for it. They reject the compensation plan as inadequate, arguing that it would amount to a one-off reduction in their costs, whereas the price of residential care, with a steadily ageing population and ever-shrinking workforce, would increase rapidly. Without a cross-party consensus, the plan will be condemned to negotiations in a conciliation committee between the Bundestag, where the coalition has a majority, and the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament where the SPD has a majority. That would delay the plan and leave the final solution in doubt. The apparently interminable debate over how to finance the nursing care scheme has already been a significant factor in fuelling popular discontent with the political establishment.</p>

No official reason was given, but this was a particularly  difficult year for the aeronautical industry (LE MONDE, December  28, 1993). Overall, Airbus Industrie is said to have received  some 59 order cancellations in 1993 and a total of 38 orders,  yielding a negative balance of 21 aircraft. In 1992, the  European aircraft manufacturer had a better year, with 136  orders for 95 cancellations.    The manufacturer was particularly hard hit by order  cancellations from the Irish company GPA (Guiness Peat  Aviation). Last May, GPA was saved from bankruptcy by the U.S.  group General Electric. In September, it announced a drastic  restructuring plan. Airbus was more affected than Boeing, as its  firm orders dropped from 91 aircraft (for delivery during  1993-2000) to only six to be delivered in 1997 and 1998. After  this cancellation, the Toulouse-based consortium recalled that  it still had orders for a total of 55 aircraft--mostly A-320s  and A-321s--to be delivered to GPA by the year 2000.    These mediocre results are due to poor economic conditions  for airlines. Following an all-time high deficit of $4.8 billion  in 1992, based on figures published by the IATA [International  Air Transport Association], their losses are expected to total  $2.4 billion this year. The overcapacity crisis drove airlines  into a price war. In this context, they drew up drastic fleet  and staff restructuring plans. Airbus Industrie is obviously not  the only manufacturer to bear the brunt of these. For its part,  Boeing announced a few weeks ago that it had received 226 orders  during the year, but 214 airplanes were retired.    Nevertheless, the European manufacturer's deliveries  proceeded at a satisfactory pace. They should account for 138  aircraft in 1993, compared with 157 in 1992, which was a very  good year. However, sales should be higher in 1993 than in 1992  ($7.6 billion) because of the delivery of long-haul A-340 jumbo  jets.    On the bright side, 1993 was marked by the introduction of  the Airbus A-319 carrier at the Le Bourget Show. The A-340 was  set into service in March 1993 at Lufthansa and Air France, and  the first A-330 was delivered to its launching airline, Air  Inter, in December.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Asen Asenov and Diana Tsankova] </F>   [Text] The number of students on strike at Sofia's St.  Kliment Okhridski University is steadily increasing. Following  yesterday's meeting of the Academic Council, about 7,000  intellectuals, professors, and citizens signed a petition in  support of the student strike. Today, students from the  University of National and World Economics joined in supporting  the demands of their Sofia University colleagues and will  probably issue their own declaration.    The strike committee will set up a group of experts to  prepare a standpoint regarding the strike declaration, including  item 1, which demands that 2 percent of the GDP should be  allocated to science and education. The protest has already  produced an international reaction: a NEW YORK TIMES journalist  has interviewed the striking students.    Minister of Science and Education Marko Todorov issued an  official statement on the student strike, in which he said that  it is political in nature and that the demand for 2 percent of  the GDP to be allocated to education and science cannot be  satisfied.    The sit-in at the university continues. At a general meeting  tomorrow, professors and staff of the university are expected to  declare their own strike, because more than 50 percent of the  signatures required have already been collected.    Today Prime Minister Lyuben Berov received representatives  of  six student organizations, who expressed disquiet regarding the  occupation of Sofia University and the politicization of the  strike. They called upon the executive power to help to ensure  that the rights of students who want to take their examinations  and not interrupt the study session are not restricted. The  prime minister undertook to speak to Sofia University Rector  Professor Lalov, asking him to bring under control the tension  that is developing between the striking students and those not  on strike.</p>

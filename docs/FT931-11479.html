			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Suppliers keep calm over Daf's problems - The belief that the truckmaker might not disappear completely THE decision by Daf, the Anglo-Dutch truck and van manufacturer, to seek protection from its creditors caused some confusion and mixed reactions among European suppliers of a wide variety of components. As union officials in the UK warned that jobs in the component supply industry could be at risk, some suppliers immediately halted deliveries to Leyland Daf in the UK, bringing production at its factories in Preston and Birmingham almost to a halt. But companies generally reacted calmly over the long-term implications of the decision - even if they did halt supplies yesterday. While big automotive customers worldwide have been reducing the number of suppliers with which they deal, the suppliers have also been careful, where possible, to avoid being too dependent on any one client. Ultimately, the importance of Daf and its market position - it is truck market leader in the UK with a 25 per cent share - has convinced some suppliers that the company and its truck manufacturing will not disappear. 'I can't believe a package won't be put together to retain the most successful parts of the business,' said one international supplier. Companieswhich continued deliveries to Daf explained their action by saying either that the immediate future of manufacturing at the truck maker was unclear or that they were not in a position to halt supplies because of their own problems in the recession. One of Daf's most important suppliers, Thyssen Stahl, said it was continuing to make deliveries to Daf in the Netherlands. 'We have no plan to stop being a supplier,' said a spokesman for Germany's biggest steel producer. 'I can't imagine that any steel company could do that at the moment.' Daf, in comparison with other truckmakers, is a relatively integrated producer, with a big share of components made in-house. 'Its policy tends to be 'make' rather than 'buy',' said Mr Edward Hadas of Morgan Stanley. Daf makes most of its engines itself, although engines for its 45 Series of small trucks are supplied by US-owned Cummins Engine, and Peugeot-Talbot make diesel engines for Daf vans. Peterborough-based Perkins also makes engines for the 200 Series van, and Eagle engines for the Daf 'Drops' military vehicle. Transmissions come largely from ZF, the big German producer, while axles are mainly made in-house at Glasgow and at Westerlo, Belgium. Cabs for its UK-built light truck are supplied by Motor Panels, a long-established UK supplier of automotive bodies, which is part of the Mayflower Corporation, a UK holding company. Cabs for its medium and heavy trucks are made in-house in Belgium. Other leading suppliers to Leyland Daf include GKN, the big UK vehicle parts group, which supplies drive-line components for trucks, as well as some axles. There are also smaller component suppliers serving Daf's manufacturing plants, such as Washwood Heath in east Birmingham. Suppliers were yesterday deciding on the best immediate steps to take. At Motor Panels, deliveries have been suspended until the situation is clarified, said Mr Merrick Taylor, chairman of Mayflower's Automotive Products Group. He could not envisage a situation where Daf would just disappear. 'People will be keen to pick up parts of the business. To have such a large share in a very important market is very attractive.' Cummins, which makes Daf-badged engines for the 45 Series at Darlington, said Leyland Daf was a 'fairly major' customer in the automotive area. But Cummins pointed out that the impact of Daf's decision was not quite the same for a broadly-based supplier, such as Cummins, as for companies that served only the automotive industry.</p>

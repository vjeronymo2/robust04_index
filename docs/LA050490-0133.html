			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> SCHOOL BUDGET CUT PROPOSALS PROTESTED  </P> <P> Parents, students and teachers turned up in droves at a Thursday budget hearing  to protest proposed cuts to the school district's nationally recognized fine  arts program.  </P> <P> The cuts and others are due to a loss of up to $3 million in state funds from  the Irvine Unified School District's $84-million annual budget, said David  Brown, district superintendent.  </P> <P> "We can't afford to provide our students with less than they need to succeed in  school," said Annie Chang, a 14-year-old violinist. "We cannot afford to reduce  funds for music education in our elementary schools." Items on the proposed  list of cuts, compiled by a budget task force, are not required under teacher  contracts or by state law, said Barbara Dresel, a task force member and  president of the Irvine Teachers Assn.  </P> <P> In addition to fine arts, these include business services, district office  operations, transportation, athletic programs, food services and  extracurricular activities.  </P> <P> "We seem to have an agreement from all sectors of the task force that we want  to keep the cuts away from the classroom and everyday programs," Dresel said.  </P> <P> Sizable fine arts budget cuts are proposed only at the elementary school level.  </P> <P> If approved, they would mean that instrumental music lessons held twice a week  would be offered once a week and visual arts lessons given six times a year  would only be given three times per year, said Jack Vaughn, coordinator of the  fine arts program.  </P> <P> The task force is scheduled to present its recommendations for cuts from the  overall list to the school board on May 15. A special board meeting on the  reduced list is scheduled for May 21. WENDY PAULSON and DANICA KIRKA  </P></p>

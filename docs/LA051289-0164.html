			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE  </P> <P> Some people might have been surprised earlier this week to see a sharp drop in  home sales reported in Orange County in April. But in fact home sales have been  dropping all year, says TRW Real Estate Market Information.  </P> <P> Last year saw an unusually large number of sales, so this year's slowing may be  little more than the market catching its breath, say experts.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Orange County registered the second largest drop of the 25  counties tracked by TRW for the first 3 months of the year.  </P> <P> The number of new and used houses and condominiums sold dropped 10.7%, TRW  said, making Orange County next to last before San Mateo County, where sales  fell 19.9%.  </P> <P> At the other end of the scale, Riverside led all counties with a 44.3% increase  in sales, and San Bernardino was fourth with an 18.5% increase.  </P></p>

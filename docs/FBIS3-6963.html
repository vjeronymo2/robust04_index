North Korean Ambassador Chu Chang-chun made this remark at a  news conference on 23 March and threatened that the United  States should not forget their lesson learned from the Korea war  on 25 June. He denounced the U.S. Clinton administration for  attempting to create international pressure against North Korea.    Ambassador Chu said that such an act by the United States  will contribute to only hastening the war and stressed that if  the United States does not immediately give up its attempt,  there will be only a war.    The Korean Central News Agency monitored in Tokyo reported  that North Korea is fully prepared to answer dialogue with  dialogue and war with war. Prior to this report, Pyongyang  radio monitored in Tokyo warned that North Korea is  simultaneously preparing for both dialogue and war. It also  denounced the United States for continuing to stifle North Korea.</p>

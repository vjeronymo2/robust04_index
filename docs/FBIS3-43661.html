In other words,  the authorities are forbidding certain opposition members to  leave the country. Mr. Pierre Louis Agondjo-Okawe, leader of  the Gabonese Party of Progress, explains. He spoke to Ghislaine  Dupont:    [Begin recording] [Agondjo] We are, in effect, forbidden to  leave the country, and we regard this as a very serious measure.  It violates freedom of movement; it violates the charter of  fundamental freedoms in Gabon, and it even violates the  constitution. It is very, very serious because we are moving  slowly towards a return to dictatorship.    [Dupont] Do you think that you are under house arrest?    [Agondjo] It practically boils down to that; it is  practically house arrest.    [Dupont] What do you think the authorities are afraid of?    [Agondjo] I think the authorities are afraid of the truth.  They are afraid that if we go abroad we might tell the  international community about what is really happening in Gabon,  in particular what happened on 5 December 1993. [end recording]    That was Mr. Agondjo, the leader of the Gabonese Party of  Progress. The coordinating body of the opposition of Gabon met  today. It is to continue its consultations tomorrow to decide  on the response it will give to the Libreville government.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Summary" of interview with Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu </F> by Fernando Gutierrez; place and date not given]    [Text] [Gutierrez] What are the results of the Uruguay  Round of GATT for our country?    [Abreu] One side of the negotiation that concerns Uruguay  has  to do with the multilateral issues dealing with tariff  reductions. The main impact of this Round was an average  40-percent tariff reduction.    Yet there are two additional very important circumstances.  One is that the majority of current nontariff measures will be  converted to tariffs. This more clearly shows the protection  measures used by each country. The second is that this  commercial opening will apply to other items that were  previously outside GATT regulations, like textiles, services,  and farm products.    In this area Uruguay will benefit from a reduction of farm  export subsidies, to be gradually implemented over a six-year  period, both in the subsidized volumes (which will be reduced by  21 percent) and in the budget allocations for financing  production (which will be reduced by 36 percent). This does not  meet all of Uruguay's expectations, but it should be noted that  progress was made, especially because the farm sector was  included in the negotiations.    The other remarkable fact is that GATT will become a new  institution, the World Trade Organization, which will provide  the institutional framework to guarantee the fulfillment of the  Uruguay Round agreements.    [Gutierrez] Will this new institution be able to prevent big  powers from failing to comply with regulations, as happened  several times with the GATT?    [Abreu] Yes, because this agreement was signed and will be  ratified by Congress, following the standard practice of the  majority of democratic countries. This entails a legal certainty  that GATT did not have.    This institutional stability will be also reflected in other  areas: One is the settlement of controversies. The new system  sets forth that the panels in charge of studying controversies  will operate automatically, and the deadlines for completion of  their work is much tighter than at present.    This is beneficial for less developed countries; like the  compensation for the closing of the oilseed market, when we  waited eight years for compensation through a new meat quota.  With the new system, this case can be resolved in no more than  one year.    [Gutierrez] At the final Uruguay Round meeting you said that  the progress that has been so far made will be meaningless if  the commercial opening is not intensified in the future. Do you  think such intensification has a chance?    [Abreu] The Uruguay Round is the conclusion of a  consolidation stage for tariff reduction and for the inclusion  of new subjects on the agenda. It also entails an effort that  will project itself in future negotiation rounds.    [Gutierrez] There is then no danger of the current situation  becoming frozen, right?    [Abreu] No, I believe relations will be very dynamic.  Continuation of protectionist policies can be harmful for  countries that cannot adjust themselves, because of the rapid  reaction of competitive levels from other countries. There is  not much chance for protectionism. There are chances for  transforming the country following the demands of the  international market.    [Gutierrez] What will be the negotiating strategy in the  future? Will the Cairns Group continue to pressure European  countries?    [Abreu] The Cairns Group is having internal problems because  concessions were made seeking to divide it and discriminate  against countries whose exports are in competition.    The issue will be on the agenda of the Group's next meeting,  which will be held in Uruguay.    Concerning Uruguayan strategy, I want to emphasize the  significance of our achievements, like the 2,000-ton Hilton  quota and the fact that after failing to arrange significant  sheep meat sales on the European market, we found other markets  like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, or Jordan.    This shows that bilateral negotiations have been positive  because they opened and diversified the market.    [Gutierrez] Does that mean that the time has come to  emphasize negotiations with nontraditional markets?    [Abreu] Uruguay wants to diversify products and markets. The  economy of a country that has a very narrow range of exports is  directly affected by price fluctuations.    It is also true that our exporting capacity does not permit  too much diversification, but since 45 percent of our exports go  to Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and 12 percent to the  United States, we must try to avoid dependence. This is a  permanent strategy that small countries should implement on a  day-to-day basis. Coordination is necessary between the state  and the private sector to control the new variables of the  international economy.    It is therefore necessary to adopt a different strategy with  which we can have some degree of predictability.</p>

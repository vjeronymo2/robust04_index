			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: VW on course for full-year profit after strong quarter Volkswagen climbed further back into profits in the third quarter, with the benefits of rising demand and its tough action to cut labour and components costs almost wiping out the loss made at the start of the year. The German motor group said the after-tax loss for the first nine months was down to DM73m (Dollars 47.1m) from DM1.53bn in the same period of 1993. Its third-quarter net profit of DM136m compared with DM133m in the second quarter, and a loss of DM342m in the first three months. In the third quarter of 1993, it made a net profit of DM70m. For the full year, VW said it expected to 'at least break even'. In 1993, it made a group loss of DM1.9bn. 'The underlying trend is basically very positive,' said Mr Stephen Reitman, motors analyst at UBS. He forecast fourth-quarter profits of more than DM400m, making full-year earnings of around DM340m. Under the uncompromising leadership of Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW - whose group operations include Audi, Seat in Spain and Skoda in Czechoslovakia - has striven to bring down the cost of labour and of bought-in parts and materials. Despite the improved figures, however, the shares closed DM4.50 lower at DM455 yesterday. VW said turnover in January-September was 4.3 per cent higher at DM58.8bn. Unit sales rose 6.7 per cent to 2.3m vehicles; in Germany, they slipped by 3.4 per cent to 662,500 units, but abroad they showed an 11.4 per cent increase to 1.64m. In western Europe, excluding Germany, deliveries were up 6 per cent to 857,000 vehicles, with a 22.5 per cent improvement, to 226,000, in North America. Because of model changes in Germany, third-quarter turnover was flat. Mr Reitman said the July-September result showed clearly the impact of the drive to cut component costs - spearheaded by the controversial Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua - and of the reduced working week.</p>

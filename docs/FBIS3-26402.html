"By approving the Lisbon Protocol, Ukraine is committed to  accede to the Nonproliferation Treaty in the shortest possible  time," said White House Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers.    The U.S. comments came after Ukrainian lawmakers voted 260-3  yesterday to remove conditions they had imposed for approving  the start one treaty under which Kiev is required to give up all  its nuclear warheads.    Under the agreement, Ukraine, now the world's third nuclear  power, is to surrender more than 1,600 nuclear warheads  inherited from the former Soviet Union.    "Although the lawmakers voted not to join the nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty for the time being, their support for  start one and the Lisbon Protocol advances the security interest  of both the United States and Ukraine and represents a major  non- proliferation achievement," Myers said.</p>

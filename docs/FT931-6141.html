			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / DTI warns of costs risk to N Sea oil THE GOVERNMENT yesterday warned North Sea oil and gas operators that they must cut costs or face a threat to the long-term viability of the offshore industry. Now that the heyday of North Sea discoveries is over, the government is keen to maintain the cost-effectiveness of an industry which still invests more than Pounds 10bn a year and employs 335,000 people. The concerns are contained in a Department of Trade and Industry report which highlights the changing nature of the offshore industry. Future oil and gas finds will be concentrated in much smaller fields, the report says. The industry must reduce its overheads if it is to exploit these finds economically. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said: 'Many of the recommendations will be difficult, requiring innovative thinking and hard work. But the challenge is to ensure they are delivered. What is at stake could be a secure future for the UK continental shelf.' The report makes 29 recommendations, focusing on reduction of paperwork, streamlining of equipment specifications and greater operator co-operation. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said: 'If the UK continental shelf doesn't remain competitive, slowly - but inexorably - investment funds will flow to other oil provinces and the infrastructure will move elsewhere.' The report says that until 1980 the average size of discoveries in the North Sea exceeded 150m barrels of oil equivalent (which includes gas). Since then the average size has been below 50m barrels. Oil prices remain at their lowest level for 20 years. Government statistics show that expenditure on offshore oil operations rose in real terms from Pounds 2.50 a barrel to more than Pounds 4 a barrel in the three years to 1991, although it is believed to have dropped to Pounds 3.60 a barrel last year. 'Nevertheless, with oil currently trading at Pounds 10 to Pounds 12 per barrel these costs pose a significant threat to the future viability and profitability of the North Sea,' the report states. Mr Eggar stressed the importance of companies working together, for example, in partnership contracts which share the risks and rewards of developments between oil companies and contractors.

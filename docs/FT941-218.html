			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / World Trade News: China acts to phase out import quotas China has announced plans to phase out quota restrictions on most categories of imports by 1997 as part of a continuing effort to satisfy requirements for resumption of membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation (Moftec) said yesterday a removal of quotas imposed on some 50 import items would be carried out in three-stages. 'Within the next three years China will gradually cancel licenses for most of the existing 53 categories that still require an import license,' the ministry said. In the past five years, an official noted, China had progressively cancelled import quotas and reduced tariffs on a wide range of items. Western officials, responsible for monitoring China's efforts to comply with requirements for Gatt entry, described the latest announcement as a 'further step forward', but said China still had 'some way to go.' At a meeting in Geneva earlier this month, Gatt members expressed support for China's re-entry, but also made clear they would require further evidence of trade liberalisation. Western countries are calling for greater transparency in Chinese trade regulations, improved market access to China for foreign service companies such as banks, and more commitment in combating infringements against intellectual property rights. China was a founding member of Gatt, but withdrew after the Communists came to power in 1949. Beijing has been seeking to re-enter the organisation since 1986. It has made no secret of its desire to become a founder member of the World Trade Organisation when it supercedes Gatt in 1995. China was an active participant in the Uruquay talks, and one of its senior trade officials will travel to Morocco next month to sign the Uruguay Round package. AP Moller, the Danish shipping group which operates one of the world's largest global container-shipping operations under the Maersk Line name, has been given permission to set up in China, the group said yesterday, reports Hilary Barnes from Copenhagen.</p>

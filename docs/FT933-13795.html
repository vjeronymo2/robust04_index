			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Weighty dossier on EBRD cost over-run JUST before midnight on Thursday the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's audit committee delivered to the board of directors its report on the bank's excessive spending. It beat the deadline, set when the report was commissioned on May 10, by a matter of seconds. That was no mean feat - the report is two inches thick and had to address some very delicate issues, notably the responsibility of Mr Jacques Attali, who quit his job as EBRD president yesterday, for the bank's excesses. On the Pounds 66m spent by the bank on fitting out its new headquarters at No 1 Exchange Square, the report says: 'Substantial cost savings could have been achieved if there had been better planning and control.' It adds: 'The committee was particularly concerned that there were areas of the fit-out where value for money was not the primary consideration.' A detailed analysis carried out for the committee by consultants from Coopers &amp; Lybrand says that the cost per square metre of the headquarters, most of which was fitted out in 1992, was Pounds 1,524, compared with Pounds 650 for a typical UK public sector building, Pounds 1,150 for a UK commercial operation and Pounds 1,260 for a UK financial institution. However, the EBRD has a number of special facilities, such as a high-quality auditorium for press conferences and an enormous boardroom, complete with high-tech translation and video facilities. The report also points out that fitting out costs at 'other international financial institutions in North America and Europe have cost in the range of Pounds 300 per square metre to Pounds 600 per square metre'. Among the items identified by Coopers as contributing to the high fit-out cost are marble cladding and flooring for Pounds 1.65m, a hi-tech suspended ceiling for Pounds 5.7m and a specially dyed carpet for Pounds 1.31m. The committee says that part of the reason for the excessive costs was that 'the normal chain of command was not used in this project' and that the project was handled by an ad hoc team headed by Mr Pierre Pissaloux, director of Mr Attali's cabinet. It says Mr Attali has 'rejected suggestions that he was involved'. However, the Coopers report says Mr Attali gave opinions when requested on design options and had frequent meetings with one of the architects, Mr Jean-Louis Berthet, at which, according to Mr Berthet, design matters were discussed. Mr Berthet is a founder of Berthet et Pochy, which did much of the architectural work on No 1 Exchange Square as part of the Anglo-French joint venture, Berthet Pochy Sidell Gibson. Berthet et Pochy was first contacted to do some work for the EBRD, on its previous headquarters, at the suggestion of Mr Attali. The audit committee notes that 'the appointment of the architects did not follow the banks' rules nor was it based on good commercial practice: in fact the procurement procedure was not competitive.' It continues: 'The total fees paid to BPSG (of Pounds 3.2m) are high and the committee was not given sound reasons that can justify why BPSG were chosen.' The committee has also made recommendations designed to improve the bank's budget controls in general: That cost over-runs beyond pre-established thresholds should be reported to the board and thoroughly justified; That budget performance should be assessed by relating costs to the amount of business which the bank is doing. Separately it proposes a sweeping review of corporate governance, or the management structure and responsibilities of executives and directors. It suggests that the role of each vice-president be reconsidered and annotated job descriptions be prepared, to prevent a recurrence of the management vacuum on the headquarters project, for which no executive took overall responsibility. Finally the committee looked at the procedures for the control of expenditure. It was particularly concerned by the Pounds 1.4m spent on flights in private jets, most of them arranged by Mr Attali, and also the FFr5m (Pounds 570,000) of French government funds given to the bank by the French government to pay for a Paris office, whose existence was not notified to the board. Other concerns are the Pounds 358,611 spent on artwork, which might 'give an impression of extravagance' and also the 'significant amounts of expenditure of a private nature or for which no supporting invoices have been provided' which were charged to Mr Attali's corporate credit card in 1992 and 1993. Since June 1993 Mr Attali reimbursed expenses totalling Pounds 30,431 which had been incurred since January 1992. The committee says it is 'generally satisfied that the bank's system for authorising and controlling routine expenditures is sound'. However, it is concerned about the authorisation of expenditure incurred by Mr Attali and some members of his office. It proposes reforming the procedure whereby the expenses of the bank's president and members of the presidential office are authorised by direct subordinates of the president. It wants such expenditure to be authorised in future by the vice-president in charge of finance. However, the committee concludes that 'proper expenditure control requires more than simply sound procedures, but a general ethos of prudence and probity throughout the organisation. Responsibility for establishing this ethos rests with the president and the board of directors'.  -------------------------------------------------------    Estimates for fitting out offices (Pounds per sq m)  -------------------------------------------------------                                  EBRD      Typical high                         specification     specification  ------------------------------------------------------- Air conditioning                  172               110 Ceilings                           71                42 Lighting                           74                20 Carpet                             44                32 Doors                           39.83             31.73  ------------------------------------------------------- Source: Coopers &amp; Lybrand report  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> British authorities are investigating the nation's biggest arms deal following  bribery allegations over $34 billion in contracts with Saudi Arabia, the  Observer newspaper said. It said investigators are looking at claims that huge  commission payments, alleged to have been made to British Aerospace agents,  inflated the export sale price of Tornado fighter-bombers. Government officials  were unavailable for comment. British Aerospace concluded an $8.5-billion deal  with Saudi Arabia in 1986 to supply military aircraft and weapons systems. Last  July, Britain signed a second agreement estimated at up to $26 billion.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 800 IN BREA TO BRAINSTORM REDEVELOPMENT PLAN  </P> <P> About 800 Brea community representatives will join city staff members and urban  planners in brainstorming sessions to plan an extensive redevelopment of  downtown Brea, officials said Friday.  </P> <P> In a press conference announcing the redevelopment project, City Manager Frank  Benest called the partnership between residents and professional planners  unique and said it would "develop a downtown that isn't anywhere else."  </P> <P> The planning session will take place Oct. 6 and 7 and will culminate at the end  of the year in a "vision for the downtown," Mayor Gene A. Leyton said.  </P> <P> After coming up with ideas and proposed improvements, the city staff will meet  with developers in a separate session Oct. 8 to determine which suggestions are  feasible.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Staff for Resources  </P> <P> "It will be a community-driven project with a resource team (the city staff) to  flush out the resources needed," Leyton said.  </P> <P> A planned shopping center on the 22-acre site at the northwest corner of  Imperial Highway and Brea Boulevard will be a main focus of the redevelopment  plans, Benest said. Three "major developers who have shown they have a vision  other than a cookie-cutter shopping center" will create proposals for the  center based on the suggestions from the community, Leyton said.  </P> <P> The companies will submit detailed master plans for the site that also allow  for the future development of an additional 40 acres surrounding the shopping  center.  </P> <P> Trammell Crow Co., Watt Community Developers and the Alexander Haggen Co. will  compete for the project when they display their sketches and designs to the  community on Nov. 29 in the theater of the Brea Civic and Cultural Center.  </P> <P> Benest said a developer would be chosen near the end of the year in a "major  economic decision" for the city.  </P> <P> The plan is to develop a residential type of downtown in the midst of a busy  industrial boulevard, Benest said.  </P> <P> Community members and staff will discuss the possibilities of "multi-use  buildings," which might include both residences and businesses, Benest said.  </P> <P> The actual work is scheduled to begin in March or April of 1990, Leyton said.  </P></p>

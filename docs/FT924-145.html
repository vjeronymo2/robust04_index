			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Confidence is the key to recovery - Andrew Baxter continues the FT's occasional survey of six companies in the engineering sector confidence - is making a faint but detectable reappearance in the engineering sector as a nightmare year in the battle against recession draws to a close. The signals remain mixed, but the six companies in the FT's occasional survey of the engineering sector are beginning to sound a little cheerier about prospects for 1993. Confidence among the six companies and their customers is not exactly flowing back, but is at least trickling back in most cases. Where it is not there are growing expectations that it will do over the next few months. The autumn has brought considerable upheaval for the FT Six and British industry at large. Interest rates have come down by 3 percentage points, Black Wednesday has transformed terms of trade for both exporters and importers, and Chancellor Norman Lamont's Autumn Statement gave industry at least part of what it wanted on infrastructure spending and support for manufacturing investment. All this activity has encouraged the FT Six, but the results at the front line - selling to customers - show that restoring something nebulous and unquantifiable such as confidence needs more than can be achieved simply by moving the financial parameters. Above all, it needs time. Current conditions vary among the six companies, which operate in diverse sectors including machine tools and vehicle parts, gears and construction equipment. In some there has been a very sharp rise in inquiry levels over the past three months, and evidence of more confidence, although not yet converted into orders. Other companies see no signs of a change in UK market sentiment yet, but at least expressed 'confidence about confidence'. Exporters are encouraged by a brighter outlook in US markets, which they are now better able to exploit because of the pound's devaluation. In Europe too, exporters such as Bloxwich are discovering new sales opportunities where doors were previously closed. But there is concern about continental European market conditions, which look to be worsening in some sectors. As with their assessment of the current market, there is some divergence too on the scope or need for further cuts in interest rates. Mr Colin Gaskell, managing director of 600 Group, believes a cut in interest rates of 2 percentage points would have a dramatic effect on confidence. 'There are still people who think that it would not take too much before the Treasury hikes interest rates up - after, all, they did it by 3 per cent in one day,' he says. On the other hand, Mr Gilbert Johnston, deputy chairman of JCB, says: 'You could keep cutting interest rates for ever, but it's just going to take time for confidence to return.' And Mr Peter Barker, chairman of Fenner, believes that, with the stabilisation of sterling, 'the opportunity is there for a 1 point cut early in the new year. This would be another very firm indication that things are on the move'. This is how the six companies have fared over the autumn and their outlook for the next few months: JCB: The biggest British-owned construction equipment group is now producing at about one-third the rate of four years ago, and has reduced its workforce at its Rocester, Staffs, base by about 100 in the past three months. However, the privately-owned company is still making a profit, says Mr Johnston. He sees no sign yet of any change in sentiment in the UK market, but says: 'It must come through, of that we're confident.' Mr Johnston says sterling's devaluation had increased JCB's profit per unit sold in continental Europe, but there had been no real opportunity to increase volume sales. The success of the Edinburgh summit should alleviate the recession on the continent. 'To us, that is probably the biggest problem.' ***** At Senior Engineering Group, Mr John Bell, chief executive of the tubing, boilers and ductwork group, says: 'I do think there is more confidence around in the UK, although there is not too much evidence of this in orders.' But things are beginning to look up in the US market, where Senior is expanding its presence. Devaluation of sterling, meanwhile, has been a two-edged sword, and the current rate against the D-Mark is too low. 'It's this question of balancing the higher cost of imported materials against the benefits from exporting products,' he says. The group is trying to sell its mining equipment business and is closing its large turnkey power generation project side, with the loss of 90 jobs, because of the contraction of the UK coal industry. ***** Fenner, the Hull-based power transmission and industrial conveyor belts group, has also been reshaping its mining equipment business over the past two years, and Mr Peter Barker, chairman, says the size and timescale of the Government's original pit closure plan was breathtaking. Fenner is world leader in conveyor belting used in mines, about half of which goes for export. Mr Barker is now adopting a 'wait and see' attitude while the coal industry's future is being reconsidered. Elsewhere, Mr Barker sees some very faint signs of increased confidence, but cautions that it is too early to see substantial benefits from the interest rate cuts and Autumn Statement initiatives. Devaluation of sterling has produced distinct advantages in markets with dollar-related currencies, although again these do not happen overnight. ***** At Bloxwich Engineering, one of the UK's biggest independent producers of car and truck parts, devaluation has also brought benefits. 'We've seen a lot of interest in our products, particularly from Germany,' says Mr Peter Burton, chief execu-tive. 'They appreciate that Britain ought to be able to supply cheaper than Germany - the difficulty in the past was the price.' Overall, Mr Burton is optimistic. Recent government initiatives have been good for the UK motor industry, he says, and November/December sales, normally flat, have been better than expected. 'We believe there will be an uplift in the new year,' he says - there could even be a marginal increase in emp-loyment next year from the current 400. Mr Burton is particularly pleased by a big development order from Van Technology, the holding company for Renault and Daf's new generation of commercial vehicles. ***** At Posiva, the UK subsidiary of the German gears and drives company, inquiry levels in the last three months were 58 per cent higher than in the previous quarter, says Mr Reg Bricknell, managing director. Orders are up 2 per cent compared with this time last year, despite intensifying competition, and output is down 3 per cent. Devaluation has been a mixed blessing. A lot of the inquiries concern export work, and Posiva has in any case been benefiting from a rise in orders as British manufacturers specify German components to win European export contracts. The UK company imports all its products, however, and Mr Bricknell is now looking at sourcing components such as bearings and castings in the UK on behalf of its parent company, to make the whole product package more competitive. It could even acquire a UK gear manufacturer if one became available. ***** Business is still very slow in the UK, says Mr Gaskell at 600 Group, the big manufacturer and importer of machine tools and materials handling equipment. 'We are just starting to see people nibbling at some of the larger machines,' he says. 'They are inquiring more, but they don't really have the confidence to place big orders.' Mr Gaskell says the government 'has got to say something about its long-term strategy on interest rates to help restore customers' confid-ence. Employment has been reduced by another 100 over recent months, and will be down to about 1,550 by the end of the year - compared with 2,700 two years ago when Mr Gaskell joined the company. Meanwhile, he sees signs of improvement in the US and in Australia, and believes the devaluation of sterling will help the company sell its equipment in Germany.</p>

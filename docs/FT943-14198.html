			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Shares in Ideal Hardware set at 225p Shares in Ideal Hardware, which is coming to market through a placing with institutional investors, were priced yesterday at 225p, valuing the company at Pounds 47.5m. Ideal started trading in January 1987 and has grown into one of the largest independent distributors of computer data storage products. It has between 10 and 15 per cent of the rapidly expanding distribution market in the UK for disc, tape and optical drives. In the year to April 30 pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 4.56m (Pounds 1.58m) on turnover of Pounds 71.8m (Pounds 45.5m). On the basis of historic earnings per share of 15p last year, the placing price represents a p/e of 15. Yesterday the directors said that, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, they expected to pay an interim dividend for the six months to October 31 of 3.4p and to recommend a final dividend of 5.2p. On this basis the shares will have a gross dividend yield of 4.8 per cent, based on the placing price. Under the flotation terms 7.47m shares, representing 35.3 per cent of the issued capital, are being placed by Charterhouse Tilney with institutional and other investors. The placing will raise Pounds 16.8m after expenses, including Pounds 2.5m for the company, which will help fund the purchase of larger premises. Some 6.14m shares are being sold by existing shareholders. Mr Konrad Goess-Saurau, one of the company's founders, is selling the bulk of his 26.2 per cent stake. Following the flotation, executive directors will hold a little less than 53 per cent of the expanded capital. The shares are expected to begin trading next Thursday.</p>

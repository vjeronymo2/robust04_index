			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / International Company News: Benetton juggles debt with new financings BENETTON, Italy's best-known clothing group, is re-jigging some of its short-term borrowings to cut interest costs in a surprise series of innovative financing deals. The company's net borrowings totalled L325bn (Dollars 215.66m) at the end of last year. The group took on a substantial amount of high-cost borrowing when it gained control of four local clothing manufacturers last year. The deals will start next month with a L200bn bond issue targeted at international institutional investors. The issue, which comes with warrants for Benetton shares, will be launched between July 10 and July 15. It will carry a coupon of between 4.5 and 5 per cent. The issue will be followed in September by a L150bn syndicated loan from a pool of Italian banks, and an innovative L100bn domestic bond with warrants indexed to four leading stock indices. The equity-linked issue, similar to other recent transactions, would allow investors to hold the bond but detach the warrants, indexed to the US, German, French and Japanese markets, if share prices were rising sharply. The equity-linked issue, to be launched in October, will have a minimum coupon of 7 per cent, Mr Marco Polo, finance director, said. Last year Benetton managed to shrug off the effects of the downturn in world-wide consumer spending and increase 1992 net profits by 12 per cent, to L184.7bn, on sales of L2,512bn.</p>

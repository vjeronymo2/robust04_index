			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Small companies It is difficult to judge whether the smaller companies bandwagon is still gathering momentum or about to reach terminal velocity. Since the FT-SE Small Cap index has risen by 20 per cent this year - while the FT-SE 100 has stood still - small company shares might be due for a period of consolidation. On most measures, though, the Small Cap is far from overvalued. A yield and price-earnings ratio not far from the market average is if anything modest for this stage of the cycle. If economic recovery is this time led by capital goods industries, the Small Cap stands to benefit from its weighting towards this sector. The worry is that expectations of dividend and earnings growth are ahead of what smaller companies can deliver. That is of concern in the upper reaches of the market too, but small companies in particular will find cash flow squeezed during the early stages of recovery. Dividend growth may be held back as a result. If profits are growing strongly investors will be happy enough. But the onus is now on companies to live up to their promise of sharply higher earnings this year. Lower interest rates will certainly help. Small Cap stocks are generally more highly geared than larger companies. Their cost of borrowing is also linked almost exclusively to short-term interest rates rather than long-term bond yields. If that makes small companies especially sensitive to changes in base rates, though, the best of the gains have already been seen.</p>

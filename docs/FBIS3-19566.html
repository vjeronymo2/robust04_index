			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial report] Writing in the 27 February Athens daily  I KATHIMERINI, Yiannis Loulis comments on the results of two  ALKO polls conducted in December 1993 and one ALKO-MARTEL poll  conducted in January 1994 [no further information].    In the middle of December, respondents were asked to  evaluate  what are the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) government's  three most positive and three most negative initiatives:    Positive    --It is open to a dialogue with social groups: 26.3 percent    --It is (for the moment) less bad than the previous  government 25.4 percent    --It is moderate: 25.3 percent    Negative    --It is not delivering on its preelectoral promises (for  instance, no new  taxes): 33.1 percent    --It lacks a clear program to face economic problems: 25.3  percent    --It adheres to old partisan concepts (for instance, hiring  its followers):  23.2 percent    The ALKO poll was conducted from 5 to 12 December 1993, and  the ALKO-MARTEL poll on 26-27 January [no further information].    Respondents were asked whether they were confident that the  measures announced by the government are sufficient to face the  economic crisis. In December, 23.6 percent expressed confidence,  a figure that increased to 30.3 percent in January. Some 37.8  percent in December and 56.7 percent in January expressed their  lack of confidence, while 35.3 percent in December and 9.3  percent in January said it was too early to judge. A total of  3.4 percent in December and 3.7 percent in January did not know.    According to Loulis, two contrasting views prevailed  following the October 1993 elections that brought PASOK back to  power. The first maintained that the new government's grace  period would be quite brief, given the public's weariness and  increasing impatience. According to the second current of  opinion, the grace period would be rather long, for such was the  public's anger with the previous administration that the PASOK  government would need time to "expunge negative memories." Poll  results show that "the truth lies somewhere inbetween," Loulis  notes. If the grace period seems to be holding, the first  rumblings are being heard. "While the government may not awaken  negative feelings, it is instilling increasingly less confidence  about its abilities," Loulis comments. Therefore, the reason for  the government's reluctance to adopt additional economic  measures is the feeling that the public's tolerance is wearing  thin. In fact, the December poll revealed that 32 percent of the  respondents believe such measures are "necessary," but only 9.7  percent say they are "realistic" and 3.55 percent that they are  "justified." According to the January poll, 18.5 percent view  the measures as "leading to an impasse," 16.5 percent see them  as "harsh," and 14.4 percent as "unfair."</p>

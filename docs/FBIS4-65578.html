			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] President Denktas received Gustave Feissel, the  UN secretary general's deputy special representative, in  connection with the talks that have been held in Vienna.  [passage omitted] In a statement to journalists after the  meeting, Denktas said:    [Begin Denktas recording] Although Feissel attached  importance to the matters we insist on, he maintained that we  should agree to the map. Regarding the access road to Maras  [Varosha], they agreed that we should have authority over that  road. However, they took the approach that we should reach an  agreement with the United Nations to enable the UN officials to  control it. In that case, we would be able to stand around it,  etc. Meanwhile, a partial withdrawal of troops from that area  is being discussed.    They have confirmed that the Nicosia International Airport  [NIA] will have two gates for entry and exit. Nevertheless, we  have not been furnished with a map of the airport thus far.  Consequently, we have not been given enough help to be able to  consider the matter as a whole. We are worried that the Greek  Cypriots may seek a court decision to close down the airport  because of the noise it will make. Statements have been  published in the Greek Cypriot newspapers on that matter. They  say that they will consult their legal advisers and note that  they will be able to obstruct the operation of the airport.    Regarding the use of the NIA by the Greek Cypriot airline,  they have agreed that the Turkish Cypriot airline should also  use that airport under equal conditions. It seems that they  also agree that Turkish Cypriot passenger aircraft using that  airport should be allowed carry their logo.    Yes, a certain degree of progress has been made. However,  the problems have not been resolved. We must have authority to  resolve those problems. We shall hold talks with the Government  and quickly take the matter to the Republican Assembly. They  have said that we do not have much time. They may be right. We  have informed them that we are prepared to convene the Council  of Ministers and the Republican Assembly even during the  religious holidays. [end recording]    A correspondent recalled the proposal to open simultaneously  Maras and the NIA. Denktas replied:    [Begin Denktas recording] A certain degree of progress has  been made on that matter. They have made a proposal that is  close to the one we made some time ago. However, they have not  agreed to our proposal as it stands. They have proposed that  that the Greek Cypriots get access to the northern part of  Dhimokratias Avenue after our direct flights from the NIA begin.  That area will be placed under UN control, but the Greek  Cypriots will have access to it when our direct flights take off  from the NIA and when the routes our aircraft will fly are  established. They are trying to work out the simultaneous use  of Maras and the NIA.    We also have to consider our passports. When we say we shall  fly with our own passports, it means that we shall be issued a  visa on a piece of paper. That is the system that is now  applied when Turkish Cypriots wish to travel to Britain and the  United States. However, we still retain our passports.    Russia was the country that opposed that most. We have not  been able to understand Russia's approach. That country is an  important UN Security Council member. We hoped that Russia too  would agree to the UN Security Council's decision, but Russia  reportedly is opposed to the idea for the time being. Let us  wait and see whether it will change its mind. [end recording]    Another journalist asked Denktas whether or not the UN  secretary general's report will be delayed or an interim report  submitted. Denktas replied as follows:    [Begin Denktas recoding] I do not know. However, I tried to  explain to Mr. Feissel today that there were matters that should  have been discussed. We have held talks on them in Vienna,  which means that not everything was discussed in detail in the  past. That is why we had to meet in Vienna. An effort was made  to have Robert Lamb and Gustave Feissel agree on various issues.  Lamb agreed on various points, but the UN officials objected to  them. Talks were held in goodwill. They have put a kind of  pressure on us by saying that the UN secretary general's report  is ready and the UN secretary general is about to sign it.  However, they have failed to clarify various issues even at the  present time. They have not submitted the map of the NIA. The  agreement about having two gates at the airport was clearly  confirmed only today. We were informed that the map will depict  the two gates. All that means that there is still work to be  done.    Nevertheless, they still maintain the approach that all  these  are details and ask us whether or not we accept the map and to  place the access road to Maras under their juristiction. They  caution us that the UN secretary general's report will be  reflect our approach if we object. They wish to place the  matter in their own preferred framework. What is important,  however, is the agreement that will be reached between the two  sides. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Markets Report: No change from Buba Traders were yesterday left twiddling their thumbs after the Bundesbank council left all its leading interest rates unchanged, writes Philip Gawith. The Bank's decision, leaving the discount and lombard rates unchanged at 4 1/2 per cent and 6 per cent respectively, and the repo rate fixed at 4.85 per cent for a further two weeks, was widely expected. In the US the dollar weakened after the prices component of the August purchasing manager's index rose to 74.5, the highest level in six years. This prompted weakness in the bond market, and a fall in the Dow Jones industrial average below 3,900, which hurt the dollar. The dollar finished in London at DM1.577 from DM1.5783. Against the yen it closed at Y99.665 from Y100.175. The focus has now shifted to the release today of US payrolls data. The prospect of a long weekend in the US also curbed the market's appetite for taking large positions and this had a dampening effect on volumes. In Europe the D-Mark was little changed after the Bundesbank's decision to leave rates unchanged. Sterling had a very quiet day, with the trade weighted index unchanged at 79.1. The response of US markets and the dollar to the purchasing managers' index was a reminder of the bearish psychology which continues to plague the dollar. Some analysts had recently predicted that softer than expected data, which was good for the bond market, might be the catalyst for a dollar revival. Yesterday's movements suggest that reasoning to be premature. Analysts said the softness of other parts of the report - such as falls in new orders, production and the employment index - should have offset the prices index and prevented the dollar going lower. Earlier the dollar had received some encouragement from Mr Robert Mcteer, president of the Dallas Federal Reserve bank, who said the long term outlook for the dollar was pretty good. He predicted it would be stronger in 6-12 months time. Analysts said the market's response had been constrained by the release of the monthly employment report, and the start of a long weekend. Some traders are expected to start squaring their positions with Labour day and Rosh Hashanah holidays next week. The Bank of France left its intervention rate unchanged at 5 per cent, despite the decision earlier in the week by leading French commercial banks to raise interest rates by 25 basis points. Although the franc was fairly firm, analysts warned that trouble may lie ahead. Economists at Nikko Europe say that unemployment, which fell to 3.07m in July, will be the main issue in the May 1995 presidential election. They argue that the economy needs further stimulation, but the commitment to reduce the budget deficit removes room for fiscal manoeuvre, while the Bank of France's commitment to a stable Franc/D-Mark rate means French rates are set in relation to German rates. The Nikko economists predict that there will probably only be one further cut in German rates, in late September/early October. 'The French economy needs more than just one interest rate cut (but) it is not likely to get it. This is likely to lead to an increased political risk premium in both the franc and domestic bond yields.' Elsewhere in Europe the lira, having recovered to L1,000, again fell victim to profit-taking. The catalyst was a renewed bout of political squabbling, prompted by comments from Mr Umberto Bossi, the Northern League leader. Mr Bossi alleged that the prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, had asked President Scalfaro's permission to call a fresh general election in the hope that the League would lose much of its vote. Both the president and prime minister denied this claim, but it served as a reminder of the fragile nature of Italy's ruling coalition. The episode also cast doubt on whether the requisite political resolve exists to deal with difficult issues, like curbing state spending. The Bundesbank's decision to leave its official rates unchanged, and to fix the repo rate at 4.85 per cent for a further two weeks, elicited limited market response. The December Euromark contract traded 27,315 lots to close at 94.84 from 94.88. The decision was fairly widely predicted. Scandinavian currencies have recently been surprisingly firm, but Mr Muj King, global director of forex and money markets at Technical Data in London, predicted that a correction of 'several big figures' was due. 'This retreat is especially possible because the Bundesbank is at the end of a cycle of cuts and thus German interest rates are likely to firm and have an adverse effect on the Scandinavian bloc.' The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 462m assistance, at established rates, compared to a forecast shortage of Pounds 500m. Overnight money traded between 3 3/4 per cent and 5 per cent.</p>

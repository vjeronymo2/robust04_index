			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STALIN IGNORED INVASION WARNINGS, PRAVDA SAYS  </P> <P> Dictator Josef Stalin had detailed information about Nazi Germany's plans to  invade the Soviet Union in 1941 but ignored the warnings and failed to prepare  for war, Pravda told its readers Monday.  </P> <P> The full-page article in the Communist Party newspaper, the most detailed look  yet at what Soviet spies knew about Adolf Hitler's plans, came on the eve of a  national observance of the 44th anniversary of victory in World War II.  </P> <P> The article marked a sharp break from the Soviet press tradition of publishing  uncritical, patriotic reminiscences of Soviet heroism.  </P> <P> Western historians have written extensively about how Stalin ignored  intelligence reports about Hitler's plans. However, little has been published  in the Soviet Union, where Stalin traditionally had been portrayed as a  brilliant wartime leader.  </P> <P> But under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness,  many Soviet writers and historians have recently condemned Stalin's political  repression of millions of people and re-examined his wartime role.  </P> <P> Pravda said the article's author, history professor A. Baidakov, gleaned the  accounts from classified state security archives.  </P> <P> He said the state security agencies managed to infiltrate Hitler's Gestapo  secret police, Germany's Aviation Ministry and its coding service.  </P> <P> According to Baidakov, security officials promptly forwarded information to  Soviet political leaders about Hitler's invasion plans as early as November,  1940. German forces invaded June 22, 1941.  </P> <P> But, the historian said:  </P> <P> "The leadership of the U.S.S.R. people's commissariats (ministries) of state  security and defense did not, in my view, do everything to convince Stalin and  the country's other leaders of the inevitability of an imminent confrontation  with the Germans."  </P> <P> He added that the main blame for lack of preparedness "lies with the U.S.S.R.  political leadership."  </P> <P> Baidakov revealed a series of intelligence reports forwarded to Stalin and  Foreign Minister Vyacheslav M. Molotov. In April, 1941, for example, the two  were told that Hitler had revealed to a Yugoslav prince that an invasion of the  Soviet Union was planned for June.  </P> <P> On June 16, this urgent message was delivered to Stalin and Molotov: "All  military operations of Germany on preparation of a military aggression against  the U.S.S.R. have been completely stopped, and a blow can be expected at any  time."  </P> <P> The next day, Baidakov wrote, Stalin asked intelligence officials whether the  message was reliable. Before the information could be rechecked, the Germans  invaded.  </P></p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Survey of Argentina (2): Investors still showing reluctance  -John Barham finds that there has been no great burst of energy in the private sector With the privatisation of state companies and abolition of nearly all the government's interventionist mechanisms, Argentina's private sector has become the engine for growth. But it is far from clear whether private industry is in any shape to lead the economy. Companies are still in a state of flux. Although it is five years since President Carlos Menem began his free market reforms, there has been no great burst of entrepreneurial energy, no investment boom, no management revolution, no aggressive pursuit of exports. Instead, companies are concentrating on less ambitious incremental investments, often aimed at unstoping bottlenecks. 'Everyone is investing something, but it is very selective. Everyone is making small, selective investments,' says Bernardo Kosacoff of the UN's Economic Commission for Latin America. And there is still considerable room for turning round existing companies without launching major new investments. Ted Truscott, principal of US fund managers Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, notes that US, European and Latin American companies are buying up local competitors in increasing numbers, using their management, technology and marketing skills and capital strength to revive badly-run Argentine companies. Corimon, a Venezuelan paint company, for example, last year took over Colorin, a smaller Argentine competitor. 'Two years ago Colorin had no working capital and its sales were falling,' Mr Truscott says. Now, under Corimon's management, 'Colorin is beginning to grow. It is going to take on (market leader) Alba. I think there are going to be a lot of other companies like this'. Procter &amp; Gamble, Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco, all of the US and Britain's Cadbury Schweppes and Unilever have bought companies in Argentina recently. Local groups are also on the prowl. Buenos Aires-based FiduCorp has built up a portfolio of companies, rebuilding them with infusions of capital and tough management. 'Companies are really forced to do their homework, control costs and find places to cut. Companies (either) go bust or show muscle,' Zsolt Argady, FiduCorp's president, says Many industries - from cars to steel to food processing - have achieved impressive productivity gains through improved management and strong sales growth. Autolatina, the joint venture linking Ford and Volkswagen in Argentina and Brazil, has tripled output per employee since 1991. However, Agustin Castano, head of the Buenos Aires office of US management consultants Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, says the process of increasing productivity through tighter management is reaching its limits. 'Some sectors have reached full capacity and will have to begin investing,' he says. Yet he sees few examples of new greenfield projects. Most investment is going to sectors that are sheltered from import competition, such as services, privatised utilities or construction. Investment in industrial projects is also being angled to the few remaining protected sectors such as cars or those focused on the domestic market, such as breweries. However, Mr Castano says that more than big investments, Argentine companies need a far-reaching change in management culture. 'It is one thing to change structures and it is another thing to change behaviour. Some (managers) are absolutely unadaptable. At the same time you have an emerging group of managers reaching top management positions,' he says. Still, Mr Castano can think of few companies that have embarked on management revolutions. 'Unfortunately you can find only pockets of best practice management.' Neither are companies falling over themselves to raise new capital. Argentine companies are undergeared by international standards. The economy ministry estimated Argentine companies' liabilities at only Dollars 27bn in 1992, compared with assets of Dollars 473bn. Argentina has only 161 listed companies. In theory, therefore, they have plenty of room to raise fresh capital. Although there are no data on the corporate sector's profitability, many companies are foundering in the wake of liberalisation and elimination of trade barriers. Miguel Angel Broda, a business consultant, says 17 out of 54 sectors have seen output fall over the past three years. Mr Truscott says a long history of under-investment is compromising the viability of many sectors, especially in manufacturing industry. Perhaps most at risk is the capital goods industry, which is under severe pressure from competing Brazilian intermediate technology products. Alpha, a Buenos Aires consultancy, says capital goods imports are climbing every month, while local production has almost halved since 1993. It reckons capital goods imports should rise 39 per cent to Dollars 5.7bn this year. In spite of the impressive gains of recent years, Argentina still ranks low in the international productivity stakes. Wages are high - the average Argentine industrial worker earns Dollars 883 but is less produc tive than a Brazilian worker. As a result, few manufacturing companies are able to export profitably let alone resist sustained attack by foreign competitors. Argentina has few world-class companies. Most analysts mention Siderca, a steel tube company owned by industrial conglomerate Techint, as an outstanding company. However it is a chronic loss-maker, mainly because of the depressed oil drilling market. Perez Companc, another industrial conglomerate, is frequently praised for its professional management and its decision to focus on energy and privatised services. YPF, the privatised oil company, is widely admired for its combination of sound management and aggressive expansion strategy. Footwear and clothing company Alpargatas has also attracted attention for its young and highly intelligent management team. Most analysts say that companies with best future prospects are those in small, technology-based niches where they are able to harness Argentina's relatively skilled workforce. Argentine workers tend to be better educated than others in the region and therefore can be quickly trained to use sophisticated equipment. Companies operating in the food, energy, and mining industries - where Argentina has undisputed advantages - are also widely considered to have a bright future. The car industry, the only one to retain substantial import protection and export incentives, is also likely to see considerable growth. Alpha says car companies have a 24 per cent profit margin. However, their long-term prospects are uncertain, since the government says it will abolish import protection in 2000. Argentina has never before built an internationally competitive industrial base. Its long history of unpredictable upheavals and shifts in government policy have made entrepreneurs wary of investing. Jorge Mostany, president of Autolatina's Argentine arm, worries that Argentina cannot compete on cost with China or India. But neither is it sufficiently sophisticated to challenge Japan, Germany or the US.</p>

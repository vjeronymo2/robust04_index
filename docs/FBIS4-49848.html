			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- China has declared that  it will continue its macro control over the development of  higher education this year.    The State Education Commission insists that all students  must  take the unified national examination for college entrance,  otherwise, no graduation certificates will be given.    To prevent unauthorized colleges from expanding enrollment,  the government will issue for the first time forgery-proof  graduation certificates.    And the total enrollment nationwide will be reduced by about  30,000 over last year.    "These are the toughest control measures for many years,"  said Xu Dunhuang, who is in charge of the plan.    The commission has reported that the enrollment reached  924,000 last year, up 22.5 percent over 1992. That made a total  of 2.53 million students on campuses, up 16.1 percent over 1992.    However, the growth of student number exceeded the economic  growth of 13.4 percent last year, putting the education sector  in the doldrums.    Dormitories have become more crowded. Over 100 universities  and colleges were not able to meet the official requirements for  residence conditions last year.    Teaching and research equipment is insufficient or outdated,  owing to funding problems. About 160 colleges of science or  engineering cannot meet the official standards. More  difficulties were found in liberal arts schools.    Compared to the fast growth of higher education, basic  education has been slow. Last year about 73 percent of eligible  students went to junior middle schools, up only 1.2 percent over  1992.    "The situation reveals that the current state investment  level cannot support the growth of education," said Xu.    However, Xu said, the government has decided to allow the  number of students on campuses to grow by 6.5 percent each year,  to reach 3.5 million before the year 2000.    This will enable 35 percent of Chinese youngsters of college  age to receive higher education by then.</p>

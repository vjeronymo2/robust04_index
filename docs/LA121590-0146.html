			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> AN EFFICIENT HOUSING CLIMATE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM? TRY A TREE  </P> <P> Brazil and Malaysia aren't the only ones removing trees faster than they're  replacing them; we're doing the same thing to our urban forests, area arborists  say.  </P> <P> Research by the American Forestry Assn. "shows us that cities are removing four  trees for every one they're planting," says Tom Larson, a member of the group,  president of Urban Forestry Consulting and founder of the nonprofit Tree  Society of Orange County.  </P> <P> These are trees that we can ill afford to lose, he says. Our cities are already  5 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than surrounding areas, according to  association statistics, and they're predicted to heat up another 6 to 12  degrees within the next few decades if present trends continue.  </P> <P> Trees cool cities off directly by providing shade and reducing energy  consumption for air conditioning. Indirect cooling results from trees reducing  carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. (Carbon dioxide traps heat that would  otherwise radiate into space.) We need more trees, not fewer, Larson says.  </P> <P> But that doesn't mean we should all grab our shovels and go out and plant the  biggest trees we can afford in our parkways. Putting the wrong trees in  parkways in the first place -- whether those plantings were done by citizens or  municipalities -- accounts in large part for the high incidence of tree removal  that cities now face, tree experts say.  </P> <P> "Ninety percent of the trees available in the market do not belong in public  parkways," says Daryl Smith, superintendent of parks, trees and landscapes in  Huntington Beach. "Their trunks get too big, and their roots are too invasive."  </P> <P> If a tree is planted in an area too small for its root system, Smith says, it  just seeks nourishment elsewhere. "The roots are attracted to the warmth of the  soil under the sidewalk, the moisture and fertilizer in the lawn and the  moisture and warmth in the rock and gravel under the asphalt in the street."  </P> <P> When roots burrow toward these natural magnets, he says, they begin popping up  sidewalks and breaking up curbs, leaving cities with just two options: breaking  up the roots, which endangers the life of the tree, or taking the tree out  altogether.  </P> <P> "The minimum space any kind of shade tree needs to thrive is 10 feet -- and  most of our medians aren't even that big," says Steve Holcomb, an arborist at  Irvine-based Golden Coast Environmental Services. "That's why cities find  themselves having to cut down mature trees every 10 to 15 years. As soon as the  trees get big enough to provide any environmental benefit, they tear up the  hardscape."  </P> <P> Trees in cutouts fare even worse. "The average age of trees in these  2-foot-by-2-foot cutouts -- which, personally, I think are an abomination -- is  only seven to eight years," says Alden Kelly, arborist consultant and member of  Street Trees Seminar, a professional association of municipal workers,  consultants and vendors dedicated to the promotion of street trees and  improvement of street tree management.  </P> <P> "We're treating trees like big potted plants," he says. Or, as Holcomb puts it,  "like long-term poppy beds."  </P> <P> Cities have been working with the nursery industry, public utility plants and  other concerned parties to find trees that will have a longer life span in  restrictive parkways, without causing problems to the hardscape. But the narrow  limit of choices under these constraints -- in Huntington Beach, for instance,  just 10 tree species are approved -- can create other problems.  </P> <P> "When you have only a few species to choose from and start building up large  host populations, those host populations will inevitably attract insects and  encourage them to multiply," Holcomb says.  </P> <P> Ornamental pear trees, for instance, which were planted heavily in many parts  of the county over the last eight to 10 years, are now struggling with white  fly infestations, he says. And palm trees, another widely used choice in narrow  parkways, are developing "some real sophisticated diseases we don't know how to  treat."  </P> <P> Pest problems are causing many cities to take a fresh look at their lists of  street trees to see whether more can be added. Working with a committee of  citizens, consultants and city staff people, Anaheim recently doubled its  previous species list.  </P> <P> "We had maybe 25 varieties for the entire city before," says Al Epperson, tree  services coordinator. "And lots of single varieties in certain areas.  </P> <P> "I worked in Chicago in the '60s when the Dutch elm disease struck, and we took  out 10,000 trees a year, so I know what can happen. If you have only a few  varieties, these diseases can wipe you out. The white fly infestation affecting  the ash and evergreen pear is bad enough as it is."  </P> <P> Eliminating parkways as they now exist would allow for more options, and that's  exactly what arborists would like to see.  </P> <P> "The concept of parkways comes from the Midwest, where snow-removal equipment  needs space to dump snow when it clears streets without putting it on  sidewalks," Holcomb says. "We kept the concept -- even though we don't have the  snow -- but reduced the parkways. And just kept reducing them until now we're  down to 18 to 20 inches in some cases."  </P> <P> Holcomb would like to see these parkways in which narrow green strips separate  roads from walkways replaced by an arrangement where walkways are right next to  the curb: "You'd plant the tree where the sidewalk is now -- it would still  technically be on easement -- but it would have the whole yard to root in."  </P> <P> This would be healthier for trees and permit more species to be planted, he  says.  </P> <P> Kelly would go further: "If I were king of the world, I'd make most streets one  way and take out sidewalks on one side of the street. Let people go to a little  trouble on the behalf of trees for a change."  </P> <P> But these solutions, both admit, are not politically popular. "It means  starting over," Holcomb say, "and people are reluctant to give up existing  trees in the interim."  </P> <P> Another way to increase the tree varieties in the urban forest is planting them  somewhere besides parkways. Holcomb, for instance, would like to see trees  planted in all those little odd-shaped plots too small to build on but large  enough to support a substantial tree. "It would have to be a tough tree that  could pretty much exist on its own, but there are plenty of those around."  </P> <P> And Larson, with the Tree Society, would like everyone living in a private home  to plant three trees around it.  </P> <P> "If people planted three deciduous trees around their homes -- we call them  'passive solar trees' -- energy consumption could be reduced by millions of  megawatts," he says. "The trees would leaf out in spring and summer and shade  the house, reducing the amount of air conditioning needed, and would lose their  leaves in the winter, letting the heat from the sun in."  </P> <P> Air-conditioning bills in the summer could be reduced up to 30%, he estimates.  Planting trees with "some dimension and scale" whenever possible would also  benefit the environment by cleaning the air, Larson says.  </P> <P> Though all trees absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, thereby benefiting  the environment, tall trees with sweeping canopies do this more effectively  than such dwarf species as crape myrtle, he says.  </P> <P> Larson's arguments for planting trees of consequence where appropriate should  not be construed as lack of support for parkway trees, however. One of the Tree  Society's functions as the regional coordinator for California Releaf is  supporting groups of citizens who wish to help their cities plant more trees --  most of which will be, by necessity, in parkways.  </P> <P> One such group is Releaf Anaheim. This organization -- the first of its kind in  the county -- has the goal of planting 20,000 trees in Anaheim by the year 2000  and is cooperating with the city's Parks and Recreation Department to meet it.  </P> <P> When enough requests for trees come into the department from one area -- or can  be combined with known vacancies -- to suggest a good candidate area for a  community planting, the information is relayed to Releaf Anaheim. According to  parks superintendent Jack Kudron, Releaf then contacts homeowners in the area,  gets them and other community members -- such as Boy Scout troops or high  school ecology classes -- involved and generally plans the event, he says.  </P> <P> Actual planting is by citizens of the community, with initial training and  supervision by city staff.  </P> <P> Having planted the parkway trees themselves, citizens become more protective  about them, Kudron says. "They water them more carefully, watch out for pests  and just generally take more interest."  </P> <P> The arrangement also has the advantage of saving the city money. Two city staff  members worked with Releaf Anaheim to plant 15 camphor trees on Alice Street in  the group's latest project, he says.  </P> <P> "If the same two guys had planted those 15 trees, at, say, 1.5 hours per tree,  it would have cost the city 45 man-hours," he says. "But since volunteers did  most of the work, all the city had to provide was eight hours' labor for two  staff members for one morning. We're going to be able to plant a lot more trees  this way."  </P> <P> He heard about a similar project at an American Forestry Assn. conference about  a year ago, he says. (The association started Global Releaf, the parent project  behind all the other Releaf groups.)  </P> <P> Community plantings are what Larson likes to see: "I want to turn the chili  cookouts of the '80s into the tree-plantings of the '90s."  </P> <P> The society will provide the opportunities, he pledges. More plantings are  scheduled.  </P> <P> "Call ((714) 449-7170) to find out how to participate," he urges. "We want to  get as many people involved as we can, because we need every tree we can get."  </P></p>

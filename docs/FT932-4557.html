			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / China turns to BA for advice CHINA'S Civil Aviation Authority (CAAC) has approached British Airways for help to modernise its airline industry, which is growing faster than any other airline sector in the world. Air traffic is expanding by about 30 per cent a year in China, which is emerging as the most buoyant market in the depressed civil aircraft industry. The Chinese authorities have already indicated plans to partially privatise the country's airlines and are seeking western help to upgrade and develop services to international standards BA is among several leading western carriers approached. Although the Chinese are at present seeking advice, they also hope to develop longer term relationships which could lead to western investment. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, is leading a company delegation to Beijing this week at the invitation of the CAAC. The Chinese are particularly interested in BA's privatisation process and experience. The British airline has recently started non-stop flights between London and Beijing and has been showing growing interest in developing its presence in the fast growing Chinese market. Although BA officials said yesterday it was much too early to talk about joint ventures, a collaboration deal with a Chinese carrier would represent an additional component in BA's strategy to become a global airline. Western aircraft manufacturers are also intensifying their marketing efforts in China whose airlines have traditionally relied on Russian aircraft but are now increasingly turning to western airliners. Mr Robert Dryden, a Boeing executive vice president, speaking at a Financial Times aerospace conference in Paris yesterday said China was expected to account for about 14 per cent of the 340 aircraft Boeing expected to build this year.</p>

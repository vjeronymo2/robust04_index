			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zeljko Katancic: "Accumulated (Obsolete) </F> Equipment"]    [Text] According to published data, the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] has spent half a billion dollars  for the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina; the guerrilla battalions, of  which they are reportedly 26, are the most dangerous to the  peacekeeping forces' units.    In a certain sense, the present situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina could also be considered as a cat playing  with a mouse. The Serbs already thought that with Russian  backing they had escaped the West's excessively severe pressure,  but they were obviously mistaken. By shooting down four  aircraft, the West proved that it was nevertheless serious about  it, and consequently what the Bosnian Serbs are doing now is  perhaps extremely risky. Obviously the spokesman for the  international peacekeeping forces in Sarajevo did not say too  loudly that the Serbs had renewed their attacks within the  20-kilometer protected zone around Sarajevo and were also using  heavy weapons in doing so. The guarantee by General Rose that  trucks would take humanitarian aid throughout Bosnia without  asking anyone at all for permission also had its purpose.  Perhaps something even worse than the downing of the four  aircraft may really happen during the coming days.    It will therefore not be superfluous to know what the NATO  aircraft and the international peacekeeping forces' infantry  will have to deal with if they do decide to punish those who are  challenging them too much. The loudest and most dangerous among  them are the Bosnian Serbs, who are also the best armed.    Western intelligence services have surely collected quite  solid data on the positions that they would have to destroy.  There are somewhat fewer than 3,000 such targets on the Bosnian  Serbs' side. They include 460 tanks, 300 armored personnel  carriers, 50 self-propelled howitzers and 30 self-propelled  cannons, 77 multiple rocket launchers for Plamen missiles, six  missile launchers for the more powerful Orkan missiles, and 10  missile launchers for the already known Luna missiles, of which  one missile launcher is near Sarajevo.    In about 180 barracks and military posts, there are  approximately 80,000 military conscripts, many of whom were only  recently called up. Approximately 50,000 of them are soldiers  from the permanent forces of the army of the self-styled Srpska  republic.    The Serbian air defense has old short-range, medium-range,  and long-range missiles and artillery systems. Western military  experts are quite familiar with them, and consequently it will  not be difficult for their pilots and infantry to find and  destroy them. According to some information, there are supposed  to be 67 positions with the Dvina and Neva missiles, better  known by the Western designators SAM-2 and SAM-3, and Cub  missiles, or SAM-6 according to their Western designator. There  is probably a missile launcher with three missiles at each  position.    Also quite probable is the fact that every year about 80,000  fresh conscripts from the Serbian-Montenegrin army and its  reservists complete at least part of their military service, if  not all of it, as reserves in the army of the Srpska republic.    The Serbian guerrilla battalions are still the most  dangerous  to the infantry and armored units of the international  peacekeeping forces. There are reportedly 26 such battalions,  with from 550 to 780 soldiers in each of them. That means about  20,000 well-trained and hardened Serbian warriors.    That army operates with very good coordination with the  Serbian rebels in Croatia. Fresh conscripts and reservists from  the Serbian-Montenegrin army also perform part of their military  service in the so-called Serbian Krajinas. Every year about  40,000 of them discharge their "patriotic" duty in the army of  the self-styled republic of Serbian Krajina.    According to published data, last year and this year the  Serbian-Montenegrin Yugoslavia spent a full $1.5 billion for the  war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and approximately an additional $650  million to aid the people of the Krajinas in Croatia. The  Serbian armies in Croatia and Bosnia receive approximately 40  percent of even more of everything produced by the rebuilt  defense industry of the former and present Yugoslavia. The  Serbian armies in Croatia and Bosnia consist of 130,000-160,000  soldiers. Most of them are reservists who were called up  recently.    The latest events have also pointed out the Serbian armies'  quite strong air force. According to some information, the one  in Bosnia is supposed to have over 50 combat aircraft. They are  deployed at three of the eight airports that are on the  territory controlled by the Serbs in Bosnia and in Croatia.    All of the former Yugoslavia was thoroughly prepared for  some  sort of general popular war. On its territory there were about  3,000 areas that were suitable for mobile military airports, and  about 100 of them are on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The Bosnian Serbs' air force has its main bases in Mahovljani  and Zaluzani near Banja Luka, and at temporary airports near  Bosansko Grahovo, and there are also some Serbian aircraft in  neighboring Croatia near Udbina.    Until now, the army of the self-styled republic of Srpska  had  75 aircraft and helicopters. About 20 helicopters were intended  for transportation and communications. The aircraft include five  MiG-21's, 12 Jastrebs that are already old, and 16 G-4 Super  Galebs. The Bosnian and Croatian Serbs are supposed to have  about 14 of the larger and more powerful Orel fighter-bombers.  Intelligence services have observed 17 MI-8 and 17 Gazelle  helicopters, and eight Gama military helicopters. The latter are  most often observed in the vicinity of Bihac and the Cazin  Krajina.    Some intelligence data also mention 12 MI-8 transport  helicopters, which are mostly under repair. These are older  helicopters whose service life has already expired.</p>

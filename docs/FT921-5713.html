			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Observer: Gardener arose When David Welch, the new boss of the Royal Parks department, was Aberdeen's director of leisure and recreation, he was such a dab hand at rose-growing that the British Tourist Authority had to exclude Aberdeen from its Britain in Bloom competition every three years so that somewhere else could win. The Royal parks are not likely to be as generous as Aberdeen in the provision of roses - Welch's workers transformed the sides, central reservation and roundabouts of the city's inner ring road into rosebeds, doggedly replanting as local people borrowed the plants for their own use. Demand from Aberdonian gardeners eventually reached saturation point, and Aberdeen's rose bushes are now flourishing uninterruptedly. Welch is remembered as energetic and innovative in overhauling the old city parks department - and was adept at exploiting job creation programmes to turn eyesores into flowerbeds. When the city's winter gardens appeared in the UK's top 10 visitor attractions, Aberdonians suggested that David Welch had hired a team of YTS trainees to spend a year walking through the turnstiles. Sounds like Environment Secretary Michael Heseltine has picked a man after his own heart.</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's A year after Mr David Rowland's task force report, the problems of the Lloyd's insurance market look as pressing as ever. Underwriting losses show every sign of matching the gloomiest predictions. That will lead to a further erosion of capital. If the losses forecast by Chatset this week prove anything like correct - and rates continue to harden - Lloyd's will be turning away profitable business before the middle of the decade unless new sources of capital are found. The new quota-share arrangements for attracting corporate investors are already proving their worth. But it is far from clear that the modest investments made by the likes of J P Morgan this year will plug the gap. The current rate of attrition among Names demands something more. The hurdles to direct corporate membership are formidable. Assuming these can be overcome, though, Lloyd's must find a way to introduce corporate members without alienating individual Names. Since corporate capital would be subject to limited liability, there is plenty of scope for friction. Names facing unlimited liability - even allowing for the stop-loss arrangements introduced last year - might easily feel disadvantaged. But it can hardly be in the interest of Names to participate in a market starved of capital. Any insurance market worth its salt should be able to reward varieties of capital with appropriate rates of return. If Lloyd's can learn to price its risks correctly, there should be no shortage of capital from either source.</p>

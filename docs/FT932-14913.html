			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Government to provide Pounds 5.5m for 'one-stop shops' A TOTAL of 23 business advice centres will be set up in the six areas which have won official government approval for their 'one-stop shop' programmes. The six areas will receive Pounds 5.57m of government funding over the first three years, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said in a written parliamentary answer yesterday. The areas are: Birmingham, Halton (north and mid-Cheshire), Hertfordshire, Manchester, south and east Cheshire, and Tyneside. Birmingham will have just one centrally located advice centre. Hertfordshire and Manchester will each have six; Halton will have two, in Widnes and Runcorn; Tyneside will have five; and south and east Cheshire will have three. The first 'one-stop shops' are expected to open in July starting with three in Manchester and one each in Birmingham, Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead. A further nine areas have been allocated 'one-stop shops' provided they modify their business plans. The government said it hoped they would be able to establish their centres within the next 12 months. The nine areas are Chester and the Wirral, south Derbyshire, Shropshire, Merseyside, Hereford and Worcestershire, Doncaster, Leicestershire, Surrey and Dorset. In addition, government funds will be provided to allow Training and Enterprise Councils and other support organisations in London to prepare plans for a London-wide network of one-stop shops.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> BATTLE SPARKLES IN A BOWL OF CORN  </P> <P> Pops with a twist is the house specialty at Hollywood Bowl. This weekend David  Zinman and the Los Angeles Philharmonic visited Vienna and found . . .  "Hee-Haw."  </P> <P> On paper, the offering promised intriguing charm, with Kathleen Battle the  soloist and Zinman leading the orchestra with a violin. But the fiddle proved  simply an excuse for some Jack Benny gags, which in turn proved the most  sophisticated part of the long, self-deprecating cornball show.  </P> <P> The Viennese are not above slapstick, as anyone who has seen their New Year's  Eve programs can attest. But this performance might well have been stickered  with a warning label for the benefit of the innocents -- surely some among the  11,158 Friday, 13,973 Saturday -- who expected more sentiment than silliness  from "An Evening in Old Vienna."  </P> <P> In a way the thing was shrewdly planned, so that by the time the final Johann  Strauss Jr. set rolled in -- Zinman conducting "The Hunt Polka" with a rubber  shotgun while rubber chickens dropped from above, Zinman conducting the  "Thunder and Lighting Polka" in a raincoat while the stage lights flashed --  expectations had been suitably lowered.  </P> <P> Illuminating the desperate hokeyness was Battle. She began with the noblest  lullaby of all, Mozart's "Ruhe sanft, mein holdes Leben," bridging the Bowl  distances with soft pliant lines, then turned to caressive, gentle seduction  for "Batti, batti, o bel Masetto" while in streamed a host of very late  arrivals.  </P> <P> Battle invested the "Laughing Song" from "Die Fledermaus" with demure wit and  vocal sparkle, while the stagehand who would drop the rubber chickens in  Strauss clambered through the speakers above her. She lavished shimmering sound  in great cresting arches on "Vilia" from "The Merry Widow," while Zinman and  half the band fell far behind in the cadences.  </P> <P> The orchestra -- or rather, a small part of it -- had the best instrumental  moments in Mozart's "Serenata Notturna," K. 239, with concertmaster Sidney  Weiss leading the concertino part blithely. The rest of the program was played  as the butt of Zinman's stand-up monologues and costumed shtick.  </P> <P> And now, for something completely different. . . . JOHN HENKEN  </P></p>

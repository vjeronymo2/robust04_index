It was a  piece of good news that also boosted the prime minister's  optimism about successfully concluding Norway's membership  negotiations.    "This is pleasing. Now I hope we will see rapid progress and  a solution for all four countries (Sweden, Finland, Norway, and  Austria -- editorial note) within a few days.    ``It is of crucial importance that the negotiating tempo is  maintained and that all four countries achieve a result. I  believe that Norway will also achieve a solution,'' the prime  minister said.    Shortly before, at his weekly meeting with the press at  Christiansborg, he had stressed that it is of crucial importance  that the negotiations should succeed.    "The words `collapse of the negotiations' do not exist in  our  dictionary. They will succeed. For the sake of the Nordic  countries, for the sake of the EU, and against the background of  the future enlargement negotiations with the countries of East  Europe," he said.    The prime minister said that he would like to see more  flexibility in the enlargement negotiations on the part of Spain.    "It is necessary that Spain too should understand the  consideration that must be given to the Norwegian fish stocks.  If the political will exists, the question can be resolved,"  the prime minister said. [passage omitted]</p>

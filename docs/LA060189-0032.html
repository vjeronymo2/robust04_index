			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SADDLED IN THE PAST;  </P> <P> WHEN LIFE GETS DULL, THE MEN OF K TROOP GALLOP OFF INTO THE 19TH CENTURY  </P> <P> When it comes to recreating the life and times of a 19th Century cavalry unit,  Pat Coen and the men of his K Troop don't horse around.  </P> <P> One weekend a month, they gallop up hillsides with revolvers blazing, they  practice fancy equine military maneuvers, they gnaw homemade hardtack -- "It's  kind of like a hard, thick matzo," Coen says -- and they generally give their  all to ensure the Republic's manifest destiny.  </P> <P> Then Coen goes back home to his wife and two daughters in Canoga Park, and his  workaday gig as an RTD diesel mechanic. His 16 or so cohorts in K Troop return  to their lives as machinists, technicians, engineers. For another month,  settlers go unprotected, marauders go unchecked, and sunsets go unridden into.  It's not a perfect system, but as Coen and company have learned in exhaustive  detail, the Army never was.  </P> <P> "You get an idea of what it was really like 100 years ago," says K Troop  stalwart Bruce Taylor, a Simi Valley plumber who hauls an 1885 saddle, a  working 1873 Colt .45 and assorted century-old memorabilia on K Troop  maneuvers. "It was a rough life."  </P> <P> On occasional "encampments" with other ersatz cavalry units in the Arizona  desert, the men trudge around in regulation blue woolen uniforms and heavy  boots that stop a regulation one inch below the knee. "Apaches" wear war paint  in authentic patterns, made from the very roots and flowers the Indians used.  Everybody yells a lot, shoots blanks at the enemy -- "It's a search-and-destroy  kind of thing," Taylor explains -- and flirts with heatstroke.  </P> <P> "You eat period food -- beef jerky, salt pork, if you're lucky a can of  peaches," he says. "You sleep in an 1880s cavalry tent with nothing under you  but a bedroll. After a weekend in the 100-degree heat wearing those wool  uniforms, you're glad to get back to civilization."  </P> <P> Their counterparts 100 years ago had no such choice.  </P> <P> For decades after the Civil War, the cavalry was a haven for the unemployed,  the illiterate, the desperate, according to contemporary accounts. Nearly half  the troops were foreign-born. Quarters were cramped and the food was wretched.  For years, no ammunition was available for practice. Pay was $13 a month.  </P> <P> "The majority of the enlisted men in the Army are simply human driftwood, men  who have committed crimes elsewhere and are hiding in the service under assumed  names; men who cannot brook the liberties and familiarities of society, and  take refuge in military discipline; men who are disappointed, disheartened and  ambitionless, and find the lazy life of a soldier a relief," a Chicago  newspaper reporter wrote in 1874.  </P> <P> Coen, a mountain of a man who grew up on a Kansas farm, was first hooked by the  Hollywood version of the cavalry, the square-jawed lieutenant sitting erect on  his steed as he scans the ridge top for a row of feathers. The rest, he found  out, is history.  </P> <P> "When I was 7, I can remember thinking how great it would be to be in the  cavalry," he says. "I grew up with Rin Tin Tin and John Wayne movies."  </P> <P> His fascination with history kept growing, and, at the age of 19, he signed on  with a Civil War unit. Then, as hobbyists swarmed into the War Between the  States, Cohen forged ahead, concentrating on the less voguish Indian Wars.  After research in military archives and Western libraries, he formed K Troop of  the First Cavalry, one of about a half-dozen groups in the Los Angeles area  that model themselves on old cavalry units.  </P> <P> "You don't hear much about the First Cav," he says. "We don't get much notice.  All the attention is focused on the Seventh, which was wiped out at Little Big  Horn."  </P> <P> Bivouacked throughout the West, K Troop took its share of lumps as well. It  swept into California with Gen. Stephen Watts Kearny in the Mexican War, but  was routed at the Battle of San Pascual, an engagement described by historian  James M. Merrill as "unnecessary, poorly conceived, badly executed." In  addition to countless Indian skirmishes, the troop suppressed poachers at  Yellowstone National Park, and took part in an ill-fated effort to introduce  camels to the West.  </P> <P> If none of that matches Bull Run or Gettysburg for stirring the blood, it  doesn't faze Coen.  </P> <P> "The Civil War is a lot more popular," he acknowledges. "You want to do Civil  War? You go out and get yourself a uniform and a rifle, and you do Civil War.  This is a lot more difficult. For one thing, you need a horse."  </P> <P> K Troop, which is seeking new recruits, usually mounts up at a stable in  Newbury Park for its monthly drills, maneuvers drawn from cavalry training  manuals of the 1870s and 1880s.  </P> <P> To kick things off, Coen bellows, "Command march!" rather than the more  inspirational but less historically correct, "Forward ho!" On patrol, the men  ride four abreast, as prescribed in the drill manuals, not two-by-two, as in  the movies. Their saddles sit on stitch-by-stitch replicas of the last known  surviving cavalry horse blanket, a tattered 1885 shroud enshrined in a private  collection.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Keeping in Period  </P> <P> "We try to be as historically accurate as is humanly possible," says Coen, who,  along with his men, peppers his speech with period slang. A dishonorable  discharge is a "bobtail"; four years of active duty are four years "up the  pole."  </P> <P> Campfire songs for Company K are all-but-forgotten Army ditties like "O'Reilly  Was a Soldier" and "General Jake." Calls-to-arms are played by company  trumpeter Mike Winters, a Van Nuys alarm repairman who has a collection of  horns dating to the American Revolution.  </P> <P> "He's one of the top troop musicians in the field," Coen says.  </P> <P> The public rarely gets to see all this. From April through October, other  outfits, including the Simi Valley-based Company A, strut their stuff at Fort  Tejon State Historic Park near Bakersfield, but Company K generally shies from  the limelight.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Public Exhibition  </P> <P> During one of its infrequent exhibitions recently at the Big Sky Ranch in Simi  Valley, a soldier in full gallop speared a cabbage that was affixed to a post.  </P> <P> Another shot out some balloons. The whole troop charged up a steep hill.  </P> <P> Coen gave a short talk, in which he professed "tremendous respect" for  Geronimo, who eluded 5,000 U.S. cavalrymen and 4,000 Mexican soldiers for a  year and a half until his capture in 1886.  </P> <P> He makes no excuses for the epic mistreatment of Indian tribes at the cavalry's  hands.  </P> <P> "We were the first line of the administration," he says. "We were given the  order to enforce the will of the government, and we weren't smart enough to  ask, is this right or wrong? We had our job to do and we went out and did it."  </P></p>

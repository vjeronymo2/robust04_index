			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Poland's privatisation minister survives vote of no confidence Mr Janusz Lewandowski, Poland's privatisation minister, yesterday narrowly survived an opposition vote of no confidence which, if successful, would have led to the collapse of Ms Hanna Suchocka's seven-party coalition government. The vote came as the government launched the first reading of its modified mass-privatisation proposals whose progress depends on the votes of the 58-strong former communist SLD group. Its abstention in the no confidence vote against Mr Lewandowski allowed him to scrape home by 175:147, with 51 abstentions. The SLD has been placed in this strategic position by a rebellion of the right-wing Christian nationalist ZChN party, a government coalition member.</p>

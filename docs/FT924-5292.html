			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Letter: Legally possible, if politically unwise, to isolate France Sir, The possibility of France using its 'right of veto' against the US-EC farm trade deal continues to be evoked. There is in fact no legal right of veto on matters where the Treaty of Rome provides for the EC Council of Ministers to decide by qualified majority. This includes agricultural policy (Article 43) and commercial policy (Article 114). The 1966 'Luxembourg compromise' was a political document, not a legal one, and was in fact an 'agreement to disagree' among the original six Member States. Its full text (which can be found in the Commission's Ninth General Report) states: 'I. Where, in the case of decisions which may be taken by majority vote on a proposal of the Commission, very important interests of one or more partners are at stake, the members of the Council will endeavour, within a reasonable time, to reach solutions which can be adopted by all the members of the Council while respecting their mutual interests and those of the Community. . . . II. With regard to the foregoing paragraph, the French delegation considers that where very important interests are at stake the discussion must be continued until unanimous agreement is reached. III. The six delegations note that there is a divergence of views as to what should be done in the event of failure to reach complete agreement.' Even assuming that the 'Luxembourg compromise' still has some political validity, a country which invokes a 'very important interest' can be overruled, as Peter Walker (then minister of agriculture) found to his cost in 1982. It depends on the president agreeing not to take a vote, or, failing that, on a sufficient number of countries abstaining or voting against to constitute a blocking minority. It may be politically unwise to isolate a country in this way, but it is legally possible. Michael Tracy, Agricultural Policy Studies, 20 rue Emile Francois, 1474 La Hutte (Genappe), Belgium</p>

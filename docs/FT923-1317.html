			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Societies log good savings figures BUILDING SOCIETIES last month enjoyed their best month so far this year in the savings market. More than Pounds 327m flowed into building society accounts in the month, compared with an outflow of Pounds 325m in July. The improvement came after the government twice lowered rates on National Savings products in order to ease market pressures on the societies. Although the August savings figure was the highest this year, it was still well below the level usually regarded as normal, and Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, warned that it meant societies would continue to face difficulties with funding. Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the Building Societies Association, welcomed the improvement, saying the figure was substantially higher than a year ago. However, he warned that the September savings figure might be down again because of payments for the final instalment of regional electricity company share issues. The mortgage side of the building society industry continued to languish in August. Net lending was unchanged from July at Pounds 1.7bn, but new lending  -loans agreed but not yet paid out - fell sharply to Pounds 2.4bn from Pounds 3.4bn in July. 4bn. The fall probably reflects the end of the temporary suspension of stamp duty on August 12. Since then, societies say, mortgage lending has been extremely subdued. Societies now hope that the mortgage market will recover as a result of yesterday's cut in base rates - although it will take some months for the long-term effects of the recent money market turbulence and consumer uncertainty about interest rates start to become clear. The July net outflow of Pounds 325m was one of the worst for the industry since September 1986, when there was an outflow of Pounds 673m as savers withdrew money to take part in the flotation of TSB.</p>

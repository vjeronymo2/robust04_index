			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Arts: A happy month for Francophiles - Video It is rumoured that on the Tour de France's recent visit to England French cyclists left behind large numbers of French-language movie videos. They scattered them discreetly along the hedgerows, to be collected later under cover of darkness by British video companies. Something like this must have happened. How else account for an August video slate berserk with Francophilia? High-quality films they are too, plucked from the hedgerow of French cinema history. For Truffaut fans, there is the enchanting 1968 quasi-autobiographical comedy Baisers Voles (Artificial Eye). For those who still reverence Jean Gabin, the Marcel Carne classic Le Jour Se Leve (Connoisseur) breathes poetic doom over a 1930s tale of love and murder. For Jean Renoir admirers, his great class-clash comedy Boudu Sauve Des Eaux (Artificial Eye) comes to video, looking far superior to its 50-years-on Hollywood remake, Down And Out In Beverly Hills. And then there are Jean Marais in Jean Delannoy's moody-elegiac 1943 Tristan and Isolde variant L'Eternel Retour (Art House); Jacques Doillon's teen-angst updating of Goethe, Le Jeune Werther (Tartan); and Joseph Losey's best late film M. Klein (Arrow), with Alain Delon as a wartime Parisian Jew treading the path of the Holocaust. In addition the most popular French film ever made - at least at the French box office - comes to video with Les Visiteurs (Arrow): a sort of time-hopping Gallic Monty Python, in which a Medieval knight and squire crash-land in modern Languedoc. This, though, is the only arguable turkey of the bunch. A hit at home, its broad but parochial fun-poking was largely shunned abroad. And another French domestic success now on video - Yves Robert's Pagnol-based two-parter about youth and memory La Gloire De Mon Pere and Le Chateau De Ma Mere (Artificial Eye) - gained respect rather than ecstasy in cinemas outside France. Many people think French cinema has now died and they will assume, cynically, that this embarras of re-releases is a form of posthumous honouring. The video-viewing ritual, after all, has long seemed uncomfortably close to cremation: the sliding of the black box containing the 'remains' into the jaws of that immortalisation machine, flickering with light, that we call a VCR. But perhaps we should look on the August French film frenzy as an ambassadorial gesture: a symbol or earnest of the 'light at the end of the Euro-tunnel'. Video is an unrivalled way to re-assess undersung movies and some modern French films - especially the quiet ones - do seem better, far better, on the small screen. None more than Yves Robert's cine-diptych. Nothing much 'happens' in those summery Provencal hills, or in the romantically forbidden footpaths around that small-town chateau. But the two films have a real pop-Proustian charm. And home viewing allows the narrative to grow at its own pace, with no fidgety sense that having paid movie-theatre money we should be bombarded with movie-sized drama and special effects. We can get all these at home now anyway. My CDi machine, whose hi-fi qualities I hymned last month, is responding well to saturation viewing. I had some people over who sat there gawping at Top Gun, and finger-flicking to favourite chapter-headed action scenes, while the dinner was getting cold. And the dark, nearer-home violence of The Krays and The Crying Game has a marvellous sheen and resonance viewed on Digital Video. I have also been making use of the 'Compton's Interactive Encyclopaedia.' You can punch up any entry you want, from 'Aachen' to 'Zworykin, Vladimir' (father of television); you can roam and zoom all over a map of the world; you can watch educational videos; and you can take a 'time machine' trip, stopping for information at any historical station along the way. Nor are the texts unduly skimpy. I looked up Existentialism on the 'Topic Tree' and was soon floundering knee-deep through Kierkegaard, Sartre and Heidegger. My friends urged a swift return to Top Gun, whereupon I insisted on an overdue adjournment to dinner.</p>

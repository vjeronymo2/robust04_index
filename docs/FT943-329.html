			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Lima puts in higher performance Lima put in a sharply higher performance last week as foreign interest in the market was ignited by a Dollars 45m offering of ADRs in Banco Wiese on the New York Stock Exchange, the first ever international offering for a Peruvian equity. The issue was reported to have been 20 times oversubscribed, with the price rising to a 16.5 per cent premium on the first day of trading. Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets notes that Lima's positive mood was also helped by news that talks with foreign commercial creditors would resume following official recognition of all outstanding debts. The result was a 19.4 per cent increase on the week in average daily turnover to Dollars 15.5m, according to figures from the Lima exchange. Wiese, Peru's second largest bank, surged 25.5 per cent on the week in domestic trading, pulling Banco de Credito, the country's largest bank, 17.7 per cent higher in its wake.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Dollar terms                     No. of    September 23   % Change    % Change Market              stocks            1994  over week  on Dec '93  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America        (209)          789.96       +2.6       +21.4 Argentina             (25)          961.61       -1.6        -3.3 Brazil                (57)          445.43       +3.9       +91.4 Chile                 (25)          736.84       -0.1       +33.5 Colombia1             (11)          903.39       -2.0       +40.1 Mexico                (68)        1,020.64       +2.9        +1.4 Peru2                 (11)          181.47      +15.3       +50.0 Venezuela3            (12)          570.92       +0.9        -3.5 Asia                 (557)          285.95       -0.5        -1.7 China4                (18)          107.35       -0.2       -28.1 South Korea5         (156)          147.18       +3.3       +24.6 Philippines           (18)          311.87       +2.5        -8.4 Taiwan, China6        (90)          159.48       -1.0       +18.0 India7                (76)          140.55       -2.6       +20.7 Indonesia8            (37)          110.84       -3.3       -11.1 Malaysia             (105)          322.32       -1.0        -4.9 Pakistan9             (15)          406.77       +0.8        +4.9 Sri Lanka10            (5)          208.29       +0.1       +17.5 Thailand              (55)          438.08       +1.2        -8.3 Euro/Mid East        (125)          115.98       +0.7       -31.5 Greece                (25)          222.77       -0.2        -2.2 Hungary11              (5)          178.89       +0.2        +7.3 Jordan                (13)          152.56       -0.6        -7.8 Poland12              (12)          562.62       -6.3       -31.2 Portugal              (25)          123.84       -2.9        +8.8 Turkey13              (40)          112.38       +4.2       -47.1 Zimbabwe14             (5)          263.77       +0.3       +30.5 Composite            (891)          377.84       +1.1        +6.2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                              Local currency terms                    September 23%   Change %      Change Market                     1994   over week  on Dec '93  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina            590,067.57        -1.6        -3.3 Brazil            1,428,388,245        +3.9    +1,305.6 Chile                  1,220.15        -0.3       +28.0 Colombia1              1,347.94        -0.2       +45.4 Mexico                 1,492.54        +2.1       +10.6 Peru2                    249.68       +15.3       +57.0 Venezuela3             2,231.18        +0.9       +57.0 Asia China4                   115.75        -3.8       -29.5 South Korea5             154.93        +3.5       +23.4 Philippines              381.18        +0.0       -14.2 Taiwan, China6           157.04        -0.9       +17.4 India7                   155.43        -2.6       +20.7 Indonesia8               130.91        -3.4        -8.1 Malaysia                 304.09        -1.0        -9.8 Pakistan9                564.90        +0.8        +7.0 Sri Lanka10              223.91        -0.0       +17.3 Thailand                 434.17        -2.7       -10.1 Euro/Mid East Greece                   355.45        -0.0        -7.6 Hungary11                232.31        -0.1       +15.1 Jordan                   218.75        -0.6        -8.6 Poland12                 821.36        -5.8       -25.6 Portugal                 134.42        -2.4        -2.7 Turkey13               1,798.56        +5.1       +23.6 Zimbabwe14               323.02        +0.7       +51.2 Composite  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

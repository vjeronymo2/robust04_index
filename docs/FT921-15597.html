			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / US and Japan pledge to boost economic growth THE US and Japan yesterday launched an initiative to encourage economic growth and urged other industrialised nations, particularly Germany, to do the same. The plan, entitled A Strategy for World Growth, is apparently aimed at getting interest rates down in an effort to kick-start the world economy. The Bundesbank, which views inflation as a bigger enemy than slow growth, raised interest rates as recently as last month. President Bush and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa agreed on the plan during their summit meeting in Tokyo when they also discussed US demands for Japanese trade concessions. US officials are visiting Europe to explain the initiative to Germany and the other Group of Seven industrialised countries. They intend to present it to a forthcoming meeting of G7 finance ministers to be held in the US, probably on January 25. Mr David Mulford, US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs, arriving in London from Bonn yesterday, was careful to say that he was consulting with European G7 partners of the US rather than asking them to join an already prepared strategy. The initiative includes a commitment by Mr Bush to announce economy-boosting measures in his State of the Union address later this month and in his budget for the 1993 financial year. These are likely to include investment incentives and possibly tax cuts - though Mr Bush did not give details. Mr Miyazawa said Japan's budget for the financial year starting in April was aimed at strengthening domestic demand through increased public investment. The recent decision by the Bank of Japan to reduce the official discount rate to 4.5 per cent was also intended to maintain sustainable growth with price stability, said the statement. The rate was cut by a half-point on December 30. Economists said the statement referred mainly to measures which had already been announced or, as in the case of the State of the Union address, widely expected. Mr Paul Chertkow, chief currency analyst at the London office of Citibank, said the statement would have little impact on persuading the Bundesbank to cut German interest rates, a move likely to help the European economy. He said the statement was an 'exercise in rhetoric' which highlighted the problems of getting all the G7 countries to agree on joint strategies for promoting world growth. But speaking in Tokyo, Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury secretary, rebuffed criticism that the two leaders had promised nothing new. 'The thing that's different is that the president of the US and the prime minister of Japan have put their names to a growth strategy.' Mr Brady also suggested that the declaration could help pave the way to further cuts in interest rates. Given the recent reductions in rates, 'there's always the possibility that more could be done (in this area) if more needs to be done'. Mr Bush and Mr Miyazawa welcomed the recent rise in the yen against the US dollar, saying 'recent exchange rate movements were consistent with current economic developments.' However, some private sector economists expressed disappointment that the two countries did not commit themselves to pushing the dollar down more firmly in order to promote US exports.</p>

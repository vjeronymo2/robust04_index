			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / UK Company News: How Serco became Cinderella's Prince Charming - A look at one of the stock market's best performers through the recession Winning a business enterprise award recently presented a ticklish logistical problem for Serco, the contract management group - how to show the prize to as many employees as possible, given that they operate on more than 400 sites worldwide. The 9,500 staff who work for the group and its associates perform a bewildering variety of tasks: everything from servicing RAF helicopters to looking after buildings for corporate customers such as Marks and Spencer and Barclays. Yet the range of Serco's work has not prevented the low-profile company from being one of the stock market's best performers through the recession. Since flotation in late 1988, the group's market value has increased more than seven-fold to its present level of Pounds 146m. Pre-tax profits are this year expected to top Pounds 9m, compared with Pounds 3m in the year it came to market. Serco has successfully ridden a wave which has swept both the public and private sectors, first in the US and more recently in the UK and beyond. Variously dubbed contractorisation, outsourcing, or - in the case of the public sector - privatisation, it involves organisations concentrating on their core functions by farming out peripheral activities, normally cutting costs in the process. Mr Richard White, Serco's managing director, says coping with the consequent diversity of activities within the group is simple: 'Essentially it is a management question. We build strong teams and then maintain tight financial control.' Serco was established in 1929 by RCA to service the US group's British cinemas, and was the subject of a management buy-out in 1987, a year before flotation. Mr White says the most important legacy from RCA is Serco's tradition of strong financial reporting disciplines. What Mr White describes as Serco's big break came in 1964 when RCA was awarded the contract to look after the RAF's Fylingdales missile early-warning station in North Yorkshire. The contract, which Serco has retained, involves the operation of the radar system, as well as cleaning and maintaining the base. This track record - and subsequent substantial contracts with the European Space Agency - meant the RCA offshoot was well placed when the Ministry of Defence started contracting out more services in the eighties. Defence-related work still accounts for about 40 per cent of Serco's business. Mr White says he is not unhappy with that balance - indeed the pressure on defence spending seems likely to increase the pace of contracting out of MoD services. Serco has, however, widened its field operations beyond the defence field, although public sector contracts still account for about 90 per cent of business. The group now runs sports centres for local authorities, road management schemes and air traffic control systems. Mr White estimates his group can save most clients up to 30 per cent of the cost of any contract. Although Serco does normally end up employing fewer staff, he says there is a lot more to their approach than cutting numbers. 'Often the functions we take over were the Cinderellas of an organisation. We get a tremendous response from workforces because suddenly the thing they do is the main attraction, which we focus on.' All Serco's full-time employees have staff jobs, even though the group's contracts run from one to 10 years, with five being the average. About half the workforce is unionised. Mr White says the group is not anti-union: 'We like unions which can negotiate long-term agreements and stick to them.' Serco tends to avoid contracts with low added-value, such as cleaning or security services. However, the group manages British Rail's Victoria and Liverpool Street stations. Mr White said these contracts were taken mainly to establish a close relationship with BR in the run-up to privatisation. Although Serco's organic business has achieved an underlying growth rate of nearly 20 per cent, it does not enjoy huge profitability - the operating margin is just over 5 per cent. Mr White says: 'We are not greedy on price, so as to increase our chance of getting renewal and thus ensure continuity of business and stability for our staff.' Serco now operates in 29 countries and about a fifth of the group's business is outside the UK, with continental Europe marked as its most immediate opportunity. Longer-term, the group is organising the 2,200 staff who work in the Asia/Pacific area into a separate business, and aims to use existing operations in Australia and New Zealand as a springboard into east Asia. Organic growth has been increased to 30 per cent by acquisitions. In 1992 the group entered a new area, air traffic control, when it bought International Aeradio, the civil aviation specialist, from BT for Pounds 12.3m. The civil aviation services market has continued to develop well, with new contracts including consultancy work in central and eastern Europe. The company is now operating the Scatsta air terminal in Shetland for BP Exploration's Sullom Voe terminal. In July last year , Serco paid Pounds 3.5m for BM Scotland, part of the Property Services Agency, the government's property management body. The company said this deal brought a further 278 contracts with existing government customers, which considerably strengthened its core business and enhanced its position in the separate Scottish market. Mr White believes the principle of market-testing is now relatively non-controversial, so Serco will not suffer uncertainty when a general election approaches. He also says the group is ready to take on a large opportunity, although group gearing of 50 per cent means a large acquisition would seem likely to require a rights issue. The government's recently restated determination to press ahead with subjecting more parts of the civil service to market forces bodes well for companies such as Serco. Mr White says of the BM deal: 'These government sell-offs are almost a new form of privatisation.'</p>

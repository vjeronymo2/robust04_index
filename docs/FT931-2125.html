			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Arts: Orpheus in the Underworld - D'Oyly Carte THE D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's cross-Channel leap from Gilbert and Sullivan to Offenbach has been sympathetically awaited. Orpheus in the Underworld is announced as a first step in a broadening of the company's repertory of light opera. It comes as a co-production with Opera North, sharing the same designer (Tim Hatley) and director (Martin Duncan) but with D'Oyly Carte's own musical director, the capable John Owen Edwards, and with a cast largely overlapping with that of the companion-piece for the current national tour, The Pirates of Penzance. To complain of timidity in the choice, on the ground that Orpheus in the Underworld is the most familiar of the dozens of works in Offenbach's output, is probably to miss the point. The ceaseless musical fizz of this score plus the ready opportunity for guying the gods of Olympus mean that the piece can hardly fail. The same assurance can be given with the D'Oyly Carte version, even though it is really Orpheus in the Recession. It is not merely miserly of scenery and effects, with tatty, ill-fitting costumes; its poverty is also the poverty of imagination. The staging manages to be both congested and over-symmetrical; elbow-jigging and bum-shaking are passed off as dancing. David Fieldsend zombies through the role of Orpheus, his persistently faulty miming of the solo violin part hardly credible in a music-based company. His spoken lines are delivered in a nondescriptly northern accent (why do directors suppose, as Ken Russell did with the ENO's Princess Ida, that regional dialect is funny in itself, however unmotivated?). At Birmingham last Thursday, most of the characters seemed not so much to be playing their roles as playing at them - the outstanding exceptions being Barry Patterson, a tall, dashing devil of a Pluto; Gareth Jones, with just the right pathetic and comic touch as Pluto's servant, John Styx; and Jill Pert, whose self-righteous but nimble-footed incarnation as Public Opinion would have done honour to Patricia Routledge. Moving down from Mount Olympus to Pluto's dominions, the second act showed some improvement. Mutual sparks began to fly between the pretty, sweet-voiced Eurydice of Mary Hegarty and the rather dry-toned Jupiter of Alan Watt. Here the smart new translation by Jeremy Sams was to be relished, though I maintain that Geoffrey Dunn's former translation was smarter still. Finally, of course, the can-can - or rather can't-can't. If the expectation of Parisian flavour would have been unreasonable, some comparable inventiveness was needed. But things just bumped along - a verdict which has to be applied to too much of this shortish evening. Alexandra Theatre, Birmingham</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Krakow President Jozef Lassota, local </F> self-government activist and member of the President's Council  for Local Self-Government Affairs, by Antoni Lewandowski; place  and date not given]    [Text] During the meeting between the delegates of  the Polish Cities Union and local self-government structures and  President Walesa's representative Professor Lech Falandysz, most  utterances by the mayors and presidents of Polish cities were  dominated by a sense of profound disquiet concerning the fate of  the democratic system based on local self-government structures.  The absence of any results so far after several months of talks  by the Commission for Government and Local Self-Government  Affairs gave another cause for concern.    The assembled delegates representing local  self-government bodies decided to take advantage of President  Lech Walesa's offer and voted to transform the loose  representation of local self-government structures (comprising  36 delegates) into the President's Council for Local  Self-Government Affairs.    In compliance with the president's suggestion,  communicated to the meeting by Prof. Lech Falandysz, the Council  elected Professor Maria Gintowt-Jankowicz, director of the  National School of State Administration, to the office of  chairman.    We asked Krakow President Jozef Lassota, member of the  new council and local self-government activist, for a general  assessment of the current situation arising from the  government's attitude to local self-government structures, a  situation that was described during the meeting as "a dialogue  of the deaf."    [Lewandowski] How would you comment on the difficulties,  reported here by delegates, in achieving a measure of agreement  between local self-government structures and central government?    [Lassota] I believe that the government's attitude to local  self-government structures can be defined today as a trend  following logically from the government's overall philosophy of  the methods of state administration. The present government has  already demonstrated quite clearly that it is opposed to  decentralization. Instead, it favors centralization of state  structures.    Both Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and Minister Michal  Strak, head of the Council of Ministers' Office, state  officially that they are in favor of decentralization of power.  However, we note that, in practice, they pursue a completely  different policy. In other words, they say one thing and do  another. Attempts by self-government bodies to conduct a  dialogue with the central government are not even like a  dialogue of the deaf. I would say, quite simply, that we are  being cheated. I believe that the government does not even try  to play fair with either local self-government bodies or with  the public. It is dishonest of the government not to declare  openly what it really wants to do.    I have arrived at this opinion of the state of affairs,  among  other things, on the basis of the talks between representatives  of central government and local self-government structures in  which I have been taking part. We have not been able to come to  an understanding for long months now. As far as I am concerned,  it is quite obvious. We can see from this that we will never  come to an agreement on any vital issues.    [Lewandowski] But surely the Office of the Government  Plenipotentiary for the Reform of Public Administration is still  in existence and in operation, is it not?    [Lassota] The fact that the function of plenipotentiary  for the reform of public administration is still extant serves  only as a smokescreen for the government, designed to suggest  that something is being done. In truth, the role of the  government plenipotentiary has been reduced to that of a minor  official who does not have even the power to bring about the  realization of the decisions that had already been prepared for  implementation by the previous government. As far as local  self-government structures are concerned, this is just another  fact attesting to the central government's hostility to all  reforms concerning local self-government.    [Lewandowski] How would you evaluate the realization of the  so-called "pilot program"?    [Lassota] All decisions the present government made in  connection with this program are drastically curtailed in  relation to the original version and were only made under  pressure from local self-government bodies and public opinion.  We began to put the pilot program together in the middle of  1993. It officially came into effect on 1 January 1994. For  the past two months, we have encountered nothing but a string of  official difficulties. Let me give you just one example  concerning both the financial and legal angles of our  operations: First of all, we encounter continuous "piling up"  of difficulties hampering the transfer of funds to projects  envisaged in the program; in addition, the sources supplying  finance for the program are regularly blocked. Moreover, to  date, voivodas have not received appropriate instructions  concerning the pilot program, and, as a result, they are unsure  whether they are really supposed to support the pilot program or  to reject it. Those who have the courage to assist us on their  own initiative have been doing it regardless of the  difficulties. Others, though, do not do anything to help us in  our operations, and, consequently the whole scheme has so far  reached a deadlock.    The above examples demonstrate clearly that the government  does not intend to accept responsibility for the realization of  the pilot program. It is possible that this is a deliberate  "preelection action" designed to undermine the forthcoming local  self-government election campaign. It may be that, after the  election, the situation will change, but, knowing the central  government's general attitude toward these matters, I doubt it  very much.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Smirnov, deputy chief of the Central </F> Bank of Russia Main Administration for Currency Regulation and  Currency Control, followed by editorial comment: "Bank of  Russia Agrees With Charges against GMM But Does Not Agree It Is  Not Taking Steps"]    [Text] IZVESTIYA 24 December published items by two of its  correspondents, Yu. Kovalenko and M. Berger, devoted to the  Dutch company GMM [Global Money Management Trust]. Since  Mikhail Berger focused his attention on the activity of this  company, or to be more precise its office in Moscow, and also  voiced a negative opinion of the Central Bank on this issue, I  should like to answer this correspondent.    The office of the Dutch trust company "Trust Financial  Services BV" is registered in Moscow. Under Russian legislation  the offices of foreign firms are not corporate bodies and do not  have the right to engage in commercial (economic) activity.    Thus, by taking money from citizens and corporate bodies,  whether it was in rubles or hard currency, GMM twice violated  Russian legislation. The first time when it embarked on  commercial activity while it only had the status of an office.  And the second time when it began operations involving money,  which is only permitted to banks, while GMM is not a bank.    By calling its operations trust operations GMM is operating  in a legislative vacuum since there is no law on trust in Russia  and the company is very well aware of the fact. Trust  operations presuppose that the owners of temporarily free money  and securities entrust their management to trust companies with  a view to deriving a profit. At the same time in the absence of  a law on trust in Russia we have an adequate institutional basis  for conducting operations involving the financial resources of  corporate bodies and the population. That includes primarily  banks and investment funds and in this connection GMM's maxim to  the effect that it is introducing a new type of service onto the  money market and we are not accepting it is unfounded.    And it is a very great pity that M. Berger, who has quite a  good understanding of economics, should seem to be vindicating  GMM's piratical actions when he speaks of "the  incomprehensibility of Russian legislation, which allows an  ambiguous interpretation of obvious things." It is true that he  does not explain what obvious things and ambiguous  interpretation he means.    Now about the fact that in M. Berger's opinion GMM is deeply  "obligated to the Central Bank, which is not reacting in any way  to the invasion of a foreign company onto the Russian financial  market."    I ask to be forgiven for being obliged to say banal things  but every public statement, particularly in the press, should be  based on a knowledge of the facts. And the facts are that in  late November I and administration chief Ye. Ivanov had a  conversation with A. Liozner [name as transliterated], GMM's  Moscow representative. He was informed of the illegal nature of  the office's activity in attracting money in connection with the  fact that it has no banking license and he was asked to halt  this activity immediately or, if the office wanted to continue  it, to start work on the creation of a bank.    On 23 December GMM was sent a letter from our main  administration in which the company was once more asked to  dissolve the contracts concluded with Russian Federation  residents and stop advertizing for funds from Russian residents.    And another thing -- about advertizing. In IZVESTIYA 12  November this year [as published] in an article entitled  "Panama-3" M. Berger together with V. Kornev wrote in particular  of their colleagues who are advertizing illegal activity:  "...we are deeply convinced that newspapers and television  companies which advertize the activity of firms with no legal  right to undertake this activity should share the responsibility  toward people who may be misled with their aid. Our esteemed  colleagues, ask for your advertizers' licenses if they want, for  instance, to take citizens' investments or vouchers. If they do  not have the necessary documents, refuse this source of  revenue." And they also wrote: "Esteemed colleagues,  advertising is something more specific than bank notes. For  this reason it can smell, sometimes very badly."    I absolutely agree but what about similar advertizing in  IZVESTIYA? I should like to draw Mikhail Lvovich's attention to  the advertisement of the "LEND" joint-stock company, slightly  below and to the left of his article on GMM in the 24 December  issue, in which the company promises first to take rubles from  its client, then to convert them into currency, and to transfer  the currency from a Swiss bank to anywhere in the world.  Usually "LEND" offers an interest rate of 36 percent per annum  (see IZVESTIYA 25 December, for instance) without the right to  work with money. Examples of similar advertizing in IZVESTIYA  could be continued but I hope the editorial office itself will  discover the "harmful" advertizing and draw the necessary  conclusions.    And for the future we are prepared for constructive  cooperation with the newspaper since we can see mutual interest  in it. [Smirnov ends]    From the editorial office: We are pleased that our  assessments of GMM's activity in RUssia coincides with what the  Central Bank of Russia thinks of it. But we want to draw  attention to the fact that the outcome of similar thinking in  the editorial office and the state institution can be  fundamentally different. In the newspaper that outcome is a  newspaper article, at the Central Bank it involves actions which  accord with the situation.    Obviously it is important to explain to the lawbreakers that  they are breaking the law. It is good that the currency  regulation administration has done this twice: first verbally  and then in writing. But what next? Even before the Russian  Ministry of Finances had tried to explain to GMM that the  company was operating illegally. But if the lawbreaker, despite  a large amount of explanatory work, continues his fruitful  illegal activity, collecting money from credulous or reckless  citizens, then who should take steps? Should it not be the  Central Bank?    Yes, we accept the rebukes over the publication of  advertizing by dubious financial organizations, including LEND,  of the illegality of whose actions Vladimir Smirnov kindly  informs us. But under the law we are not obliged to check the  authenticity of information supplied by the advertizer. To  refuse such advertizing is a matter for our good will. While  the Central Bank simply has to react immediately and effectively  to the emergence of illegal banks and other gathers of money.  But unfortunately practice shows that the Central Bank is  either reluctant or unable to protect Russians from illegal  "plowmen" in the russian money field. That is borne out by the  experience of the successful illegal banking activity of the  "Russkiy Dom Seleng," GMM, and others.    Proceeding from this premise we insist that GMM and other  similar companies which have already appeared and perhaps intend  to develop their activity should be eternally thankful to the  Central Bank for its total inability to offer any resistance to  the illegal financiers.</p>

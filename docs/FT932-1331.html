			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Backbenchers meet tonight on defiant Mates MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday refused to give unequivocal support to Mr Michael Mates, as a leaked letter confirmed the minister's detailed representations on behalf of Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman. The career of Mr Mates, the minister at the centre of the row over Tory links with Mr Nadir, appears to hang largely on the verdict of Tory MPs, and a meeting of the 1922 committee of backbench Conservatives tonight may determine his fate. Friends of Mr Mates suggested that the Northern Ireland minister had on several occasions protested about the behaviour of the Serious Fraud Office. Further evidence of his involvement emerged last night with the Daily Mail's publication of a letter from Mr Mates to Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, complaining about Inland Revenue investigations. The newspaper said the letter showed Mr Mates was questioning the way the police were handling the fraud investigation against Mr Nadir. The minister also expressed his 'concerns about the injustice of the way this case is being handled'. Mr Mates's decision to meet Mr Nadir days before his flight to Cyprus was a response to the businessman's 'suicidal' mood after the seizure of some of his defence papers. There were also suggestions that the Greek security services could have been behind attempts to wreck Mr Nadir's business empire. Mr Mates did not consult Mr Major before saying this week that he had the prime minister's 'full support'. He was said to believe that the pressure for his removal was starting to abate, and last night his friends indicated that he was determined to remain in the government. Downing Street, however, refused to endorse Mr Mates's choice of words - signalling that the prime minister was still ready to accept Mr Mates's resignation, although he was reluctant to sack him. Mr Mates was said to have strongly denied reports that he believed that British security services had been involved in a plot to destabilise Mr Nadir's Polly Peck business empire. He had also not raised any complaints about the conduct of the attorney general's office in the investigation. The minister was said to have flatly rejected suggestions that he had threatened to embarrass the government if forced to stand down. Among Conservative MPs there remains disquiet at Mr Mates's gift of a watch to Mr Nadir and the loan of a car by a public-relations adviser working for the businessman. That could still harden into calls for Mr Mates to be told by the 1922 exec-utive that he ought to resign. Mr Mates is understood to believe that a full account of his relationship with Mr Nadir - and his representations on behalf of the fugitive tycoon - eventually would exonerate him from any wrongdoing. Downing Street has consistently said that Mr Mates's gift of a watch was a mistake, 'but not a hanging offence'. It described the loan of a car as 'a trivial matter'. Neither incident had worried Sir Robin Butler, cabinet secretary, who polices the official guidelines to ministers. Meanwhile, some senior MPs were arguing that for Mr Mates to resign this week would make it appear as if the press had hounded another minister from office. It would be better for the Northern Ireland minister to leave government in Mr Major's next reshuffle, they said. But others were convinced that he should go immediately. 'There is no way we are going to let him off,' said one. Some expressed concern that Mr Major was failing the test of his authority created by Mr Mates's attempts to brazen out calls for him to resign.</p>

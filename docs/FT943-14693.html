			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Charter bid for Esab attacked Trade unions at Esab, the world's leading producer of welding equipment, have attacked a takeover bid by Charter of the UK, saying the offer undervalues the Swedish group and threatens its future in Sweden. In a campaign carrying echoes of last year's revolt that halted the proposed merger between Volvo and France's Renault, the unions at Esab have written to shareholders appealing to them not to accept the bid made by Charter at the end of last month and recommended by the Esab board. Charter, which offered Dollars 400m (Pounds 255m) for Esab, has already acquired votes worth more than 50 per cent through the 49 per cent voting stake previously held by Incentive, the Swedish industrial group controlled by the Wallenberg family, and further share purchases. But it needs 90 per cent to take over Esab fully and the trade unions hope that Swedish institutions will refuse to sell to Charter. The bid deadline is August 12. White and blue-collar unions at Esab have attacked the fitness of Charter, which until now has focused on building materials, coal and rail track equipment, to run the company. Mr Stefan Larsson, representing Esab's white-collar workers, civil engineers and metal workers, claimed that many inside the company were alarmed by public comments by Mr Jeffrey Herbert, Charter chief executive, suggesting Esab required further restructuring. He added that Esab's six-month results, due on August 8, were expected to show sharply improved profits, with the outlook suggesting that 1994 earnings would top the SKr300m (Pounds 25m) previously forecast. Profits were expected to grow strongly again in 1995 to between SKr500 and Skr600m. 'In that perspective we believe the bid is too low,' he said. The largest Esab shareholder after Incentive is Fourth Fund, a state pension fund, with 6.2 per cent of the votes. It has trade unionists on its board and played an important role in the Volvo-Renault affair. Mr Thomas Halvosen, the fund's chief executive, said the fund was aware of the trade union objections but would not decide on its position until after it had scrutinised Esab's half-year results.</p>

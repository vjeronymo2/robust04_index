			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, June 21 (CTK) -- Results of a recent  "giant" poll surveying political preferences among almost 12,000  Czech residents "exactly illustrate the thesis that the support  of government policy spreads across (all) social layers," writes  the latest issue of the Czech political weekly RESPEKT.    The poll recently conducted by the Center of Empirical  Research (STEM) showed that only three of the four right-wing  government coalition parties and three of the six opposition  parties would gain parliamentary seats in the elections "if held  tomorrow", Vladimir Mlynar states in the paper.    According to the poll, the coalition Civic Democratic Party  (ODS) would fill more than one-third of parliament, while the  Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) and the Christian Democratic  Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) would gain 12 and 7  percent of votes respectively. (At present the ODS has 65  deputies in the 200-seat Czech Parliament, and the ODA and the  KDU-CSL each 15.)    As to the opposition, the Czech Social Democratic Party  (CSSD) and the Left Bloc grouping (LB, including communists)  would be given each 13 percent of votes. The extreme-right  opposition Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican  Party (SPR-RSC) would follow with 5 percent.    "At least from two points of view, the situation in the  Czech  Republic is the same as that two years ago: The ODS would again  absolutely win the elections, and every fifth Czech would again  vote for the extreme political forces -- the communists and the  Sladek-led republicans," Mlynar comments.    "It is interesting that only a little more than one-third of  the population claims to support the right-wing parties, while  full 40 percent say they back the center policy (the remaining  20 percent are followers of left-wing parties). In simple  words: At least two people out of five preferring the parties  describing themselves as right-oriented, claim their support for  the center. This logically implies that almost a half of the  followers of the (right-wing government) coalition policy do not  view this policy as a right-wing but as a center one," Mlynar  writes.    He also focuses on the extent of the support given to Czech  political parties by individual population groups. If the  elections were attended only by workers, who form the  traditionally left-orientated part of the society, the  government coalition would win with 40 percent of their votes  (out of which 25 percent would be gained by the ODS, and 10  percent and 5 percent by the ODA and the KDU-CSL respectively).  Only one-fourth of the workers would prefer the left-wing  parties (the CSSD -- 16 percent, the LB -- 8 percent).    The coalition's election victory would be sure among  entrepreneurs (the ODS, the ODA and the KDU-CSL would gain 49,  15 and 4 percent respectively), Mlynar states.    "The forces are less or more balanced with pensioners --  one-  third of them wants to vote for the right wing, while only a  little less (28 percent) are supporters of the left-leaning  opposition," he continues.    The unemployed equally split concerning political parties.  They would give the 17-percent support to the SPR-RSC, 16  percent of votes to the ODS, while most of the remaining parties  each would gain about 10 percent from them.    With the other layers of the society, such as clerks,  tradesmen and even housewives, the predominance of the coalition  parties is more than evident, Mlynar says.    The coalition would also clearly win among "specialists",  that is intellectuals. However, the poll surprisingly showed  that almost seven percent of these people were intending to vote  for SPR-RSC leader Miroslav Sladek, Mlynar points out.    "With the exception of the ODS, which -- with a certain  simplification -- could be viewed as the party backed by  entrepreneurs and clerks, our parties have not any firm social  backing as yet," Mlynar writes. "Although party preferences have  not undergone any significant changes during long months, there  still exists a certain space for change. In other words, there  still remains a chance for an opposition pursuing a reasonable  policy," Mlynar comments.    However, a miracle would probably have to occur for, let us  say, present social democrats to succeed in addressing the  workers. The first pre-requisite would have to be a change of  party rhetoric, which is, as permanently proved by CSSD Chairman  Milos Zeman, above the party's capability, Mlynar adds.</p>

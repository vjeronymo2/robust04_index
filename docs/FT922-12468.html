			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / International Company News: Windows fuels Microsoft climb MICROSOFT, the leading personal computer software publisher, reported a 44 per cent rise in earnings for its third fiscal quarter, buoyed by continuing strong sales of its Windows operating system program, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco. Net income for the quarter, ended March 31, was Dollars 179m, or 90 cents per share, up from Dollars 124m, or 65 cents, in the third quarter of fiscal 1991. Revenues were Dollars 681m, an increase of almost 40 per cent over Dollars 487m in the same period a year ago. The third-quarter results reflected record revenues from sales to personal computer manufacturers and continued strong retail sales, the company said. 'More than 200 OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) around the world have licensed the Microsoft Windows operating system,' said Mr Frank Gaudette, executive vice-president and chief financial officer. The third-quarter results capped a week in which Microsoft won important rulings in its copyright infringement dispute with Apple Computer, lifting the cloud of litigation that has hung over Microsoft's Windows program.</p>

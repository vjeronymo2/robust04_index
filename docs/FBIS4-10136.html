			<p>BFN     [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said the  great efforts of the Cuban people are aimed at increasing  production and exports. In a news conference held in Montevideo,  Uruguay, where he is carrying out an official visit, Robaina  stressed that the Cuban Government decided to associate itself  with foreign capital as an alternative for development in  determined spheres such as tourism, oil, and nickel. Robaina  added that Cuba's economic problems will not be solved with  foreign investments alone.    In explaining the human rights issue, Robaina said that in  Cuba there are no disappearances or tortured people. In  contrast, Robaina highlighted that for some time now, every  Cuban generation has participated in the government.    Robaina also held meetings with members of the Latin  American  Integration Association and with members of solidarity  organizations with Cuba. In the latter, Robaina stated that  Havana hopes to establish normal relations with Cuban emigres  residing in 15 countries, and that the upcoming forum The Nation  and the Emigre Community will help achieve just that.    Cuban Foreign Minister Robaina is carrying out a tour  through  Uruguay, Peru, Argentina and Paraguay aimed at expanding and  strengthening the bilateral relations between Cuba and those  South American states.</p>

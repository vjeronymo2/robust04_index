			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Public funds are speeded up to help rescue private hospital A private hospital set up to cater for patients from overseas has been saved from the brink of receivership by its bankers and by the Scottish Office only three months after opening. One lender to Health Care International, a Pounds 180m hospital at Clydebank near Glasgow, is understood to have become alarmed at the small number of patients being treated in the hospital. A consortium of banks agreed two weeks ago, however, to advance more money and the Scottish Office speeded up payment of a grant to ensure the company's survival. Labour last night demanded a Commons select committee investigation into the government's role in funding the hospital. Unison, the public-sector union, also demanded an inquiry. About Pounds 29m in public funding has been paid or committed to the project, including regional selective assistance, capital allowances due to its construction in an enterprise zone, and loans and equity from Scottish Enterprise, the development body. In addition, Pounds 9.3m was spent by the Scottish Development Agency on clearing the site, which had been contaminated with asbestos. The 260-bed hospital offers acute treatment to patients who are unable easily to obtain treatment in their home countries and who cannot afford to go to the US for treatment. The project was conceived by two Harvard professors, Dr Angelo Eraklis and Dr Raphael Levey, who obtained equity and loan financing through the City of London. It is understood that ING Bank, one of the leading banks in the Netherlands, became alarmed at the hospital's trading position since its opening in June. The fear that it might put the company into receivership led to concerted action by the other banks in the lending syndicate to save the company. The syndicate, which had advanced a total of Pounds 90m, made more funds available to HCI. Its other members are Samuel Montagu, Midland Bank, Credit Lyonnais and Royal Bank of Scotland. HCI is trying to raise a further Pounds 15m in equity by October 14 to reassure the banks. HCI said it approached its equity investors three months ago for money in addition to the Pounds 35m already invested, in order to strengthen the balance sheet and fund other projects abroad. The equity investors are led by Harvard Management, which invests money for Harvard University. Others are Montgomery Medical Ventures, Samuel Montagu, John Laing, Abu Dhabi Investment Company, British Aerospace and Drake &amp; Scull. Mr Andrew Gordon, one of the hospital's executive directors, said: 'We have nothing to fear from any investigation of the support the government had given us, which is completely above board.' He confirmed that the venture had decided to seek an extra Pounds 15m but denied that it had been thrown into crisis by a shortage of patients. Mr Gordon said: 'We are either bang on or fractionally ahead of our budget for patient admissions. That is not to say we are full, but we did not expect the build-up to be quick.'</p>

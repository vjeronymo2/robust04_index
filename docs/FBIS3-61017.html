Maucharov and Candidate of Technical  Sciences A. Lapin under the rubric "The Floor to the Test  Pilots": "A Good Aircraft Means a Well-Tested One"]    [Text] The flight testing of the latest combat aircraft is  one of the most labor-intensive and crucial stages in the  overall process of realizing the program of equipping the Air  Forces and naval aviation of the Russian Federation with them.  It is namely at that stage, after all, that an objective  evaluation is made of the new ideas and engineering solutions  made inherent by the designers in their aircraft, and the fine  tuning of the whole aircraft system is performed. The  suitability of a prototype for the performance of the combat  tasks that define its purpose is evaluated, and recommendations  on the possibility of putting the aircraft system into service  and beginning series production are made, only according to the  results of full-scale ground and flight check-out and testing  under conditions that approximate operational ones. Flight  testing itself, including the preparations for it, makes up more  than half of the amount and duration of the time and financial  resources allocated for the creation of an aircraft system.    A good aircraft means a well-tested one. This exceedingly  topical subject has already been raised in the article by test  pilot A. Akimenkov, "What Keeps Our Aircraft From Being Better"  (AVIATSIYA I KOSMONAVTIKA No. 7, 1990). The author invited  interested readers to discuss it. We would thus like to dwell,  relying on many years of personal experience in participating in  the testing and refinement of new aircraft systems, on the  principal shortcomings that are characteristic of the process of  creating and adopting aircraft hardware in the field, and try to  determine ways of eliminating them.    We would note, first and foremost, that the amount and  duration of flight testing and its quality and effectiveness  depend on many factors, some of which are fundamental. We will  thus begin the process with an analysis of the process of  formulating the preliminary specifications (TTZ). These are  traditionally prepared on the basis of the results of scientific  research and experimental inquiry that are performed at the  corresponding institutions of the customer and the principal  executor, a comprehensive and objective analysis of the  conceptual framework of the combat aircraft from the standpoint  of its feasibility, the effective utilization of world  scientific and technical achievements and actual capabilities  for the creation of the new aircraft system with the assigned  characteristics within the stipulated time frame.    All of the enumerated conditions are unfortunately far from  fulfilled in domestic practice. And the point is not, as  Akimenkov asserts, that the lead executor taking part in the  formulation of the conceptual framework of a combat aircraft  system supposedly "possesses every reason both to force his  point of view onto the problem and to defend his own interests  first and foremost," or even that "by the moment of write-up of  the TTZ the final decision, as a rule, has been made." These  assertions do not conform to reality.    The chief reason, in our opinion, is the fact that the  realization of the TTZ in experimental design is not supported  by the requisite scientific, engineering and production  potential in industry; the full set of equipment and assemblies  for the aircraft system reaches flight testing, as a rule,  without proper autonomous and comprehensive working out owing to  the restricted operating capabilities of the test-bench and  modeling bases, means of preliminary assessment of the  operability of aircraft systems in the course of physical  testing (using flying laboratories and models and  flight-modeling systems) and other reasons that are sometimes of  a purely organizational nature.    The results of the fulfillment of the comprehensive program  of testing of an aircraft system depend, to no small extent, on  the technology for performing the flight testing that was  formulated at the stage of preliminary design engineering of the  new aircraft, the completeness of the implementation of measures  within the framework of preparing the airfield technical gear of  the test bases, the test-track equipment and the flight-control  and target-guidance systems, the degree of simulation of  hypothetical operation, the quality of the target equipment on  the test range etc. The arrival of the prototypes for the  performance of ground and flight testing according to plan is  also an exceedingly material factor.    The resolution of all of these issues is largely conditioned  by the organizational structure of the testing process--the  principles for its planning, control and monitoring, the forms  of interaction between the general customer and the principal  executor and between military scientific institutions and  organizations within those agencies, the clear-cut division of  responsibilities (including financial) for the quality and  deadlines for support and the performance of concrete types of  ground and flight operations.    We cite as confirmation summary indicators of the flight  testing (its overall duration, the number of flights within a  fixed calendar period, the quantity and rate of deliveries of  prototypes for testing) of the Su-24, MiG-25, MiG-23, MiG-31  domestic combat aircraft and the analogous American F-111,  F-15C/D, F-14 and F-16. We will moreover proceed from the fact  that we, as well as our colleagues across the ocean, adhere to  the following conceptual model for the performance of flight  testing: the realization of a comprehensive program should be  fit into a stipulated time period, with the achievement of more  complete conformity of the characteristics of the aircraft  prototype to the requirements of the TTZ, and the expenditures  should not exceed the amount of financing allocated.    The duration of the testing of domestic prototypes of  aircraft, with virtually the identical number of aircraft (14)  submitted for flight and ground operations, proved to be almost  twice that of the foreign ones (6 and 3.5 years respectively).  This is despite the fact that flight programs in the United  States exceed our analogous ones by 70--80 percent, since the  Americans conduct testing across a broader range of conditions  for the combat application of the aircraft (this pertains to the  target and jamming environments on the test ranges, and climate  and other conditions). Their program moreover includes all the  types of field (operational) testing necessary to resolve the  the issue of putting the prototype into service.    The markedly longer period for the testing of domestic  aircraft systems compared to the United States is connected with  the low rate of test flights (350 and 850 a year respectively);  the average annual flying time of our experimental aircraft is  thus 2.5 times less than the American ones.    Such a large difference in the flight utilization of the  aircraft being tested is in this case the consequence of a  number of reasons:    --first, the low level of finishing of the individual  constituent elements that are installed in domestic experimental  aircraft, and the incompleteness of equipment ready for  operation in the prototypes being tested;    --second, the greater losses of flight time caused, in turn,  by the necessity of eliminating design and production  shortcomings and defects that are revealed and the performance  of finishing and reconditioning work, as well as the imposition  of a number of restrictions for weather conditions and bans on  flights;    --third, the insufficiently broad scope of the concurrent  testing and refinement of experimental prototypes of  scientific-research and experimental work on test benches,  modeling systems and flying laboratories;    --fourth, the poor incorporation into flight-test practice  of  automated systems for the processing and analysis of flight  information in real time, as well as the control of the flight  experiment from a joint command post.    More than 70 percent of the calendar year here, all in all,  is not spent for conducting test flights. Roughly half of them  (by and large in the initial stages) moreover do not work  through their flight assignments fully for various reasons (poor  reliability of the physical equipment, prevailing test  conditions etc.). This naturally requires that they be repeated,  leading to a significant increase in the time and material  expenditures relegated for the realization of the whole program.    The rate of delivery of aircraft prototypes is an extremely  important factor affecting the duration of aircraft testing. A  procedure has been established in the United States, for  example, under which all prototypes arrive for testing by and  large within the first two years of its start. A broad range of  work to finish up and refine constituent elements and the  aircraft system as a whole is thus ensured thereby. The  principal delivery of aircraft here, on the contrary, is made  during the second half of the testing period, which leads to the  inefficient utilization of the inventory and, as a result, to  poor results in the realization of the overall program.    The average statistical data cited pertain chiefly to  fourth-generation fighters whose testing was conducted in the  1970s. Let us now compare the testing of the latest F-15E and  Su-27 fighters.    The characteristic features of the F-15E that represent a  profound modification of the F-15C/D aircraft are the efficient  utilization of organic systems of on-board equipment and  weaponry that have acquitted themselves well; their modification  and modernization in accordance with the high requirements posed  for tactical and combat performance characteristics of the  aircraft system, reliability and operational service life; and,  the limited incorporation of fundamentally new engineering that  nonetheless ensures the fulfillment of the requirements posed  for the aircraft prototype as a whole in the TTZ.    The program of creating a new combat fighter and equipping  it  for the Air Force, in accordance with the practice that has  taken shape in the United States over the last decade, was  entrusted to a supervisor who possessed broad authority and the  corresponding staff apparatus, including a joint testing team.  The composition of that team included representatives of the  testing and operational subunits of the Air Force and the  developer firms.    The testing was conducted according to uniform plans,  programs and techniques for flight and ground operations with  overall technical and economic support. The course of the  operations and the results of testing were moreover under the  constant observation and monitoring of the customer from the  very start.    The composite schedule for the flight testing of the F-15E  envisaged gradually bringing its individual constituent  elements, and the aircraft as a whole, to the assigned  parameters. The comprehensive plan encompassed an eight-year  period, the first half of which (from 1983 through 1986) was  devoted to conducting ground and flight operations before the  experimental prototypes arrived for flight testing. The power  plant, external fuel tanks, on-board radar set, digital flight  control system etc. were all finished up during that time.    The whole program, proceeding from dedicated tasks, was  subdivided into stages. Responsibility was divided in clear-cut  fashion between the customer and the principal developer firm in  each of the stages (depending on the content of the operations,  the tasks that faced the testing team and specific  organizational and departmental features), both on questions of  both logistical and metrological support and in the performance  of concrete experimental research. Questions of a financial and  economic nature were comprehensively discussed therein.    The dedicated planning of operations was furthermore  oriented  first and foremost toward the widespread utilization of  supermodern computers, providing for the processing and analysis  of information in real time; toward modeling and the active  management of the flight experiment in conjunction with the  testing, which made it possible to obtain more complete data  promptly; and, toward reducing risks when making the test  flights. The program envisaged, aside form this, the separate  finishing up and comprehensive check-out of the functionality of  various systems of the aircraft system depending on the degree  of their completion. It must be noted that the start of the next  stage of the operations did not depend on the completion times  of the prior one. Most of the types of testing were conducted in  parallel, with a regard for the planned delivery of experimental  aircraft and their constituent elements. This procedure made it  possible to augment the quality of the constituent systems and  the aircraft as a whole as early as during the course of the  testing itself, in essence realizing the principle of "separate  start--simultaneous finish."    The first experimental F-15E was officially turned over to  the Air Force Flight Center for further testing just two months  after making its first flight (it was required by the developer  to clarify the allowable flight modes). The preliminary  refinement testing of the principal constituent parts of the  aircraft system was started at once at the flight center in  accordance with the procedure stipulated by the U.S. Department  of Defense. The autonomous and comprehensive verification of the  functionality of the on-board electronics equipment,  navigational and flight-control gear and weapons systems was  accomplished chiefly using flying laboratories and specialized  land bases. The effectiveness of the new combat aircraft as a  whole was subsequently evaluated.    Field testing was conducted, in parallel with the pursuit of  this set of measures, by the corresponding subunits of the Air  Force under a so-called accelerated program--the combat  qualities and operational suitability of the aircraft were  comprehensively evaluated, overall guidelines for raising them  were devised and the retraining of flight, engineering and  technical personnel was conducted. The initial combat flight of  the F-15E was thus provided for, as was planned, in the middle  of 1990.    The performance of testing and refinement of the aircraft in  such a short time (just four years) was largely facilitated by  the observance of the optimal schedule for the delivery of  experimental prototypes (three the first year, two the second  and one the third) and the high rate of test flights (an average  of ten per aircraft per month). The latter was achieved thanks  to the efficient utilization of those airfield means that  supported the possibility of the safe performance of flights  virtually around the clock and under any weather conditions, the  efficient management of the flight experiment from the ground,  the processing and analysis of flight information in real time,  the aerial refueling of the aircraft while performing individual  tasks and a host of other measures, including some of an  organizational-technical nature.    A large proportionate share of new structural and design  ideas being embodied for the first time in the aerodynamic  configuration, aircraft and weapons control systems, piloting  and navigational equipment and on-board defensive systems was  typical of the Su-27, as opposed to the F-15E. The testing of  the Su-27 was conducted in accordance with the practices of many  years that have taken shape here, which are based to a certain  extent on prevailing statutes on the procedure for creating  aircraft for military purposes. The fulfillment of the whole  flight program, according to the results of which the decision  was made to put the aircraft system into service, required about  13 (!) years--three times more than the Americans needed to test  and adopt the F-15E. Such a prolonged period for the testing of  the Su-27 by today's standards, aside from the other reasons  indicated, was also connected with the poor flight return on the  inventory of experimental aircraft (an average of four flights a  month per aircraft).    The following should be kept in mind first and foremost in  discussing the quality of the latest domestic combat aircraft.  The look of the "standard" prototype, as well as recommendations  pertaining to the procedure for putting it into service and  submitting it for series production, was formulated according to  the results of state testing--which does not include, as has  already been emphasized, specific questions of field testing--in  accordance with prevailing directive documents governing the  course of testing and the adoption of combat aircraft into  service. The final decision is made by the government, as  represented by the Ministry of Defense. State interests,  connected first and foremost with the plans for equipping the  Air Forces (or Navy) with a combat aircraft system, the process  of assimilating new production technologies and the functional  aging of the aircraft, and conditioned in particular by the  duration of the period of its creation, are entirely naturally  taken into account therein. This, and a host of other aspects,  could have a marked impact on the decision on the fate of a  prototype even before its field testing, during which experience  in the operation and combat application of the new aircraft is  accumulated. The elimination of a number of shortcomings  revealed in the course of that testing and the making of the  necessary refinements to individual constituent parts of the  aircraft system, under the procedure that exists here, are  accomplished in the stage of series production, which slows the  process of the entry of the new aircraft into service as a  result.    In order for this not to happen, it is essential, in our  opinion, to make a fundamental review ahead of time of the basic  principles for the organization of operations in the creation of  new combat aircraft with an orientation toward foreign  experience (and first and foremost the United States). And we  would like to single out the basic steps aimed at reducing the  time frames and material expenditures in developing aviation  hardware, as well as increasing its quality, in this regard.    The program for the creation and field adoption of combat  aircraft, it seems to us, should be formulated and realized by a  collegial body of the type of a state interagency council,  headed by a supervisor of the program (named either by the  general customer or the lead executor) who would exercise  overall leadership and coordination of the work, answer for its  performance in the required amount and be given the powers of a  legal person to conclude contracts, expend financial resources,  perform monitoring, employ sanctions etc.    A comprehensive program containing all the types of  operations and the measures supporting them that are required  for the scientific and technical substantiation of the TTZ and  the performance of experimental design (design engineering,  manufacture and testing), in an amount necessary for the  evaluation of the constituent elements and the prototype as a  whole in accordance with the preliminary specifications and the  overall technical requirements of the Ministry of Defense,  should be at the foundation of the activity of the council.    A joint testing team, composed of representatives of the  corresponding organizations of the customer and the executor,  should be one of the principal structural subdivisions of the  council. Its direct participation in operations at all stages of  the creation of an aircraft system--from the formulation of the  TTZ right through to its adoption in line units--is mandatory  therein.    The testing team should become the principal executor of the  schedule of flight testing, which envisages a whole set of  operations to refine the prototype as well as to perform field  testing, according to a program whose fulfillment would make it  possible to draw fully substantiated conclusions on the  expediency of putting the aircraft into service and starting its  series production.    The combat aircraft systems being created should complete  joint (with the simultaneous participation of the executor and  the customer) state testing (SGI). SGI, as compared to the  flight-design or state testing that is currently conducted by  these agencies independently, has the following advantages:    --the overall organization of the planning, management and  monitoring of the preparation and performance of flight and  ground operations would undoubtedly lead to a reduction in the  expenditures of time and material resources, including through  an increase in the rate and efficacy of test flights;    --the implementation of flexible planning would provide an  opportunity to adjust the course of operations at various stages  in the creation of an aircraft system, and to make timely  decisions in that regard;    --uniform requirements would finally be devised for  test-track complexes, target equipment at test ranges, the  technological support of operations and the techniques for  evaluating the characteristics of a prototype being tested;    --a real opportunity would appear for the clear-cut  delimitation of functions and responsibility among all of the  testing participants on questions of coordination, the efficient  utilization of the testing physical plant, the experimental and  auxiliary aircraft inventory, airfield and test-range equipment,  systems of automated information processing and databases for  the management of flight experiments that are common to all  parties;    --a unification of the efforts of the highly skilled  engineering and flight personnel of the testers and the military  specialists in the operational subunits would certainly have an  effect on raising the scientific and technical level of  operations and the safety of the test flights, make it possible  to resolve issues of the refinement of aircraft systems promptly  and reduce to a minimum the expenditures of time and the  consumption of material resources during the period of  assimilation of series production of the new hardware and the  start of its entry into service with line units;    --SGI, as opposed to the program of aircraft testing being  practiced today in which the principle of its division according  to departmental traits is inherent, would envisage its  realization depending on the requirements for the stage-by-stage  refinement of the constituent elements of the aircraft system;    --a separate stage of SGI could be allotted to measures  (carried out with the aim of issuing findings for the production  of a limited lot of the aircraft) whose results would make it  possible to determine the range of fulfillment of work  operations projected earlier, and to evaluate in comprehensive  fashion the conditions for its full-scale series production and  successful assimilation in line units;    --special testing could also be performed (as one of the  stages in the overall program), by decision of the program  supervisor, to reveal the specific features of the field  operation of the prototype and further improvements in its  combat characteristics.    The following must also be noted: preliminary (plant) flight  testing of the aircraft should be conducted--during the process  of which it would be possible to evaluate the functionality of  all systems and, if necessary, bring them to a level that  reliably supports the safe performance of flights under  SGI--before beginning SGI.    We would like to hope that these recommendations will be  taken into account to a certain extent when the conceptual  framework for a new statute on the creation of aircraft for  military purposes is formulated under today's difficult economic  conditions.

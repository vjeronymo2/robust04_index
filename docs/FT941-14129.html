			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Simon Eng aims for Pounds 40m from disposals Simon Engineering, maker of access equipment including fire rescue gear, yesterday announced plans to raise Pounds 40m through disposals and warned of a small operating loss for the second half of 1993. The disposals of both businesses and properties are part of a plan aimed at cutting debt and concentrating on core markets. Since Mr Maurice Dixson became chief executive in a boardroom shake-out of the group in September, debt has declined from Pounds 148m to Pounds 128m. The reduction has followed the sale of Simon's 50 per cent share in TR Oil Services last month for Pounds 6.2m and three smaller sales worth a total of Pounds 2.5m. In addition, the group said it had introduced tight cash controls in the second half, resulting in a positive cash flow. 'We're making the progress that we said we would, and quite a bit is coming early in the cycle,' said Mr Dixson yesterday. 'This is not rhetoric, but real things happening.' Talks are continuing on the sale of Houston-based Unichem International to the Western Company of North America, which could raise up to Pounds 12m. Discussions on property sales that could realise Pounds 10m were 'at an advanced stage,' the group said. Shares in the group fell by 10p to 128p - still more than double the price when Mr Dixson was appointed. An extraordinary meeting is scheduled for February 7 to seek approval for borrowings of up to Pounds 175m, 'a limit the board considers to be prudent.' Without the increase, the group, which is still in discussions with its lenders in both the US and the UK, would be unable to secure continued financing. Simon warned that in spite of 'a significant improvement' at the operating level, it expects a small operating loss in the second half. The pre-tax loss will also reflect a Pounds 90m write-down of goodwill carried in the reserves, in addition to the Pounds 10.6m already written off at half-way. It also announced that it was making provision for expected losses on disposals of Pounds 2.9m for 1994; a provision of Pounds 7.3m to cover the early repayment of Dollars 125m of loan notes; and Pounds 1.5m above the Pounds 6m made at the half-way stage for refinancing.</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Waigel unveils steep budget cuts MR Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, yesterday unveiled plans to cut state spending across the board to cope with the consequences of 'the sharpest economic crisis' since the foundation of the German federal republic in 1949. He promised a law to reduce welfare benefit levels, an indefinite extension of the ban on new programmes which have no compensatory cuts to finance them, and a medium term ceiling of 2.75 per cent annual growth in state spending - half the forecast nominal growth rate of 5.5 per cent. The severe cuts in social spending programmes, including unemployment and retraining subsidies, met furious criticism from the opposition Social Democrats in the German parliament yesterday, which was voting on the last round of more modest budget cuts. The new package is supposed to find extra savings of at least DM20bn (Pounds 7.9bn) in 1994, in order to keep the central government budget deficit down to DM70bn. But the real squeeze is on longer term spending, to prevent the current recession-induced deficit becoming a structural one. Mr Waigel warned that Germany must change its attitude, and could no longer plan on the basis of steadily increasing economic welfare. 'Whether real gross national product falls by 1.5 per cent, 2.0 per cent or even more, is not the decisive question,' he said. 'The decisive thing is rather that all plans and expectations for constantly increasing prosperity must be revised. 'In the space of just two years, in 1993 and 1994, we must support both socially and financially almost 1m additional unemployed workers,' he said. 'And we must continue to support the revival of the east (Germany) on the basis of a significantly weaker western economy.' Mr Helmut Wieczoreck, the SPD budget spokesman, described the proposed cuts in welfare benefits, such as a 3 per cent cut in unemployment benefits, as 'an act of social piracy'. Mr Rudolf Dressler, deputy leader of the SPD in parliament and its social affairs spokesman, accused the government of seeking to dismantle the welfare state, and impose all its spending cuts at the expense of the weakest in society. Mr Waigel has given himself little more than a month to negotiate his DM20bn budget cuts for 1994, before the draft budget has to be approved by the cabinet in early July. It will then go before parliament in September. At present there looks to be little prospect of an agreement with the opposition on the necessary cuts in social spending, which means that the budget could be blocked in the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, where the SPD has a majority. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, who resigned this week as president of Germany's powerful I G Metall trade union amid allegations of insider trading, is being investigated on suspicion of tax evasion, the Frankfurt prosecutor's office said yesterday, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.</p>

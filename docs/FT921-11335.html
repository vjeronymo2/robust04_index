			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / OFT move throws ruling over pubs into confusion ATTEMPTS by Britain's big brewers to reduce their estates of tied public houses to comply with government orders were thrown into confusion yesterday by the Office of Fair Trading. The OFT said 734 pubs which the brewing group, Allied Lyons, was planning to lease to Brent Walker, the troubled leisure group, would still be counted as belonging to the tied estate. Allied supplies beer to Brent Walker pubs under a separate contract. Allied hoped the deal would help it meet the government requirement that it should free 2,380 pubs from ties, or exclusive beer supply contracts. The OFT has been reviewing a complex deal between the Allied and Brent Walker. The OFT's decision came as a shock to Brent Walker. It believed there were no obstacles to the deal after the Department of Trade and Industry said in the morning that it would not refer the transaction to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Brent Walker is in the process of trying to persuade its banks to reschedule and restructure Pounds 1.5bn of debt. A vital condition of the restructuring is the completion of the pub deal with Allied. However, Brent Walker's chief executive, Mr Ken Scobie, said he was confident that the deal with Allied would still go ahead. 'The key condition for us was that there should not be a reference to the MMC.' He said there was a fall-back clause in the agreement with Allied which would allow the deal to go ahead on different beer supply terms. An adviser to Brent Walker said that this might involve changing the lease terms, but that it would not change the overall financial attractions for Brent Walker. For a year, Brent Walker has been perilously poised between rescue and receivership. Yesterday its banks agreed to a further extension, until the end of February, of standstill on loan repayments. A banker said that agreement from all 50 banks was not given until minutes before yesterday's deadline. The OFT's view of the pubs deal - supported by Treasury counsel - was that Allied's continuing interest in the pub properties coupled with an agreement. Under the agreement, it would supply Brent Walker pubs with an estimated 250,000 barrels of beer a year for seven years effectively 'tied' the pubs to the Allied estate. Allied said last night that it wants to proceed with the deal but would be seeking clarification of the OFT's views. Its legal advice was that the leasing arrangement would free the 734 pubs from the tie and would not infringe the beer orders, it said. This would certainly involve either reducing the period or the amount of beer supplies to Brent Walker - and thus reducing the value of the deal to Allied. Apart from the disposal of the pubs, the other main attraction for Allied was the fact that supplying the enlarged Brent Walker estate of more than 1,800 pubs would lift its share of the UK beer market by up to 1 per cent. Allied announced last month that it had agreed a similar deal, involving the lease of 142 pubs and a supply of beers, to Burtonwood Brewery, the north-west regional brewer. The turn of events yesterday will also cast further doubt over the government's response to its proposed merger of its brewing interests with the UK operations of Carlsberg, the Danish brewer, in a Pounds 510m joint venture, Carlsberg-Tetley. That merger would give the combined group an 18-19 per cent share of the beer market, putting it into third place close behind Bass and Courage. Allied Lyons' shares rose 18p to 661p but fell back to close at 649p, a gain of 6p. Brent Walker's shares closed 2p higher at 14p. Lex Page 24</p>

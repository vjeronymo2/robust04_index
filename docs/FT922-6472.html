			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: How to find a fee-charging financial adviser HOW DO you find a fee-charging financial adviser when you need one? Few advertise their services too strenuously, for sound commercial reasons. 'Come to us for advice and we'll ask you for money, even if you don't buy anything,' would not be a good sales pitch. As yet, there are few advisers who operate solely on a fee basis, but the number prepared to offer this option is growing fast. The names of 1,500 prepared to charge fees are available in a register - arguably the best available - published by Money Management magazine and administered by Professional Life, but many 'swing both ways' and do the bulk of their business through commission. Money Management takes no responsibility for the advisers on its list. But if you consult one and find the standard offered is unacceptable, report this and the adviser will be knocked off the register. The magazine will send you details of six advisers near you, and it is worth investigating all of them. Send your enquiry to: Money Management Fee-Based Adviser Register, Financial Times Business Information, Greystoke Place, Fetter Lane, London EC4A 1ND. Remember to include your postcode, since this is used to locate the nearest firms of advisers in your area. The Institute of Financial Planning is attempting a slightly more ambitious project. Its registry of financial planning practitioners will include all those who have passed the IFP's examinations on financial planning, and who will abide by its code of practice. This includes offering a financial planning service separate from any investment business, if required. The registry is still being compiled, and is likely to have a rather smaller list of members than the Money Management list, but it will aim to include all those satisfying the IFP criteria who charge fees. Details are available on 0432-274-8991. The IFP is, however, an embryonic professional body. If you specifically need the services of an accountant, a longer-established organisation can help. The Institute of Chartered Accountants (head office: 071-606-7060) is divided into 22 regional offices. Your local branch will be able to provide the names of the firms nearest to you. Again, it is wise to check all of them; most will give basic details of fees and services without charge. The Law Society (head office: 071-242-1222) offers a similar service and publishes the Solicitors' Regional Directory, available in all public libraries and citizens' advice bureaux. This gives details of all qualified solicitors in your region and their special fields and should guide you quickly to those suited best to will-writing or estate-planning. The complete register is available at the Law Society's shop in the Strand, London.</p>

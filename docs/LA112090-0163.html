			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: THAT'S A WRAP: END OF MGM/UA THAT WAS  </P> <P> The transmogrification of the old Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is, as it turns out, the  end not of one era but of two. The purchase of the MGM/UA Communications Co. by  Pathe Communications Corp., completed at the start of November, is the last  cutting of the cord to the MGM that was. The new logo will be MGM-Pathe. And at  the same time the UA logo will disappear into history after 71 memorable years.  </P> <P> By present plan, "Rocky V," just being released, and the next (and probably  final) James Bond film will be the last to carry the United Artists label.  </P> <P> The great MGM lot that Louis B. Mayer built is now the home of Columbia, a  Japanese corporation. From somewhere up in the clouds, Louis B. Mayer and his  arch-rival, Columbia's Harry Cohn, must both be gazing down with extremely  mixed emotions at what Mammon hath wrought.  </P> <P> From adjoining clouds Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and D.  W. Griffith could look down with equally mixed emotions. The four of them had  founded United Artists in 1919 with the thought that they would enjoy a good  deal more creative freedom -- and very likely more money -- if they made and  distributed their own films.  </P> <P> In the silent era, the company did well, releasing films by the founders and by  others as well, including Buster Keaton. For a while in the '30s UA also  released the films of Sam Goldwyn and Alexander Korda.  </P> <P> But there were problems. Mary and Doug, America's sweethearts, ceased to be  such. D. W. Griffith, ill and out of favor in a changed Hollywood, could no  longer work. In later years, Pickford and Chaplin did not speak at all. As the  '50s began and television was making its heavy inroads in Hollywood, UA was  virtually moribund. Pickford wanted to sell; Chaplin resisted; Mary won.  </P> <P> New owners, led by Robert Benjamin and Arthur Krim, took over from the founders  in 1951 and led UA into a golden era that lasted just over a quarter-century.  The company had no production facilities, which once seemed a handicap but  which, in the post-television era of independent production, suddenly became a  virtue. Under David Picker and subsequent production executives, UA's operating  philosophy of approving a project, providing the money and then leaving the  filmmakers alone was almost unique in the industry. It paid off.  </P> <P> UA had a smashing hit in Tony Richardson's sexy, witty period romp, "Tom Jones"  (1963). It had the lucky foresight to finance the Harry Saltzman-Cubby Broccoli  production of Ian Fleming's "Dr. No," which in 1962 introduced Sean Connery as  James Bond 007 to a waiting world, thus begetting a hugely profitable series  whose end is not yet.  </P> <P> The hands-off policy at UA attracted Woody Allen, whose unique contracts with  the company allowed for two week at least of reshooting if Allen wanted it. The  association began with "What's New, Pussycat" in 1965, which Allen wrote but  did not direct.  </P> <P> An impressive string of commercial and critical successes began to bear the UA  label. There was an Oscar for best picture for "In the Heat of the Night" in  1967, another for "Midnight Cowboy" in 1969. There were best picture Oscars for  "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," "Rocky" and "Annie Hall" in successive  years, 1975-77, and a nomination the next year for "Coming Home."  </P> <P> Then in the late '70s, Transamerica Corp. bought control of UA. The  conglomerate was more accustomed to dealing with insurance policies than with  creative artists, and at the start of 1978 the UA leadership departed en masse  in rebellion against head office interference. They formed Orion Pictures.  Woody Allen, significantly, also left to go with Orion.  </P> <P> The biggest news out of UA in its Transamerica period was the horrendous  cost-overrun on Michael Cimino's "Heaven's Gate," a $48-million loss from which  UA as an independent entity never really recovered. Acquired by Kerkorian as an  MGM hyphenate, MGM/UA has continued to release the James Bond films and the  Robert Chartoff-Irwin Winkler "Rocky" productions.  </P> <P> In the '80s, the UA or MGM/UA output grew thinner and thinner, and yet the firm  released Martin Scorsese's "Raging Bull" (produced by Chartoff and Winkler) and  the Oscar-winning "Rain Man."  </P> <P> The decline and demise of a studio, or a production company like UA, is very  much like the death of a magazine or a newspaper. It is the silencing of a  voice, the loss of an option available to the writer or the filmmaker with an  idea and a passion to see it made, a diminishing of choices and variety within  the whole output of the industry.  </P> <P> It means a dozen or more films a year that won't get made, any one of which  might have turned out to be something special.  </P> <P> The voice of a studio, like the voice of a publication, may sometimes have been  foolish, superficial, shrill, cynical or any one of a number of other things a  voice can be. But it may also have had its moments of greatness, when it rose  above the mundane and created something of lasting worth and importance.  </P> <P> Film history would be significantly poorer without the UA legacy, from its  formative silent days, more particularly from its great period between the '50s  and '70s.  </P> <P> It made films -- I think immediately of Bob Fosse's "Lenny," with Dustin  Hoffman -- that might not have found a home elsewhere in the industry. In 1974,  a film about the controversial comedian Lenny Bruce was a bold commercial  venture.  </P> <P> With the notable exception of "Annie Hall," Woody Allen's films have been only  narrowly profitable, a special urban taste almost unmarketable in some parts of  the country. But the pre-Orion UA was a firmly supportive if occasionally  nervous patron for him. And by now the Allen films constitute a body of work  unique in its ever more aspiring creative intentions.  </P> <P> There were UA flops; there always are, it being impossible to repeal the law of  averages or unvaryingly second-guess the audience. But it is always the  successes one looks to. The lesson of UA's hands-off regard for its filmmakers  has not been lost, surviving at Orion and elsewhere.  </P> <P> Still, you watch with melancholy as the UA logo fades from the scene. In its  various guises it has spanned three quarters of the life of American movies.  Its best days had come and gone, but it leaves memories that will be a good  deal slower to fade.  </P></p>

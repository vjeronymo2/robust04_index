Commenting on a  6-trillion-yen income tax cut and the "creation of a national  welfare tax" that the prime minister announced in the early dawn  of 3 February, Mr. Kantor said: "You made a proper decision."  In this way, he highly rated the prime minister's tax measures  taken as part of stimulus measures.    Mr. Kantor met with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii prior to  his meeting with the prime minister. During the meeting, Mr.  Kantor warned that "if the Japan-U.S. summit slated for 11  February ends in failure, it would have a great impact on the  world economy." Referring to negotiations on the insurance  sector under the Japan- U.S. economic framework talks, Mr.  Kantor asked that Japan adopt "objective criteria" to measure  the share of foreign insurance firms on the Japanese insurance  market. In response, Finance Minister Fujii said: "The share  is something that must be decided by the business activities of  foreign firms."</p>

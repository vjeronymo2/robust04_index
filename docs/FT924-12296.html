			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Survey of European Business Locations (5): Question mark over popularity - United Kingdom THE UK has consistently been attracting more overseas corporate investors than any other country in the European Community. In world terms, only the United States attracts more inward investment. The question is whether it can maintain such an impressive achievement. However hollow the British government's claims of an 'economic miracle' might sound in the wake of the recent turmoil, large numbers of foreign companies - from within and without the EC - have increasingly chosen the UK as their first choice when deciding to open up overseas. The reasons for Britain's popularity are diverse but many investors cite lack of government interference, an open, free-market economy, low tax rates, recent productivity improvements and a broad range of available skills. The alternative, less complimentary, view is that Britain is a relatively cheap labour base from which business can mount its assault on the more prosperous EC markets, free of the old trade union 'shackles' and many of the obligations which bind employers in other countries. Not that all employers are anxious to avoid establishing relationships with trade unions. While it may be too early to assess the impact of Japanese companies on UK industrial relations, many seem quite prepared to strike recognition agreements with unions as British employers cast them out. The Trades Union Congress is even studying Japanese labour relations in the hope of finding common ground and establishing a beneficial, working partnership. Whatever the motivating factors for overseas companies, the UK's success in wooing inward investment has been impressive. In the 12 months to the end of March 1992, overseas companies gave the go-ahead for 332 projects - creating or safeguarding 50,000 jobs. Big projects included a decision by Sony, the Japanese electronics group, to invest Pounds 144m in Wales and Kimberly Clark, the US consumer products company, to spend Pounds 100m in south Humberside. The annual inward investment total represents a minor reduction from the previous year, which is thought to reflect a general weakening in the European economies and the existing presence of many of the largest international companies. About half the proposed new investment is by foreign companies already established in the UK. About 37 per cent of all US direct investment and 39 per cent of Japanese direct investment is targeted on the UK. Other big investors in the British economy are Germany, France, the Netherlands and Sweden. The overall figures suggest that, with the impending arrival of the single market, the UK could be accounting for as much as one-third of all incoming EC investment. According to the Invest in Britain Bureau (IBB), the UK's leading agency for attracting foreign investment and part of the Department of Trade and Industry, there are wider benefits to the trend. Inward investors have, over the past three years, bought on average more than half of all their capital equipment within the UK. Many companies have moved quickly to increase local sourcing of components and supplies. Much inward investment is also converted into export sales, with companies such as Nissan sending 90 per cent of its Sunderland output overseas, some of it back to Japan. As a further bonus, many overseas companies operating from Britain are spending increasing volumes of funds on research and development and on training. The IBB is stepping up its promotional activities worldwide, given the less encouraging economic climate now encircling the globe. It will be concentrating in particular on the Far East, in markets such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Hong Kong. It might find the going more difficult than it has been in the recent past. Even before the most recent events which may have severely damaged Britain's international standing, there were already signs that big inward investors like the Japanese were not entirely happy with their UK experiences. A report commissioned at the start of 1992 by the Department of Employment found that the UK could lose its dominant share of European inward investment from the Japanese as they begin to produce more sophisticated products away from their domestic base. It showed that personnel managers in Japanese companies were often highly critical of UK skill levels and the poor quality of job candidates. According to the report, literacy, numeracy and technical skills were considered to be in short supply. Such potential weaknesses may, however, pale into insignificance against the potential fall-out from recent events and the UK's effective abandonment of the exchange rate mechanism. The subsequent fall in the value of sterling may provide a useful boost to any UK-based exporting operation but Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, warned recently that there could be an alternative fall-out. He asked: 'If it was perceived that we were going to be part of a slow stream Europe, do you think all those Japanese companies would continue to invest here on the scale that they are?'.</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank dashes hopes of imminent cut in rates EUROPEAN government bond markets rallied yesterday on hopes that the Bundesbank would cut German interest rates shortly in order to relieve tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism. Rumours that the Bundesbank could cut interest rates as early as today at the central bank's council meeting helped to encourage buying of French and German government bonds. However, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, later dashed hopes of an imminent cut when he told industrialists in Oslo that the Bundesbank 'must continue to give priority in its monetary policies to limiting inflationary risks'. French government bond prices rose on the rumours. The French government bond market has been troubled by speculation that the franc may be devalued within the European exchange rate mechanism. On Tuesday, the Bank of France raised its overnight rate to 12 per cent from 10 per cent to curb speculation against the currency, and both the French and German central banks issued statements stressing their intention to support the parity between the franc and the D-Mark. The measures helped to relieve the pressure on the franc, which appeared relatively stable yesterday. Dealers noted healthy buying interest in the French government bond market as investors were attracted by the high yield spreads over German government bonds. The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent bond due April 2003 moved from 8.12 per cent at the opening to 8.05 per cent by late afternoon. Elsewhere in Europe, German government bonds edged higher as interest rate speculation and some gloomy economic forecasts encouraged domestic investors to buy bunds. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 92.86 and traded in a range of 92.68 to 92.98 before ending the day at 92.96. The yield curve flattened as the short end of the market outperformed longer-dated issues. The German Institute for Economic Research, a leading German economic institute, said the economy would shrink in 1993, and criticised the Bundesbank for not lowering key interest rates. In addition, the Economics Ministry said industrial output in west Germany fell 1.1 per cent in November from October and was down 5.1 per cent from a year earlier. Dealers said the news led to hopes that the Bundesbank would be forced to ease interest rates soon. UK government bond prices closed higher after a volatile day, taking their cue from the European bond markets. Dealers noted some switching out of short-dated issues into medium and long-dated gilts. JAPANESE government bonds closed slightly firmer after touching new highs, helped by the combination of continued stock market weakness and investor buying. The futures contract climbed from its opening level of 108.41 to a four-year high of 108.56, before closing at 108.45 in Tokyo. The yield on the benchmark No 145 opened at 4.505 per cent and moved to 4.475 per cent before ending at 4.48 per cent. Dealers said bond market sentiment remains bullish, despite the prospect of new supply today. The Ministry of Finance is expected to auction about Y800bn of 10-year government bonds. Dealers predicted the coupon would be the same as for the December issue at 4.8 per cent, and that the auction will be a reopening of the existing No 153 issue. US Treasury prices remained trapped in narrow ranges as investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of tomorrow's employment data. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/16 at 103 5/16 , yielding 7.343 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 7/32 , to yield 4.491 per cent. Trading activity was light. Prices eased early, but recovered later amid sporadic buying. Attention remained fixed on tomorrow's employment report for December - which should provide the market with a clearer idea of how the economic recovery is progressing - and on the likely impact on prices of fresh corporate and government supply due out both this and next week. The Treasury announced yesterday that it would sell Dollars 9.75bn of new seven-year notes next Wednesday, slightly less than had been expected.</p>

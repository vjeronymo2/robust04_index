			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] As you probably know, the ULIMO [United Liberation  Movement for Democracy in Liberia] faction in Liberia is itself  bitterly split into warring splinter groups -- Alhaji Koromah's  section and Roosevelt Johnson's followers. They have been  slugging each other off and fighting each other for weeks. Now,  General Kamina of Alhaji Koromah's military command has called  us up to launch a scathing attack on the ECOMOG [Economic  Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]  peacekeeping force, and especially the Nigerians. Robin White  asked him what his complaint was:    [Begin recording] [Kamina] They have been aiding the  dissident group to bring total split into ULIMO forces and to  derail the entire peace process.    [White] Why on earth should the Nigerians want to do that?    [Kamina] Sure, they have been promised a lot of things.  These guys have told them that they are going toward the  diamond mining areas and other areas. This is the Nigerian  ECOMOG particularly I'm talking about. Most of them on the  ground with the command of General Togun, they have been  promised everything on the ground there; that they are going to  get everything, all the wealth and resources.    [White] It does seem most unlikely. I mean ECOMOG and  Nigerian troops are there to try and keep the warring factions  apart.    [Kamina] I am telling you that they have been aiding and  transporting arms and ammunition through everywhere. Through  Tubmanburg and along the route side, they are carrying on these  dissident forces there, transporting them and derailing the  whole peace process. These guys are plenty men. They are  having men disguised into ECOMOG uniform, fighting all along  [words indistinct] to Tubmanburg.    [White] So is your faction currently losing?    [Kamina] We are not losing. We are determined to fight but  we want to register this to the world that the ECOMOG forces,  the Nigerian contingent, are on the ground and continue to aid  the dissident forces that we are still fighting and we want to  tell the world that we will never relent. We will keep fighting  this thing here until ECOMOG, the Nigerian contingent is [word  indistinct] from that ground totally.    [White] Aren't you just blaming the Nigerians for what after  all are your own problems?    [Kamina] I am saying that the Nigerians, particularly  wherever they are there is a problem there. Even the LPC  [Liberian Peace Council] to see for itself. They have created  another group in Charles Taylor area to support the LPC thing.  [end recording]</p>

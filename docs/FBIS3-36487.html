And They Do Not Like Officials from Moscow"]    [Text] Blagoveshchensk, Beijing, Shenzhen, Xi'an, Moscow  -- "Finally, Russia's interests and statewide discipline must  not be forgotten." After the speaker had pronounced these words  the audience seemed stunned into hostile silence for a few  moments.    The venue: The conference hall at the Amur Oblast  administration building in Blagoveshchensk. On the rostrum --  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. The audience --  participants in the conference of representatives of Far East  administrations responsible for questions of the development of  Russian-Chinese relations. Before the official visit to China  the head of the foreign policy department had decided to canvas  the opinions of regional leaders on border trade and free  economic zones and intended to familiarize himself with the  experience of the creation of such zones in the PRC. There is  something to discuss here: In 1993 the volume of border trade  reached $2.5 billion and the trend is upward.    However, the times when the words of government members were  greeted with reverence in the provinces have long since gone.  Hardly had the minister ended his speech than the heads of  administration took the platform to bombard him with a barrage  of demands which amounted to a few simple tenets: Because of  the disintegration of the USSR and the economic crisis China has  become a more advantageous partner for the Russian Far East than  other regions of Russia. The introduction of the visa regime  for holders of general civilian passports in Russia and the PRC  is a severe blow to trade ties: Either give us credits or give  us a free hand to trade with the Chinese in the free economic  zones which ought to be set up immediately and moreover financed  by Moscow or rather by reducing our contributions to the state  budget. To summarize: Russia's interests are important but our  own are even more important.    The administration heads quite ostentatiously ignored one of  Kozyrev's main ideas: The introduction of the visa regime was  necessary to halt the process of the uncontroled spread of  criminal elements from China into Russian territory. Taking  advantage of the ease of passage into the border regions, they  then set off on their "travels." According to some statistics  there are over 1 million "guests" of this kind in our country.    After the conference, Kozyrev went to visit the free trade  zone in the city of Heihe (PRC) on the opposite bank of the  River Amur. The friendly embraces of the Chinese leaders with  the Blagoveshchensk city fathers, and equally the tone -- which  sounded almost like an ultimatum -- which the hospitable hosts  of Heihe took during their conversation with the minister, left  no doubts: Ties between the local elites are strengthening and  developing regardless of Moscow's wishes.    The things that the party and economic leaders from Heihe  said coincided almost word for word with the demands of the  heads of administrations at the conference: They want the  relaxation of the visa regime and the construction of a bridge  across the Amur (the pet theme of Amur Oblast administration  head Polivanov). You ought to have seen Kozyrev when he said in  measured and firm tones after enduring an almost 40-minute  verbal attack from the Chinese: "I hope that the Chinese side  will treat with understanding the measures undertaken by the  Russian side in the sphere of visa control." And he added  significantly: "We are worried by some guests who, I am sure,  give you no peace either." There was no reaction.    It is interesting that after visiting two free economic  zones  in the PRC -- at Heihe and Shenzhen in the southern province of  Guangdong -- the minister came to the conclusion that it is  impossible in Russia's conditions to copy the Chinese experience  -- or indeed any other experience. "We must find our own path  taking into account certain elements of foreign practice," he  noted.    When speaking in Blagoveshchensk and in China Kozyrev  repeatedly called for a switch from primitive "shuttle" trade  and elementary barter in the border oblasts to more serious  joint projects of a production and investment character. No one  has rejected these proposals in public but no one has been in a  hurry to develop the idea either. Is it because it is  unprofitable?    Among the Russian foreign minister's first ideas to be  expressed was that of the active participation of the regions in  foreign economic activity. But I think that for him the Far  East was a difficult test. The pressure of the local  administrative and economic hierarchy defending their corporate  interests was noticeable even to outside observers. The Russia  of the regions has unfortunately already been transformed into  the Russia of regional bosses.</p>

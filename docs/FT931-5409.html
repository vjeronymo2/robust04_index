			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Survey of European Airports - Manchester (6): A site for developers' eyes - The potential for property expansion AIRPORTS act like honeypots for property developers. In Britain, the evidence at Heathrow and Gatwick airports suggests that it is not only aviation-related concerns which want to be close to them. A corridor of computer companies has developed along the M4 motorway, which runs past Heathrow, in places such as Reading and Swindon. In Crawley, next to Gatwick, the old so-called metal-bashing companies have given way not only to caterers and other airport-related concerns but also high-technology companies. The international dimension is important. It is significant that most of the large electronics companies which established themselves along the M4 had US parents. Executives flying in from the US wanted to be close to their factories and to London. Because its airport has climbed into the first division of international hubs, Manchester has accordingly seen property developments springing up around it. Mr Peter Skelton, of estate agents and developers Lambert Smith Hampton, estimates that more than 500,000 sq ft of new B1 office/light industrial space has been built on business parks close to the airport in recent years. These business premises include Kings Valley, a development financed by the Co-operative Bank, the Concord Business Park which has been developed by St Modwen, The Towers, a P&amp;O project, and Greencourts Business Park, which has been brought on stream by Marples Developments. Much of this newish business space is let. Clients at Greencourts include Unilever's National Starch Division, Fisons pharmaceuticals and Microsoft. At The Towers are to be found British Olivetti, Honeywell, Asea Brown Boveri and Thorn EMI. Elsewhere there is Siemens, and on the Concord Park Mercury Communications and Ferranti. If other office premises in South Manchester - including the Manchester Business Park which is a project Ringway Developments wants to develop - and properties in places such as Stockport are included, then there has been an availability of well over 1m sq ft of good quality B1-type space. Much more space, however, is in the pipeline. The best known prospective development is Davenport Green. This would be a project of 1m sq ft of high quality B1-type offices built by Amec Developments. This would be on a site of 80 acres opposite the airport, close to the M56 in between junctions 5 and 6. Mr Ken Knott, the director of Amec in charge of the project, says: 'We have not received planning permission yet but assuming all goes well we would reckon to have the scheme in place by 1994.' The problem close to the airport is the green belt. Planning permission from Trafford Borough Council will neither be automatic nor uncontested. However, Mr Knott says the 80 acres is only part of a tranche of 340 acres owned by Amec. Land not used for buildings would be landscaped to try and enhance present environmental standards. Mr Knott says he knows of another scheme involving a different developer which, again, would be of around 1m sq ft. It would differ from Davenport Green in that it would also involve a hotel. This scheme, which is at a tentative stage, would need approval by Manchester City Council. Should the project go ahead the question arises whether the property market would not go into a surplus, and depress prices. Greater Manchester as a whole has become a smaller version of London. There is an overhang of new B1-type properties of the kind that Amec is proposing to build close to the airport. Mr Skelton estimates that there is 1m sq ft of B1-type properties on the market in Greater Manchester itself. He says that much of this is older property which is not greatly in demand. But to this total must be added the developments in Salford Quays. There, during the late 1980s, a number of properties were built in two enterprise zones to take advantage of tax concessions; just as in London's Docklands. The projects include Exchange Quay, the Anchorage, Quay West and the Harbour. They total around 1m sq ft. Only about a third of this is let, in spite of incentives and low rents. Can Greater Manchester absorb a further 2m sq ft of this type of property, and hold rents at commercial levels? Mr Alan Solomons, also of Lambert Smith Hampton, makes the point that very little space either in Salford Quays or around the airport is of the B2 heavy industrial or B8 distribution or warehousing variety. He says: 'There are few projects of the B8-type because the airport built its own depot for handlers and distributors within its boundaries. This a 15-acre site and there does not seem to be much demand for further space of this kind around the airport.' Another reason is that there is not such a good return for B2 properties. The land near the airport has become expensive - at least Pounds 500,000 an acre. Developers would be looking for top rents to cover developments, at least Pounds 20 per square foot. The take-up of B1-property during the buoyant 1980s was 1m sq ft a year. Now it is less than 500,000 sq ft a year. Rents in Salford Quays have been well below Pounds 20 a sq ft. Mr Knott is optimistic that Davenport Green will find tenants, although he says that nothing will be built speculatively. He says: 'I know Salford Quays is only 20 minutes from the airport as the crow flies, and it is close to the city centre. But public transport is poor and people cannot easily get there to work. 'Our project is right next to the airport. We would be targeting the top layer of international companies - pharmaceutical and technology concerns. There are about 200 of these. We would only need around 10 per cent of the total. 'I am sure we will manage to achieve rents which are equivalent of Pounds 20 a sq ft today. We are building for the very top of the market,' he adds. If there appears to be a demand for the 1990s, what are the prospects for the more distant future? The airport itself is looking forward to 2005 when its proposed second runway will be operational. A report by York Consulting for the airport and local councils has estimated that the airport itself will need a further 48 acres for on-site activities. There would be a need for 184 acres for aviation-related companies The study found that the take-up of land from both on-site activities and related aviation concerns was 104 acres. Land supply, the study found among the councils of Stockport, Manchester, Trafford, Macclesfield, Vale Royal, Halton and Warrington, was 1,777 acres, or 11 years' supply. These are crude figures. The airport impinges on some salubrious parts of Cheshire. There will be conservation considerations. The airport, which has prided itself on its accessibility does not want so much building close to it that congestion turns passenger access into a problem. However, should the demand for office space materialise there is clearly enough land around, farther out, but near enough for most practicable industrial and commercial purposes.</p>

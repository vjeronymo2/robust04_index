			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In preparing this amended tentative final monograph, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency has reevaluated these ``other allowable statements'' to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine whether they should be incorporated, wherever possible,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as part of the indications developed under the monograph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has reviewed the `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other Allowable Statements <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed in the previous tentative final monograph in &sect;333.85  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for health-care personnel handwash, in &sect;333.87 for patient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preoperative skin preparation, and in &sect;333.97 for surgical hand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scrub. The statement ``recommended for repeated use'' proposed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a health-care personnel handwash has been included in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended tentative final monograph as an ``other allowable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indication'' in proposed &sect;333.455 for antiseptic handwash or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health-care personnel handwash drug products. (See section I.B.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment 5.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The terms ``broad spectrum'' and ``fast-acting'' (if applicable)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were proposed as `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other Allowable Statements <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' for all three of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these product classes in the previous tentative final monograph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in section I.C., comment 6, the agency is proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to include ``broad spectrum'' in the definition of the three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product classes included in this amended tentative final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monograph. Although the term ``broad spectrum'' is included in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definitions of these product classes, the agency does not see a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need to include this information in the ``indications'' for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. Likewise, the term ``fast-acting'' is included in the definitions of these product classes, but the agency does not see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a need to include this information in the indications for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. This type of information may appear elsewhere in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labeling of these products as additional information to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health-care professional, provided it does not appear in any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of the labeling required by the monograph and does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detract from such required information. Other previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other Allowable Statements <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,'' i.e., ``contains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antibacterial ingredient(s),'' ``contains antimicrobial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingredient(s),'' and ``nonirritating,'' are not related in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant way to the safe and effective use of these products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency does not believe that statements such as ``contains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antibacterial ingredient(s)'' or ``contains antimicrobial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingredient(s)'' are necessary on products intended primarily for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health professionals, but has no objection to such statements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appearing in the labeling as other information not intertwined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with any portion of the labeling required by the monograph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Likewise, the term ``nonirritating'' may appear as additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to the health-care professional, provided it does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appear in any portion of the labeling required by the monograph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and does not detract from such required information. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such statements are subject to the provisions of section 502 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the act (21 U.S.C. 352) relating to labeling that is false or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misleading. Such statements will be evaluated on a product-by-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product basis, under the provisions of section 502 of the act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relating to labeling that is false or misleading.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

MANDELA'S EX-BODYGUARD SENTENCED TO DEATH FOR MURDER  </P> <P> A South African court today sentenced Winnie Mandela's former bodyguard to  death for murdering a teen-age black activist.  </P> <P> Jerry Richardson, coach of the self-styled football club whose members served  as bodyguards for the wife of black anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, was  found guilty in May of murdering 14-year-old black activist Stompie Seipei in  January, 1989.  </P> <P> Richardson was also convicted of kidnaping four youths, including Seipei.  </P> <P> The Rand Supreme Court in Johannesburg rejected defense evidence that  Richardson, 37, was mentally retarded and depended on Winnie Mandela to the  extent that he called her "Mommy" and craved her approval.  </P> <P> Transvaal province Atty. Gen. Klaus von Lieres has said that the outcome of  Richardson's trial would help him decide whether to charge Winnie Mandela.  </P></p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Slowcoaches begin in Europe Sir, Many companies will welcome the proposal by the European commissioner, Mr Raniero Vanni D'Archirafi, to introduce laws giving businesses the right to charge interest on late payments of debt ('Brussels' answer to slow payers', December 1). However, the European Commission might like to consider similar action to deal with late payment of EU grants to the large number of organisations (many non-profit making) which are critically dependent on such funding. The Commission and the EU member states should set an example by putting their own house in order first. Greg Perry, managing director, Westminster Europe, 1040 Brussels</p>

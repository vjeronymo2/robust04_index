			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Carlos Eduardo Alves] </F>   [Excerpt] Sao Paulo Prefect Paulo Maluf told the leadership  of the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] yesterday that he will be  a presidential candidate in the elections to replace President  Itamar Franco. "I will be a candidate, I will leave the  prefecture on 30 March and I expect everyone's help" said Maluf  during a three-hour meeting in his house in Sao Paulo. Maluf  seeks to end the pressure from friends and relatives not to run  for president.    Senator Esperidiao Amin (SC) [Santa Catarina], national  president of the PPR, made the announcement. He said: "I am  convinced Maluf will be our presidential candidate." A good  part of the meeting was used to evaluate the studies of Maluf's  electoral possibilities and of the PPR candidates for state  governors.    One point emphasized by Maluf was the concentration of his  support, as shown in the polls, in the middle, lower middle, and  lower classes of the population which cover the largest part of  the electorate. The evaluation of the PPR is that Finance  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB) [Brazilian Social  Democracy Party] who would be Maluf's direct competitor in a  second round would have problems getting the votes of the poor.

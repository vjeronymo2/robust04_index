			<p>BFN     [Text] The Crimean Republic Supreme Council has taken  another step towards exacerbating relations with official Kiev.  By a majority vote at its session on 19 May, it approved the  appointment of General [Volodymyr] Lepikhov to the post of  chairman of the autonomy's security service. He was nominated  by President Yuriy Meshkov. The directive on reorganizing the  Security Service of the Republic of Crimea into the Security  Service of Ukraine Main Directorate in Crimea, signed by  Ukrainian Head of State Leonid Kravchuk, has thus been ignored.    The [Security Service of Ukraine] press service in Kiev  emphasizes that the principal aim of the reorganization is the  need to enhance the centralization of leadership and the  effectiveness of this service in fighting organized crime in  Crimea where the scale of it is ever more threatening.    The press service at the same time reports via the TV and  radio agency Novyny [News] that Crimean President Meshkov has  effectively ignored (?a coded telegram addressed to him) from  Yevhen Marchuk, head of the Security Service of Ukraine, where  he is informed that the Security Service of Ukraine Main  Directorate in Crimea, set up in accordance with Leonid  Kravchuk's directive, is to remain unchanged in performing its  functions (?in order to retain effectiveness).    The press service also reports that (Valeriy Malikov),  Security Service of Ukraine first deputy chairman, and a number  of his staff are now in Simferopol. They are preparing materials  on the situation with fighting organized crime in Crimea, which  will be under consideration at the (?next) sitting of the  Security Service of Ukraine Collegium.</p>

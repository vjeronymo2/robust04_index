			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Major General Mai Nang] </F>   [Excerpts] In past wars, together with the branches of  service, branches, local troops, and people, the special  operations troops have manifested the tradition of being "crack,  heroic, and clever and innovative troops capable of winning  victory" and completed all the tasks in an outstanding manner.  [passage omitted]    Today, the country is at peace. Even though things are still  not stable, organizing the military in general and organizing  and building the special operations units in particular are  different than in the past. In the present stage, construction  and combat readiness are the leading tasks. Furthermore, the  army's task of defending our socialist fatherland now has  different requirements and themes: defending our independence,  sovereignty, and territorial integrity is tied to defending the  party, defending the socialist system, and maintaining the  country's political security. Opposing peaceful change and  rebellions has become the leading task. This must be coordinated  with and dealt with actively together with other situations. We  are no longer receiving military aid from abroad as in the past,  and today's national defense budget is limited. Thus, renovating  organization and building forces in accord with the  requirements, tasks, and new situation is the task of each  branch of service and branch, which includes the special  operations branch.    In my view, in building special operations forces today, we  must concentrate on the following main themes:    1. We must build special operations forces that are really  well-trained, particularly forces that are well-trained  politically. Special operations forces' combat strength is  crystallized by many factors. This is the strength of the strong  political capabilities, unique special operations combat arts,  and tight military organization of a crack, revolutionary, and  regular force that is gradually being modernized. If we simply  compare our strength to that of the enemy, it will be very  difficult to explain the victories of our special operations  troops. Recent wars have shown that in many situations, one  sapper team has successfully attacked a major target deep in the  enemy's rear, an operation that would have been difficult for an  infantry regiment, or even a division, to carry out. This stems  mainly from the "special nature" of the special operations  forces in all the factors and relationships, their skill in  organizing and building forces, their special operating  formulas, and their special capabilities in attacking the enemy.  Thus, building special operations forces who are well-trained in  all respects, particularly in politics, is an urgent and  long-term task. As warfare develops and the enemy uses more and  more weapons and more high-tech equipment, more and more  attention must be given to this requirement.    In today's conditions and in a people's war to defend the  fatherland (if war should break out), the special operations  forces must be organized broadly. But this does not mean that  there should be large numbers of poor-quality troops spread far  and wide. The guiding ideas of the party must always be  thoroughly understood in building forces, and quality,  particularly political quality, must always come first. Starting  now, in carrying out the national defense and security tasks and  maintaining political stability in the country, this issue must  be greatly elevated. The enemy's "peaceful change" plot is  constantly making advances and hurting us. The struggle against  aggression is actually underway. This cannot wait until there is  a war of aggression. Unless we defeat their plots and stratagems  in peacetime, we could lose the party and the regime, as has  happened in many countries. Once the leading party and the  regime is lost, the entire system will be lost, and that will  lead to the loss of the country. We will fall into the orbit of  neocolonialism in one form or another.    This new task requires that the military, which includes  special operations troops, have a new combat strength and  contribute, together with all the people, to winning the complex  and very difficult "political war." At the same time, it must  have the strength to serve as the activist for all the people  and be prepared to defeat a war of aggression if war should  break out in order to defend our socialist Vietnamese  fatherland. Special operations cadres and soldiers must have  strong political capabilities and adhere closely to the targets  and ideals. They must be absolutely loyal to the fatherland and  people and be vigilant. They must react quickly to all types of  enemies and not vacillate or waver in the face of the deceptive  arguments of the enemy or in the face of monetary or material  bribes. At the same time, sappers must be imbued with a lofty  idea of the offensive. They must be resolute, brave, and daring.  They must have adequate military knowledge and be physically  strong. Only then will they be able to stand firmly and fight  for long periods in terrible conditions, have the fortitude to  overcome difficulties, and have the wisdom and ability to defeat  targets not of their choosing in conditions in which they are at  a disadvantage in terms of both forces and equipment. With this  spirit, along with improving the quality of military training,  the special operations branch has constantly strengthened  political and ideological education, regarding this as one of  the important things for ensuring that the sapper forces are  built up and can fight victoriously. [passage omitted]    Political education must enable everyone to see that the  tasks of sappers today have expanded as compared with those  during the national liberation war. Because of this, the  disciplinary and tactical requirements are higher, and this  defines the determination to study and train to satisfy the  requirements and fulfill the tasks.    2. Special operations detachments that are strong in all  respects must be built.    With respect to the special operations branch, just as in  the  past, the combat units must build strong sapper teams,  spearheads, units, and joint units that have the ability to  fight on any battlefield and attack targets deep in the enemy's  rear using the equipment available. This is a pressing and  long-term requirement.    To build special operations detachments requires above all a  thorough understanding of the spirit of General Staff Directive  116CT-TM on building units that are strong in all respects.  Because of the special nature of the special operations forces,  we are concentrating on the following:    We must build strong party organizations, particularly party  chapters and party cells. The various-echelon party  organizations, particularly the party chapters, must really have  the ability to lead the party members and masses in the units.  The party organizations must ensure that people thoroughly  understand the party's resolutions, policies, and lines and  carry out the construction and combat training tasks for their  units. At the same time, because sappers usually operate in  small numbers far from the guidance of higher echelons, the  branch is giving much attention to building party chapters  having many outstanding members. Today, in the special  operations branch, all combat units have party chapters. The  problem is to ensure that many party chapters have party  committee echelons and that more and more party chapters are  strong in all respects.    An important requirement is to build ranks of primary-level  management cadres, because cadres are the root of every victory.  Special operations cadres must not only have excellent technical  and tactical standards and be strong physically but they must  also be highly skilled in mobilizing the masses and building  political bases among the people. They must be able to organize  an area and be skilled in training the cadres and soldiers  subordinate to them. The experiences gained from past battles  and operations have been reviewed. Both the successful and  unsuccessful experiences must be passed on to subordinate cadres  and soldiers through both formal training and on-the-job  training.    Combat readiness training and training in discipline and  order are central tasks in building detachments that are strong  in all respects. Today, just as in other infantry units, sappers  are obligated to serve in the military for only 2 years. In such  a short period, training must be planned and follow a scientific  model in order to ensure that 1st-year soldiers have good basic  standards and that 2d-year soldiers are well-trained and skilled  in every respect. Emphasis must be placed on forging excellent  skills in independent combat as well as in joint combat with  other branches of service and other arms.    Combat training must be coordinated with physical education  and with strengthening discipline and order. For a long time to  come, just as in the past, the special operations troops will  have to carry on operations and fight for long periods with just  the equipment and food they carry. Thus, they must be physically  strong and have a good concept of organization and discipline.  Sapper discipline does not stop here but also manifests high  combat coordination. In unusual times, special military  knowledge will be used to affect the prestige of Uncle Ho's  troops. [passage omitted]    3. Reviewing things and carrying on scientific studies must  be strengthened in order to satisfy the new requirements and  fulfill the new tasks. [passage omitted]    If a war to defend the fatherland breaks out, the enemy will  certainly use modern, high-tech weapons and equipment. But  special operations forces must manifest their great role and  exploit special methods of attack on the battlefields of a  people's war based on the training that they received in  peacetime. The special operations troops can attack important  targets on land, command bases, rear area and technical targets,  and the aircraft and ships of the enemy deep in their rear.    Making complete preparations so that the special operations  forces can fulfill the combat readiness tasks based on the  experiences of the war for national liberation does not mean  blindly applying the old experiences to the new situation, which  changed has and developed. The special operations branch must  study many problems such as the organization and construction of  sapper forces, sapper combat arts, the use of sappers of  integrated branch commands, formulas to maintain rear services,  techniques, intelligence for the sappers during combat, and so  on. Above all, plans must be studied to determine how to  organize the special operations forces in a rational manner,  from the special operations forces of the command and in the  military regions and corps to the local special operations  forces. The necessary ratio between professional forces and  draftees in today's special operations units must be determined.  Formulas for having sappers carry out quick and secret  operations must be studied, and plans to build corridors,  positions, and political bases in predetermined locations must  be studied.    Scientific research must go deeply into studying and  purchasing new weapons and equipment, new modes of attack, and  writing training materials for the special operations troops.  The highest requirement with respect to the weapons and  equipment used by sappers is that they are compact, easy to use,  easy to assemble and set up, and easy to transport on both land  and in water, that their shape is suited to each type of special  operations force, and that they are highly destructive.    Weapons research must be directed toward the application of  the newest technology in order to improve the old types of  weapons and improve and purchase equipment so that the special  operations forces can operate at remote distances on both land  and at sea. The signal and liaison means and reconnaissance  means of the special operations forces is another difficult  problem that must be studied. An important research task is to  ensure that the special operations troops eat a proper diet and  are physically healthy so that they can carry out the immediate  tasks and remain in good health. Studies must be done on  processing highly nutritious foods that are easy to use and that  can be preserved for long periods. Food for water sappers, for  example, must be small, light, impervious to water, and easy to  use so that the sappers can eat while swimming. On the other  hand, studies must be done on manufacturing preventive medicines  and other drugs suited to independent activities, particularly  when sappers must rely on themselves at sea.    Many of the scientific research problems exceed the  capabilities of the special operations forces. It is hoped that  the state, the Ministry of Defense, and scientists both in and  outside the military will provide help.</p>

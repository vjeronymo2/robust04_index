			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andray Petrovsky; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] The country's government decided not to submit for a  while to parliament its program of speeding up the reform and  pulling out of the economic crisis. This decision was made  following the criticism President Nursultan Nazarbayev leveled  at the program. He told the government to update it in the  light of proposals made by every government member. Every  minister will have to sign the program and then bear  responsibility for its implementation.    Nazarbayev was confident that the anti-crisis program had to  dictate the government's tactics for the coming 12 to 15 months.  The goal is to cut the monthly inflation rate to below 10  percent. He thought that the production decline could not be  overcome unless Kazakhstan's own producers and entrepreneurs  were encouraged.    The government decided to discuss the anti-crisis program  again next week.    Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko presented to  parliament a memorandum on the government's socio-economic  policy. He said that Kazakhstan had exhausted the domestic  sources of financing for reforming its economy. Therefore, he  thought, the country needs foreign credits. Preparations for  them will take 15 months, he explained. Tereshchenko said that  the government would act in three stages during that period.    At the first stage, from June to December 1994, the  government will rely chiefly on domestic resources for budget  financing. Within that time inflation will be reduced to below  10 percent and the tenge, the national currency, would be  stabilized to some extent.    At the second stage, from January to September 1995, the  government expects an agreement on medium-term credits to be  signed, an accelerated integration with Russia and CIS member  nations and investments by the G7 group.    The third stage will be the beginning of a new economic  policy. The government intends to lay the foundation for an  improvement of living standards and a production growth.    Tereshchenko emphasized that the government would pursue an  unswerving anti-inflation policy, reduce taxes, carry out a bank  reform and step up privatization.    He insisted that reforms could not be carried out without  properly financing the social sphere, because otherwise society  would reject them. He wanted parliament to support the budget  and said that if the country stood by it, foreign loans would be  easier to obtain.    Answering questions, Tereshchenko said he did not think the  country could return to the ruble zone because of the  significant differences between the Russian and Kazakh economies.    He called for introduction of a transnational CIS currency,  the altyn, and added that this idea had been initially put  forward by Nazarbayev in his draft plan of setting up a Eurasian  Union.    Tereshchenko recalled that Kazakhstan had had to leave the  ruble zone and introduce its own currency because, in his words,  Russia had demanded a gift of nearly $1.5 billion. He said that  the talks between Moscow and Minsk on the setting up of a ruble  zone had been futile for nearly six months.    Tereshchenko thought, however, that a joint economic space  and lifting customs duties inside the CIS would facilitate  integration of CIS member nations.</p>

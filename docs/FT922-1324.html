			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Miners warn on Scots pits THE Scottish deep mine industry will wither under privatisation, unless linked with the country's opencast activities under a separate and independent Coal Corporation, the Scottish miners conference heard yesterday at Inverness. Mr George Bolton, NUM area president, told delegates that a 'dire consequence' of the general election victory was the government's determination 'to ram through what they have called the ultimate privatisation, that of coal'. His call for a 'Scottish Coal Corporation, not a company' was unanimously endorsed by the conference. It follows the union's submission to Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, stating that under any privatisation programme Scotland's coal assets should be sold off separately and intact. Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, was rebuked for a 'decade of inactivity' at the negotiating table.</p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Arts: A Song at Twilight - Theatre We tend to think of Coward as a playwright of the 1920s, '30s and '40s. Congratulations therefore to the Greenwich Theatre for reviving his 1966 play A Song at Twilight. As it begins, it reminds you of sundry other Coward plays. But, as it develops, it also reveals a gift for suspense that Coward had seldom employed. Then, seriously, it addresses a subject that had underlain all Coward's earlier oeuvre but round which he had always, childishly, skirted. One of the several ways in which A Song takes your breath away is the hostile light in which the male protagonist - Coward's own role - is viewed. The role has wit and a certain urbane charm, on the surface; and no doubt Coward himself made the most of those. But then the play peels that surface away. We see Sir Hugo Latymer, an eminent elderly writer living in Switzerland, being beastly to his wife Hilde. She doubles as his secretary, and their relationship is a development of that of Garry and Monica in Present Laughter. We see him being charming to his young butler, Felix. But all this, we sense, is preamble to the arrival of his old flame, Carlotta. Carlotta turns out to be a well-preserved and much-married lady aged about 50; and the degree to which she skirmishes with Hugo and reminds him of the past makes her a successor to Garry's wife Liz and the seductress Joanna, both in Present Laughter. But all this is also preamble. The most daring feature of Tom Smith's excellent Greenwich production is how uncharming and unsympathetic it makes Sir Hugo from the first. John Quentin, who plays the role, is testy, acid, defensive. His lack of charm makes him an unnatural Cowardian, but has the advantage of ensuring that we face head-on Hugo's unpleasant hypocrisies, cruelties, evasions. Gideon Davey, the designer, has given Hugo's sitting-room a glacial air. Lois Baxter, as the elegant Carlotta, has both the rapier conversational technique and the womanly charm to point up all the more clearly what Hugo lacks. Alison Skillbeck, as Hilde, neatly catches the dowdiness, forbearance, and pragmatism that have been necessary to live with this man for 20 years. If you are inclined to see this play, read no further; just go. For the best fun of A Song is its suspense. The skeleton in Hugo's cupboard which Carlotta finally addresses is his own homosexuality. We reach it, melodramatically, just before the interval. But the beauty of the play is that Carlotta is not blackmailing Hugo, though he presumes she is. She simply wants him to admit not merely that he has a homosexual past, not merely that his thoughts have been homosexual all his life, but most importantly his own capacity for loving anyone. It is this link between Hugo's sexual repression and his misanthropy that is the play's most exciting feature. It illumines everything; the preamble, we see, was not preamble at all. And the play's wordless conclusion - Hugo's gasping reaction as he re-reads the letters he once wrote to the man who was his one true love - suggests that his own ice is indeed about to crack. A Song at Twilight is Coward's most adult play, and so this revival does him honour. At the Greenwich Theatre, SE10.</p>

			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> IRELAND UNDER ATTACK BY NEW ZEALAND WORMS  </P> <P> Ireland has suffered a mysterious invasion from the other end of the Earth that  threatens to do serious long-term damage. The invader, which has spread out  across Northern Ireland and is now entering the Republic of Ireland, is a lowly  New Zealand worm called Artiopositalthia triangulata, which is slowly wiping  out the native population of Irish worms.  </P> <P> How the 6-inch-long New Zealand worm got to Ireland nobody knows. But it is  thought that it probably arrived in Northern Ireland as egg capsules on the  roots of a shrub more than 20 years ago. Since then it has proliferated in  Northern Ireland and has recently been found on the southern side of the  border.  </P> <P> The respected British journal The New Scientist reported recently,  "Agricultural productivity in Northern Ireland could dip by at least one-third  because a plague of flatworms has depleted the province's population of native  earthworms by 90%."  </P></p>

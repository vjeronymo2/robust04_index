The province has registered 6,200 agro-technical societies  with 240,000 members since farmers voluntarily set up the first  one in 1980.    These societies are involved in more than 100 specialties  covering plantation, breeding, gardening, sideline processing  and rural enterprises.    Of the societies, about 1,000 focus on the study of  technology, economic development and new products for rural  industries.    Founded in 1985, the Nanfeng township-run Station Wagon Body  Society in Zhangjiagang city, Jiangsu Province, has imported 12  items of advanced technology and developed 18 new products.    As a result, it generated more than 80 million yuan in taxes  and profits last year.    The province has formed a number of large special production  bases and markets with the help of rural societies.    The Changzhang Vegetable Society in Tongshan county has set  up a vegetable consultancy department, a seedling department and  a production and marketing department to offer a package of  related services. Its vegetables sell well across the country.    According to the provincial society of sciences and  technology, Jiangsu will set up a provincial level federation of  rural professional technology to better guide farmers to  contribute in the market economy.</p>

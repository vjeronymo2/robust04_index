			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish  at 1600 GMT on 2 June features the "Straight Talk" Program with  host Osvaldo Rodriguez from BOHEMIA magazine and guest Renato  Recio from TRABAJADORES newspaper.    Rodriguez begins by asking: "Currently, what is being  implemented? Is it or is it not a package of measures?" Recio  explains that reporters have been using the term, "group of  measures," rather than "package of measures," noting that the  Miami EL NUEVO HERALD said that the measures being implemented  in Cuba have a neoliberal character.    Recio asks: "Why avoid using the phrase, package of  measures,  even if we are talking about a significant group of measures? I  believe the reason is precisely to avoid giving the impression  that the measures respond to neoliberal policies. The phrase,  package of measures, has always been associated with the  neoliberal formula which, as we all know, is implemented  overnight, even without cabinet-level discussions, but rather,  by two or three influential people in the government, with  premeditation, and under cover of night."    Rodriguez explains that it is more than just a matter of  semantics; it is a matter of concepts. Recio adds that measures  to correct economic problems are necessarily similar, no matter  in what country they are taken, but that: "Cuba does not want to  become a market economy."    Recio observes that despite the similarity of the measures  being taken in Cuba with those abroad, the difference lies in  the goal of the measures. Rodriguez and Recio discuss aspects of  market-economy measures, but emphasize that in Cuba, the  measures were preceded by extensive consultation with the  people. Recio continues: "In Cuba, economic reforms respond to  the social base from which the political power of the Revolution  emanates -- the workers, farmers, the people in general. This is  why we do not have a struggle among social classes in Cuba."  Recio adds that the issue is not what the measures are called,  but what they seek to accomplish, and advises avoidance of the  term, package of measures, because of the term's connotations.    Regarding the way the people have received the measures and  the increased sacrifice that they entail, Rodriguez states: "I  believe the initial reaction has not been very positive among  the people in general because I do not believe the measures have  been explained very well."    Recio calls on the media to further explain the measures to  the people, explaining: "If these measures truly serve to  increase production and food supplies, you will eventually  increase your food intake and solve a number of current  shortages. If we are to understand these measures as a  sacrifice, we must see them as a welcome sacrifice because they  will yield the results we seek." Rodriguez agrees that the  sacrifices are obvious.    Recio closes with the statment: "As excess currency  diminishes, black market prices will do so as well."</p>

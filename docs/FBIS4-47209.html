			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Opinions" of Viktor Verk and Mikhail Ustyugov, editors of </F> the policy departments of the newspapers KARAVAN and EKSPRESS K  respectively: "Who `Released' Nurkadilov and Why?"]    [Text] [Verk] So what according to the logic of things  should have happened long ago has happened: The permanent  (seemingly) mayor of Almaty, Zamanbek Nurkadilov, has been  removed from office. The "No. 2" in Kazakhstan had not had a  chance to disappear into political oblivion (the position of  ambassador in the capital of a Far East "dragon" is in this case  tantamount to political death) before many people began to ask:  What induced the No. 1 to take this step?    There are several possible answers, in my view. First  possibility. Nurkadilov had as of late begun all too  manifestly to compromise the president, being in terms of status  his governor general in the country's principal city. It is  sufficient to recall if only his actions during the fall-winter  "offensive" against Soviet power. At that time the mayor (he is  a member of parliament) himself placed calls to his deputy corps  colleagues, offering them key positions in the  ministerial-departmental vertical line in exchange for a  statement that they were relinquishing their authority  voluntarily. Many members of parliament received notice of the  need to visit Office No. such and such in the city  administration (and some of these many people hastily took up  the "invitation"). And in the course of the election campaign to  the new parliament the municipal "head" lobbied quite openly for  "his" candidates for the people's elect (there was talk even of  the existence of a kind of "mini-official slate" of 13  "Nurkadilovite" candidates (nameplates with a majority of the  names of this slate now adorn the doors of the parliamentary  candidates).    It is perfectly natural that the talk about this, which  percolated into the public (murder will out!), led to the  appearance of numerous myths and stories from the life of the  "No. 2." There was even talk about his undoubted influence on  the No. 1 or the people closest to him and of some documents  compromising these people in some way or other. Recalling the  folk wisdom concerning fire and smoke, it may be surmised that  some individual fragments of these apocrypha could be not far  from the truth. On the whole, however, it was hard, observing  the ex-mayor's public activity, to escape the feeling of some  deliberate "self-publicity": Everyone says that this cannot be  done, but I say it can. And I not only say but also do. We need  recall if only Z.K.'s initially celebrated appearance on Almaty  television of this spring or the business of the cancellation of  benefits for retirees and the handicapped (subsequently restored  by the president). Then a conference was promptly held in the  capital's rayon administrations (in some, at least), which  summarized proceedings roughly as follows: The president has  restored the benefits--this is his business--we will operate in  the old way. This "policy" of the mayor's could not, naturally,  have failed to have caused perfectly understandable irritation  in the "house upstairs." And the status quo was restored by the  method traditional since CPSU times--"...in connection with his  transfer to other work." This possibility would seem the most  plausible, but there is another. So, second  possibility. Nurkadilov's removal was connected with the  concealed antagonism of some "interest groups" that has surfaced  "in public" from time to time (the assassination of Igor  Milgramm, the "chief builder" of Almaty, or the scandal  surrounding the activity of the capital's meat-packing plant).  There are as yet few direct arguments in support of this  possibility (based on actual facts), but it should not, in my  opinion, be discounted entirely.    Third possibility. Nurkadilov was removed to  assuage the capital's patriots agitated by the resumed talk (at  the prompting of the president himself) of the pending switch of  the "crown" to Akmola. In this case the logic of the replacement  of the mayor is exceptionally simple: Since this is being done,  an attempt will be made, consequently, to "sweep" from Almaty  with a "new" broom the old mafia, after which it would still be  perfectly suitable for the role of first city of the country.  Otherwise opponents of the transfer (which, according to the  most modest estimates, would cost no less than $10 billion)  could kick up a fuss via the press and "arouse" the  assertiveness of the capital's average inhabitant. Which, with  regard to the 1996 presidential elections (until which,  incidentally, there remains not as much time as it might seem),  is clearly not a part of the plans of Nursultan Nazarbayev....    And, finally, the fourth possibility. The ex-mayor  of Almaty paid with his position for insufficient concern for  the inhabitants of Almaty, that is, the inadequate operation of  transport, the growth of crime, the filthy streets,  environmental problems, and so on and so forth.    This possibility would seem unlikely, though. For, according  to the "sound" tradition that has evolved here, for a failure to  discharge his direct official obligations an official is moved  to a somewhat higher chair. In Mr. Nurkadilov's case this could  be, at a minimum, the office of vice premier. But, in the  opinion of people in the know, the formulation "in connection  with his transfer to other work" does not leave the former "No.  2" with any hopes of political "resuscitation."    [Ustyugov] The position of head of a megalopolis where all  the leading structures--from state through mafia--are  concentrated is always fraught with a certain scandal potential.  The new appointment to the office of mayor testifies that not  simply the "president's man" but a person from  outside--experienced and at the same time neutral and totally  uninvolved in the clamorous showdowns of the capital of recent  times--has come to power in the capital. Shalbay Kulmakhanov was  state counselor for housing construction for just seven months.  Prior to this he was chief of the Aktyubinsk Oblast  Administration, and before this, chairman of the North  Kazakhstan Oblast Soviet Executive Committee. It is impossible  in seven months, of course, to seriously change anything in such  a crisis-ridden sphere today as housing construction. So the  personnel shuffle undertaken by the president last November--the  transfer of Kulmakhanov to Almaty--appears to have been, rather,  an interim step undertaken with a view to the long term.    What determined this choice by the head of state? The  calculation, probably, that the new mayor would not make many of  the mistakes made by his predecessor. Zamanbek Kalabayevich had  clearly detached himself from the government team, which, as the  president intends, should be united. Sharply worded utterances  about a cabinet failing to supply the city with petroleum  products, pursuing a worthless tax, price, and budget policy,  and bearing, from the viewpoint of the capital's authorities,  "full responsibility to the people for the present situation"  were being heard continually from the capital's city hall. It  was obvious that Nurkadilov's "team" was playing its own game,  the outcome of which was to many observers unclear. In this  context Kulmakhanov's appointment looks first and foremost like  the restoration of the "team principle." The new mayor will,  most likely, act more cautiously, without noisy effects and  public accusations against the government and the Supreme Court  of Arbitration. Not a political "star" laying claim to a leading  role in the state but an experienced manager, whose main task is  to transfer the work of city hall from a scandal-populist to a  constructive channel, is coming to the capital. Not the easiest  of tasks inasmuch as the personnel changes will not spell more  money for the city's coffers.</p>

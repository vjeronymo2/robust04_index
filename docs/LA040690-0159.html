			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE SOFTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE, KENNEDY BATTLE TO TIE  </P> <P> The Kennedy High School-Garden Grove game, which figured to show the dominant  softball team in the Garden Grove League, was suspended at a 1-1 tie after 20  innings Thursday.  </P> <P> After four hours, plate umpire Ed Staab called the game because of darkness,  but not before both teams proved why they are tops in their league and among  the county's best.  </P> <P> Garden Grove, ranked fifth in the Orange County Softball Coaches' poll, and  Kennedy, ranked sixth, mirrored each other with stellar defensive plays, strong  pitching and good hitting. Both teams are 6-0 in league play.  </P> <P> Both teams used a walk, an error and a hit in the second inning to score.  </P> <P> With no outs, Kennedy pitcher Cheryl Longeway reached first on an error.  Andrina Hustead walked and both runners advanced on a passed ball.  </P> <P> Renee Gragnano struck out. Shortstop Nicole Paloney singled to drive in  Longeway. Smith then struck out Angie La Carte and got Danielle McLeod to pop  out to end the inning.  </P> <P> In the bottom of the second, Becky Eggers walked. Brandie Novack bunted and  Longeway's throw pulled first baseman Gragnano off the bag for an error. Eggers  injured her ankle going to second and was replaced by Maria Romero. Nakia  Houston grounded out, advancing the runners to second and third.  </P> <P> Romero tried to score from third on Stephanie Mareina's ground ball, but  Longeway threw her out at the plate. Garden Grove finally scored when Celeste  Gordon lined a single to left, scoring Novack.  </P> <P> Garden Grove left 19 runners on base, Kennedy 13.  </P> <P> "They threw us out by half a step and my girls are quick," Kennedy Coach Sue  Hall said. "The defense in general, including the pitching, dominated."  </P> <P> Longeway (8-1) struck out 10, walked five and hit one. Smith (14-3) struck out  17, walked two and hit one.  </P> <P> Kennedy looked as if it would end the game in the top of the 15th inning when  Lana Jimenez bunted for a single and took second on an error. One out later,  Longeway singled to left. Jimenez, Kennedy's fastest runner, rounded third but  Hall called her back. Jimenez eventually was tagged out at home to end the  inning.  </P> <P> "I should have sent her," Hall said, later. "I played it too cautious."  </P> <P> In other league games:  </P> <P> Santiago 7, Bolsa Grande 4 -- Leanne Stoneking drove in the winning run in the  fifth inning at Bolsa Grande. Jessica Sulsona (3-7) pitched a one-hitter for  Santiago (4-8, 1-5).  </P> <P> La Quinta 2, Los Amigos 1 -- Jill Bishop had two hits and Nicole Eisley had a  hit and an RBI to lead visiting La Quinta (8-6, 5-1).  </P></p>

It is an action that  deeply hurts us, and me particularly, because this is an attack  on a human being. In addition, it is against a noble man, a  good man, who seeks to serve others and to serve his country. I  have already heard many voices express their consternation with  this incident and their all-out rejection of this attack. I am  in constant contact to learn about Colosio's condition. I have  sent my sympathy to his family. I have sent my personal  physician and an expert to help the doctors attending him.    I have been informed that arrests have been made. I have  given instructions to the attorney general to travel to Tijuana  to help in the investigation. We will get to the bottom of this  and the full weight of the law shall be applied.    The most important thing right now is Luis Donaldo Colosio's  health. I am certain that if we all join in our sentiments of  compassion and serenity and direct them positively, it will be  good for him and good for all of us. Personally, this is a very  painful matter, as he is a beloved Mexican. I offer him and his  family all my affection and warmth. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Letter: Audit fee figures not just simple averages Sir, Andrew Jack, in his article on international accounting and auditing (Accountancy Column, May 6), quoted an average of audit fees as a proportion of sales as being 0.022 per cent in the UK, according to the Cifar report. This average is only true for companies of a particular size; those with Pounds 20m-Pounds 50m in sales. The median figure for small plcs, with less than Pounds 5m in sales, is about 0.0056 per cent, while companies with more than Pounds 1bn in sales have a median of only 0.00046 per cent. The industry sector also has a big effect. Distribution companies can, for example, have audit fees one third those of similar-sized engineering companies. I give the above figures as many may have compared their own percentage with that given and found variations. As ever, the use of simple averages can be misleading.

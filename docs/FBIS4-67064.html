			<p>Trafficking   <F P=102>   PA0605141094 Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish  2300 GMT 5 May 94 </F>  <F P=103> PA0605141094 </F> <F P=104>  Panama City Circuito RPC Television </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega for the "RPC Television News" </F> newscast]    [Excerpts] Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate  of the United People alliance, went to the San Fernando Hospital  for a drug test, which came out negative. Perez Balladares  stressed that if he wins the presidential elections, he will  implement a vigorous policy against drug trafficking.    [Begin recording] [Perez Balladares] I came for a drug test  because I think the Panamanian people have the right to demand  and to know whether their candidates are using chemical  substances. I also had a stress test because I think the next  president should have enough physical stamina and be in good  enough health to keep the promises made to the Panamanian people.    [Ortega] Could this be viewed as a prelude to your  government's policy against drugs?    [Perez Balladares] You can be sure that if I took the test,  I  will demand that everyone else do likewise. [passage omitted]    [Ortega] Why did you take the drug test? Have other  candidates done the same?    [Perez Balladares] I hope we all do it. I think it should be  done as a sign of respect for the Panamanian people so they can  be sure that none of us use any type of chemical substance. [end  recording] [passage omitted]</p>

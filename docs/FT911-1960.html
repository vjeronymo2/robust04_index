			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (23): Polish entrepreneurs ALEKSANDER GAWRONIK, (right) by the door of his new Mercedes, is reckoned by a Poznan business magazine to be Poland's richest man. Left is Jerzy Janow, a senior executive, who 18 months ago was a high school mathematics teacher. Last year Mr Gawronik imported one in five litres of petrol bought by Polish motorists and Esso has signed him up to sell its lubricants. His business took off two years ago with the legalisation of private foreign exchange dealing. Up to now all his exchange offices have been on Poland's western borders or main cities. Now he is about to open his first exchange office on the Polish-Soviet border to do business with the 12,000 Soviet citizens who cross the border daily. But foreign exchange dealing now accounts for only one seventh of Mr Gawronik's turnover which last year rose sharply to 2,400bn zlotys, around Dollars 250m. He is now expanding into insurance, freight forwarding, arranging VAT refunds and oil refining. Mr Hubert Janiszewski, former vice-president of the state Foreign Investment Agency and now director of the private Polish Investment Company, staffed mainly by Anglo-Polish financial advisers, describes Mr Gawronik as ' a product of our times'. He estimates there are probably 100 such men actively making fortunes and transforming the economy by moving fast to grasp opportunities opened up by the often chaotic transition from state-owned to private economy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 19 Jun (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  today received a visiting south Yemen delegation led by Salim  Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council and  assistant secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party.  Muhammad said that during the meeting they discussed  implementation of Security Council Resolution 924 and Egypt's  role, particularly before the crisis erupted and during the  fighting, and all of President Mubarak's appeals and stances.    He noted that they also reviewed the efforts being made by  Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general, especially  his meeting today with a south Yemen representative on the  committee that will discuss a cease-fire. He said: We agreed  on this proposal, which the representative of the UN secretary  general has submitted and we are ready for this meeting. He  noted that a delegation representing the other party is expected  in Cairo from Sanaa. He said that the representative of the UN  secretary general is exerting efforts to bring about a  cease-fire, noting that this is the most urgent issue at  present. He pointed out that if a cease-fire is reached, the  discussion between the two parties will focus on forming a  delegation to debate the other issues. He said that a meeting  between the southern and northern delegations hinges on a  cease-fire and Sanaa's compliance with Security Council  Resolution 924. He said that Sanaa is trying to circumvent the  issue and mark time. He said: We will turn to the Security  Council to pass a new resolution deterring any party from  violating Resolution 924, adding that right now this is what is  required. Muhammad said that we will decide whether or not to  go the Security Council in light of the contacts being made by  UN Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi.    Muhammad said that fierce fighting continues and is focusing  on encircling the Aden Governorate, and on finding loopholes to  make the public feel that Aden is coming under an offensive. He  noted that courageous resistance is confronting the attackers  and things are beginning to change, particularly in the  governorates of Shabwah and Lahij. He said that popular  resistance has begun in these governorates. He noted that Aden  has a cause adding: We are a recognized entity and are facing  an invasion and occupation and our homes are being destroyed.  He said: We have a right to request aid to defend our lives  and future. He pointed out that the countries that supply south  Yemen with arms are countries that support right and respect  neighborliness, peace, and stability in the region. He said  that these are Arab and friendly countries. He stressed that  the war will yield other results and that negotiations will  determine the Yemeni future, noting that the future will not be  the same as it was before the war. He emphasized that unity  cannot be imposed by force, noting that when we established  unity it was agreed upon voluntarily. He said that regrettably  this unity was destroyed from within by forces that do not want  unity and who believe that unity is blood and violating the  rights of others. He said that a unity that is not based on  sound and principled foundations cannot survive because rockets  and guns have destroyed this fragile unity.</p>

Bhatia, Indian minister  of state for external affairs, stressed today that the stability  of the Gulf region was dependent on Iraq's compliance with all  UN resolutions related to the war to liberate Kuwait.    In an exclusive interview with KUNA, Bhatia said that India,  which had participated through the UN in formulating these  resolutions, was aware that this was the way to achieve the  prosperity [rakha'] of the region.    About his visit to Kuwait, Bhatia said that it was aimed at  discussing prospects for cooperation and investment between the  two countries. He said he had discussed the current economic  reforms in India with the senior Kuwaiti officials he met today.

Regarding the nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan,  Bhatia said that India previously declared that it did not  believe in the military use of nuclear energy and India used  nuclear energy for civilian purposes. He revealed that India  was discussing the question of disarmament with Pakistan, and  expressed his hope that Islamabad would agree to that.    Regarding his tour after Kuwait, Bhatia said that he would  visit Bahrain and Yemen to discuss the prospect of increasing  trade exchanges and bolstering bilateral cooperation with  Manamah and San'a'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Some mystery is surrounding the negotiations that  have been going on between Malawi's new UDF [United Democratic  Front] government of President Bakili Muluzi and their allies in  opposition, Aford [Alliance for Democracy], led by Chakufwa  Chihana. Certainly, they were startling. Aford which gained 36  seats against the UDF's 84, was apparently unhappy with the  junior ministries it was offered. Yesterday, there were  conflicting reports that the talks had broken down or were still  on. There have also been suggestions that Aford is now talking  to the former ruling party, Hastings Banda's MCP [Malawi  Congress Party]. On the line to Blantyre, Mary Harper asked  Nick Young of the London FINANCIAL TIMES exactly what the  position was.    [Begin recording] [Young] Well, if I can begin by saying  that  at the moment, President Muluzi is out of the country. He left  behind the secretary general of the party, Harry Thompson, to  conduct the talks with Aford. I understand that they have  stalled rather than broken down and I don't personally believe  there will be any development until Muluzi returns to have a  personal input into what is on offer. The position, as I  understand it, is that the UDF government has offered Aford the  possibility of having three seats in cabinet, fairly minor  posts. I am told, I don't know if this correct, but I am told  that offer has now been cut to three minor posts plus a couple  of deputy ministries. Now, my personal belief is that Aford or  the leadership of Aford is divided over whether or not to take  these posts.    [Harper] So, does it really look like there is a serious  split in Aford?    [Young] Yes, I think there could well be, not necessarily a  split into two camps, perhaps a split into several.    [Harper] And what about Mr. Chihana himself?    [Young] Mr. Chihana is keeping a very low profile. He is  operating in negotiations through junior colleagues and he is a  lot of the time incommunicado. He has remained in the north  since the election result. He is going around making a series  of public speeches, which he is doing apparently to calm  people's feelings down up there because there are a lot of  reports of strong secessionist demands coming from ordinary  people -- people saying let us just break away and form our own  country. He has been going around saying: No, we must respect  the election result and federalism or being a separate country  just isn't viable for the north.    [Harper] Now, we have had reports that since the stalling of  the talks between Aford and the government, Aford has now turned  to the former ruling MCP Party. Do you know anything about this?    [Young] Well, I certainly believe that they are talking to  each and I think that is natural and understable. Exactly how  the new Parliament is going to shape up, it is very far from  clear and at the very least, one would expect all the parties to  be sounding each other out. [end recording]</p>

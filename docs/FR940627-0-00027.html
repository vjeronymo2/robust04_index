			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The reporting requirements require pipelines to provide information relating to transportation transactions with affiliates. The pipelines must file FERC Form No. 592, a log containing information relating to requests for transportation service by affiliated marketers and to discounts provided to affiliates. The regulations also require the pipelines to maintain the same information for non-affiliated shippers and to provide that information to the Commission upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission imposed a sunset provision requiring a reevaluation of the requirements of the rule within one year to determine whether increased competition in transportation had mitigated the concerns about affiliate abuse. The Commission has extended the sunset provision on several occasions, most recently extending it until June 30, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Order No. 497&hyph;E, III FERC Stats. &amp; Regs.

One of the principal changes introduced by Order No. 636 was the initiation of capacity release mechanisms through which firm shippers can release their firm transportation capacity, including storage capacity, to others wanting to obtain the capacity. The Commission also required that pipelines establish EBBs to provide information about available firm and interruptible capacity on the pipeline, including the firm capacity available through capacity release. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;&sect;284.8(b)(4); 284.9(b)(4).

In Order No. 497&hyph;D, the Commission eliminated the requirement that pipelines file the Form No. 592 containing the affiliated transportation log with the Commission, requiring instead that they provide this information on their EBBs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission also determined that Order No. 497 does not apply to temporary capacity releases, because such releases are not a request for transportation to the pipeline. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The releasing shipper, not the pipeline, controls and makes the determination to release capacity; the pipeline merely facilitates the transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Order No. 497&hyph;D, III FERC Stats. &amp; Regs.

A temporary capacity release occurs when the releasing shipper retains its rights to the capacity when the release period ends. A permanent release ends the releasing shipper's rights and responsibilities under the contract and the contract is transferred to the replacement shipper.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With the implementation of Order No. 636 on virtually all pipelines, the Commission reevaluated its Order No. 497 requirements in light of the requirements of Order No. 636 as well as the Commission's experience under Order No. 497. On December 23, 1993, the Commission issued the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in this docket in which the Commission proposed significant reductions in the Order No. 497 reporting requirements as well as the elimination of one of the Standards of Conduct. The Commission, however, also invited comment on the need for, and retention of, the requirements as a whole. The Commission has received 22 comments on the NOPR. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Standards of Conduct and Reporting Requirements for Transportation and Affiliate Transactions, 59 FR 268 (Jan. 4, 1994), IV FERC Stats. &amp; Regs.

Summary of the Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule revises both the Standards of Conduct and the reporting requirements in a number of respects. The Commission is reducing the pipelines' reporting burden by eliminating maintenance and posting requirements relating to requests for transportation service and implementing in their stead limited requirements that better comport with pipeline operations under Order No. 636.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 UNISYS OFFICIALS NAMED IN FRAUD PROBE  </P> <P> In an apparent indication of the prosecution's next thrust in the massive  Pentagon fraud investigation, the government released documents Friday  detailing a scheme involving three previously unnamed executives of the Unisys  Corp. who allegedly conspired to pay Defense Department officials for  privileged information.  </P> <P> The documents focus on a Unisys operation in Eagan, Minn., where executives are  alleged to have paid defense consultants to gather confidential details about a  $100-million Marine Corps contract.  </P> <P> While the government previously had indicated that Unisys' effort to win the  lucrative ATAAC communications equipment contract was a subject of the  corruption probe, the decision to release new details suggests that prosecutors  may have targeted those involved for the next round of criminal charges. The  documents were released by the office of U.S. Atty. Henry E. Hudson in  Alexandria, Va., which is coordinating the investigation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Releasing Documents  </P> <P> The government, which had for the last 10 months fought to block efforts to  make information about its Minnesota investigation public, has been releasing  documents about elements of the investigation while preparing to file formal  charges about them.  </P> <P> The new information, which was also unsealed in Minneapolis federal court, came  eight days after the government secured the convictions of two Teledyne  Electronics Inc. executives in a judgment that wrapped up the first round of  prosecution efforts.  </P> <P> Among the 14 individuals and two corporations convicted in that stage of the  probe was Jack A. Sherman, a Marine Corps official who admitted that he  accepted $43,000 from consultants in return for confidential information on the  ATAAC contract. Another figure convicted was consultant William L. Parkin,  described as the chief conduit of the information.  </P> <P> The new documents revealed that Sherman, who pleaded guilty in January, had  been secretly cooperating with investigators for two months.  </P> <P> No charges have been filed against the other principals alleged to have played  a role in the scheme, including the three second-tier Unisys executives and two  consultants named in the documents.  </P> <P> Some passages outlining alleged wrongdoing at the Minnesota office of the  Pennsyvania-based corporation were deleted, indicating that portions of that  investigation may be continuing. The leading prosecutor in the case, Assistant  U.S. Atty. Joseph J. Aronica, declined to say whether he expected charges to be  forthcoming in the near future.  </P> <P> But Aronica made clear that the new revelations "broaden the case beyond what  was previously known publicly."  </P> <P> "When we release these (documents)," Aronica said, "we're satisfied that the  investigation has proceeded to such a point that it won't be jeopardized by  these things coming out in the open."  </P> <P> The documents, an affidavit and a search warrant filed last June when federal  agents searched Minnesota offices of Unisys Defense Systems, alleged that  company employees there had "been involved in criminal activities" with  consultants Parkin, Thomas E. Muldoon and William Sanda.  </P> <P> It quoted Sanda as saying that Unisys employees had urged him to obtain details  about their competitors' bids on the Advanced Tactical Air Command Central  project, which involved military air traffic control equipment, and about  Defense Department evaluations of the various bids.  </P> <P> Unisys paid Sanda at least $18,000 for the service, much of which was passed on  to other consultants who used it to pay sources within the Pentagon, the  documents indicate. One of the consultants working with Sanda in the scheme was  actually a confidential government informant, the papers show.  </P> <P> The government names three Unisys executives -- William Geiger, Ralph Hughes  and Robert Elfering -- as the consultants' contacts within the company.  </P> <P> None of those named could be reached for comment. A Unisys spokeswoman, Janet  Hess, declined to comment on the allegations or to provide details about the  employees, saying, "We have to have time to examine the documents."  </P> <P> Geiger, a vice president, and Elfering, a marketing manager, are still with  Unisys, sources said. Hughes, a former marketing director, has left the  corporation, they said.  </P> <P> Another former Unisys vice president who worked in the company's Long Island  operation, Charles F. Gardner, already has pleaded guilty to charges of bribing  Pentagon officials.  </P> <P> The company, which has not been charged with any crimes, has blamed wrongdoing  on officials who came to the company from the Sperry Corp., which was acquired  by the Burroughs Corp. in 1986 in a corporate merger that formed Unisys.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Liu </F> Zhenying (0491 2182 5391), and XINHUA reporter Zou Aiguo (6760  1947 0948)]    [Text] Beijing, 16 May (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a meeting  with representatives attending the 10th National Conference on  Civil Affairs, Premier Li Peng said today that civil affairs  departments have lots of work to do, and civil affairs must be  strengthened not weakened. He said: Civil affairs departments  must always consider it their objective to protect the masses'  vital interests, and safeguard their basic rights and interests.  Civil affairs departments must improve grass-roots operations,  properly manage various social projects, go deep into  grass-roots units, and use various appropriate ways to help  local people solve their problems, maintain social order, and  expedite the healthy development of socialist ethics and  material progress.    Vice Premier Zou Jiahua; State Councillor Li Tieying; and  leading comrades Chi Haotian, Song Jian, Li Guixian, and Chen  Junsheng were present at the meeting, which took place at  Zhongnanhai this morning. Li Guixian chaired the meeting.    At the meeting, Minister of Civil Affairs Doje Cering gave a  briefing on the national conference on civil affairs and actual  state of civil affairs in the country. Zhang Ruifeng, vice  governor of Shandong; Zhang Yuqin, vice governor of Guizhou; Ma  Lin, director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Civil Affairs  Department; Zhang Baohuan, director of the Hebei Provincial  Civil Affairs Department; and Bai Xianjing, director of the  Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Civil Affairs Department, took  the floor at the meeting one after another.    In their speeches, they maintained that the conference has  factually summed up the state of civil affairs in the past five  years; and that the basic ideas, guiding thought, objectives,  and principal tasks the conference has put forth are in line  with the national needs -- reform, development, and stability --  as well as the general policy set by the Central Committee.  They pointed out that civil affairs departments must proceed  from practical needs, continue to explore new ways to handle  civil affairs when the nation is embarked on building a  socialist market economic system, accomplish all assignments  which the conference has put forth, and improve the overall  quality of civil affairs so that civil affairs departments can  give full scope to their functions.    In his speech, Li Peng said that the civil affairs  conference  has discussed major principles for civil affairs, that the  meeting was a success, and the results which civil affairs  departments have achieved over the years have also been quite  fruitful. Li Peng extended the cordial regards of the CPC  Central Committee and State Council to the representatives  attending the conference as well as comrades who have been  working diligently in the nation's civil affairs departments.    Li Peng said: China's reform has entered a crucial period  since the convocation of the 14th National Party Congress, and  especially since the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee. When we implement the Central Committee's  general policy of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform,  opening up wider to the outside world, expediting development,  and maintaining stability," the most important thing we must do  is to properly handle the relationship among reform,  development, and stability. Comrade Xiaoping said: "Without a  stable social and political environment, reform and construction  cannot be successful." This is why the Central Committee has  repeatedly stressed the need to expedite reform and construction  while ensuring stability, as well as the need to maintain  long-term social stability through reform and construction.  Maintaining social stability even has strategic significance  during the initial period of building our socialist market  economic system. This is an invaluable experience China has  gained from carrying out reform over the past decade or so.    Li Peng pointed out: Both the central and local  authorities are grasping social stability because it is an  important matter. Proceeding from their respective functions,  various departments should create a good social environment for  reform and development by solving social contradictions,  maintaining social stability, and forming a comprehensive  mechanism for social stability in China. Over the past dozens  of years, the civil affairs departments have worked very hard  and played a great role in maintaining social stability by  solving social problems. Civil affairs personnel have  constantly visited grass-roots units to convey the party and  government's concern for dependents of servicemen and  revolutionary martyrs, demobilized soldiers, bereaved old  people, disabled children, and impoverished households. They  are worthy of being called the "oxen" of the masses because  fearless of hardships, they have insisted on bringing comfort to  thousands of households. The achievements made in civil affairs  work over the past four decades reflects, on the one hand, the  superiority of the socialist system in China and, on the other,  represents a sound return blow against hostile forces in the  West who attack China on the question of human rights. Once we  have done our civil affairs work well, we will be able to create  a good social environment for economic construction, thereby  promoting coordinated social and economic development.    Li Peng said: As natural disasters are common in China,  every year a large number of people become their victims.  Also, there are bereaved old folks, sick and disabled people,  low-income people, and others who have social difficulties. The  majority of these people whose living conditions are rather  poor, live in rural areas. Therefore, governments at all levels  should pay special attention to the question of poverty existing  in some rural areas. He said: We should change the current  method of relying solely on government relief. We should  broaden the method by gradually establishing a system by which  governments at various levels share responsibility for providing  relief.    Li Peng pointed out: In the new situation, the civil affairs  departments should continue to emancipate their minds, deepen  reform, effectively carry out their functions, protect the  people's rights and interests, basic living conditions, regulate  social relations, alleviate social contradictions, solve social  problems, and do a good job in maintaining social stability and  promoting the building of a socialist spiritual civilization.  In particular, the civil affairs departments should play a  greater role in safeguarding society, in promoting national  defense, and in building grass-roots political power and  basic-level self-governing organizations.    Li Peng expressed the hope that party committees and  governments, proceeding from the overall purpose of reform,  development, and stability, will pay special attention to civil  affairs work; make it an important item on their agendas; and  effectively strengthen leadership over this work. He expressed  the conviction that under the leadership of the party Central  Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, cadres and  workers on the civil affairs front will achieve more brilliant  results and make greater contributions to promoting economic  development and social stability in China if they continue to  carry forward the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly,  fear no hardships, overcome difficulties, boldly open up new  channels, and work hard in unity.    Attending the discussion meeting were Chen Jinhua, minister  of the State Planning Commission; Tao Siju, minister of public  security; Liu Zhongli, minister of finance; Song Defu, minister  of personnel; and responsible persons of the relevant  departments under the State Council.</p>

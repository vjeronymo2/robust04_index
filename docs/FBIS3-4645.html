			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New York, Feb. 25 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the  United States, resuming their working-level contact at UN  headquarters on Friday to discuss Pyongyang's acceptance of  nuclear inspections and other issues, failed to reach a final  agreement.    After the meeting, Ho Chong, deputy chief of the North  Korean  mission to the United Nations, told reporters that he and U.S.  officials had discussed taking four simultaneous steps but that  they could not narrow their differences. Ho said a meeting  would be held again later in the day, but U.S. representative  Tom Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of state for Asian and  Pacific affairs, had a doubt about the possibility.    Hubbard was unsure whether another contact would take place  later that day, citing the U.S. position that this was  unnecessary unless North Korea offered a compromise.    At Wednesday's contact, Pyongyang proposed that it and  Washington take four simultaneous steps including joint  announcement of a third round of high-level talks and suspension  of this year's Team Spirit military exercise. The other two  steps are North Korea's positive consideration of meeting with  South Korea on an exchange of special envoys, and Pyongyang's  acceptance of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  inspections, according to a North Korean official.    The U.S. delegation which attended Wednesday's contact  returned to Washington on Thursday, but North Korean officials  asked the Americans to resume their talks after receiving  instructions from Pyongyang, according to sources.    Announcement of a final agreement had been expected at  Friday's contact, but the two sides seemingly failed again to  agree on an exchange of special envoys between South and North  Korea, diplomatic sources said.    Pyongyang maintains that if Seoul proposed exchanging  special  envoys, it would agree to preparatory talks, while Washington  asserts that the exchange must be realized.    Washington is saying that a decision on the schedule for the  third round of high-level talks with Pyongyang and suspension of  Team Spirit are possible only after the IAEA begins inspection  of North Korea's nuclear sites.    North Korea, on the other hand, is insisting that all steps  be taken simultaneously.</p>

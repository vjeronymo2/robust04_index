			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber pact talks will aim to break price deadlock Key rubber producing and consuming states will meet in Kuala Lumpur next week to try to break a deadlock over a new price-stabilisation pact, delegates to the meeting said, reports Reuter from Singapore. The rift over pricing blocked efforts to renegotiate the International Natural Rubber Agreement at the last UN-sponsored talks in Geneva in April. Delegates said a high-level working group including the top three Asian producers would meet informally from July 12 to 14 ahead of another round of talks in Geneva. The group comprises Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the top three consumers - Japan, the European Union and the US. The dispute centres on the reference price, which guides market interventions by the buffer stock manager of the International Natural Rubber Organisation. Consumers want it held at or near the level at the end of the current accord. Producers want it raised, but have not said by how much.</p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bigger sugar shortfall forecast THE SHORTFALL in world sugar supply is expected to more than double next season, leading to sustained price rises, according to a report published today by ED &amp; F. Man, the London trading house. Man estimates that there will be a production deficit of 734,000 tonnes for October 1993 to September 1994 compared with 338,000 tonnes the previous year. 'The resulting draw down in stocks in a number of countries particularly in India and China leaves these markets without a buffer for further substantial de-stocking,' it says. A cloud of uncertainty hangs over the coming season, and many crops that suffered last year are not expected to recover fully, says Man. 'The resulting supply deficit is expected to have a more lasting influence on prices. . . in the 1993-94 season the possibility of further de-stocking has diminished and the prospects for white sugar supplies have declined.' Man predicts that world production, based on individual countries' crop years, will rise by nearly 1m tonnes to 112.4m tonnes compared with 1992-93, still well below the levels of the previous two years. It puts consumption, which is calculated differently, using the October to September period, at 113.7m tonnes, an increase of 1.8m tonnes or 1.6 per cent on 1992-93. Man has revised its production and consumption estimates for last season, bringing it into line with other forecasts. It has reversed its May forecast of a supply surplus of 562,000 tonnes into a deficit of 455,000 tonnes. It accounts for the change by saying there has been a big fall in estimated sugar cane production and concomitant strong demand for white sugar from the former Soviet Union. Its estimate for Russian consumption last season now stands at 6.5m tonnes compared with 5.4m tonnes in May.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In a report from inside Iraq, our sources say that a  group of the Islamic resistance threw three hand grenades at the  al-Nasiriyah governor's headquarters during his meeting with  security and intelligence officials. The sources say the  resulting explosion inflicted material damage on the building,  wounded a number of its guards, and prompted the governor and  the regime's henchmen to hide in an underground shelter.    In another development, the resistance dealt a destructive  blow to the district officer's headquarters in al-Nasiriyah on  the evening of 18 March. Various types of light and medium  weapons and mortars were used. Our sources confirm that eight  regime elements were killed and others wounded. Heavy damage  was inflicted on the building, which the regime uses as a center  for its mercenaries and criminals who monitor the citizens'  movements and arrest them.</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE BITES  </P> <P> The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews.  </P> <P> Kachina, 222 Forest Ave., Laguna Beach. (714) 497-5546. Open nightly from 5:30  to 10.  </P> <P>  Kachina is new, but it already may be the county's best restaurant. Named for  an American Indian doll of the Southwest, the restaurant serves food that is  rare and exotic -- edible art. David Wilhelm, late of Pave and the El Torito  Grill, has composed a menu featuring some of the most imaginative, intelligent  cooking this side of the Twilight Zone, full of sumptuous tastes and  color-splashed textures. Run, don't walk, to taste their green corn tamale,  honey glazed pork and celestial chocolate bread pudding. And go early.  </P> <P> Agostino's, 34700 Coast Highway, Capistrano Beach. (714) 661-8266. Open  Tuesdays through Sundays noon to 3 p.m. and 5 to 10 p.m.  </P> <P>  Entirely new management is in place at this Chicago-style Italian restaurant,  famous for its homemade sausage and romantic beach view. Much of the menu,  including the tableside Caesar and the rich, creamy pastas, is the same as it  was when the place was called Sabatino's. But Agostino already has added many  seafood dishes including mussels, fresh salmon and calamari. The bar is as good  a hangout as you'll find on Capo Beach.  </P> <P> Tuttomare, 545 Newport Center Dr., Newport Beach. (714) 640-6333. Open Mondays  through Thursdays 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Fridays 11 to midnight; Saturdays 11:30  to midnight, Sundays 5 to 10.  </P> <P>  Service is fluid and solicitious at this smart, stunning restaurant, located  in the building that used to house the Savannah Grill, but the kitchen is  having its ups and downs. Wonderful, yeasty foccaccia bread served with virgin  olive oil and the fine grilled seafoods are some of the ups. Naked vegetables  and bland pasta dishes are some of the downs. Lombata di vitello, veal chop  with fontina and prosciutto, is one reason to go back for a second look.  </P> <P> Umi, 2075 Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa. (714) 631-2208. Open Tuesdays through  Sundays 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5:30 to 10:30, Fridays and Saturdays till 11.  </P> <P> Umi is a modern and imaginative but often unprofessional sushi bar with  high-tech pretensions, and knowing what to order is important: You are safe if  you stick with the sushi, which is fresh and crafted with an excellently  prepared rice, but it is easy to run aground on the many hot dishes. Among  them, best are a wonderful scallop casserole, a toothsome Japanese steak, and  yaki-onigiri, grilled triangles of sushi rice with various fillings. Service  can be painfully slow.  </P> <P> Pinnacle Peak, 9100 Trask Ave., Garden Grove. (714) 892-7311. Open Mondays  through Fridays 5 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., weekends till 10 p.m.  </P> <P> Crazy Horse Steak House, 1580 Brookhollow Dr., Santa Ana. (714) 549-1512. Open  Mondays through Fridays 11 a.m. to 2 a.m., Saturdays and Sundays 5 p.m. to 2  a.m.  </P> <P> While everyone else is busy disavowing addiction to good steak, sneak off to  one of these places. Leave the tie at home when you visit Pinnacle Peak;  someone will sneak up on you and cut it off. Honest. The restaurant's trail  boss steak, cooked over an open flame, is a char-broiled monster, a great value  at $9.95. The Crazy Horse is a bit longer on atmosphere but, apart from the  high-grade beef, it's run-of-the-mill. Many of the side dishes have been  frozen, and the whole place has a packaged feel about it.  </P></p>

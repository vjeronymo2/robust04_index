			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Agreement on fighting music pirates THE International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which represents record companies worldwide, and Philips, the Dutch consumer electronics group, have reached an agreement on a method to combat music piracy using digital technology. The agreement between the federation and the inventor of the compact disc is expected to help stem the loss of revenue to the recording industry resulting from unauthorised copies of recordings on CDs, which the IFPI estimates at 25m units worth up to Dollars 250m (Pounds 164m) in 1992. Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding, Philips will introduce codes into the manufacturing process that will make it possible to identify the maker of a CD or Digital Compact Cassette, as well as the location and equipment used. Philips is the licensor of CD and DCC, a tape launched in autumn by the Dutch group. For licensees of DCC, use of the identification codes will be mandatory. The primary sources of unauthorised CDs are eastern Europe, South Korea and Taiwan. The concern over CD piracy comes when growth in the market has slowed in Europe and the US.</p>

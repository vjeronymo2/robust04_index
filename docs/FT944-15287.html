			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Observer: Passing the Lloyds' chair Sir David Walker is not the first ex-Bank of England director to seek his fortune in the City and will almost certainly not be the last. Yet his decision to step down as a deputy chairman of Lloyds Bank, when he was widely thought to be the chairman in waiting, is puzzling. True, the chairman of Morgan Stanley's European operations is likely to earn several times the Pounds 223,000 that the chairman of Lloyds Bank got last year. At 54, Sir David is still young enough to make some serious money after a long career of public service. Even so he is turning down the chance of leading Britain's most successful high street bank into the next century in order to be the European figurehead of a Wall Street broker. Whether or not Sir David sensed that the chairmanship of Lloyds was no longer in his grasp, his departure raises the fascinating question of whether Sir Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive, will be allowed to take over as chairman from the elderly Sir Robin Ibbs who turns 70 in 1996 . This would be a turn up for the books since Lloyds has never given the chairman's job to one of its own managers before. But Sir Brian has transformed the group and parallels could be drawn with Sir Edward Holden, the banking 'superman' who turned Midland Bank into the biggest bank in the world at the turn of the century, and was rewarded with the Midland chair. Lloyds Bank could do a lot worse than promote one of the workers. These days clearing bank chairmen don't have to be gentlemen.</p>

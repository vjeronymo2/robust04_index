			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities await the Budget account THE LAST day of the pre-Budget trading account in UK equities featured significant activity in specific stocks as the institutions balanced their portfolios ahead of Mr Norman Lamont's speech next Tuesday afternoon. Traders were surprised by the disclosure of another fund-raising move, although Thorn-EMI's rights issue call for Pounds 516m was well-received in a market taking a favourable view of the group's purchase of Virgin Music. Trading volume in equities remained high, although Seaq-reported deals of 538.4m shares slipped below Thursday's 608.4m. But traders maintained that the all-important retail business total, which reached Pounds 1.1bn on Thursday, probably declined yesterday; detailed statistics on retail business for Friday's equity trading session will not be available until Monday. With the latest public opinion polls indicating that public ratings of the Conservative and Labour parties remain close together, the stock market had little definitive lead. The pound remained nervous in the wake of Thursday's fall, with the sterling/D-Mark rate finally unchanged in London. Some analysts in the City of London have now resigned themselves to the view that the UK general election expected early in April will produce a 'hung' parliament, with no political party winning an overall majority in the UK parliament; this would imply the likelihood of an other general election in the UK later this year, with a further period of uncertainty. Government bonds steadied after two sessions of falling prices and recovered about  1/8 of recent falls. But the bond sector remained nervous, reflecting the growing worry over the level of Public Sector Borrowing Requirement and the sudden downturn in sterling on Thursday. The FT-SE Index closed 5.2 down at 2,533.1, having moved erratically between 2,542.7 and 2,528.6 during the session. The mood was helped in late dealings by a fairly steady performance on Wall Street, which shed only 2.68 on the Dow Average in early deals following the announcement of the US employment data. The pre-Budget account which closed last night has seen the Footsie drift lower by 9.2 as investors have shown caution ahead of Tuesday's Budget speech. At least two trading programmes were identified in the London market. In addition to busy trading in Thorn-EMI, which was bought strongly when the stock at first gave ground on news of the Virgin Music deal, there was ready institutional support for a number of other significant deals. Retail business in equities has risen sharply this week as investment funds have repositioned themselves ahead of Tuesday's budget speech.</p>

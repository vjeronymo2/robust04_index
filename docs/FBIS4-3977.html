			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- A spokesman for the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed the belief that following  the establishment of Japan's new government, China and Japan  will continue to maintain their close coordination and  cooperation and will work together to promote the long-term and  steady development of the two countries' relations.    The spokesman made the statement while answering a  reporter's  question at a news conference held this afternoon.    The reporter asked: Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is now  forming his cabinet, what is your comment? What do you expect  from the new Japanese Government?    The spokesman said: Premier Li Peng has sent a  congratulatory message to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. Mr. Hata  is a statesman with whom the Chinese people are familiar. "We  appreciate the zeal and foresight he has demonstrated in  strengthening Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation, as well  as the great deal of work he has accomplished for this purpose.  Ruling and nonruling parties in Japan share a common  understanding toward the development of reciprocal and  cooperative relations between China and Japan in all fields. We  believe that, following the establishment of the new Japanese  Government, China and Japan will continue to maintain their  close coordination and cooperation and will work together in  promoting the long-term and steady development of the two  countries' relations."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Our Cabinda correspondent reports that on 12 June  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola armed forces  seized (Banza Sano), a former Portuguese armed forces barracks  in the Buco Zau region. Popular Movement for the Liberation of  Angola troops used the barracks as a logistics base to assist  its heavy artillery in northeastern Cabinda. After a four-hour  clash, our forces destroyed one 75-mm gun, one Grad 1-P, one  14.5-mm gun, two arms depots, logistical equipment, and three  60-mm mortars. Our forces captured five AK-47's and killed six  members of the 23d Commando Company.</p>

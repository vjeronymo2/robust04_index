			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Critical question not answered by Lloyd's Sir, Your report, 'Lloyd's confident on solvency tests' (May 25) of the Lloyd's AGM referred to protests from the floor about Lloyd's alleged failure in the early 1980s to disseminate information to Names about asbestos-related losses. It did not mention the repeated failure of chairman David Rowland to answer the most critical question arising from the allegations. There is documentary evidence which substantiates that it was known to the then Committee of Lloyd's that enormous losses were in the pipeline. The question that was not answered was whether Parliament had been informed of these horrendous impending losses before passing in July 1982 the Lloyd's Act, which conferred on Lloyd's the special privileges of self-regulation and immunity from being sued. It is clear that Parliament was not informed. The facts were concealed from MPs as well as from Names, and since it is inconceivable that the 1982 Lloyd's Act would ever have reached the statute book had Parliament been aware of the immense and unquantifiable losses faced by Lloyd's, it is difficult not to conclude that these unique privileges were acquired by false pretences. Furthermore, Mr Rowland refused to make available the minutes of the Lloyd's Audit Committee and the Asbestos Working Party during the 1980-82 period.

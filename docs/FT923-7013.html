			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / West European car sales decline by 15.3% in year WEST EUROPEAN new car sales dropped by an estimated 15.3 per cent in July under the impact of a dramatic fall in new car sales in Germany, the single biggest European market. According to industry estimates German new car sales plunged by around 37 per cent in July to only 349,000 from 553,000 a year ago, when demand was still at a record level in the wake of unification. The accelerating fall in German new car sales will ring alarm bells in the European car industry and is expected to force car makers to revise downwards their earlier forecasts for a decline of only 1 per cent in west European new car sales for the whole of 1992. The trend in sales in the other big volume markets in Europe suggests that they will be unable to compensate for the fall in Germany. Hopes for a recovery in the very depressed UK market have not been realised. Sales in July were 8.5 per cent lower than a year ago, and car makers appear to have accepted that demand in the crucial month of August, which accounts for more than a fifth of UK new car sales, will be little changed from last year. At the same time the European industry is becoming increasingly cautious about the outlook in France and Spain. Spanish new car sales in the first seven months were still 16.9 per cent higher than a year ago, but the rate of increase fell to 8.9 per cent in July, and car makers fear tightening economic measures will slow the recovery further. Overall West European new car sales in July fell to around 1.13m from 1.33m a year ago. Demand was lower than a year ago in 10 of 17 markets across west Europe. In the first seven months of the year west European new car sales at 8.5m were 3.3 per cent lower than a year ago, led most importantly by an estimated fall of 14.4 per cent in Germany to 2.54m. Renault, the French car maker, has gained most ground among the big six volume car makers with a 3.7 per cent jump in sales in the first seven months increasing its share to 10.6 per cent from 9.9 per cent a year ago. In July it managed to hold its sales virtually unchanged from a year ago in contrast to all its volume car rivals. Despite the weakening German market the Volkswagen group, which includes Audi, SEAT and Skoda, has consolidated its commanding overall lead. An estimated rise of 1.6 per cent in its sales volume in the first seven months has allowed it to raise its west European market share to a record 17.8 per cent from 16.9 per cent a year ago. Its lead has been strengthened by the waning fortunes of the Fiat group, which has seen sales drop by an estimated 8.7 per cent in the first seven months of the year, narrowly holding on to second place ahead of General Motors (Opel/Vauxhall) and the Peugeot group, which includes Citroen.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS                             January-July 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Volume    Volume     Share (%)   Share (%)                               (Units)  Change (%) Jan-Jul 92  Jan-Jul 91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET                 8,467,000    -3.3       100.0       100.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MANUFACTURERS:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Volkswagen* (incl.           1,507,000    +1.6        17.8        16.9 Audi, SEAT &amp; Skoda) Fiat (incl.

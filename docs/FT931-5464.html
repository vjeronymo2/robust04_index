			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Lower markka helps Kemira KEMIRA, the Finnish state-owned chemicals group, cut its pre-tax loss to FM337m (Dollars 75.1m) in 1992 from FM522m the previous year. Rationalisation, the depreciation of the markka and the start-up of new facilities all helped the recovery, the company said. But it noted that cheap imports from eastern Europe and lower European fertiliser demand helped to keep it in the red. Sales rose 3 per cent to FM11.2bn.</p>

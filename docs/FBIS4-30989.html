			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Omonoia Implements the Project of the Greek Government </F> Against Albania" -- ATA headline]    [Text] Tirana, May 30 (ATA) -- On May 29, the newspaper  REPUBLIKA published the letter that the chairman of the General  Council of the Omonoia organisation in Albania, Sotir Qiriazati,  sent on April 8, 1994 to Mr. Constantine Mitsotakis, ex-premier  of Greece. Follows the letter:    The General Council of Omonoia, the organisation  representing  the Greek minority in Albania, deems it necessary to thank you,  personally, the Greek Government and whole Greek people, for the  all round and constant support for the Hellenization of the long  suffering North Epirus. On this occasion, Mr. Premier, let us  decide and express some of our opinions on general problems  preoccupying the Hellenization of North Epirus and on whose  solution depends further development.    Firstly: The present international conditions, I believe,  allow the North Epirus problem, too, to appear on the  international arena. We are confident that the government of the  motherland will exploit all the existing possibilities to  resolve this national question.    Secondly, our organisation, since the first moment of its  functioning, has assumed as its main objective the revival of  the Hellenism living in Albania as well national, religious,  spiritual, cultural, economic and social development, because in  this way Hellenism is believed not only to stay in its own  hearth but also to recover and flourish obviously.    But, our zeal, toil, and efforts do not suffice to attain  this significant objective. We also need the support and love  of our motherland, a programmed political, economic, moral  assistance as well as the Greek Government aid.    Concretely:    1. It is necessary that Omonoia be gradually organised into  a small undeclared government with the corresponding services  based on the Greek ministries with employees, offices, and a  budget, as the conditions prevailing in Albania enable it to  exercise the policy and carry out the duty of governing in the  North Epirus land. In case this objective is realised, we  gradually create predispositions for the autonomy of the region,  make it evident and develop as an internal national political,  cultural, economic and running force at home. In order to move  ahead in this direction, we necessitate experience and special  advice as well as considerable amounts of money.    2. Coordination of efforts is necessary and every ministry  of the Greek Government should designate counsellors competent  for Albania's Hellenization, give orientations, supervise the  correct application of the governmental policy and coordinate  this government's accord. An equal extension for all the bodies  with leading and executive powers is an indispensable demand for  the Foreign Ministry.    3. It is the sole and insisting demand of this country and  people to have a free communication with the homeland, it is a  measure which was successful before the war and for the special  value and conditions created it will have magnificent results  for all the question of North Epirus because it:    a. Will bring the people closer to the final solution  through its national and psychological spirit:    b. Will economically bring about a rapid improvement of the  standard of living of the people and later their continuous  staying in their homes:    c. Will lead to non-abandonment of their homes by our people  who have been forced to install their families in Greece because  they will be given the possibility to legally bring their  families back whenever they want and whenever it is needed:    d. It will stop the phenomenon of refugees and reprisals  among North Epirus people who are forced to pass illegally and  secretly the border between the two countries and become  refugees hunted on the streets and villages of Greece, or  arrested by Greek relevant bodies. Tortured, humiliated, and  hopeless they are forced to be back to Albania.    4. A necessary and primary condition for the salvation and  survival of the Greek minority in Albania is the rapid  development of this region through all sided investments and "a  unique program of development of the economy of Epirus" until  the other side, too, wins. You, Mr. Premier, have expressed  this idea during your latest visit to the border point of  Kakavije.    Thus, fast investments, both private and state, and the  valuation of fruitful economic sources and the labour force of  the people of this region are necessary. We should also stress  the importance that the spheres of agriculture, industry,  communication, telecommunication, improvement of roads,  construction of hospitals, education and culture have for the  development of our country. For optimal conditions, these  spheres demand fast and efficient involvement of the Greek state.    5. Another question to be considered with responsibility and  seriousness, a question that should be solved by the Greek  state, Greek universities, and scientific organizations is the  opposition to the systematic anti-Greek propaganda which through  a political, spiritual, and economic devotion has been spread  throughout Albania and in the foreign world with the technical  creation of the "Cam question" and the falsification of the  history of Epirus.    It is still necessary that the Greek mass media (television,  radio and press) must give an oral reply to Albanian liars and  falsifiers, pseudo-scientists and through a high responsibility  they should address the Greek minority and North Epirus in  general in their programs and news bulletins.    6. Finally there is a need of strengthening essentially the  exarch of the Orthodox Church of Albania, the honoured  Anastasios Janullatos, to be able to carry out his as difficult  as precious job for our national interests.    Assured of having your continuous support on our way, Mr.  Premier, we thank you and again wish you good health and  strength for the success of our most important and national work  that you are leading.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: THEY CONTEMPLATE THE OCEAN WITH A SENSE OF WONDER  </P> <P>  -- You've heard of the seven seas and the Seven Wonders of the World, so why  not the seven underwater wonders of the world. A panel of 14 marine scientists,  conservationists and explorers named the sites to draw attention to the  underwater environment and to urge a global effort to protect it. Former  astronaut Scott Carpenter, now an environmental consultant, said: "We're  killing the oceans . . . . The ocean is a very delicate entity and people don't  realize that." Rick Sammon, president of CEDAM International, a nonprofit group  of marine scientists and conservationists that sponsored the panel, said: "If a  concerted effort is not undertaken soon to protect and preserve our underwater  wonders, they -- like the classic Seven Wonders of the World -- could be lost  forever through carelessness, negligence or deliberate mistreatment." The  panel's list: Palau, an island group in Micronesia; the northern Red Sea;  Australia's Great Barrier Reef; the waters of the Galapagos Islands off  Ecuador; Siberia's Lake Baikal; the Belize Barrier Reef, and the deep ocean  vents in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The panel gave an honorable mention  to whales, as one of seas' great living wonders.  </P> <P>  -- A Miami couple who survived 66 days in a life raft in the Pacific returned  home, each more than 50 pounds lighter. "We're going to rest -- and go away  from the ocean for a while, to the mountains, the prairies," William Butler,  59, said. Butler and his wife, Simone Butler, 56, said their boat was sunk by  whales and they fended off sharks and subsisted on fish they caught and  desalinated seawater. The couple was rescued by the Costa Rican Coast Guard.  Waiting for them at the airport with other relatives and friends was Jessica  Butler, the 2-month-old granddaughter born after they began their voyage.  </P> <P>  -- Japanese Emperer Akihito's second son, Prince Aya, 23, has received  permission to marry Kiko Kawashima, 22, a graduate student he has been seeing  for four years. Palace and government officials made no official announcement  but nearly all large newspapers and television networks carried the news about  the prince who is second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne. Kawashima, who  met the prince at Tokyo's Gakushuin University, sparked speculation about an  engagement announcement when she visited the Akasaka Palace with her parents.  The engagement must be approved by the Imperial Council, led by Prime Minister  Toshiki Kaifu. DAVE JOHNSON  </P></p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Paying for the excesses of an acquisitive past - Credit Lyonnais appears to be behind schedule in its FFr20bn asset sell-off Christmas may be near, but Credit Lyonnais, the troubled bank controlled by the French state, has hardly had time to enjoy the festivities as it deals with its over-consumption of the past few years. Barely has a day gone by in the past few months without some mention of the bank: either the latest effort to sell off part of its portfolio of subsidiaries and investments, or a new twist in its long-running battle with Mr Bernard Tapie, the businessman and politician. In the latest development, Credit Lyonnais yesterday confirmed it was in talks to sell off the 20 per cent stake owned by its investment arm Clinvest in the Forum des Halles, the former central Paris fresh food market converted into a commercial centre in the 1970s. In July, it disposed of its 65 per cent stake in FNAC, the retailer which has one of its main showrooms in the complex of shops inside Les Halles. On Tuesday, it announced the sale of its 57.3 per cent stake in Banca Lombarda to Credito Agrario Bresciano for about FFr650m (Dollars 119.9m). It has already closed other European operations this year, including its retail branches in the UK. Its other important sales this year include its stake in UAF, the life insurance company, for FFr1.16bn, and its shareholdings in Meridien Hotels, the specialist glass company Essilor, retail group Pinault-Printemps and TF1, the television channel. An announcement is likely shortly on the possible sale of Adidas, the sportswear manufacturer, which Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus, its chief executive, has an option to buy until the beginning of January. Other important deals include MGM, the film studio, which the bank is committed to selling, at least in part, by 1997. All of these transactions reflect the bank's plans to shed costs and generate income as part of a restructuring aimed at reducing its enormous losses, reported at FFr6.9bn for 1993 and FFr4.5bn for the first half of this year alone, on top of bad debt provisions of FFr10.1bn. However, Credit Lyonnais faces a difficult task. As part of the restructuring agreed with the French government last year, it needs to sell off FFr20bn in industrial and commercial assets in 1994 and 1995. Currently, the total is a little more than FFr9bn, and it looks as though it may be falling behind its target. Nevertheless, some analysts have been convinced by the apparent assurances given in the autumn by Mr Jean-Louis Peyrelevade, the chairman appointed by the government last year, that losses this year will be no more than in 1993. This was taken to imply that the state has in effect underwritten any losses beyond this level - something the French treasury refuses to confirm. However, one French analyst said yesterday: 'Nobody really knows enough about the accounts and assets of Credit Lyonnais, and only a few people in the government know whether they will salvage it. 'The bank can offer an opportunity to an investor who is ready to assume a very risky bet.' Certainly, little of the recent news of court battles and disposals has done much to affect the price of its certificats d'investissement, the bank's only traded shares, which are non-voting. They have remained relatively stable, after a succession of bad news earlier in the year drove them down sharply. Even so, Credit Lyonnais has remained a story of interest to the French press, if only because of Mr Bernard Tapie, the colourful businessman and politician who was an important client of the bank and who symbolises something of its history. Recent weeks have seen numerous twists in the protracted legal battles between Mr Tapie and the bank. He has now been declared personally bankrupt, and a court ruling in a few days will determine whether a liquidator can begin to sell his assets - the proceeds from which would be split primarily between Credit Lyonnais and the French tax authorities. Mr Tapie has appealed the bankruptcy order - which jeopardises his political career - and a hearing is expected in March. Meanwhile, he is suing Credit Lyonnais, claiming that it shares responsibility for the management of some of his companies. The courts recently rejected his libel claim against the bank and against newspapers that ran advertisements portraying his name on dustbins associated with the clear-out at the bank. Based on past experience, he will no doubt appeal.</p>

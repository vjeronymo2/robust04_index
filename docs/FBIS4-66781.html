			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, March 24--India today warned the United  States that any enhancement of Pakistan's offensive military  capabilities would escalate tensions in the region and seriously  affect India's security environment.    India's strong reservations on the possibility of an  amendment of the Pressler legislation or its waiver to supply  more F-16 jet fighters to Pakistan, were conveyed by the foreign  secretary, Mr Krishnan Srinivasan, to the U.S.  assistant-secretary of state, Ms Robin Raphel.    An external affairs ministry press release said Mr  Srinivasan  reiterated India's willingness to resume dialogue with Pakistan  at the foreign secretary level and hoped Pakistan would eschew  the path of internationalisation of the Kashmir issue and  support to trans-border terrorism.    Ms Raphel told the foreign secretary that the United States  was willing to encourage the process to facilitate resolution of  all outstanding problems between the two countries. It welcomed  the continuation of the bilateral dialogue between India and  Pakistan which was resumed in January last.    India has reaffirmed its consistent position on, and  preference for a global, comprehensive and non-discriminatory  approach to non-proliferation and security-related issues.    This was made clear to Ms Raphel by the minister of state  for external affairs, Mr R.L. Bhatia, when she called on him  today.    India has also expressed its reservations on the possibility  of discussing the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] and related  security issues in a multilateral forum comprising some selected  countries. This point was raised by Ms Raphel during her  discussions with Mr Srinivasan.    Ms Raphel had a series of discussions with Mr Bhatia, Mr  Srinivasan and also the commerce secretary. She got an  opportunity to interact with several joint secretaries of  territorial divisions in the external affairs ministry at a  working lunch hosted by the jt sec. (America).    The foreign secretary regretted the closure by Pakistan of  its consulate in Bombay and banning the entry of Indian citizens  through the Wagah checkpost on the border in Punjab. He drew her  attention to the unanimous resolution passed by Parliament on  Kashmir recently and asserted that Pakistan's efforts to  internationalise the issue would not succeed in fulfilling its  territorial ambitions.    Both sides agreed that contentious issues like the amendment  of the Pressler legislation to facilitate purchase of F-16  fighter aircraft by Pakistan should be taken up in detail with  Mr Strobe Talbott, the number two person in the state  department, who arrives here early next month.    During her discussions with the commerce secretary, Mr  Tesinder Khanna, both sides expressed satisfaction at the  increased momentum in bilateral trade relations, the growing  interest of the U.S. business community in commercial  interaction with India and expressed optimism about the growth  in trade.    Specific issues like difficulties being experienced by  Indian  software engineers in securing visas, apprehensions about  revival of Super 301 and other pressing issues were raised by  the commerce secretary.    Ms Raphel responded that America would use Super 301,  consistent with GATT and the results of the Uruguay round.    The commerce secretary also outlined India's efforts to work  out a preferential trading arrangement under the aegis of SAARC  [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]. He expressed  the hope that Pakistan would join other SAARC members in this  endeavour.    The U.S. commerce secretary, Mr Ron Brown, is also expected  to pay a visit sometime later this year.    Meanwhile, the Janata Dal today registered its strong  protest  over the manner in which the Indian government has dealt with  the visit of Ms Raphel, and wondered why the "nation's dignity"  had been compromised in such a way.    A statement issued here today by the senior Dal MP [member  of  Parliament] and former external affairs minister, Mr I.K.  Gujral, said he was astonished on how all protocol norms had  been disregarded and the visiting U.S. official received by the  country's home minister, the minister of state and the home  secretary.    Mr Gujral pointed out that all practioners of diplomacy knew  that such upgradation of protocol would imply nervousness and  uncertainty, adding that since the days of Nehru, India had  evolved a pattern of dealing with such visits particularly in  similar circumstances.    "I fail to understand why the nation's dignity is being  compromised in such a way. We have both the strength and pride  to preserve our nation's integrity. We do not need testimonials  from all and Sundry," Mr Gujral said.</p>

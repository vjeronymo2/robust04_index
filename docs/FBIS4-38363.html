			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 30 TASS -- Chairman of the Duma Committee  for Defence Sergey Yushenkov described as "symbolic" today's  meeting between Russian and American MP's [members of  parliament] in the lower house of the Russian parliament.    "Starting from this day," he stated, "the strategic missiles  of Russia, the United States and Great Britain will no longer be  aimed at targets in the three countries. This means that the  agreements reached by Boris Yeltsin, Bill Clinton and John  Major, aimed at consolidating world peace and international  security, are going into effect."    Leader of the U.S. delegation Sam Nunn, chairman of the  Senate Committee on Armed Services, noted the extraordinary  character of the current meeting between American and Russian  MPs. He said that the meetings he had with members of the  Supreme Soviet during his numerous visits to Moscow over the  past 20 years were purely formal, protocol-type functions, while  the current one was marked by cordiality. He said that his  delegation wanted to have serious talks with the Russian  parliamentary committees, dealing with military matters. Nunn  added that his delegation also planned to meet representatives  of the executive branch of government, but would focus mainly on  talks with parliament members.    Dwelling on the nature of the forthcoming contacts with  representatives of the U.S. Congress, Yushenkov told ITAR-TASS  that the parliamentarians of the two countries wanted to discuss  matters linked with the work of the Duma Committee on Defence  and the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services to adopt  military budgets and ratify international treaties, primarily  the START-1 and START-2 agreements. Yushenkov said that the  sides would also discuss problems linked with the expansion of  relations between Russia and the United States, and also  problems of security. "Of course, we shall discuss also the  all-embracing NATO Partnership for Peace programme," Yushenkov  stated.    He expressed the hope that some common approaches to those  problems would be determined, and "we shall be able to reach  agreement on further cooperation within the frameworks of the  agreements reached as a result of Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin's  recent visit to the United States". Yushenkov said that he  hoped the visit of the American delegation would turn a new page  in the cooperation of the two parliaments.</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management 3: Vital tool in minimising costs - The proportion of swaps linked to new issues has been declining THE Dollars 4,000bn global swaps market has become a vital tool for corporate treasurers in minimising funding costs and managing exposure. The availability of interest rate, currency - and now commodity - swaps to hedge exposure or match assets and liabilities has been an important factor in changing attitudes to corporate treasury management. 'It is no longer acceptable for companies to attribute poor performance or results to market movements,' according to one commodity swaps trader. A swap agreement is an exchange of liabilities between two (or more) counter-parties. Although many swap market participants are keen to point out that the market is used for hedging and not speculation, decisions over swap transactions often require a view on the market. But a decision not to use such instruments also expresses a view on market movements. In the case of interest rate swaps, for example, if a treasurer believes interest rates are rising, he may wish to swap floating-rate for fixed-rate liabilities. A swap agreement is often linked to a financing in the debt markets, since the form in which a particular company can most easily raise funds is not necessarily best suited to the company's needs. For example, a German firm may be able to raise relatively cheap funds in D-Marks, while it requires dollars to fund a subsidiary in the US. If it can find a US firm that requires D-Mark funds, the two can swap their liability payments to their mutual advantage. But the proportion of swaps linked to new issues has been declining, due to the erosion of arbitrage opportunities as disparities between markets break down. In earlier years, because retail investors, once the mainstay of the Eurobond market, were unsophisticated in assessing the value of bonds, companies could often issue fixed-rate bonds and swap the proceeds into floating-rate funds at a level substantially below the London interbank offered rate. Increasing participation by sophisticated institutional investors has contributed to a narrowing of swap spreads. In addition, the growing sophistication of swap dealers themselves means that any opportunities are swiftly arbitraged. 'By its nature, arbitrage removes the pricing gap that was its raison d'etre. I don't believe there will be a return to the sort of arbitrage opportunities available in the past,' according to Mr Malcolm Basing of Swiss Bank Corporation, who chairs the International Swap Dealers Association. Swap spreads - the differential between the yield on the government bond and on the comparable swap - have been at historically tight levels for some time, making it almost impossible for most borrowers to swap fixed-rate funds, except at margins often well above Libor. However, tight swap spreads are also a function of present views on interest rates, and of supply and demand, so changes in market trends can prompt a widening of spreads. For example, US dollar swaps spreads recently widened sharply, as a result of a change of view on US interest rates, now at a cyclical low. Expectations that US rates are set to rise soon prompted a sudden proliferation of fixed-rate payers - that is, counterparties keen to lock in fixed-rate funds while interest rates are low. This created attractive swap opportunities for companies wishing to obtain floating rate funding. Similarly, the recent fall in UK interest rates prompted a rash of activity in the sterling swaps market, as companies switched floating-rate liabilities into fixed-rate liabilities. New techniques allow companies to tailor transactions to their precise needs. For example, some companies have swapped into floating-rate while at the same time buying caps, which limit the risk of rising interest rates. Attitudes in the corporate treasury are also shaped by the nature of a company's core business. For example, if a business is highly negatively correlated with interest rate movements, such as in the building industry, there is a strong need to protect the business from rising interest rates. On the other hand, the company may be less concerned about benefiting from falling interest rates, since the business itself is likely to flourish in a low interest rate environment. A business less vulnerable to interest rate movements may be more determined to benefit from falling interest rates, and so may keep a higher proportion of its borrowings in floating-rate form. While the proportion of new issue business has waned, new participants have entered the market, as a broader range of companies became familiar with swap market techniques. Companies, which used to be concerned merely with finding cheaper ways of raising primary debt, are much more attuned these days to the ongoing management of their liabilities, and frequently use the swap market to adjust their interest rate exposure. 'The advantage of the swap market is that it allows you to adjust exposure profiles without having to undo the underlying transactions,' said Mr John Grout, director of Treasury at Cadbury Schweppes. Similar techniques using commodities now allow oil companies - or transport companies which need to consume large amounts of oil - to reduce their exposure to price changes. The size of the commodity swap market has grown, according to estimates, from Dollars 3bn in 1988 to Dollars 10bn before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, and is now believed to total Dollars 40bn. As much as 80 per cent of commodity swaps business is believed to consist of oil-related transactions. The market in short-dated currency swaps is also very active. Many companies use the market to hedge themselves, when day-to-day transactions create currency exposure. For the most part, though, companies do not hedge translation exposure, a practice which is not always viewed favourably by shareholders.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Cardboard citizens Most Londoners squirm when they encounter a street beggar in the centre of the city. Is this someone in genuine need? A threat, a potential mugger? A lazybones who prefers to collect both the dole and coins from passers-by rather than take an unappetising manual job? It is impossible to tell. The result is that every decision to proffer or withhold one of the coins that jangle in your purse or pocket is taken on ad hoc grounds. The temptation to walk on by is strong, and not easily or often overcome. Sometimes there is an especially plaintive look in a young face; out comes the silver. Sometimes a largish youngster looks menacing enough to be worth buying off. Pay again. This is absurd. You expect beggars in Bombay or Calcutta. India is a Third World country within which a First World middle-class is rapidly emerging. The rise of the tide of street people in New York over the past decade has been striking, but here again there is no surprise. The failure of the United States to raise the standard of living of most of its black and many of its Hispanic citizens is well-known. In France the steady inward flow of indigent North Africans accounts for at least some of the unfortunates one sees on the streets. London is supposed to be different. The British welfare state was designed to eliminate the need for begging among all sections of the population. It is self-evidently not doing so. The reason why is plain. What we are witnessing is a spin-off of the Thatcher years. That this is so is suggested by an intriguing set of statistical tables in the latest issue of Economic Trends, published by the Central Statistical office (proprietor: HM Treasury). The CSO's annual analysis of the effects on household income of taxes and benefits has been reworked for earlier years, mainly to adjust the numbers to take account of family size and composition. This makes comparisons as close to reality as possible. A freshly-adjusted 1977-88 series is therefore available. 'The main conclusion,' says Economic Trends, 'is that the distribution of income has become more unequal over the 11 years'. Yes yes, I am aware that 'more unequal' does not mean that the poorest are necessarily worse off in absolute terms; it may be that their incomes have simply not grown as fast as those of the rich. But consider the implications of what Economic Trends has to say. The official statisticians try to get to the heart of the matter. Taking raw material from the continuous family expenditure survey, they record all cash income after tax. This includes pay, dividends, and state benefits. They then subtract indirect taxation such as VAT, and in some tables add a figure for assumed benefits in kind, such as state education and health services. The bottom line tells the story. In 1979 the poorest fifth of all households accounted for 9.5 per cent of post-tax The British welfare state has self-evidently failed to eliminate the need for begging income (before benefits in kind); in 1988 the figure was 6.9 per cent. The share of the second lowest fifth fell slightly. The middle bands remained more or less level. The share of the top fifth rose from 37 per cent to 44 per cent, no doubt adding to the ranks of people whose feelings of guilt may make it pay to beg. All this is after the redistributive effect of the welfare state. The explanation lies partly in the severing of the connection between benefit increases and average earnings, and partly in the shift from direct to indirect taxation. Raising VAT from 10 per cent to 15 per cent in 1979, plus other indirect tax increases, hurt the very poor. They paid 21 per cent of their gross income in indirect taxes in 1979 and 29 per cent in 1988. The top band enjoyed a slight fall - from 21 to 20 per cent. The disparity is somewhat less when you take into account assumed benefits in kind, but not very much. There is little doubt that the relative living standards of the lower income groups have deteriorated since these figures were compiled. The 1988 budget was a bonanza for the rich. The hard-nosed social security reforms of Mr (now Sir) Norman Fowler, introduced in the same year, were hardly a bonanza for the poor. The first full year effect of these regressive measures was felt in 1989. Even after rebates the poll tax, introduced last year, almost certainly cost the lowest fifth of households more than the special increase in social security payments given to them to offset it. This year, to offset the cut in local taxation, VAT is up again, to 17 1/2 per cent. We have seen how that hits the worst off. We are talking here about state pensioners, single mothers, families with large numbers of children whose head is unemployed and unlikely to return to work, and so on - some 11m individuals in all. Many of these are people who are unlikely to own their own homes, as some 70 per cent of the English do. Their children often cannot afford either to rent in the shrinking private market or to buy. It is hardly surprising that such an 'underclass' should throw off a few beggars. It is not that the Tories are unconcerned: last Friday Sir George Young, the housing minister, opened a 45-person shelter for ex-residents of cardboard city, London's mini-shantytown. He was pushing his department's 'rough sleepers' initiative'. The new shelter, in the financial centre itself, is run by the St Mungo association as a joint undertaking with the government, Business in the Community, and Islington council. It is a worthy initiative: St Mungo sets out to rehabilitate its guests, with the aim of helping them find jobs and places to rent. I do not know what better there is to do: a Labour government would spend a bit more, and I guess a Tory government might further increase VAT to finance public sector services. Neither party is proposing a return to 1979 tax structures. Yet in Britain, in 1991, there should be no reason to beg.</p>

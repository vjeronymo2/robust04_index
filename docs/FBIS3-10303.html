The Argentine soldiers will join  UN troops that are monitoring the cease-fire in Croatia.    The latest Argentine contingent will replace the 4th BEA  detachment which has been carrying out its UN mission in Croatia  for six months.    Relatives and Army officers said farewell to close to 150  officers and noncommissioned officers at a ceremony held at  Ezeiza International Airport. Division General Raul Gomez  Sabaini, deputy chief of staff of the Army, presided over the  ceremony.    The Argentine soldiers will arrive in Zagreb, the capital of  Croatia, at 1100 Argentine time [1400 GMT] on 5 March. Their  flight will make technical stopovers in Recife (Brazil) and Las  Palmas, Canary Islands.    BEA 5 has 901 men and three women. Its commander is  Lieutenant Colonel Domingo Justo Machado. The battalion will  help enforce UN resolutions.    The United Nations has had to take action in Croatia  (Western  Slovenia of the former Yugoslavia) [as published] after the  country fell apart due to serious domestic conflicts prompted by  political, religious, and racial motives.    The mission of Argentine troops is to monitor the  cease-fire,  set up observation posts, patrol specific areas, help the  civilian population, oversee exchanges of prisoners, supervise  the refugees, and clear minefields. Each operational contingent  will stay in Croatia for six months. Of all UN "blue helmets"  operations throughout the world, the one in Croatia involves the  largest number of troops.</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> TENNESSEE;  </P> <P> PROTESTER REMAINS AT SITE OF KING'S DEATH  </P> <P> A protester living in a tent outside the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn.,  where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968, got a two-day  reprieve from a court-ordered eviction because sheriff's deputies do not do  that kind of work on weekends.  </P> <P> Jacqueline Smith, 39, has camped near the motel since March, 1988, in an effort  to stop the state from converting it into the Lorraine National Civil Rights  Museum. She maintains that King's memory would be better served by establishing  a shelter for the homeless or a free clinic. A county court judge had ordered  Smith out by noon Friday, but a crowd of about 200 supporters gathered and  cheered when she refused to leave.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  Federation of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon), the  vanguard organization of one million students in South Korea,  reportedly contended, in a document adopted at a rally, that the  United States should find a key to the solution of what it calls  "nuclear issue" of the North in the improvement of relations  with the North, not in pressure.    The document stated that "after it declared its withdrawal  from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty the North has totally  frustrated with its flexible and steadfast strategy the  maneuverings of the United States and other imperialists to  isolate it."</p>

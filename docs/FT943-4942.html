			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses savaged by interest rate bears While US markets were closed for the Labor Day holiday yesterday, European bourses were hit by last Friday afternoon's falls in treasuries in New York, as well as by ongoing weakness in the dollar, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw its main falls in the interest rate-sensitive financials as the Dax index fell 30.19 to 2,174.52 on the session, touching 2,163.30 in the post-bourse before recovering to close at an Ibis-indicated 2,173.60. Turnover fell from DM6.1bn to DM4.7bn. Among the financials, Allianz lost DM48 at DM2,440, Deutsche Bank DM12 at DM719.50 and Bayernverein DM12.50 at DM448. A Goldman Sachs study said that German government bond yields were set to rise because of accelerating economic growth, a likely rise in official rates in the first quarter of 1995 and heavy new supply. Yesterday, the Bundesbank's average bond yield rose by 9 basis points to 7.19 per cent. However, at the same time, fund managers in Germany were detecting a light shift towards debt from shares, saying that the benign inflation outlook should overcompensate for the likely end in the short term to Bundesbank rate cuts, while shares - which rose by nearly 11 per cent in July and August - appeared unprepared for the next stage in the economic cycle. In this context, it seemed odd that the day's main blue chip winner was Viag, utility based and rate-sensitive. However, there was talk of a big buying order in the stock for US, or at least foreign consumption. PARIS saw the CAC 40 index breach 2,000, and hit 1,978.54 before it closed 22.17 lower at 1,998.20. One or two banks were savaged, Suez losing FFr5 at FFr263 and BNP FFr5.90 at FFr253.70, but there was just as much pain in industrials: Bouygues lost FFr15 at FFr632, Peugeot FFr18 at FFr846 and Air Liquide FFr15 at FFr748. The retailer Casino found itself aptly named after trading was resumed following an early suspension. The company said that it planned to change its legal status from partnership to public limited company, and this, at a time of transnational bid talk in the supermarket business, saw the shares hit FFr175 before closing FFr6.40 up at FFr170. MADRID's general index fell through 300, bottoming at 297.50 before it ended 4.45, or 1.5 per cent, lower at 299.50. Selective interest rate-sensitives lost ground, Argentaria Pta160 at Pta5,100 in banks and Endesa Pta150 at Pta5,430 in utilities, but here, too, industrials kept pace, with Repsol Pta95 off at Pta4,030 and Telefonica down Pta30 at Pta1,755. In construction, Agroman fell Pta88, or 15 per cent, to a 1994 low of Pta500 after a similar loss on Friday; heavier first-half losses last week were followed yesterday by a mooted capital reduction scheme. ZURICH saw further foreign demand early in the day before activity slowed in the absence of US demand during the afternoon, leaving shares slipping back from their best levels. The SMI index finished 2.5 higher at 2,674.5 after a peak of 2,690.5. Roche certificates added another SFr85 at SFr6,355, while UBS bearers picked up SFr4 to SFr1,203 amid foreign buying after last week's optimistic earnings outlooks. However, Nestle gave up SFr4 to SFr1,233 and BBC bearers eased SFr7 to SFr1,197. Sulzer put on SFr4 at SFr940 on news that its Sulzer Hydro division had won a SFr54m contract to provide Francis turbines to India. MILAN remained under pressure, the Comit index falling 11.79, or 1.7 per cent, to 673.23, with blue chips leading the decline. Turnover picked up from recent levels, but it was still low. Among the biggest losers, Telecom Italia fell L150. or 3 per cent, to L4,440 and Generali was L1,000, or 2.4 per cent, lower at L40,700. BCI gave up L125, or 3.4 per cent, to L3,550, with the bank's rights plummeting 14.8 per cent to L484.7. Olivetti, heavily sold last week, fell another L50, or 2.3 per cent, to L2,090. Cir, its holding company, gave up L100, or 4.5 per cent, at L2,100. AMSTERDAM was deflated by the US holiday, softer bonds and slight pressure on the dollar. The AEX index closed 1.17 down at 417.97. Heineken lost Fl 1.80 at Fl 241.00 ahead of results, and analysts noted that BolsWessanen, another drinks group, turned in unexpectedly poor figures last week. STOCKHOLM dived with its debt market after opinion polls pointed to the weakness of the opposition SDP party, and the risks implicit in minority government after the general election in 12 days' time. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 28.60, or 1.95 per cent, to 1,439.60. Astra A lost SKr6 at SKr180 on profit-taking, and the banking and insurance index dropped by 3.5 per cent. TEL AVIV celebrated today's Jewish New Year holiday with the seventh consecutive rise in the Mishtanim index, which closed 5.75, or 3.1 per cent, higher at 192.19.

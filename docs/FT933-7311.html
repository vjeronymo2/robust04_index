			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Bonn and Paris try to mend fences FRANCE and Germany will this week make a concerted effort to improve their relations, and maintain the momentum of European monetary union, in spite of the recent upheaval within the European monetary system. Informal talks are to be held between Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, and Mr Alain Juppe, his French counterpart, in Dresden tomorrow, before Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl meets Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, in Bonn on Thursday. The two sides seem certain to discuss ideas to bolster the EMS, and maintain the timetable towards the ultimate ambition of a single European currency. Mr Kinkel insisted in a radio interview at the weekend that the new wide margins for currency fluctuation introduced into the European exchange rate mechanism would help relations. 'We have achieved a flexibility . . . that will, I hope, help us to achieve currency union through the EMS,' he said. France, however, will be looking for reassurance that Germany is not starting to question the Emu timetable, following Mr Kohl's admission that the process could slip 'by a year or two'. German officials have since stressed that he was simply referring to currency union by 1999, the ultimate goal of the Maastricht treaty, instead of 1997, the first target date. Mr Kinkel repeated the suggestion made by Mr Kohl that if the precise timescale of Emu could not be maintained, 'that would be no tragedy'. He added, however, that for the time being 'we should plan to keep within the timetable' agreed within the Maastricht treaty. The two sides are also likely to discuss their continuing divide over ways of bringing the negotiations in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks to a conclusion by the end of the year. France will also be hoping for signs of an easing of German monetary policy which would help France reduce interest rates and stimulate its recession-hit economy. The policy-making council of the Bundesbank meets on Thursday and a German rate cut would ease bilateral strains. Mr Kinkel conceded there were differences of opinion and policy over the Bundesbank's monetary policy, as well as the Uruguay Round, but he believed these could be overcome. Germany supports less protectionism for its farm sector, while France, subject to pressure from a powerful agrarian lobby, is reluctant to sanction greater liberalisation, which would entail lower subsidies. The discussions between Mr Juppe and Mr Kinkel will centre on the position France will take at September's meeting of EC foreign and farm ministers.</p>

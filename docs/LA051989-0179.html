			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PGA PROPOSES TOUR HALL OF FAME  </P> <P> The PGA Tour is proposing a PGA Tour Hall of Fame, a golf course-resort hotel  complex and a headquarters for PGA Tour Productions Inc. in Jacksonville, if  the city will provide $1.6 million over the next four years.  </P> <P> PGA Tour Commissioner Deane Beaman unveiled the plans Thursday before the Duval  County Tourist Development Council. The council, which distributes proceeds of  Duval County's 4% bed tax on hotel rooms, stopped short of committing to a  four-year $200,000 annual grant sought by the tour, saying it needs more time  to study the proposal. The plan is contingent on City Council approval of an  identical four-year appropriation of $800,000 for a total of $1.6 million.  </P> <P> The PGA Tour has never had a hall of fame, but there is a World Golf Hall of  Fame in Pinehurst, N.C., operated by the PGA of America.  </P></p>

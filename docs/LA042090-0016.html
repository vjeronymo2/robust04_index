			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH ADDRESS  </P> <P> So George Bush will give the commencement address at televangelist Jerry  Falwell's Liberty University (the first sitting President to do so), yet he  will not address the International AIDS Conference in San Francisco this June  (the first leader of a hosting country to refuse). Our nation's "leader" is  setting up dangerous precedents. Am I wrong or does this actually represent the  true priorities of a kinder, gentler nation?  </P> <P> MARK GOLDBERG  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

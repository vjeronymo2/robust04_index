			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Arts: Fool Moon - New York Fool Moon is one of the most aggressively insubstantial productions to open on Broadway recently. It consists of its two multitalented performers, David Shiner and Bill Irwin, goofing around for two hilarious hours, backed by the lively 5-piece urban hillbilly band the Red Clay Ramblers. Irwin, the personality familiar from his tv, film and stage appearances, is in good-hearted, rubber-bodied form; Shiner, the gangly clown from Cirque du Soleil's Nouvelle Experience, dominates the evening and is its revelation. In the spirit of classic vaudeville, there's no semblance of a traditional plot linking the bits that Shiner and Irwin play out alone and with each other, the band, and the audience. What almost holds the show together - are the personae the performers adopt, which signal to the audience that we are in a clown-land. Irwin's persona is sweet-faced and bemused, the innocent victim of external forces, like the weird magnetic pull always threatening to suck him offstage, and the unseen prankster who yanks the cord every time Irwin tries to speak into a microphone (neither performer utters a word during the show.) Shiner spends most of his time poking fun at audience members. He climbs over rows of seats to find the marauder in 'his' chair, borrows someone's camera and then destroys it (not really) and in the evening's funniest segment, brings people on stage to help him pretend-make a silent movie. If Fool Moon is 'about' anything, it's how willing people are to follow Shiner's charismatic lead. Everyone mimes, understanding instantly that his is a silent world; New Yorkers never seen without hands on their pocketbooks surrender fur coats and wallets to him; reticent folks end up rolling around the stage in a passionate mock embrace. Watching others abandon inhibition is a guilty pleasure. While Fool Moon's lack of structure lends it a wonderful freshness and simplicity, the show does feel slightly underconceived and underrehearsed. Perhaps an outside eye - no director or writer are credited in the programme, so presumably Shiner and Irwin filled all creative roles themselves - could have given the show the edge that it needed to become something more than the charming diversion it is now.

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Moscow in Russian to  Tajikistan at 1700 GMT on 10 May in the "Slavyanka" program of  the Russian Defense Ministry carries a feature on the  anniversary of the liberation of Sevastopol in World War II.  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is quoted on the future  status of the port:    Grachev says: "Sevastopol should be the main base of  Russia's  Black Sea Fleet. We consider that in addition to Sevastopol,  the fleet should also be based in Balaklava, Feodosiya, Kerch,  and Donuzlav where the main forces of Russia's Black Sea Fleet  are deployed and also where units and formations are stationed.  It is clear that we do not have the right to, and we will not  undermine the combat readiness of the Black Sea Fleet, a  battle-worthy and full-blooded formation of the Russian  Federation Armed Forces, as this would create a real threat to  the security of Russia in this region. Nor do we have the right  to worsen the already difficult social position of many Black  Sea sailors."</p>

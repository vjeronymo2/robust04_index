			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Arts: Ennio Marchetto - Theatre Audiences love clowns, and the Lyric Hammersmith audience loves Ennio Marchetto - with reason. He jokes, he juggles, he lampoons, and his show's second half is something quite original: a long string of impersonations achieved not with full costumes but with 2-D paper cartoon cut-outs that enable rapid changes. Marchetto himself is a thick-set barrel-chested Italian; and in the first half that is what he plays, straight. He is butch and fun and a bit bizarre. In his first sketch, he is a flamenco guitarist while also juggling pingpong balls in and out of his mouth. Next, he juggles fruit  - but with audience participation. He throws oranges at audience members, so accurately that he is on aim even to a man in the upper gallery. He considers throwing eggs at us too, but builds to a climax by juggling three oranges, a melon and the egg, spectacularly breaking it dead on cue. Finally, he juggles flaming torches; here the best joke is that an already half-petrified audience half-expects him to hurl some flaming torches out into the house too. Part Two operates on the same how-will-this-develop and what-will-happen-next principles. Marchetti has the audience agog to know what point he is going to make with each character cut-out, and which character will comes next. I like it best when he is deliberately incongruous - for example, as the Mona Lisa, in her framed portrait and awfully bored, singing 'She's Got It.' He is dull as the Queen - he doesn't know how to project that deadpan dowdiness - but, with a couple of quick costume fixes before our eyes, he becomes another Queen: Freddie Mercury. The success of Part Two depends almost entirely, however, on two kinds of cleverness: the way he can quickly adjust one character to become another and make a point (Queen-into-Queen, James-Bond-into-Shirley-Bassey, the-Supremes-into-Diana-Ross-into-Michael-Jackson), and the cartoon effectiveness of his cut-out costumes. Sometimes all there is left to watch is Marchetti the mime, and this is harder to bear. He shows such a penchant for drag that you no longer know who he is. The few Part Two personae which are not female tend to be flamboyant - Jackson, Mercury, Presley, Pavarotti. And his women are all performed according to the eye-rolling, vermilion-lipped school of female impersonation. (Thank God for his Piaf - very, very, short, stumpy-legged, and getting shorter all the time.) For his encore, he does Carmen - miming Callas's account of the Habanera but stuck in a groove on the high note: by which time he's gone way over the top. Here, and too often when in drag, Marchetti's not clowning but drowning.</p>

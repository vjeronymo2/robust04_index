			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vasiliy Lipitskiy: "The East Remains Silent: </F> Russia's Abandonment of One-Sided Atlantism Is Possible Only  With a More Active Position of the Arab World"]    [Text] The Arab world is looking on with inexplicable  indifference as its long-term strategic interests and, perhaps,  foundations of prosperity also are being undermined in Russia.  What this is: traditional submission to fate and recognition of  its impotence or, on the contrary, some subtle calculation, is  unclear. The East is, as always, enigmatic and obscure for the  European mind.    The formerly firm ties with Arab world have come to be  regarded--even though this has not been recorded in official  documents--as the onerous legacy of the ancien regime and as  communist geopolitics. Truly, there was in these ties that which  is not usually greatly to the liking of the public at  large--indirect participation in regional conflicts, arms trade,  and support for rulers unpopular in the world. But there were  undoubted pluses also--mutually profitable economic relations  and influence in the vast region. All this has been sacrificed  to ideological changes.    But it would be an exaggeration to say that the door to  Russia was suddenly slammed shut in the face of the Arab  countries and to place the whole responsibility with the Russian  side. It is simply that the West was better able to take  advantage of the favorable political conditions. The Arab world  failed to display the necessary mobility, yielding important  strategic positions practically without resistance. And this in  a situation where its interests were objectively very close to  Russian interests.    Russian producers, desperately in need of currency receipts,  are prepared to sell their products for a pittance even. The  result is a catastrophic fall in the price of oil and many types  of mineral raw material. Farsighted emissaries of the West are  penetrating Russia's oil and gas complex ever more deeply and  endeavoring to participate in the control of the extractive  sectors. Considering the calamitous position of the latter, it  is clear how easy this is--all investments are seen as a  blessing.    It is not hard to foresee in the near future a further  decline in the influence of the Organization of Oil-Exporting  Countries and a fall in the revenue of the traditional producers  of mineral raw material. And a further strengthening of the  positions of the West and an increase in the gap between North  and South. And although Russia is geographically a northern  country, economically it will shortly be somewhere around the  Equator, but without an improvement in climate. Arab investments  in Russia's oil and gas complex of the appropriate scale offered  on favorable terms against subsequent partnership could  appreciably adjust this joyless prospect. But the East remains  silent.    Another sphere of the concurrence of the objective interests  of Russia and the Arab countries is the arms trade. In the  Russian Federation the manufacture of weapons is one of the few  competitive industries. It is in a state of the most profound  crisis in connection with demilitarization and the loss of a  number of traditional markets: Iraq, Libya, Palestine. The Arab  world remains the most attractive partner for our arms  manufacturers. But the Atlantic orientation of our foreign  policy and the growing direct dependence on the West are  becoming an insurmountable barrier to mutually profitable  relations.    Here also the Arab world, having aroused the direct  producers' interest by investments, could rectify matters. But  dealers from the East are not to be seen at the defense plants,  which are being forced to halt their production lines one after  the other.    In a social and cultural respect the Western world is closer  to Russia than the Arab East. But the structure of economic  interests should be a far more important imperative for  politicians.    How is the situation to be changed? Serious political  changes  and the renunciation of the one-sided Atlantism of foreign  policy are needed for this in Russia. But such changes, in turn,  are possible only with the more active position of the Arab  world.    Assistance to Russia and investments in its economy are at  the present time a risky and overhead-laden business. The West  is, nonetheless, agreeing to this in the name of its future and  its strategic interests.    The Arab world, which possesses considerable spare financial  resources, should put them to use if it wishes in the future  also to be a pronounced factor of geopolitics and to retain the  possibility of participation in control of the world oil market.  This means not only replacing the West where this is  possible--in the investment process--but also offering better  terms. And if the West declines assistance programs in the face  of this reorientation of Russia, being prepared to compensate  the losses connected with this.    Whether the proposed scenario proves another oriental legend  will depend solely on the capacity of Arab and Russian  politicians for recognizing imperatives dictated by the national  interests of both parties.</p>

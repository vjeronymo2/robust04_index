			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'PAY FOR PLAY'  </P> <P> With the increasing attention to the "pay to play" virus, it's becoming  increasingly frustrating to read of club owners griping about barely making  ends meet and thus justifying the practice.  </P> <P> The problem lies with the clubs' refusal to have one in-house booker; use of a  single booker would end the need for outside promoters, who are, for the most  part, the greatest perpetrators of the pay-to-play evil.  </P> <P> Clubs in areas such as Anaheim, San Pedro and Reseda survive because they use  one booker and do their own advertising, along with some pre-sales.  </P> <P> CARLOS LOERA  </P> <P> Manager of Adonis, a metal band  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

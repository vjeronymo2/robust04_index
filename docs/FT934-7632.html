			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Opel signs cost-cut deal: German car group could save up to DM1bn UNIONS and management at Adam Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors, yesterday signed a far-reaching agreement designed to reduce the company's wage costs dramatically over the next four years. Mr David Herman, Opel's chief executive, put no figure on savings although it is likely costs will fall by between DM600m (Pounds 238m) and DM1bn over the period. The agreement, which will be studied carefully by other companies seeking ways to reduce wage costs without large-scale redundancies, is Opel's response to a steep decline in the German car market. 'It is a way of introducing long-term cost-savings without shock therapy,' Mr Herman said yesterday, alluding in disparaging terms to Volkswagen's plans to cut costs by introducing a four-day week coupled with reductions in wages and fringe benefits. The Opel agreement has four central points: Pay rises will be kept to two-thirds of the industry-wide settlement if the pay-rise is more than 2 per cent. Assuming industry-wide pay increases of 3.6 per cent on average between 1994-97, Opel is likely to save DM500m through this measure. The 13th month of income will be partially subject to productivity increases. Employers and employees will together try to cut absenteeism from 7.5 per cent to 6 per cent, the European average. In return, Opel has postponed a decision to contract out work and has also guaranteed to build the successor to its Vectra model at its Russelsheim factory.</p>

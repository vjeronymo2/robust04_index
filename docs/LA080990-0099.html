			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EMPLOYEES' HEALTH PLAN PROPOSED;  </P> <P> INSURANCE: BUSINESS OWNERS WOULD HAVE THREE YEARS TO SUPPLY COVERAGE. THOSE  UNABLE TO MEET THE GOAL WOULD BE TAXED TO FUND A PRIVATE PROGRAM.  </P> <P> Seeking to jump-start stalled negotiations over how to provide health coverage  for the uninsured, a key lawmaker Wednesday suggested a plan that would give  the business community three years to reduce by 90% the number of working  Californians who lack medical coverage.  </P> <P> If that goal is not reached, a so-called "play or pay" system would be  triggered under which businesses would be required to provide insurance for  their employees or pay a payroll tax to the state. Proceeds from the tax would  go into a fund to purchase private insurance for all Californians who could not  obtain it on their own.  </P> <P> The plan also includes a provision that would establish state regulation of  hospital rates and doctors' fees if increases in those costs exceeded a  targeted level. No specific target was mentioned in Wednesday's proposal.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Burt Margolin, a Los Angeles Democrat who has led six months of  talks on the issue, said he hoped the proposal would be the starting point for  three weeks of negotiations aimed at reaching a compromise before the  Legislature's scheduled Aug. 31 adjournment.  </P> <P> Margolin acknowledged that his maneuver means there is almost no chance that  the Legislature and Gov. George Deukmejian will enact a bill this year that  would require all businesses to provide insurance for their workers.  </P> <P> "If we were to have any chance at all of completing a deal, we needed a  document to set us on a fast track toward negotiating out the differences among  the various parties on this issue," Margolin said. "The notion of a voluntary  effort is probably going to be required to produce a bill that the governor can  sign."  </P> <P> Deukmejian administration officials working on the health insurance issue could  not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> The proposal will be considered by an Assembly-Senate conference committee  headed by Margolin that has an unusually high-powered membership, including the  Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate, the Assembly Republican  leader, and the Democratic chairman of the Assembly Health Committee.  </P> <P> The Margolin plan is expected to encounter stiff opposition from Assembly  Republicans. One conference committee member, Assembly Republican Leader Ross  Johnson of La Habra, has said he will not agree to any program that requires  businesses to provide insurance for their workers. A Johnson aide said  Wednesday that the lawmaker has not changed his position.  </P> <P> Otis Turner, Johnson's press secretary, said Margolin's plan would almost  certainly trigger an 8% payroll tax at the end of three years because it is  unlikely that businesses could insure the required number of workers -- about  2.5 million -- in that short a time. Turner said Johnson also opposes state  regulation of medical care rates.  </P> <P> "The whole thing just ignores market forces completely," Turner said. "We don't  think that this is a rational approach to the issue of health care."  </P> <P> The concept, however, has received the tentative support of the Los Angeles  Area Chamber of Commerce, a key business group. The chairman of the chamber's  health issues committee said in a letter to Margolin that the chamber is  "supportive of the direction" taken in the proposal.  </P> <P> The plan includes provisions designed to make health coverage more affordable  by, among other things, curbing the current insurance industry practice of  basing premiums on the health history of each company's workers. This method,  known as "experience rating," has prompted huge price increases for small  businesses that have a single worker afflicted by a serious disease.  </P> <P> The proposal also envisions containing medical costs by making the industry  more competitive. This would be done by making more information available about  doctor and hospital treatment practices and providing incentives for companies  to buy the cheapest possible coverage.  </P> <P> Businesses also would be eligible for tax credits to offset the cost of  providing insurance.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, June 22 (CTK) -- The Czech and Romanian  presidents, Vaclav Havel and Ion Iliescu, signed today a treaty  of friendship and cooperation between their countries.    At a following press conference Havel said the agreement was  culmination of the traditionally good and well developing  bilateral relations, and at the same time a basis for further  cooperation to be also supported by an agreement on a free-trade  zone, which is to be signed by the two countries' premiers in  autumn.    Iliescu pointed to the long and extraordinarily positive  tradition of Czech-Romanian relations, and to the events of  1968, when Romania was the only country of the communist East  Europe to openly oppose the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia.  Iliescu confirmed that the Czech-Romanian relations would  mainly include economic cooperation.    Havel said he had invited Iliescu to visit the Czech  Republic.    Asked whether or not Romania was interested in joining the  Visegrad group (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and  Slovakia), Iliescu said that it was rather interested in getting  closer to the Central European Initiative (the above four  countries, and Austria, Italy, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia,  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  and Slovenia).    Later today Havel is to meet with Czechs living in Romania  and Czech diplomatic staff in Bucharest.</p>

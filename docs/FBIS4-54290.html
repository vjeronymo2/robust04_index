			<p>CSO     [Text] Mitsubishi Electric is strengthening its local U.S.  microcomputer ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit)  design function. It is increasing to over 50 people design  personnel for its sales subsidiary, which has the greatest  opportunities to hold business talks with clients, a 25-percent  increase, centering on fiscal 1994, and will create a system  that will quickly reflect the demands of the client in the  design. Since design personnel previously were assigned to the  production subsidiary, the client's needs were not fully  incorporated in the product design. In the United States, the  largest overseas consumer market, strengthening of user  accommodation capability is judged to be linked to an increase  in competitive power, and they are laying out a new lineup.    It is the sales subsidiary, Mitsubishi Electronics America  (MELA, California) which is increasing design personnel. Until  now, one Japanese and 39 Americans formed the design unit, but  this will increase during fiscal 1994 to five Japanese and 45  Americans, making the design function of the sales subsidiary  substantial. The company was established in 1973, but until now  only a few personnel were concerned with design.    Moreover, beginning this year, in order to supplement the  design function of MELA, the production subsidiary, Mitsubishi  Semiconductor America (MSAI, North Carolina), will make  full-scale "design-in" activities where the product  specifications and performance are decided one by one with the  client. By strengthening the design function at local bases of  both sales and production, they can promote the creation of  products that reflect client needs.    Mitsubishi is beginning to disperse to various countries the  design function which previously had been rather concentrated  within Japan, such as the placing of design personnel in a  German subsidiary beginning this fiscal year. The strengthening  of the design function in the United States also can be called a  link in this.    Japanese semiconductor manufacturers are altering their  constitution which had depended excessively on memory and are  aiming for repletion in non-memory fields such as ASIC and  microcomputers in order to recover their international  competitive power which has rather declined. However, how much  the products incorporate the demands of the client holds the key  that will decide competitive power. For that reason, making a  substantial design function in consumer areas has become a big  task.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs.--THE CANBERRA TIMES, one of  two Australian newspapers that alleged Malaysian politicians had  been bribed by the Australian Secret Information Services  (ASIS), will not divulge its sources to Malaysian police.    The daily's editor, Michele Garttan, said the sources had  been assured of anonymity when they agreed to give their story  to the newspaper.    "Their identity is confidential and we will not betray their  trust in us," said Garttan said in a telephone interview today.    On whether she would cooperate with Malaysian police in  their  investigations, Garttan said they had not been approached as yet.    "We will decide on this if and when we are approached," she  said.    Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Rahim Noor said on  Tuesday that they had sought the help of the Australian Interpol  to interview the former ASIS agents who had made the accusations.    Rahim said police also wanted to interview the editors and  journalists of the THE CANBERRA TIMES and the SUNDAY TELEGRAPH  regarding the reports.    Garttan said there had not been many reports in the  Australian newspapers over the last few days on the issue as  interest seemed to have died down.    The SUNDAY TELEGRAPH reported on Jan 16 that opposition  leaders in Malaysia and Singapore had been paid bribes, while  the report by THE CANBERRA TIMES on Feb 3 stated that the  recipients of these bribes included Government politicians.    The reports claimed that the payments were made without the  full knowledge or consent of the Australian Government. They  claimed that payments were first made when the leaders were  junior politicians and increased as they grew in stature.    It was reported today that the editor-in-chief of the SUNDAY  TELEGRAPH, John Hardigan, had agreed to cooperate with Malaysian  police in their investigations.    Police are expected to send several officers from the  special  team set up to investigate the allegations to Australia soon.  The team has already recorded statements from several  politicians here.    Meanwhile, the Australian journalists' union has rejected a  Malaysian suggestion that reporters should reveal to Malaysian  police their sources for allegations that Australian spies had  bribed Malaysian politicians.    Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance national secretary  Chris Warren said in Canberra that Australian journalists would  not reveal this information to Malaysian authorities or anyone  else because journalists here are bound by a code of ethics not  to prejudice sources or breach any other confidences.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Councils warned on pay plans LOCAL AUTHORITIES were warned yesterday to abandon a plan to reform pay bargaining significantly as Nalgo, the main white-collar council union, decided to press for a Pounds 1,000 flat-rate increase this year for 500,000 members. Mr Alan Jinkinson, Nalgo general secretary, said a proposal to end national pay rates, floated this week by council associations, would be a recipe for industrial chaos. He was speaking after the union's local-government committee raised the across-the-board claim for this year by Pounds 150 from a previous Pounds 850.</p>

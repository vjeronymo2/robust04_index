			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> MUCH ADO: Grove Shakespeare Festival staffers are wearing trumpet label pins  nowadays as subtle political comment.  </P> <P> It all started when a former Garden Grove councilman who voted against funds  for the troupe said Shakespeare isn't part of American culture. A major donor  retorted that a trumpet should sound at each councilman's Shakespearean  reference. . . . The council hasn't budged an inch ("The Taming of the Shrew"),  but there is something in the wind ("The Comedy of Errors"). Tonight the  festival will ask that its lease be relaxed and intends to fight till the last  gasp ("King Henry the Sixth, Part I"). Lily Eng and Jan Herman  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chi Haotian, minister of national defense: "Mao </F> Zedong's Erudite and Profound Thinking on Army Building]    [Text] The publication by the People's Liberation Army  [PLA] Publishing House of the "General Introduction to Mao  Zedong Thought on Army-Building" (written by Hou Luliang), which  is a systematic study of Comrade Mao Zedong's glorious thought  on the building of a People's Army, on the eve of the centenary  of Comrade Mao Zedong's birth, is very meaningful.    Mao Zedong thought on army-building is a key integral part  of  Mao Zedong Military Thought and Mao Zedong Thought and the most  complete and scientific army-building thinking with the most  Chinese characteristics. Mao Zedong's army-building thought  reaches deeply into the CPC's great army-building practices; its  formation and development fully display an ingenuity never seen  before. We all know that early in the founding period of our  Army, old China was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country,  politically disunited, economically underdeveloped, and  culturally and educationally very backward. Setting up a  new-type proletariat-led People's Army in such a country was a  task which had never been addressed by the revolutionary  teachers Marx, Engels, and Lenin. In the New Democratic  Revolution period, our Army was far worse off regarding weapons  and installations than our enemy, with far less troops and much  worse material conditions. How were we to complete the  historical tasks of developing our Army into a powerful People's  Army and toppling the "three great mountains" of imperialism,  feudalism, and bureaucratism? There were no ready-made answers  in the Marxist canon. But, in a heaven-shaking style, the  Chinese Communists opened up the most glorious page of Chinese  history with superhuman courage and boldness. After the  founding of New China there were great improvements in the  objective conditions for army-building. On the other hand, our  army-building efforts faced many special situations; for  example, for a very long time imperialism and hegemonism had  encircled, blockaded, and militarily threatened our country and,  constrained by the country's economy, there was limited military  spending, repeated disruptions from "leftist" and rightist  opportunism, and the sharp contradiction between the Army's low  levels of modernization and the demands of modern warfare. Mao  Zedong's army-building thought evolved from such special  national and military situations and it: Absorbs, but is not  hamstrung by, foreign experience; is grounded in China's  practical situation; takes up all the good points of ancient,  modern, Chinese, and foreign military thought; reveals, in a  profound way, the basic characteristics and objective laws of  building a People's Army; and it provides guidelines for the  People's Army throughout its entire development from nothing  into a powerful force, during which time miracles were created  one after another. The road traversed by our Army repeatedly  proves that when we pursue army-building according to Mao  Zedong's army-building thought, our army will develop and grow  and win victories forever; but it will go astray and suffer  setbacks when we deviate from it. Remembrance of things past  teaches us to treasure Mao Zedong's army-building thought.    Mao Zedong's army-building thought is erudite and profound,  with rich contents and encompasses all areas and aspects of  army- building. Its basic tenets and principles apply to the  past, present, and future. This is because Mao Zedong's  army-building thought, like Mao Zedong Thought, is the most  revolutionary and creative, will develop along with changes in  historical conditions, and always maintains a strong vitality.  Any sayings or thinking which deprecate the true vale of Mao  Zedong's army-building thought are untenable.    Mao Zedong's army-building thought is the crystal of the  collective wisdom of Chinese Communists. Comrade Mao Zedong is  the most distinguished representative of Mao Zedong's  army-building thought. As the core of our party's leadership  collective of the second generation, Comrade Deng Xiaoping  creatively developed Mao Zedong's army-building thought in the  new historical era and made brilliant contributions toward  enriching Marxist army-building theories. Comrade Deng Xiaoping  thought on army-building in the historical era scientifically  answers a series of important questions about building our Army  in a new era and points out a direction for our Army's efforts  to revolutionize, modernize, and regularize itself. His  advocacy of the guiding principles for strategic changes in  army-building--the call to: Uphold the principle that  army-building obeys the country's overall economic construction;  center on modernization; make a comprehensive effort at building  a modernized, regular, and revolutionary army; uphold the  party's absolute leadership over the army; strengthen and  improve political and ideological work; ensure that our Army is  politically qualified; put military training in a strategic  position; work actively to raise officers' ability to cope with  modern warfare; work actively but steadily, and proceed in an  orderly and progressive manner while pressing ahead with reforms  in the Army; insist on ruling the Army with stern measures and  according to law when the Army must be rectified; develop  weapons and installations and reform the Army structure and  size; vigorously strengthen troops' combat power; advocate five  kinds of revolutionary spirit" and give play to our Army's fine  traditions; maintain the true color of veteran Red Army  soldiers; study people's war under modern warfare conditions;  develop military science; and to grasp the truth that science  and technology are the primary productive forces--these  important thoughts and theories of Deng Xiaoping pushed Mao  Zedong's army-building thought to a new stage.    Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out in his report to the 14th  Party Congress: "It is necessary to act in accordance with  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought about army-building in the new  era; walk the path of turning our soldiers into crack troops  with Chinese characteristics; build the PLA into a powerful,  modernized, regular, and revolutionary army; continuously  strengthen the national defense of our country; and provide a  solid and powerful security guarantee for reform, opening up,  and economic construction." This was a call from the Central  Committee collective leadership, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the  core, to the whole Army. We must obey the instructions of  Comrade Jiang Zemin, conscientiously study Mao Zedong's  army-building thought, especially Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  thought on army-building in the new era, to grasp its essence;  learn to use its position, viewpoints, and methods; emancipate  minds; seek truth from facts; continuously study new situations  and solve new problems; and actively work to press ahead with  the building of our army. I believe that this will be the best  way to commemorate the centenary of Comrade Mao Zedong's birth.    The "General Introduction to Mao Zedong Though on  Army-Building" tries hard to make an in-depth study of Mao  Zedong's army-building thought; systematically exposes from,  different angles, the formation and development of Mao Zedong's  army-building thought and its basic theoretical viewpoints; and  touches on the hitherto unexplored areas of Mao Zedong's  army-building thought, putting forward some new viewpoints and  understanding. It will help us to understand and  comprehensively and systematically grasp the entire theoretical  body of Mao Zedong's army-building thought. The author made a  great effort in writing the book, though inadequacies still  remain. It is hoped that in the future there will be continued  effort to strengthen the study of Mao Zedong's army-building  thought and further explorations combining theory and practice.    At present, our country's reform, opening up, and economic  construction are in a most critical stage. The People's Army  shoulders a key historical mission. Led by the party Central  Committee and Central Military Commission, with Comrade Jiang  Zemin as the core, we must actively study and use Mao Zedong's  army- building thought, especially Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  thoughts on army-building in the new era; act in accordance with  Comrade Jiang Zemin's general demand of "be qualified  politically, have a perfect mastery of military affairs, and  maintain a good style, strict discipline, and effective  guarantees;" continuously strengthen our Army's comprehensive  construction and actively raise our army's combat power under  the condition of modern technology, especially high technology;  and actively struggle to complete satisfactorily the noble  mission in the new era given us by the party and people!</p>

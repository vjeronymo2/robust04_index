			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Effectiveness of single market rests with member states Sir, If you had found time to read the two earlier reports concerning the internal market council, ('Foot-dragging slows path to single market', June 16 and 'Brussels shelves pension deregulation' June 17), you might have chosen to revise your editorial, 'Slipping Market' (June 17). In one of them, I was described as being 'on the warpath'. Indeed, I left the council of ministers on June 16 in no doubt of my continuing commitment to bring about a fully effective internal market. Since 1992 the Commission has systematically taken member states which do not fulfil legal obligations on time to the European Court of Justice. Last week I told the council of ministers the Commission would in appropriate cases use its power under Article 171 of the treaty, which provides for recommendations of fines to the court once an infringement has been proven. The Commission has made public for the first time which member states have fallen behind in which areas, in order to increase pressure on national governments to make transposition their number one priority. At the next council meeting in October we will look at the quality of national transposition measures in detail. This vigorous approach was endorsed by ministers. As for mutual recognition of national rules, to describe the Commission proposal for a notification procedure as 'a plan for national civil servants to report on other governments that do not stick to the rules' is either a misunderstanding or a misrepresentation. This proposal completes existing measures by providing a practical means whereby national authorities would inform each other and the Commission whenever they decided to refuse access to their markets to particular products for reasons related to the protection of health, safety, the environment or the consumer. Some member states (a minority) dislike our proposal and will label it bureaucratic, but the lively debate in the council last week demonstrated that it goes to the heart of the issue. I note from your article that the UK minister responsible for deregulation fully supports it and has referred to it as a 'crowbar to prize open markets'. Your editorial makes the mistake of shooting the messenger. It is the member states which must decide at the end of the day how effective they want the single market to be. Meanwhile I will continue to do everything in my power to ensure that the member states live up to their obligations. Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, Single Market Commissioner, European Commission, Brussels</p>

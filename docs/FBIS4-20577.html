			<p>Traveling   Solvent Floating Zone Method  [.sub]6[/]  <F P=102> 43070061H Tokyo ISBB'93 in English Aug 93 p 44--FOR OFFICIAL  USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 43070061H </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo ISBB'93 </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO   <F P=106> [English abstract of article by Shigeki Otani, Shigeru </F> Honma, Takaho Tanaka, and Yoshio Ishizawa, National Institute  for Research in Inorganic Materials]    [Text] LaB[.sub]6[/] single crystals prepared by the FZ  method are widely used as thermionic electron emitters. However,  the crystal tips for the emitters must be cut out of the high  quality parts because of subgrain boundaries. We reported that  the boundary-free crystals were prepared by adding  CeB[.sub]6[/], without any influence on the emission  properties.[.sup]1,2[/] On the other hand, the boundaries  were also removed from LaB[.sub]6[/] crystals by the  traveling solvent floating zone method.[.sup]3[/] In this  presentation, by using both of the above methods, the higher  quality crystals were tried to be prepared.    The crystals were prepared in 7 atm of ambient argon gas by  the RF- heating FZ method. The feed rod was prepared by  sintering a mixture of LaB[.sub]6[/] and CeB[.sub]6[/]  powders. The initial molten zone was formed by melting La and/or  Ce metal lump. The growth rate was 0.5 cm/h. The grown crystals  were 0.9 cm in diameter and 6 cm long.    Distribution of La, Ce and B was examined at the growing  interface. The Ce content in the crystal increased by 10%  due  to evaporation, compared with the feed rod. The cases where the  boundary-free crystals were obtained are shown as circles in  Figure l. By using both methods, the amounts of added  CeB[.sub]6[/] and La/Ce flux were decreased. Consequently,  the strain of lattices and the void densities in the crystals  decreased to be less than half.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-25A>      Figure 1. </FIG>  References    1. S. Otani, T.

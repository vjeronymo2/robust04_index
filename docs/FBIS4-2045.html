			<p>BFN     [Text] The sixth enlarged meeting of the provincial  people's government opened on the morning of 18 March. The  meeting is chiefly aimed at implementing the spirit of the  second session of the Eighth National People's Congress and  discussing the issue of how to further enhance industrial  production and economic work in various fields in line with the  province's current progress in economic development and  organizational reforms so as to intensively conduct reform among  the provincial level organs, to promote rapid economic  development, and to maintain social stability.    Gao Yan, governor of the province, delivered an important  speech at the meeting, in which he emphatically cited the  following three parts:    1. We should clearly discern the situation, enhance our  confidence, and do a good job in conducting industrial  production and economic work in various fields. The province's  economic operation in the January-February period somewhat  achieved development based on the rapid growth of 1993.  However, we should not neglect the existing problems. The  situation in industrial production is serious and the problems  cropping up in the circulation funds for production are  prominent. The new situation prevailing after strictly  controlling the gross credits and issuing some major and  important measures for reform has further exposed the province's  old problems such as the structural contradiction in economic  development, the poor quality of enterprises, and the lack of  competitive capability of products. Industrial production is a  priority and is a difficult point in the province's economic  work at present. The growth of industrial production was lower  judging from the situation in February. What we have to do at  present is not to fear the difficulties, not to complain, to  enhance understanding, to unite as one in making progress, and  to bring about a change as soon as possible to the low growth of  industrial production. Efforts should be made to ensure the  growth of industrial production in the first half of this year,  which must surpass the figure of [words indistinct].    Thus, first, we should enhance the leadership over  industrial  production. In particular, the mayor of cities where industrial  enterprises are concentrated in should focus his efforts on  grasping industries. In conducting the reform of organs, the  leading bodies of the provincial level departments in various  fields should define the division of work, realistically have  the department assume its own responsibility, have it study the  new situation and resolve the new problems, and have it conduct  its work in a creative way.    Second, we should adopt every possible way and means to  grasp  funds. Various financial departments across the province should  provide necessary fund guarantee for industrial and agricultural  production development, reinforce business operations and sales,  curtail overstock, and do a good job in grasping saving  deposits. They should also strictly enforce the business  mechanism and follow the targets of [words indistinct].    Third, we should vigorously encourage enterprises to  increase  their economic results. Efforts should be made to grasp the  production of key agricultural items, key enterprises, and key  [words indistinct]. A good job should be done in boosting the  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. In particularly  improving enterprises in various fields, we should [words  indistinct]. By adopting the method of reforms, we should  concentrate our efforts on organizing enterprises to earn more  profits and [words indistinct]. The current emphasis of the  rural work is to do a good job in making preparations for spring  farming and to provide fertilizer and diesel for farming. While  enhancing the active guidance over markets and optimizing the  structure to stabilize grain production, we should vigorously  develop a diversified economy so as to promote the rapid  development of township enterprises. We should also firmly  grasp the work in foreign economic relation and trade and the  economic work in other fields and strive to make progress in  this regard in the first half of the year.    2. We should do a good job in conducting reform among  organs and implement the system of having personnel hold  responsibility for the attainment of certain objectives in  reform. We should make organizational reform and economic work  mutually promote each other. Efforts should be made to organize  all cadres to study well the documents issued by the central  authorities with regard to organizational reforms and their  reform plan and to orient their ideology and understanding onto  the central authorities' documents and onto the decisions made  by the provincial party committee and the provincial people's  government.    First, we should stress discipline at present. In  particular, leading cadres in the leading bodies of departments  whose personnel transfer during the organizational reform is  larger should report themselves to their new posts within the  given date and plunge into the new assignment as soon as  possible.    Second, a good job should be done in making new work  connections among the changes of organizations and striving to  complete the connections within a shortest period.    Third, we should firmly grasp the formulation of plans for  various departments to implement the three decisions.    Fourth, we should enhance the ideological and political  work;  organize personnel affairs and establish departments to be well  coordinated in reform; enhance the leadership over reform; and  conduct careful work in reform. Along with the organizational  reform, a good job should be done in implementing the system of  having personnel hold responsibility for the attainment of key  objectives in reform. The provincial people's government has  defined the work target of [words indistinct] for this year.  Various departments should further discern their tasks for the  target, be responsible for their subordinate units to fulfill  the target, and have the target be fulfilled at all levels. In  line with the key work, the responsibility assumed by various  departments for fulfilling the target should be enhanced. As  for the matters that have been decided by the provincial party  committee and the provincial people's government, various  departments must earnestly implement them and ensure them to be  thoroughly carried out. In meeting the demands of reform and  development, we should further improve our work style. We  should study more, have few social dealings, grasp practice, do  practical deeds, pay attention to quality, stress efficiency,  take the whole situation into consideration, and abide by  discipline. Through the reform we should promote the  construction of governmental organs and enable various  governmental departments to create a new balance between their  work and efficiency.    3. We should safeguard social stability and create a fine  environment for organizational reform and economic development.  Social stability is a big event that has a vital bearing on the  whole situation. It is difficult for us to smoothly carry out  organizational reform and economic development without a stable  political or social environment. We should do a good job in  grasping the following four tasks to successfully safeguard  social stability: First, we should correctly discern and deeply  understand the essence of contradictions. By taking education  as a main measure, we should actively relieve or resolve  contradictions. Second, we should uphold the correct guiding  orientation of public opinions, do things in line with an  objective law, and enhance our confidence in overcoming  difficulties. Third, we should uphold the classified management  in line with the difference of departments. Fourth, we should  realize long-term social stability by upholding or depending on  reform and development. Only by earnestly implementing the  spirit of the three plenums of the Central Discipline Inspection  Commission can we carry forward the struggle against corruption  deeply and protractedly and score new periodical results in it.    During the meeting Wang Jinshan, deputy secretary of the  provincial party committee, also delivered a speech on the issue  of implementing decisions. He urged various units to further  unify their thinking and understanding, to strictly enforce the  law and regulations on establishment, to accelerate the progress  in implementing the three decisions, to intensively straighten  out relations, and to clear up or consolidate the personnel who  will be the successors of other posts or be transferred.    During the meeting, Wei Minxue, vice governor the province,  delivered a report on the province's current situation in  industrial production, in which he made specific arrangements  for organizing industrial production.    Among those who were invited to the meeting were leading  comrades from the provincial party committee, the provincial  people's congress standing committee, the provincial Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference committee, and from  the departments concerned of the province's capital.</p>

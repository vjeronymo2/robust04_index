			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By special reporter Chun Liang (0193 5328): "Experts Call </F> For Abandonment of Import Substitute Strategy To Catch Up With  International Level of Industrial Technology"]    [Text] At a recently convened internal forum on the  development strategy for China's foreign trade and economic ties  in the nineties, senior trade and economic experts one after  another urged the authorities to change the concept and  completely abandon the current "closed-type" import substitute  policy.    From the period when the CPC came to power to 1978, China  accomplished the early-phase industrialization by implementing  the import substitute strategy; since reform and opening up,  through importing technology to transform heavy and chemical  industries, China accomplished the process of "import for  replacement." At present, the third-phase industrialization has  begun, and it is a phase in which heavy and chemical industries  are the main body and labor-intensive and technology-intensive  industries are the two wings for realizing the high degree of  industrial processing which is characteristic of  industrialization in the later phase. For this reason, it is  necessary to accomplish the change from importing technologies  for petrochemical, mechanical, and electronic industries to  exporting them, and to let light and textile industries provide  foreign exchange to technology-intensive industries.    The "closed-type" import substitute strategy stresses  complete domestic manufacturing under state protection after  importing technology. Under the conditions that technological  progress in the international community takes place rapidly,  that modern industrial sectors involve sophisticated technology  and many production links, and that there are strict demands for  raw materials, spare parts, and examining and testing measures,  domestic manufacturing is not only costly, but also  time-consuming, leading to the vicious cycle of  "import--domestic manufacturing--backwardness--import again."    Chinese economic and trade experts have now proposed a new  "open-type import substitute strategy," that is, strength will  be first concentrated to enable certain spare parts or  processing stages to reach the world's advanced level, to enter  the international market, and to become a part of the global  industrial system, and through this to monitor the development  trends of the world's industrial technology and products; then  steps will be taken to enable overall manufacturing to reach the  world's advanced standard. Therefore, the development of  technology-intensive industries in the nineties must aim at  participation in high-level division of labor in the  international community, not just simplistic pursuit of the rate  of domestic manufacturing.</p>

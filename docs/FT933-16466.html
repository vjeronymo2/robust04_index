			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Macho managers under fire: Lucy Kellaway examines the toll taken by heavy workloads James Sullivan leaves his home in Dorking, Surrey, at 7am for his office in the City of London, and returns every night just after 9pm. He is in his early 40s and has three children aged eight, six and two. He fears that if he does not work so hard he will lose his Pounds 75,000-a-year job. But if he continues to put the hours in, he may lose his wife and his children. Like other unhappy and unwilling workaholics, Sullivan is suddenly hot political property. This week Alistair Burt, a junior minister at the Department of Social Security, decried the 'outrageous time commitments' that companies demand from their employees. He warned that heavy workloads were helping to push one in two British marriages towards divorce, were making workers unhappy and turning the offspring of wealthy parents into deprived children. Meanwhile, the tabloid press has taken up the cause of the neglected wives of Britain's bosses. Lady Broackes, wife of the ex-boss of Trafalgar House, and Lady Reid, wife of the chairman of British Rail, were among those who recently unburdened themselves to the Daily Mail, and spoke up about the loneliness of being a tycoon's wife. Recent research by the Industrial Society shows that British managers work an average of 55 hours a week, in blatant disregard of their contracts, most of which specify between 35 and 40 hours. A Mori poll last year of 200 directors showed that nearly half started work before 8am, and a quarter were still working after 6.30pm. About two-thirds worked at least one weekend in four, and more than half found that they could not take their full holidays. These habits of macho management are becoming increasingly entrenched. One reason is the recession: those who feel their jobs are at risk are spending more time in the office. The second reason is the 'de-layering' of organisations: the removal of many layers of managers has left those remaining with more to do. A survey carried out last year for the Institute of Management found that most middle managers had taken on new tasks, and had little choice but to work longer and harder as a result. A manager at IBM admitted this week that, as the company moved to rid itself of thousands of people, remaining managers were working 12-hour days and more. Professor Charles Handy, visiting professor at London Business School, says: 'We have half the number of managers as before, paid twice as much and expected to be three times as productive. It leads to stress.' According to Zelda West-Meades of Relate Marriage Guidance, overwork is a common cause of marriage failure. 'There is a lot of arguing at the end of the day when the man gets home. He feels very stressed and has little left to give, and is often too tired to make love.' The problem has been made worse by the fact that some two-thirds of British managers now have a working wife. 'In the old model, the woman was at home providing solace and support. Now women are telling men to share their domestic responsibilities,' says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology at University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. So how much work is too much? Cooper says that few people can sustain more than a 40-something-hour week. 'It is lunacy consistently to work a 50-hour week. These managers are just burning out.' Some managers, rather than burn out, get out. Last month Brian McGowan decided that he had had enough of being chief executive at Williams Holdings, and now the 48-year-old is waiting for fish to bite on the river Test. But not everyone is so lucky: McGowan retired, having amassed enough money to contemplate a life of leisure; for most managers there seems little alternative to the hard grind. How can excessive working hours be changed? The question is seen as increasingly important, not just in terms of saving the hearts, livers and marriages of male managers. Long hours discriminate against women managers, whose domestic duties may prevent them from working round the clock. 'Men tend to get promoted because they spend longer in the office,' says Roger Young, director-general of the Institute of Management. 'What we all want is more flexibility in terms of the working week, and when we get it we will see more women in management.' Prof Handy argues that one solution would be to put people in control of their own time. 'Instead of buying people's time and ordering them how to use it, companies should put people into groups and set goals for what they should deliver,' he argues. Even this might not be the answer to long hours. He admits that people may be their own worst employers, driving themselves as hard as any corporation. Another answer lies in better use of time. According to the Industrial Society, British managers waste more than 20 per cent of their time in meetings that need not be held, and shuffling paper. They also fly off on business trips, without any clear idea about what they are trying to achieve. Above all, the problem of overwork will not be solved until company attitudes change. Prof Handy maintains that corporate fashions are led by elites, so that people at the top need to change their ways first. Until recently most of the big corporate successes have been workaholics and proud to admit it. But there are glimmers of change. Sir John Collins, chief executive of Shell UK, attacks the idea that working long hours necessarily means doing the job well. 'The quality of the time is much more important than the quantity. I would much rather see a manager who had visited one offshore platform and had an impact there, than someone who had helicoptered round 10 in a day,' he says. Sir John ridicules the culture whereby people go home, leaving their jackets on the chair to make it look as if they are still there. While others may brag about how hard they work, his boast is that he never works weekends. Government ministers such as Burt may attack the workaholic culture, yet they themselves score higher than most as absentee parents and spouses. MPs work long and unsociable hours with frequent midnight sittings of parliament; ministers work harder still. Lord Young describes his hectic day as chairman of Cable and Wireless as leisurely compared with his time running the Department of Trade and Industry. He, like a small number of successful, mostly male, managers, seems to thrive on the long working days, the papers to read at night, the business dinners and the permanent jet lag. But as Cooper points out, the top people are self-selecting, and for each of them there are many hopefuls who have fallen, wounded, by the wayside.</p>

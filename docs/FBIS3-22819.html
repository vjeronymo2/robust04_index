Nikolay  Bisovko, a senior official in the Federal Supervision of Nuclear  and Radioactive Security, who looks after the safety of nuclear  power plants used by the country's defense agencies, told  Interfax that a mobile LNW processing unit would be built in the  Maritime Territory at a cost of 1.2 Bn [billion] rubles. "We  believe that it will be assembled in three to four months and  become operational in 1994," he said.    He added that a stationary processing unit had to be  constructed in the area. The unit will need filters and other  parts that will have to be manufactured in numerous factories.    Bisovko thinks said that an ecological study would precede  the construction of stationary LNW processing units. It was  hard to say at this stage how much time and funds would be  required for that project.</p>

[Question] Sergey Mikhaylovich, there are many very anxious  letters in RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA's mail from pensioners, especially  from the "sovereign" territories.    [Answer] Pension guarantees really do not directly relate to  the problems of our ministry. But I am not surprised that you  are asking me this question. I cannot help but recognize that  the disastrous position of pensioners is an all-Russian  calamity. And it is even broader if one recalls the position of  our fellow countrymen, especially pensioners in the so-called  near abroad. One wants to exclaim: Look how these people live  today! Do you want to live that way tomorrow?    In my time I more than once raised the problem of pension  guarantees in the country. I was concerned and am concerned  most of all about the situation in the "hot spots," in regions  of interethnic conflict.    The Ministry of National and Regional Policy Affairs  receives, for example, hundreds of letters from pensioners in  Chechnya. For a year they have not been able to receive their  humble pensions. It is impossible to read these appeals without  an ache in your heart. People write who have worked for decades  for the good of our Fatherland. Many of them whose health was  undermined during the Stalinist years when they experienced  deportation or lived in exile. Why are they being punished  again--now in their old age?! What kind of price is this for  the Law on the Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples?    As a politician, a jurist and simply as a person I see the  task of our leaders, the task of reform as creating a society in  which each citizen would be reliably protected from accidental  occurrences, would be guaranteed a peaceful old age.    [Question] You are saying that you have raised the question  of pension guarantees more than once. What happened? Did you  achieve anything? Is it the same as Chechnya in other republics?    [Answer] What is the reason for the nonpayment of pensions  in  Chechnya? It is simple to open the coffer but the key to it is  in the pocket of the politicians or pseudopoliticians, whichever  you prefer.    The system of pension guarantees, simply speaking, is built  on the basis of mutual credits of the generations. We use the  fruits of our labor for those who are now, as they say, on a  well-earned vacation, but a pension is paid to them from the  pocket of those who are working today, by deductions of taxes  into the Pension Fund. There is one fund for the whole country  but each republic or each oblast has its own branches where they  receive deductions from enterprises and local organizations.    It would seem that nothing could be simpler: the money  arrives in the local branch of the fund and the local pensions  are paid. But everything is much more complicated. In many  regions the receipts do not cover the demands for payment. Here  the better-off regions (more tax-intensive, if it can be  expressed that way) come to help them, whose deductions enter  the federal Pension Fund and the corresponding subsidies are  distributed.    Thus here is interdependence. Now imagine that one of these  republics, especially a subsidized one, declares its  sovereignty. But why imagine? This is precisely what Chechnya  did. And the National Bank of the Chechen Republic unilateraly  severed its relations with the Russian Federation Central Bank  and was no longer able to finance these expenditures from the  Russian Federation Pension Fund. What that led to, we have  already talked about.    In the beginning of 1993 Chechnya was allotted 2.5 billion  rubles [R] to pay pensions.    [Question] Did this resolve the problem?    [Answer] Of course it did not resolve it. They stopped  talking about this fact itself, and I think that not even all  the pensioners in Chechnya suspect it.    And although the money finally reached them, we together  with  the Russian Federation Ministry of Social Security and the  Pension Fund adopted a decision allowing the Russian social  security organs to pay pensions until the normalization of the  situation in Chechny, excluding pensions to inhabitants of the  given republic outside its borders.    In order to receive the money due them, the pensioners  living  in Chechnya have to appeal to the social security organs of any  region of Russia.    Of course, this is not a way out. It is possible that the  latest decisions of the Duma will help stabilize the situation.    Here it is appropriate to say that it would seem that for  our  ministry the particular part of the problem of nonpayment of  pensions in Chechnya focuses on a whole complex of complicated  tasks. Millions of Russian citizens are living in other regions  outside of legal and social security.    I have to say that for more than three years the Russian  Federation Constitution, laws or Russian legality have not  existed on the territory of Tatarstan. In essence, Russia's  general state sovereignty has not been disseminated in Tatarstan.    Now we have concluded a well known treaty with Tatarstan.  Has it removed all the problems? I don't think so. Has it  eased the situation? Yes, it has eased it. In any case, it gave  us the possibility to remove the formal contradictions between  the constitutions and provides a legal basis for resolving other  disputed issues.    In a word, it is necessary to actively seek ways out of  situations that at first glance seem to be dead ends.    [Question] In general how much is it possible to influence  the state of affairs under the current conditions? How do you  influence, let's say, the course of elections to local organs of  power which are collapsing in a whole number of regions? What  do the facts about the confrontation between elected and  appointed representatives of power say about this?    [Answer] You are asking questions for which there are no  simple answers. They are all interconnected. Let's take them  in order. Yes, elections to the local organs of power are  proceeding with difficulty.    It is obvious that the facts about opposition to the  representatives of executive power in local areas reflect  negatively on the preparation for the elections. Let's say that  in Yaroslavl Oblast the administration ratified the decree "On  Organs of Local Power..." only on 20 December and then three  times, up until 8 February, changes were introduced into it.  The President's representative proposed holding the elections  of organs of local self-government (except for the oblast duma)  in the autumn. As a result of the elections 17 out of 23  districts made up the oblast duma. In six districts they were  disrupted due to the [neivka?] of the voters. In Yaroslavl,  Uglich and Tutayev the dumas will work without a full complement.    I think that problems of local self-government are now  coming  into the forefront. It is precisely on this level that we can  and should resolve many questions inlcuding those that are  national in their essence and in their form. We in the ministry  are creating a department on issues of local self-government.    [Question] Sergey Mikhaylovich, it is the general opinion  that you are one of the most mobile politicians and that more  often than the others you are in the local areas. How do you  evaluate the situation in Russia as a whole?    [Answer] The general situation in the Russian Federation can  be evaluated in two ways. On one hand the government and  society have recognized the failure of shock therapy. On the  other hand, it is reassuring that a realistic way out of the  dead end has been outlined in the president's messages and in  the program of the government leaders.    This course toward the social orientation of economic  policy,  stabilization of production, its structural restructuring,  serious anti-inflationary measures and federalization of Russia  is opening up the potential of the Russian regions and is the  only way of maintaining the integrity of the Russian state.    Unfortunately, political instability is being maintained.  Disinformation about some kind of plot is being spread, which  further destabilizes the situation in society.    [Question] This is your first appearance in RABOCHAYA  TRIBUNA as a minister. Therefore, please, say a few words about  the tasks of your ministry.    [Answer] Structurally we divide them into three large blocs.  The first of these is nationality affairs: repressed and  deported peoples, problems of the Russian Germans, a program for  rebirth of the peoples of Russia which the Supreme Soviet  Council of Nationalities is still working on. It needs to be  implemented.    The second bloc is purely regional policy in its financial  and economic sense. We will create interdepartment structures  jointly with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of  Economics to deal with oblast, kray, and republic budgets and  the siting of production forces, and to create funds for  supporting the regions. Without real financial resources we  cannot launch one program, cannot resolve one national conflict.    The third bloc touches on regional policy but is also  sufficiently autonomous. It is the the North. Problems of its  socioeconomic development, small peoples, maintenance of its  ecological assets and traditional ways of life.    Much can be said about our plans and ways to realize them,  but I think that there will still be possibilities to meet with  the readers of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA.    [Interviewer ends] Of course.</p>

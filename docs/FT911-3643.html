			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Jobs: Consultant discovers surprising differences between candidates either side of 40 - Fresh light on the age-barrier paradox AT LAST the Jobs column has been supplied with a clue to a question that has mystified it these past 18 years or more. Why do senior executives, mostly aged at least 40, typically resist taking on people over 40 to work for them as executives? The reason usually cited for refusing to recruit same is that folk of such advanced years are no longer up to the work. But that surely rebounds awkwardly on the executives doing the recruiting. So unless there is evidence that the 'past-it' clause does not apply to 40-pluses already ranked as seniors (and I've never seen any) we would seem to be faced with a paradox. Fortunately, a way out has been found by recruiter Barrie Whitaker of the consultancy arm of Price Waterhouse. His work entails assessing job-candidates by a variety of measures - tests of verbal and numerical reasoning, and of personality, as well as 'in-tray' exercises  - and he has lately compared the under-40s' results with those of their elders. So far, only one occupational group has provided him with enough candidates for the findings to be statistically respectable. It consists of finance executives, of whom he has tested 100 on the right side of the age bar, and 77 on the wrong side. But he says the results are similar for other types such as general managers and personnel and production people. A further thing that proved much the same was the reasoning-test performance of the under- and over-40s. Apart from a marginal lead for the younger set on the numerical measure, there was no difference between them. Where the two age-groups did contrast was in persuasiveness, friendliness, decisiveness and astuteness. The oldies came out stronger on all those counts, which would apparently give them an edge in the job of managing. Nevertheless there were other factors which cast light on their unpopularity as executive recruits. For example, the oldies were more critical and controlling than the younger set, and less democratic, practical and conscientious in sticking to boring, repetitive tasks. Hence it seems that, at the same time as being better equipped to work as managers, the over-40s are more difficult to manage. But that still leaves the question why senior executives of comparable years are averse to taking on the challenge of managing them. The answer, Barrie Whitaker thinks, lies in another unexpected difference he has found between the two age-groups. The over-40s are more competitive. So senior recruiters, being of that nature themselves, probably see similarly inclined as well as better equipped older candidates as a greater threat to them in their own positions. NOW to the table below, which gives indications of the pay prospects held out by different kinds of specialist work in the United Kingdom. The figures come from the latest survey made for the British Institute of Management by the Remuneration Economics consultancy. Dated at January 1, the study covered 24,651 middle- and upper-ranked staff in 385 widely varied organisations throughout the UK, which together employ over a tenth of the country's workforce. Anyone wanting the weighty report, which costs Pounds 325, should contact Peter Stevens of the consultancy at 51 Portland Rd, Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey KT1 2SH; tel 081-549 8726, fax 081-541 5705. My table is confined to 11 specialisms commonly found in companies, and in each case shows the average total money pay - bonuses and such besides salaries - at seven levels of seniority from director downwards. Except for 'Management services' which includes information technology, and 'Company secretary' which covers in-house legal services, the specialisms should need no further explanation. As may be seen, the one with the best top pay is financial management. But measured by the average prospects across all seven ranks, it is second to the company secretarial area. Third by the same measure comes marketing followed by management services, R and D, personnel, sales, engineering design etc, purchasing, distribution, and manufacturing. FINALLY to four jobs. All are being handled by headhunters who may not identify their clients. They therefore promise to abide by applicants' requests not to be named to the employer at this stage of the proceedings. The first pair, being offered through Brian Standring, are for technical services managers initially based near London with a probability, though no certainty, of transfer to central Africa. They will work for an international group making and distributing products including food and beverages, and will be responsible for efficient and profitable production. The more senior will require higher-level experience than the second. But both must be engineers who understand finance as well as up-to-date production methods such as total quality management and just-in-time manufacturing. They need to be French-speaking too. Salaries plus bonuses Pounds 46,000 and Pounds 35,000 respectively. Cars and stock-options among perks. Inquiries to the Standring Partnership, 83 Wycombe Rd, Marlow, Buckinghamshire SL7 3HZ; tel 0628 471185, fax 0628 482240. The other two jobs are in the London options-sales team of an international bank, and are offered through recruiter John Williams of Russell, Williams and Associates (45 St Mary's Rd, London W5 5RQ; tel 081-579 1082, fax 081-566 2024). Both posts need high numeracy, with one also requiring success in marketing currency options, and the other the same in marketing interest-rate options with emphasis on caps and floors. Salaries about Pounds 30,000 with bonus on results, and cars.</p>

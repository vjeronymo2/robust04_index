			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Observer: Trading with Bruges Few are the occasions when John Major can wait for a speech from Lady Thatcher with equanimity, particularly at an event organised by Patrick Robertson of Bruges Group fame. One such seems set to occur early next month during a London conference entitled World Trade after Gatt - Issues for Europe and its Competitors. For a change, Lady Thatcher will be beating the drum for a cause beloved by her successor when she talks about the need for an open trading system. The conference is a first for Robertson's Taskforce Communications set up by one of Lady T's greatest admirers, Lord Parkinson. Queueing up to listen will be Arthur Dunkel, the long-suffering Gatt director-general, who oversaw the birth of the Uruguay Round. So will Sir Iain Vallance, chairman of BT, who will pronounce on international telecommunications, Laurent Fabius, former French prime minister, on the reactions of his country, John Flemming, erstwhile chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, on multilateralism, and DeAnne Julius, British Airways' new chief economist, on trade in services. Above all, one of the heroes of the round, Sir Leon Brittan, will analyse the policies of the European Union. So should he and, for that matter, John Major, wait with pleasurable anticipation for what their former boss will have to say? Probably not. It would be surprising if she were not to take the opportunity to belabour the European Union for its interventionism, protectionism, et al. Trust that Robertson chap to stir up trouble again.</p>

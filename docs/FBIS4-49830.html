			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Report (Excerpts) on the Implementation of Anhui </F> Province's 1993 Budget and the Draft of Its 1994 Budget" --  delivered by Kuang Bingwen, director of the Anhui Provincial  Finance Department at the Second Session of the Eighth Anhui  Provincial People's Congress on 6 April 1994]    [Text] Entrusted by the Anhui Provincial People's  Government, I now submit a report on the implementation of  Anhui's 1993 budget and the draft of its 1994 budget to the  session. Please examine it.  <H5>  I. Implementation of the 1993 Budget </H5>   In 1993, while Anhui enjoyed sustained, rapid, and healthy  economic development, total provincial revenues overfulfilled  budgeted amounts and total provincial expenditures basically  guaranteed normal requirements and supported economic and social  development. Anhui improved the balance between its financial  revenues and expenditures.  <H5>  (1) Anhui Province's Implementation of Its Budget </H5>   Of the 1993 budget approved by the First Session of the  Eighth Anhui Provincial People's Congress for Anhui Province,  revenues reached 6.63038 million yuan and expenditures 5.89159  million yuan. After adding funds carried over from the previous  year and special additional funds appropriated from the central  treasury, the budgeted expenditures must be adjusted to 8.27229  million yuan.    The implementation of the 1993 budget for Anhui is as  follows:    Revenues amounted to 7.3209 million yuan, or 110.4 percent  of  the budgeted amount. The figure exceeded the budgeted amount by  690.54 million yuan and posted a 32.8-percent increase over  1992. Calculated in accordance with the current financial  system, total funds available for use amounted to 6,337.24  million yuan. Expenditures amounted to 7.20085 million yuan, or  87 percent of the budgeted amount after adjustment. When funds  available for use were set against expenditures, there was an  accumulated deficit of 863.61 million yuan, less than the  previous year by 185.93 million yuan. Anhui succeeded in  maintaining a balance between revenues and expenditures in 1993.  <H5>  (2) Implementation of the Provincial-Level Budget </H5>   Of the provincial-level budget approved by the First Session  of the Eighth Anhui Provincial People's Congress, revenues  reached 126.23 million yuan and expenditures 1.2856 million  yuan. After adding funds carried over from the previous year  and special funds appropriated from the central treasury and  after deducting funds appropriated by the province for  prefectures and cities, the total budgeted expenditures must be  adjusted to 2.8691 million yuan.    The implementation of the provincial-level budget is as  follows:    Revenues returned to the treasury was 217.18 million yuan,  more than the approved budget by 343.41 million yuan [as  published]. Calculated in accordance with the current financial  system, total funds available for use amounted to 1.6985 million  yuan. Expenditures amounted to 1.6678 million yuan. When funds  available for use were set against expenditures, there was some  surplus.    Generally speaking, the 1993 budget for Anhui was  successfully implemented. Anhui's financial revenues exceeded  the two levels -- 6 billion and 7 billion yuan; and its  expenditures were effectively brought under control. Anhui's  revenues covered the year's expenditures. A number of  prefectures and cities also eliminated some deficits posted in  previous years and somewhat improved the situation of their  revenues and expenditures.    Last year, closely revolving their efforts around the  objectives of making financial revenues reach 7 billion yuan and  enabling revenues to cover the year's expenditures proposed by  the provincial party committee and government, financial and  taxation departments in the province did a large amount of  painstaking and fruitful work under the leadership of party  committees and governments at all levels.    (1) Continuing to expand sources of revenues and increasing  revenues of counties and townships to a new level. Having  continued to support the 16 key counties (cities) selected in  1992, Anhui gave support to 19 additional counties (cities) last  year. With efforts by various levels of authorities, the  revenue of the 35 key counties (cities) enjoying government  support is 17.3 percent more than the target set in contracts of  support for 1993, an increase higher than that of ordinary  county revenue. The number of counties (cities) with revenue  over 50 million yuan increased from 13 in 1992 to 23; among  them, Chaohu and Suzhou cities have joined Fuyang and Bozhou  cities to become cities with over 100 million in revenue. In  the meantime, 36 townships and towns have increased their  revenues.    (2) Strictly enforcing tax laws, strengthening the  collection  and management of revenues, and striving to achieve and  overfulfill the revenue target. Last year, all localities  vigorously took effective measures to rectify financial and  taxation order, strengthen budgetary management, and  conscientiously screen and check unauthorized tax reduction and  exemption and violations of tax laws. To some extent, this has  redressed the practices of contracting turnover taxes and  leaving some revenues unregistered. Meanwhile, great efforts  were made to clear tax and interest defaults. The incomes of  prefectures and cities as a whole increased above the target set  in the budget in 1993.    (3) Strictly controlling general expenditures, strengthening  capital management, and ensuring the needs of key projects.  Last year, all localities significantly enhanced their  consciousness of the balance of financial revenue and  expenditure and actively cut down and controlled general  expenditures, mainly meeting-related spending, telephone  charges, auto fuel charges, public health service spending, and  others. Meanwhile, they collected funds through all possible  means to ensure the expenditures for key projects and  particularly did a great deal of work in ensuring wages,  striving for more funds for agriculture and educational  investment, and others. This has greatly supported agricultural  production as well as the development of education and  scientific and technological undertakings.    (4) Intensifying the work of financial and taxation  supervision and management. Anhui has conducted a general  financial and taxation inspection, a general inspection of the  implementation of discipline for purchasing control, and a  series of inspections of the use of special funds; further  strengthened the management of capital not included in the  budget; appraised properties of some selected administrative  institutions; and launched the work of appraising assets.  <H5>  II. Draft Fiscal Budget for 1994 </H5>   The guiding ideology for the budgetary arrangements for 1994  is: vigorously promote the reform of the financial and taxation  system, rationalize distribution relations, and strive to ensure  the smooth implementation of all measures for the reform of the  economic system; actively create sources of revenue and  strengthen tax collection and management according to laws to  ensure a greater increase in revenue; firmly cut down general  expenditures; give priority to the consideration of wages for  staff and workers and indispensable expenses for case  investigation and normal operations of organs, and continue to  attach importance to the investment in agriculture, science and  technology, education, and others; and make efforts to achieve a  balance of financial revenue and expenditure to bring about  sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development as well as  social stability in Anhui.  <H5>  (1) Draft Provincial Budget </H5>   The 1994 draft budget submitted to the session for  examination and deliberation is compiled by the provincial  authorities. The total provincial revenue is targeted at 8.538  billion yuan, a 16.6- percent increase over the figure  registered in 1993 and up 9.2 percent in terms of comparable  constants [ke bi kou jing 0668 4024 0656 1777]; this includes  3.886 billion yuan in local revenue. Estimating and calculating  on the basis of the revenue-sharing system, Anhui's available  funds as well as its expenditures for the year are both budgeted  at 7.006 billion yuan, striking a balance of revenue and  expenditure for the year's budget.    1. Draft Current Budget    The revenue is set at 3.3025 million yuan, up 13.8 percent  in  terms of comparable constants; adding the revenue subsidized by  the central authorities and deducting the sum to be turned over  to the central authorities, the current available funds for the  year are 6.442 billion yuan. With the current expenditures for  the year set at 5.8009 million yuan, the balance of current  account is 641.01 million yuan in the budget.    2. Draft Construction Budget    The revenue is set at 583.5 million yuan; adding the balance  of current revenue for the year and others, the available  construction funds for the year is 1.20501 million yuan. This  strikes a balance of revenue and expenditure, with the same  year's construction spending set at 1.20501 million yuan.    (2) Draft Provincial-Level Budget    Revenues in the provincial-level budget total 14.9 million  yuan. As the financial system governing the provincial  authorities' policies toward their subordinate organs has not  been finalized yet, the available funds in the provincial budget  for the year can only be roughly estimated at 1.4655 million  yuan; a balance of revenue and expenditure is achieved in the  budget, with expenditures of the year set at 1.4655 million yuan.    In addition to ensuring normal expenses, this year's draft  provincial and provincial-level budgets have emphatically  increased the investments in agriculture, education, science and  technology, and other areas. The operating expenses for  agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy as well as outlays  for supporting rural production and expanses for educational and  scientific and technological undertakings in the provincial and  provincial-level budgets are all set higher than the revenue  increase in the current budget. The proportion of three  scientific and technological expenses to total expenditure in  the budget exceeds 1 percent. The budget for the aforementioned  expenses has met the requirements of the central as well as the  provincial regulations.  <H5>  III. Strive To Accomplish the Tasks in the 1994 Fiscal </H5> Budget    Comprehensively achieving the tasks in this year's fiscal  budget is an important guarantee to bring about sustained,  rapid, and healthy economic development and social stability and  unity in Anhui. Financial and taxation departments at various  levels around the province should, under party committee and  government guidance, actively promote financial and taxation  reform, strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control,  vigorously increase revenues and control expenditures, strictly  enforce financial and economic laws and discipline, and strive  to promote Anhui's financial work to a new level.    (1) Concentrate efforts on carrying out financial and  taxation reform. Leading comrades in all localities and  departments must earnestly enhance the leadership and  coordination in financial and taxation reform, conscientiously  organize the implementation of reform, promote it steadily, and  make sure it will be successful. Presently, they should properly  deal with two tasks: 1. accelerating the organization and  establishment of local taxation organs, strengthening the  collection and management of local revenues, and ensuring the  normal operation of the new financial and taxation mechanism;  and 2. studying and drafting a program for reforming financial  system governing the provincial authorities' policies toward  prefectures and cities as soon as possible. Meanwhile, attention  should be paid to intensifying investigations and studies as  well as summing up new experiences, discovering new situations,  and resolving new problems in time; problems concerning the  link-up of policies while shifting from one system to another  should be particularly handled properly to ensure the  implementation of various reform measures.    (2) Continue to attach importance to expanding sources of  revenues to enhance the momentum for financial development. It  is necessary to actively readjust our way of thinking for  creating sources of local revenues based on the changes in the  distribution structure of financial resources after the  revenue-sharing system is instituted, to create and expand  sources of local revenues. We should continue to make the  expansion of sources of county-level revenues our work focus,  collect funds from various quarters, and support one more group  of counties (cities) with promising conditions.    (3) Strengthen revenue collection and management and make  sure to increase revenue to a new level. No matter whether it's  central revenue or local revenue, every penny must be collected.  From this year on, state enterprises must pay income taxes to  the state strictly according to applicable tax rates. The  practice of leaving some revenues unregistered under the system  of "distribution of total revenue" must be redressed and all  receivable revenues must be collected and recorded in the  budget. Agricultural and special agricultural products taxes  account for a significant portion of the fixed income of  localities, all localities must intensify the construction of  the collection and management system in view of problems such as  scattered sources of tax revenue and great difficulties in  collection and management to improve collection and management.    (4) Rationally arrange for and strictly control expenditure  to strive for a balance between this year's revenue and  expenditure. In arranging for this year's fiscal expenditure,  we should first emphatically guarantee finances for personnel  wages, essential case-handling expenditures, and government  offices' normal operating expenses. We must try hard to ensure  prompt and full payment of wages for personnel in administrative  undertakings and units -- teachers in particular -- and to avoid  back pay. Under this precondition, we will try hard to increase  investment in agriculture, education, and science and  technology. It is necessary to resolutely cut expenses on  meetings, maintenance, post and telecommunications, and others  and vigorously promote the fine tradition of diligence and  frugality. Efforts should be made to accelerate reform of the  expenditure control system; comprehensively implement zero-based  budgeting; and, in conjunction with institutional reform,  earnestly appraise and decide the establishment of  administrative undertakings and units, fix the number of  personnel according to the establishment, and check and ratify  payroll against the number of personnel.    (5) Take effective measures to support economic development.  First, we will continue to increase investment in agriculture  and, with an aim to raise peasants' income, develop the rural  economy. Second, we will support state-owned enterprises in  terms of policy and finances to upgrade their reserve strength  of development. Third, we will vigorously support the  development of the tertiary industry to foster new finances.    (6) Strengthen state property management and deepen reform  of  the property rights system. We should center on changing  state-owned enterprises' operating mechanisms, establishing a  modern enterprise system, implementing a supervisory system for  state property, and other central tasks to actively explore a  system and methods of state property management suited to the  socialist market economic system. It is necessary to take  realistic and effective measures to prevent and rectify acts  that are detrimental to state property rights, firmly end the  drain of state property, and ensure conservation and  appreciation of the value of state property.    (7) Administer finances and taxation in accordance with the  law and enforce financial and economic discipline. Various  departments at all levels should earnestly study and implement  in depth fiscal and taxation laws and regulations, persist in  administering taxation and finances in accordance with the law,  and manage to ensure strict observance and enforcement of the  law as well as punishment of all law violations to truly carry  out fiscal and taxation work within the scope of law. Fiscal  and taxation departments at all levels in particular should  fulfill their duties, exercise strict self-discipline, fight  corruption, and promote clean administration to ensure that  fiscal and taxation work is carried out properly.</p>

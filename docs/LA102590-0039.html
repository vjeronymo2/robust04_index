			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MANU: 'I MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE';  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGES: RIVERSIDE PLAYER'S PUNCHING OF OFFICIAL ON SATURDAY COULD  END UP IN COURT.  </P> <P> A football player strikes an official, and one wonders:  </P> <P> How can this happen? What would cause a talented athlete to put his career in  jeopardy by engaging in such a blatantly vicious act? What was he thinking? Was  he thinking?  </P> <P> The answers, it seem, won't come any time soon.  </P> <P> Sam Manu, the Riverside City College linebacker who punched field judge Nick  Van Lue during a game Saturday, isn't ready to talk. The former Carson High  standout has been unavailable for comment, except for a brief statement  released Monday by Riverside.  </P> <P> "I am not trying to hide from the media," Manu said, according to the release.  "But for several reasons, I cannot yet comment on my actions in last weekend's  game against Golden West. As I have said through the college, I am sorry for my  actions. I made a terrible mistake and have embarrassed the college, my coaches  and teammates."  </P> <P> Riverside dismissed Manu from the team Sunday, a decision that figures to  weaken the Tigers. Manu, a 6-foot-1, 240-pound sophomore, entered Saturday's  game leading Riverside in tackles and interceptions.  </P> <P> But it remains to be seen if the dismissal is sufficient punishment to satisfy  Van Lue. The 43-year-old teacher and coach at Narbonne High said he will decide  whether to pursue legal action after meeting with Mission Conference  administrators.  </P> <P> "I'm not a lawyer," Van Lue said. "I have to do what's best for other officials  so this doesn't happen again. I'm sure (Manu) is sorry now, but he didn't think  about it at the time."  </P> <P> Van Lue spent four hours at Fountain Valley Hospital on Saturday night after he  was punched on the chin by Manu in the third quarter of Golden West's 22-13  victory over Riverside at Orange Coast College. Van Lue had just cited Manu for  unsportsmanlike conduct, saying he saw the player take an open-handed swing at  a Golden West player after a tackle.  </P> <P> Van Lue, who doesn't remember hitting the ground, was unconscious for about a  minute and remained on the ground for several minutes before being assisted to  the sideline.  </P> <P> Tom Fox, a Narbonne assistant football coach who accompanied Van Lue to the  game, drove his friend to the hospital, where Van Lue said he passed out again  for about 15 minutes. After tests and X-rays, Van Lue said doctors told him he  had suffered a mild concussion.  </P> <P> In his 20 years as an official, the last 14 on the college level, Van Lue said  it was the first time a player had ever taken a swing at him.  </P> <P> "You get players who bump into you, or spit at you, or curse at you," he said.  "I've been through all that as an official. You do as much talking to those  players, and most respond very well. Except this kid here. He just lost it."  </P> <P> Riverside Coach Barry Meier and Gene Vollnogle, who coached Manu at Carson,  said it was out of character for the player to act in such a violent manner.  </P> <P> "We feel this is an isolated incident," Meier said. "Sam is a good kid. He  realizes he made a terrible mistake. Right now we just want to help him recover  from this incident and go on with his academic career."  </P> <P> Meier said he will encourage Manu to stay in school and seek counseling to  review the incident and explore ways to moderate his behavior.  </P> <P> Vollnogle described Manu as a loner at Carson, where he played fullback and  linebacker on the Colts' 1988 L.A. City Section 4-A championship team.  </P> <P> "It's not like him," Vollnogle said of the incident. "He's usually a controlled  individual. His problem was not going to class (at Carson). I can't imagine him  instigating anything.  </P> <P> "He's real quiet; a really nice guy. I never even heard him cuss. He's the type  of kid you would like to go out with your daughter.  </P> <P> "It's hard for me to believe that he would punch an official. But things  happen. People go off."  </P> <P> Exactly what set off Sam Manu on Saturday remains a mystery.  </P></p>

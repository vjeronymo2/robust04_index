			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As in the case of other cleaning applications, the Agency finds unacceptable substitutions of HCFC&hyph;141b to replace MCF, since these compounds have nearly identical ODPs. Here again, the Agency will grant, if necessary, a limited narrowed use acceptability listings for CFC&hyph;113 past the exemption granted in the grandfathering period. However, the Agency expects only few requests for permission to use HCFC&hyph;141b to come from this sector, since most companies who requested exemptions to date to have stated that they view their use of HCFC&hyph;141b only as an interim solution. EPA believes that, absent future indications from such companies, all uses of HCFC&hyph;141b can be terminated by the effective date of the unacceptability listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Fire Suppression and Explosion Protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Overview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Halons are gaseous or easily vaporizable halocarbons used primarily for putting out fires, but also for explosion protection. The two halons used most widely in the United States are Halon 1211 (chlorodifluorobromomethane) and Halon 1301 (trifluorobromomethane). Halon 1211 is used primarily in streaming applications and Halon 1301 is typically used in total flooding applications. Some limited use of Halon 2402 also exists in the United States, but only as an extinguishant in engine nacelles (the streamlined enclosure surrounding the engine) on older aircraft and in the guidance system of Minuteman missiles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Halons are used in a wide range of fire protection applications because they combine five characteristics. First, they are highly effective against solid, liquid/gaseous, and electrical fires (referred to as Class A, B, and C fires, respectively). Second, they are clean agents; that is, they dissipate rapidly, leaving no residue and thereby avoiding secondary damage to the property they are protecting. Third, halons do not conduct electricity and can be used in areas containing live electrical equipment. Fourth, halons are gaseous substances that can penetrate in and around physical objects to extinguish fires in otherwise inaccessible areas. Finally, halons are generally safe for limited human exposure when used with proper exposure controls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Despite these advantages, halons are among the most ozone-depleting chemicals in use today. Halon 1301 has an estimated ODP of 10; Halon 1211 has an estimated ODP of 3. Thus, while total halon production (measured in metric tons) comprised just 2 percent of the total production of class I substances in 1986, halons represented 23 percent of the total estimated ozone depletion potential of CFCs and halons combined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The greatest releases of halon into the atmosphere occur not in extinguishing fires, but during testing and training, service and repair, and accidental discharges. Data generated as part of the Montreal Protocol's technology assessment indicate that only 15 percent of annual Halon 1211 emissions and 18 percent of Halon 1301 emissions occur as a result of use to extinguish actual fires. These figures indicate that significant gains can be made in protecting the ozone layer by revising testing and training procedures and by limiting unnecessary discharges through better detection and dispensing systems for halon and halon alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional information on specific halon uses can be found in the Montreal Protocol 1991 Assessment or in other background material in the public docket. The determinations found in this section are based on the risk screen described in the background document entitled ``Risk Screen on the Use of Substitutes for Class I Ozone-Depleting Substances: Fire Extinguishing and Explosion Protection (Halon Substitutes)'', and in supplementary assessments included in the public docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Substitutes for Halons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fire protection community has made considerable progress in identifying and developing substitutes for halons in fire protection applications. Several manufacturers have submitted information regarding substitute streaming and total flooding agents, and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has initiated efforts to develop standards for their use in total flooding scenarios (NFPA 2001). In addition, manufacturers are seeking Underwriters Laboratories (UL) and Factory Mutual Research Corporation (FMRC) certification for systems employing the new agents. The Agency's review of halon substitutes is intended not to replace, but to complement the guidance of the fire protection community in directing the transition away from halons to substitutes posing lower overall risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many recent efforts to develop substitutes for halon have focused on halocarbon chemicals. These are considered potential ``replacements'' for halon because they possess halon-like properties (gaseous, non-conducting) and because they can be used on Class A, B, and C fires. Some of the replacement chemicals are chemical action agents which, like halons, suppress fires by interfering with the free radical chain reactions that sustain a fire. Others are physical action agents which cool, dilute, or smother the fire (separating the air and fuel). In general, chemical action agents are much more effective fire suppressants than physical action agents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

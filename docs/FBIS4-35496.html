			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unidentified "special correspondent"] </F>   [Text] The military test of the surface-to-surface  ballistic missile Prithvi will likely be held in the first week  of June. Officials of the Defense Research and Development  Organization and senior Army and Air Force officials are camping  at Chandipur-on-the-Sea in Orissa for the test. According to  reliable Defense Ministry sources, these officials in Chandipur  are awaiting a green light from the Prime Minister's Office.    The test was scheduled for 13 May, but postponed in view of  the prime minister's U.S. visit. Later, the authorities fixed  23 May as the date, but this was not officially announced. As  the Prithvi tests have not been held yet, speculation was rife  that test flights were stopped due to U.S. pressure. Meanwhile,  the U.S. ambassador-designate to India, Frank Wisner, in a  statement on 26 May at the Senate confirmation hearing,  indirectly warned India against deploying this missile.    Defense Ministry sources say that this round of tests will  examine the Prithvi missile from different angles. The tests  are expected to be completed by the end of July. After that,  Bharat Dynamics will be given the go-ahead to start  manufacturing the missile, although Defense Ministry sources are  not in a position to state as to when the actual deployment of  the missile will take place. During the main tests, scientists  of the Defense Research and Development Organization and  military experts will study the subsystems of the missile. This  will include the command system and warhead capacity.    The defense sources say that the tests must begin before the  monsoon reaches the east coast in about two weeks. The defense  sources, however, are confident that they will complete this  round of tests by July. During the first phase of deployment,  the Army will deploy the missiles along the international border  [with Pakistan] in Rajasthan and Punjab. The Army has already  created a special artillery regiment for the purpose. Special  bunkers are being constructed to deploy these missiles in the  plains where they will be kept in specific controlled  temperature conditions.    During the second phase of deployment, Prithvi will be  deployed in Jammu and Kashmir, but the Defense Ministry sources  are not stating when this deployment will commence. It is worth  mentioning that Pakistan has already deployed 70-km range Hatf-1  and 120-km range Hatf-2 missiles. It has also deployed 300-km  range M-11 missiles which have been acquired from China.    India is deploying Prithvi missiles in response to the  Pakistani-deployed missiles, but the United States has only  indirectly warned India against the deployment of Prithvi  missiles. This has led to widespread public interest on the  deployment of these missiles. This has become a question of  national pride. Almost all opposition parties have demanded that  India strengthen its security by deploying these missiles.</p>

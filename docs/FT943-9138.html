			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Sell-off in bond market fells Dow Wall Street A sell-off in the Treasury market, prompted by rising expectations of an imminent interest rate increase, and a disastrous 30-year bond auction, left US share prices lower across the board yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 15.86 at 3,750.90. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.42 to 458.88, while the American Stock Exchange composite finished 0.72 off at 443.25 and the Nasdaq composite unchanged at 728.20. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 275.7m shares. Although prices opened marginally higher, the market struggled to hold on to its gains as Treasury prices slipped steadily lower, pushing long-term interest rates, as measured by the yield on the 30-year government bond, higher. The decline in bond prices was sparked by a series of economic releases which were not overly bearish, but were worrying enough to convince more investors that the Federal Reserve would soon sanction another interest rate increase to slow down the economy. The news that led to the sell-off in the bond market was an upward revision in June retail sales growth, from an originally estimated 0.6 per cent to 0.8 per cent. Analysts said that the robust growth in retail sales, combined with recent strong jobs growth, made it more likely that the Fed would tighten monetary policy, probably after next week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Bond prices fell further later in the day after investors shunned the Treasury's auction of Dollars 11bn new 30-year bonds. The day's other news - a 0.5 per cent rise in July producer prices and a 0.1 per cent decline in July retail sales - had less of an impact. The bigger than expected rise in producer prices was ignored because the gain was attributable almost entirely to higher petrol and coffee prices. Gap Stores jumped Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 41 1/4 in volume of 2.8m shares after announcing second-quarter earnings per share of 30 cents, up from 20 cents last year and above forecasts. US Bioscience rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 6 1/8 on the American Stock Exchange after the company's Hexalen drug, which is used in the treatment of ovarian cancer, was cleared by regulators for marketing in Canada. On the Nasdaq market, technology stocks were in demand once again: Microsoft advanced Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 55 1/4 in heavy trading, Intel climbed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 60 3/8 and Lotus Development appreciated Dollars 1 to Dollars 41 1/4 . Neutrogena forged ahead Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 26 1/2 after the personal care products concern said it was in talks with a larger company that could lead to a takeover of Neutrogena. Comcast Communications moved up Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 17 1/8 immediately after the cable television group reported a narrowing in its second-quarter loss to Dollars 12.8m, from Dollars 17m a year ago, but the shares later fell back to end unchanged at Dollars 16 3/4 . Canada Toronto closed sharply lower after moderate trading as fears of rising interest rates drove North American markets down. The TSE 300 composite index dropped 30.4 to 4,174.7 and declining issues outnumbered advances by 419 to 298 after volume of 60.1m shares valued at CDollars 651m. Twelve of the 14 sub-indices weakened, led by mining, off 1.6 per cent. Industrial products fell 1.3 per cent and financial services shed 1.2 per cent. The transportation group had the day's biggest rise, 1.0 per cent. The golds group also closed higher. Spar Aerospace, down CDollars  3/4 at CDollars 14 1/2 , reported second-quarter earnings of CDollars 170,000 or 1 cent a share, down sharply from a year-earlier net of C2.5m or 17 cents a share. Brazil Shares retreated by 1.1 per cent in volatile trading in Sao Paulo, dragged down ahead of the options and futures markets settlements next Monday and Wednesday. The Bovespa index of the 56 most-traded shares ended 494 down at 44,638. Turnover was RDollars 333.4m (Dollars 372.9m).</p>

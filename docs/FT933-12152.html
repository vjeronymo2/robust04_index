			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Arts: Today's Television What a merry evening the broadcasters have lined up for us. At 8.30 on ITV World In Action explains how an area of countryside the size of Oxfordshire will disappear within 30 years if current road building plans go ahead. At 9.30 Panorama devotes itself to the compelling topic of rape. A little later (11.40) the same channel, BBC1, begins an entire series on sexual harassment at work. Be honest now, you have been saying to yourself for months, 'What we really need is five half-hour programmes about sexual harassment'. What in the world can they do for an encore? 'Teach Yourself Trepanning' perhaps. If you are going to avoid all those and all the repeats your choices become pretty limited. In BBC Proms (7.30 BBC2) you can hear Stravinsky's 'Petrushka', four songs by Grieg, and Tchaikovsky's Suite No 3. Then at 9.00 in Travellers' Tales (C4) the excellent travel writer Norman Lewis explores South East Asia, progressing from jungle tribes in Papua New Guinea to a place in Indonesia where an entire mountain has been removed in the search for copper.</p>

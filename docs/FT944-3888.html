			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Elena's role - Appetisers Exceptional restaurant manageress Elena Salvoni has taken on a new challenge in the hectic period leading up to Christmas and the new year. At the age of 74, she emerges as the matresse d' of the former L'Etoile restaurant, 30 Charlotte Street, W1 (071-636 1496) - henceforth to be known as Elena's L'Etoile. This is a marriage of restaurant history. L'Etoile opened in 1904 and has maintained its original, charming feel. Elena began as a waitress in Soho in the early 1930s, spent the war years serving at the Cafe Bleu and completed 30 years at Bianchi's before spending the 1980s at L'Escargot, where I worked alongside her. Her life is chronicled in her book A Life in Soho, published by Quartet Books. Nicholas Lander Meanwhile, at the Ritz, London W1 (071-493 8181), Emmanuel Menjuzan, aged 28, becomes restaurant manager. Menjuzan trained at Talence Catering School near Bordeaux, and took 'stages' at the Savoy and the London Hilton. He was matre d'hotel on the French aircraft carriers Clemenceau and Foch, while completing his military service. His most recent success has been as restaurant manager of Les Saveurs in Mayfair (071-491 8919). NL For the past 20 years the Anchor Brewing Company in San Francisco has made a special Christmas Ale. It is brewed with added spices at between 5 per cent and 6 per cent alcohol to make a dark, pungent beer. It keeps too. I found a bottle of the 1990 stashed away and tried it alongside the 1994. There was a decent head on the beer and four years in the bottle had given it a sweet, marmalade-like character. It is available from the Beer Shop, 8 Pitfield Street, London N1 (071-739 3701). For other outlets ring Anchor Brewing on 081-977 0261. The price is about Pounds 2 a bottle.</p>

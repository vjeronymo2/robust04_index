			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alfonso Malespin] </F>   [Text] Before leaving Nicaragua yesterday, Salvadoran  President Alfredo Cristiani said that his government will not  meet the opposition FMLN's [Farabundo Marti National Liberation  Front] demands for troops to be confined to their barracks one  day prior to and one day following the 20 March elections and  that troops not participate in transporting the ballot boxes.    The Salvadoran president met with COSEP [Higher Council of  Private Enterprise] members in the morning and urged them to  take a more active role in their country's political life. He  also met with the Supreme Court justices, who requested that  Cristiani support the proposed Central American Court of Justice.    The FMLN has said that the active participation of troops  poses a danger of "technical electoral fraud" because they are  still feared by many Salvadorans.    Cristiani, who received the Jose Dolores Estrada Order from  President Violeta de Chamorro despite objections by the  Nicaraguan Jesuit community, said that if he accepted such a  demand to confine the troops to the barracks, he would be  "acting against the Constitution because it would suppress a  right guaranteed to citizens regardless of their profession."  <H5>  Intimidating </H5>   "The extent of the Armed Forces' participation has not gone  beyond that requested by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE].  In addition, the Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador]  electoral commission has overseen their participation.    Cristiani's party, Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance],  is favored to win the elections in a second round, although  abstention is expected to exceed 40 percent. "There is no doubt  that Arena will win," the Salvadoran president said in Managua.    The FMLN has accused soldiers of intimidating voters and has  said that at least 500,000 voters will be unable to vote due to  unresolved problems at the TSE.    At the end of Cristiani's last official visit to Managua,  which was tinged by a violent clash between the National Police  and former Government Ministry soldiers, he said Nicaragua will  achieve political and economic development when "a climate of  security" prevails in the country.</p>

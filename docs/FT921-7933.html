			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Letter: What price a wet doughnut? Sir, Lex said (February 18) that 'it is hard to see why (the oil price) should recover' from the drop below Dollars 18 per barrel. With the greatest respect (a phrase which, I have learned after many years in England, means the opposite) I will bet a dollar to a wet doughnut that it recovers within 12 days. Roland C Shaw, chairman, Premier Consolidated Oilfields, 23 Lower Belgrave Street, London SW1W 0NR</p>

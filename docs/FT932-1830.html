			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Observer: Indignant As if today's news from Lloyd's of London is not bad enough, an advertisement in a US insurance trade newsletter is touting for membership of Great Britain's 'fastest growing society' among overseas names 'to whom fortune has been unkind'. Headed 'insolvency should never prevent a man from living well', the advert promises complimentary year-round lodging and board. Full grouse hunting and salmon fishing privileges. Applications to the Royal Society for Indigent Names at Lloyd's of London, c/o Cavendish Manor, Ham Upon Rye, Gloucestershire.</p>

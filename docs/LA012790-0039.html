			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> QUALITY REMAINS HIGH AS 'NARNIA' RESUMES  </P> <P> After a year's hiatus, the myth, magic and high adventure of C. S. Lewis' "The  Chronicles of Narnia" resume on PBS' "Wonderworks" with the three-part "Prince  Caspian and the Voyage of the Dawn Treader" (beginning tonight at 8 on Channel  15 and Sunday at 8 p.m. on Channel 28).  </P> <P> Fans who enjoyed last year's exceptional debut of "The Lion, the Witch and the  Wardrobe" have waited a long time for the return of this multimillion-dollar  BBC series.  </P> <P> With one caveat, they won't be disappointed.  </P> <P> Part I is a kaleidoscope of dwarfs and talking beasts, evil-doers, sword-play,  four English children and the crowning of a boy king. Good fun, but the  frenetic pace may confuse viewers who missed last year's segment. That was when  the children -- Lucy, Edmund, Peter and Susan -- first entered the magic world  of Narnia and, aided by its spiritual leader, the lion Aslan, overthrew a  wicked witch and ruled in her stead.  </P> <P> Parts II and III, however, offer a thoroughly marvelous telling of a quest to  the edge of Narnia, aboard the ship Dawn Treader.  </P> <P> Lucy and Edmund are back, with Eustace, a bratty cousin. (Peter and Susan  appear only in Part I; they have outgrown Narnia.) With Caspian and his crew of  men, dwarfs and a talking mouse, they brave unknown seas and enchanted islands.  </P> <P> High-tech gloss is refreshingly absent; the special effects and mechanics have  an appealing stage-play look. The cast is splendid -- Sophie Wilcox is again a  standout as heroic Lucy -- and Alan Seymour's adaptation is captivating. It's a  voyage well worth taking.  </P></p>

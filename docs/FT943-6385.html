			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Australian trade deficit widens The Australian current account deficit widened to a seasonally adjusted ADollars 1.84bn (Pounds 887m) in July, the largest monthly deficit since March 1993 and at the upper end of market expectations. The revised deficit for June was ADollars 1.52bn. The figure caused mild concern in financial markets, where the Australian dollar closed weaker against the US currency. There have been persistent worries that the country's strong economic recovery, which has been driven by domestic demand, coupled with the very slow upturn in business investment, could pose problems on the balance of payments front. If investment starts to surge all at once, it is argued, imports of plant and equipment will be sucked in, giving rise to mounting trade deficits. In addition, some analysts are concerned that the current drought, affecting parts of Queensland and much of New South Wales, will depress agricultural exports, compounding this problem. However, Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, said yesterday that he believed structural changes which had made the economy more competitive should prevent a big current account problem.</p>

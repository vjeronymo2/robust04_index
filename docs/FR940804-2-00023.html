			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We did not make an adjustment for VAT for Foroni based on its claim that it and its home market customers qualify for exemptions under the Italian VAT program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also made no adjustment for home market packing expenses because Foroni claims that it does not pack the subject merchandise and, therefore, did not report this expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Valbruna  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We calculated FMV based on packed prices charged to related and unrelated customers in the home market. For purposes of the preliminary determination, we included arm's-length sales to related customers, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.45.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We deducted cash discounts. We added freight income (i.e., freight charges paid by the customer but not included in the gross price) to both ESP and PP sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's (CAFC) decision in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> V.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 13 F.3d 398 (Fed. Cir. 1994), the Department no longer can deduct home market movement charges from FMV pursuant to its inherent power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. Instead, we will adjust for those expenses under the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a) and the exporter's sales price offset provision of 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2), as appropriate. Accordingly, in the present case, we deducted post-sale home market movement charges from FMV under the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a). This adjustment included home market inland freight (including inland insurance). We adjusted for pre-sale warehousing charges associated with pre-sale movement charges in the ESP offset.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For comparison to ESP sales, we also deducted credit expenses and home market commissions from FMV. We then deducted home market indirect selling expenses capped by the sum of U.S. indirect selling expenses and inventory carrying costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For comparison to PP sales, we made a circumstance-of-sale adjustment for differences in credit expenses and warranty expenses, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2). We also deducted home market commissions from FMV and added to FMV the U.S. indirect selling expenses capped by the amount of home market commissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of the preliminary determination, we considered pre-sale warehousing expenses to be indirect selling expenses because respondent has not adequately demonstrated that such expenses are directly attributable to particular sales of the subject merchandise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also did not allow Valbruna's claim of imputed VAT expenses. While there may be an opportunity cost or income associated with the payment of VAT, that fact alone is not a sufficient basis for the Department to make an adjustment. (See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sulfur Dyes, Including Sulfur Vat Dyes, from the United Kingdom, 58 FR 3253, January 8, 1993.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For both ESP and PP sales, we deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We made adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We adjusted for VAT in accordance with our practice. (See the ``United States Price'' section of this notice, above.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Cost of Production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners alleged that Valbruna made home market sales of subject merchandise at prices below its COP. Based on petitioners' allegation, and in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act, we initiated a COP investigation to determine whether Valbruna made home market sales at prices below its COP over an extended period of time. Although Valbruna's COP questionnaire response will be received too late to be considered for the preliminary determination, it will be verified and considered for the final determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. COUNCIL ENACTS BAN ON ASSAULT GUNS  </P> <P> Over strong gun owner objections and to the cheers of South-Central Los Angeles  residents, the city enacted an emergency ordinance Tuesday outlawing the sale  and possession of semiautomatic weapons such as the AK-47 assault rifle.  </P> <P> Beginning today, selling or offering to sell such assault weapons is illegal  within the city limits. In 15 days, owners of the rapid-firing military-style  rifles must render them inoperable or surrender them to police for destruction.  </P> <P> Those violating the new law face six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Used in Gang Shootings  </P> <P> Assault rifles have been used increasingly in shootings involving gangs in Los  Angeles and elsewhere. A gunman armed with an AK-47 killed five schoolchildren  and injured more than two dozen in Stockton last month, prompting a number of  legislative attempts to ban such weapons statewide.  </P> <P> Gun owners and a National Rifle Assn. attorney predicted that the courts will  strike down the Los Angeles ordinance. But even if the law overcomes legal  challenges, gun owners and some law enforcement officials predict that it will  be ineffective. They argued that criminals and gang members will not relinquish  their rifles and can easily go to nearby cities to buy assault weapons legally.  </P> <P> Specifically outlawed are sales and possession of about a dozen semiautomatic  rifle types such as the AK-47, AR-15 and Uzi. Sawed-off shotguns and gun kits  that can be assembled into an assault weapon are also banned.  </P> <P> A semiautomatic weapon is described in the ordinance as one with a magazine of  20 bullets or more and is able to fire single rounds rapidly with each pull of  the trigger.  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley signed the emergency ordinance about an hour after the City  Council's unanimous vote. The 12-0 vote came after a highly emotional and  raucous hearing featuring verbal parrying between South-Central residents and  flag-waving gun advocates.  </P> <P> Bradley said the new law sponsored by Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky is long  overdue and should be used to prod state and federal lawmakers to enact even  stronger and more far-reaching bans on semiautomatic rifles.  </P> <P> "I believe the time has come when those of us in elected office simply have to  draw the line," Bradley said. "These weapons cannot be used for any legitimate  reason other than to kill people, and I see no justification for anybody to  sell them or possess them."  </P> <P> Noting that cities can only enact misdemeanor laws, Bradley said the state and  federal governments should make possession or sales a felony. He added that  state or federal laws would also help control the sales of assault weapons in  neighboring cities.  </P> <P> Legislation pending in the state Senate and Assembly would make it a felony to  possess or sell assault weapons. But sponsors of the state legislation have  predicted it will be strongly fought by gun interests who have successfully  opposed controls on weapons possession in the past.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky said he will work to apply pressure on the state by approaching  nearby cities to enact similar assault weapon bans. So far, Compton is the only  other nearby city to move against semiautomatic rifles. Stockton, stunned by  the attack on the schoolchildren, outlawed assault rifles Monday. Bradley and  Yaroslavsky said that even if the state fails to act against the semiautomatic  weapons, the city's law will pass muster in the courts. City Atty. James K.  Hahn agreed.  </P> <P> Hahn said the new ordinance was carefully crafted to avoid conflicts with  existing state or federal firearms law. For example, the new ordinance neither  addresses the registration of semiautomatic weapons nor the question of handgun  or automatic weapon possession, all of which fall under state control.  </P> <P> </P> <P> City Attorney 'Confident'  </P> <P> "We feel confident that we can make an argument that the City of Los Angeles  under its police powers has the authority to ban the sale and possession of  assault weapons. . . ," Hahn said.  </P> <P> But NRA attorney Richard Gardiner said state law preempts city law in  regulating the possession of firearms of any type, including semiautomatic  weapons. He was less certain on whether the city could ban the sales of assault  weapons.  </P> <P> Gardiner said the 3-million member organization will not directly challenge the  Los Angeles ordinance but will probably back an "appropriate plaintiff," such  as a gun shop owner.  </P> <P> Gun shop owner Robert Kohn of B&amp;B Sales in North Hollywood told reporters  that he will simply transfer his assault weapon inventory to his Orange County  store in Westminster.  </P> <P> Kohn called the city's action a "grandstand" and said the increasing popularity  of assault rifles is traceable to the recent publicity they have received.  </P> <P> "The public is so panicked that (government) is trying to take away their means  of defense that they are buying nationwide in record numbers," Kohn said. "I'll  probably lose a considerable percentage of business (because of the ordinance),  but that's not involved here. (The city) is trampling on the rights of  law-abiding citizens for emotional appeal and political mileage."  </P> <P> Alan Chamberlain, an NRA member who repairs guns at a Van Nuys shop, said he  will defy the new law because "I think what (the city) did was illegal."  </P> <P> "I'm not releasing my weapons to anybody. . . ," Chamberlain said. "Mussolini,  Hitler and Stalin all pulled this stuff, and that's why you have communism in  those countries where people were unable to protect themselves."  </P> <P> While the new law's passage was booed by gun owners, it was cheered by  South-Central Los Angeles residents. The rapid-firing weapons have become  increasingly popular with some gangs based in South-Central neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The AK-47 and AR-15 rifles have been blamed for a number of drive-by shooting  deaths in South-Central Los Angeles. Residents complained bitterly during a  one-hour hearing that they have been terrorized by the nightly "chatter" of the  semiautomatic guns.  </P> <P> Gun owners complained as well. Opponents said the city ordinance violates their  constitutional rights to "bear arms" and said the sweeping nature of the  ordinance is unfair.  </P> <P> Firing back, Frances James, a leader of the South Central Organizing Committee,  said gun owners opposed to the law did not understand.  </P> <P> "You say it's your God-given right to have a gun," James said. "It's my  God-given right to raise my child and know he'll go to school and know he'll  come back alive.  </P> <P> "I don't have that right, right now."  </P> <P> The city of West Hollywood voted Monday to draft an ordinance banning  semiautomatic assault rifles and the Compton City Council approved a similar  ban by a vote of 5-0 Tuesday night.  </P></p>

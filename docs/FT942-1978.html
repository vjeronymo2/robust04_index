			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Delors brushes off 'philosopher king' jibes Mr Jacques Delors yesterday brushed off British government charges that he had turned into a 'philosopher king' during his 10 years as president of the European Commission. Mr Delors, co-architect of the Maastricht treaty, powerhouse behind the European Single Market, and putative French presidential candidate, said it was wrong to suggest he had spent all his time in Brussels dreaming up grand designs for the Europe's future. 'If that was the case, I would have been able to go to 10 football matches a year instead of two. I would have been less tired,' he told a news conference in advance of this week's European summit in Corfu. Mr Delors, who leaves office in December, offered a hint of satisfaction on how the Commission presidency had grown in power and prestige since he took over in 1985. Yesterday, he counted 89 articles on the contest to succeed him; his appointment, 10 years ago, received only three lines downpage in the French press. But he avoided commenting on the prospects of the three declared candidates to succeed him: Mr Ruud Lubbers, outgoing Dutch prime minister, Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, and Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister and current favourite. In a sympathetic reference to Mr Lubbers, who is being blocked by France and Germany, Mr Delors said he had tried to ensure that all candidates received 'fair treatment' among the heads of government whose choice must be unanimous. Fears are growing that the Corfu summit, which opens on Friday, could be deadlocked over the Delors succession. This could force Germany, which takes over the rotating EU presidency from Greece on July 1, to hold a special summit in the autumn. The British government insisted yesterday it would maintain its backing for Sir Leon. Senior officials refused to discuss Mr Dehaene's candidacy, hinting that Mr John Major, the prime minister, was prepared to see the decision deferred until a special summit. The officials said Mr Major would insist that Sir Leon would make an 'excellent president'. They pointedly side-stepped the question of whether Mr Major would use Britain's national veto, stressing instead that the 12 heads of government were obliged to reach a 'consensus'. In Rome, the Italian government made clear it was prepared to bargain hard over Mr Delors' successor. Mr Antonio Martino, foreign minister, told parliament it was vital to link the choice to the broader issue of obtaining a strong Italian presence in running international organisations. Italy is fielding Mr Renato Ruggiero, former trade minister, as a candidate to head the new World Trade Organisation. Mr Delors offered a low-key assessment of prospects for the meeting in Corfu. He hinted that he would not press EU leaders to support extra European Commission borrowing powers on the capital markets to finance trans-European networks. But he wanted a commitment for work to begin on the 11 'top priority' cross-border road and rail projects. Similarly, he expressed concern that EU leaders might use the incipient economic recovery to shirk from tough choices to improve competitiveness through reform of labour markets and easing the cost of hiring people - matched by greater support for the disadvantaged and unemployed.

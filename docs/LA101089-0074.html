			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: JUSTICE'S WHEELS ROLL PAST HUBCAPS  </P> <P> The first victim of violent crime in this country is victimless crime. With all  the mayhem that is going on in the streets these days, one can't expect the  police to get too excited about a stolen pair of silver candlesticks or a  television set.  </P> <P> Vivian Andrews discovered this when the hubcaps were stolen off her Toyota.  </P> <P> Red-faced and steaming mad she marched down to the 85th precinct and declared,  "I wish to report a crime."  </P> <P> The sergeant was holding a drug-pusher's head on his desk with one hand while  he searched the man's pants with the other. Then he pushed him in the direction  of another officer and said to Vivian, "What kind of crime?"  </P> <P> "Someone stole my hubcaps."  </P> <P> The sergeant looked at her to make sure that she wasn't kidding and said, "We  don't do hubcaps."  </P> <P> "What do you mean 'you don't do hubcaps?' "  </P> <P> "We stopped doing them years ago, about the same time that we decided not to do  anything about stolen television sets, car stereos and silver candlesticks."  </P> <P> "A crime is a crime," Vivian protested. "Those hubcaps mean as much to me as  stolen cash means to a bank."  </P> <P> The sergeant threw a glass paperweight at a mugger who was being booked and  shouted, "Tell him to shut up." He then turned to Vivian. "Please don't think  that the police are cold and heartless about hubcaps. It's just that when it  comes to serving the community, we can't give hubcaps the same priority we give  to a drug lord being gunned down in the street.  </P> <P> "In normal times we might even send someone over to fingerprint your car, and  try to match the prints against every known convict in the city. But these are  not normal times."  </P> <P> "What about the FBI?" Vivian wanted to know.  </P> <P> "The FBI can only intervene if the hubcaps are transported across state lines.  They have problems, too. They're using their entire force to guard Felix Bloch,  and so they decided several months ago to cut back on solving hubcap crimes."  </P> <P> "You people really don't care about petty crime any more. All you're interested  in is stuff that can put you on the evening news."  </P> <P> "That's not true. We're really falling behind these days, and if we rounded up  every hubcap thief in town, we would never catch the few people who deserve to  be locked up." With that the sergeant whacked a fly with his night stick.  </P> <P> "So what are you going to do?" Vivian asked again.  </P> <P> "Lady," the sergeant told her, "I am going to make out a report on your hubcaps  and put it in a file with stolen fur coats, credit cards and punch bowls."  </P> <P> Vivian was impressed. "Here's the form. When can I expect you to catch the  thief and return my hubcaps?"  </P> <P> The sergeant looked at his calendar. "Let's see, today is Tuesday. I won't be  able to get the entire precinct on the case until Wednesday. We'll put out an  all-points bulletin this afternoon, so let's say we'll crack your case by  Friday."  </P> <P> Vivian said, "That seems more than fair. My friends warned me that with the  increase in crime you wouldn't be able to solve the theft until next week."  </P></p>

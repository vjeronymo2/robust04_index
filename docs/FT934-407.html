			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Books that nobody wanted This week the acting books editor staged a sale for charity of all surplus books cluttering up the books office. A new arts and books editor is arriving fairly shortly, and will no doubt cut a swathe as soon as she gathers her wits. In the meantime, we are rubbing along with an acting books editor whose Christmas sale for charity was staged outside my office on Tuesday afternoon. News of the start of the sale was flashed across our screens. Next moment, the space outside my office was filled with the strangest people: a sprinkling of minor specialists, people from the prices rooms, people who write about bonds, and people who sub-edit things. From time to time I would lean out of my office and shout: 'Feminism and Serial Killers are down at this end.' But that is not the sort of joke calculated to succeed with people who write about bonds or spend their time sub-editing things, so eventually I fell quiet and stared glassily at my screen, unable to write a word because of the noise of people scrambling to buy cheap Christmas gifts. In the end, the acting books editor's sale raised Pounds 341, a reverberatory sum considering the books on sale, which were clearly unreviewable, if not, in fact, unreadable. You should have seen the ones that were left. By nightfall, the remains of the charity sale lay as bleached and as picked-over as the bones of a week-old kill abandoned under a thorn tree on the red, volcanic plain north of Mt Kilimanjaro. They made me very sad. All that wasted labour; all those frustrated hopes - books that nobody wanted, not even the authors' mothers, I shouldn't be surprised. Some of these publications were provokingly out of date, which may help explain why the acting books editor was never a prominent candidate for the job of actual books editor. Who could be surprised that there were no takers for The European Public Affairs Update 1992, or The European Public Affairs Directory 1992, or The European Community 1992: Annual Review of Activities, or, indeed, for Hollis Europe: The Directory of European Public Relations and PR Networks, 1992-1993. The press release accompanying Hollis was headlined: 'Single European market heralds bonanza of PR Opportunities'  - an unspeakably revolting thought. Some of the abandoned books had strangely beautiful titles, such as The Third Man: The Life and Times of William Murdoch, Inventor of Gas Lighting, by John Griffiths, author of eight other books, among them Modern Iceland and The Science of Winning Squash. Conversely, some of the business books were almost certainly doomed from the moment someone in marketing approved or composed the title: eg, Wages and Unemployment: A Study in Non-Walrasian Macroeconomics, the initial chapters of which 'examine short-run macroeconomic equilibrium with nominal rigidities within the framework of fix-price temporary equilibria' and the concluding, or crescendo, chapters of which go on from there. This being the FT, no one dared pay Pounds 1 for Bernard Arcand's The Jaguar and the Anteater: Pornography Degree Zero, Arcand's concern, according to the dust-jacket, being to 'elucidate the ways in which pornography is a mirror of our modernity'. Nor were there any takers - this was more surprising - for Talking Tough: The Fight for Masculinity, by Carol Lee, which 'sheds much-needed light on the gulf between society's notions of maleness and young men's pursuit of male identity.' There were numerous rejected novels, including Vurt, by Jeff Noon, published by Ringpull Press, set in near-future Manchester and starting like this: 'Mandy came out of the all-night Vurt-U-Want, clutching a bag of goodies. Close by was a genuine dog, flesh and blood mix; the kind you don't see any more. A real collector's item. It was tethered to the post of a street sign. The Sign read NO GO. Slumped under the sign was a robo-crusty. He had a thick headful of droidlocks and a dirty handwritten sign - 'hungry n homeless. please help'.' Made wretched by their abandonment, I have purchased each of these titles, plus several more. Now I am wrapping them up. When it is dark tonight I shall wander London's streets delivering them to certain people. They know who they are. I have got a little list.</p>

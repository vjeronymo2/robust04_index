			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Allied-Lyons seeks to acquire off-licence chain Allied-Lyons, the drinks, food and retailing group, is negotiating to buy the Augustus Barnett chain of almost 600 off-licences from Bass, the UK's largest brewer, writes Philip Rawstorne. Analysts estimate the deal to be worth about Pounds 40m. The deal would greatly improve Allied's position in the Pounds 4.9bn take-home drinks market, recovering much of the ground lost to Whitbread after its Pounds 50m acquisition of GrandMet's Peter Dominic chain two months ago. That purchase reinforced Whitbread's market leadership, adding 667 Dominic outlets to the 993 Thresher shops which it already owned. Allied, which owns the near 1,000-strong Victoria Wine off-licence chain, would again run a close second to Whitbread if it acquired Augustus Barnett.</p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Crackdown on easy cash for Japan's big spenders JAPAN'S commercial banks are about to cramp the style of the country's big spenders by limiting withdrawals from cash dispensers. The move will be a blow to those who are coy about using credit cards, and debt-collecting gangsters who generally do not accept them. The country's leading 11 commercial banks have agreed in principle to impose a daily limit of Y2m (Pounds 12,900) on their machines, still very large by international standards. The proposed new ceiling is a response to rising bank card fraud and concern that small banks could be threatened if customers continue to enjoy unlimited access to cash. In contrast to the standard Pounds 200 withdrawal limit from British cash machines, at present the only limit on the largesse of Japanese dispensers is often the size of your bank account, or your overdraft facility. Some banks currently have a daily limit of Y5m, while others have no limit. The Y2m ceiling will be an inconvenience in a country that runs on large-denomination notes. When a provincial governor was arrested several weeks ago for alleged bribe-taking, prosecutors claimed he was given Y30m cash in a shopping bag. Mr Shin Kanemaru, the fallen godfather of Japanese politics now on trial for alleged tax evasion, has said he often received large amounts of cash from construction companies or 'loyal supporters'. Prosecutors found millions of yen in his bedroom. Police believe bank dispenser machines are used by companies giving politicians large donations because they do not have to deal directly with bank staff. Japanese bankers fear that a bank failure could prompt depositors to rush to another institution's automated teller to withdraw funds. Banks bruised by the sharp fall in asset values in Japan over the past three years are increasingly fragile because of the continuing downturn in the economy, particularly in regional areas. Regional banks are linked to a 90,000-machine automated teller system, which has a day-after settlement policy exposing all banks to a run on a weaker bank. One Japanese bank said: 'We want people to have enough cash, but we also trying to improve our risk management.' The Ministry of Finance says no bank will fail. However, without intervention by the ministry and the Bank of Japan, three small institutions would have collapsed in the past year. The new limits indicate that even Japanese banks are conceding that the country's banking system is vulnerable to failure. The move to limit withdrawals is also in response to a 44.7 per cent rise in reported offences involving cards, credit and cash in the past two years. 'We don't want to inconvenience people who like cash, but changes in Japanese society and in the banking system have made it necessary for us to think about new limits,' a bank manager said.

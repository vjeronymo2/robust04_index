			<p>BFN     [Text] India is taking steps to allay US concerns over the  lack of adequate intellectual property rights (IPR) protections,  according to Naresh Chandra, senior adviser to the Prime  Minister and former Cabinet Secretary.    Giving the keynote speech at the beginning of a two-day  seminar on "Technology transfer and other joint venture  opportunities in the new India" here, Mr Chandra noted the  hurdles created in many sensitive areas while concluding  agreements on transfer of technology between the two countries.    "Strong opinions have been expressed from both sides and the  provisions in the GATT agreement pertaining to the patent system  have caused acrimonious debate," conceded Mr Chandra at the  meeting which was organised by Business Development Associates.    However, consequent to the agreement signed on December 15  last year in Marrakech, "India will be introducing necessary  amendments to the Indian Patent Act of 1970," Mr Chandra said,  echoing the Prime Minister's assurances to US Commerce Secretary  Ron Brown and US Trade Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor.    A little over a month ago, India, along with China and  Argentina, got a reprieve of 60 days from the USTR to improve  its patent and copyright laws. Otherwise, it was in danger of  being listed as a Special 301 country, one that was not meeting  the conditions of trade laid down in the US Trade Act.    The Patent Act amendment, Mr Chandra said, would increase  the  period of protection from seven years to 14 years in the case of  pharmaceuticals and processed foods and 20 years in other cases.    He stressed that New Delhi had traditionally been cognisant  of the need to protect IPR, a view strongly disputed by  Washington's senior officials.    The Copyright Act was also being amended for the protection  of performers, sound recorders and broadcasting organisations.  Furthermore, trade marks, trade secrets and industrial designs  were protected under laws conforming to international standards,  Mr Chandra insisted.    "Apprehensions with regard to protection of IPR and  infringements of patents and copyright have been exaggerated in  the past," he said.    N Vittal, Secretary, Telecommunications, was also invited to  the meetings, but was unable to attend because of preoccupations.</p>

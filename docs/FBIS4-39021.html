			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Nikolay Geronin] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 6 TASS -- A high-ranking Russian foreign  ministry official hinted on Monday that Russia may not support  sanctions against North Korea if they are imposed by the United  States, Japan and South Korea without a UN approval.    "Russia, as well as China, has major trade and economic  interests in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. That is  why Moscow will take into consideration its economic interests  in relations with the DPRK while working out its position  towards trilateral sanctions against Pyongyang", the official  told TASS on Monday.    However, he added that the common goal of Russia and other  states is to ensure the nuclear-free status of the Korean  peninsula and make North Korea observe the nuclear  non-proliferation regime.    The official reiterated the position voiced by President  Boris Yeltsin that Russia stands for a gradual approach to  sanctions against Pyongyang and said all other measures are to  be used first. "Moscow believes that it is necessary to try and  use all possible political measures without infringing on the  interests of the sides", the official stressed.    He recalled the proposal of the Russian president to convene  an international conference on security and nuclear-free status  of the Korean peninsula. "This proposal does not mean that  other variants of the settlement are brushed aside", he added.</p>

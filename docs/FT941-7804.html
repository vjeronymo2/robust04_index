			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Green sheen on Whitehall machine: Bronwen Maddox questions the depth of the UK government's environmental commitment The sight of green campaigners being dragged away last week from bulldozers clearing a path for a motorway link in Wanstead, east London, can have done little to enhance the UK government's efforts to build an environmentally friendly image. Only a month earlier, Mr John Major, the prime minister, personally launched a set of policies for protecting the environment with an appeal to 'individual citizens' to change their way of life. Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, recently attacked the encroachment of 'urban sprawl' on the countryside and the construction of shopping malls outside towns. On Monday he called for tighter protection for green belts - the countryside encircling large towns, where development is strictly controlled. This level of activity is in sharp contrast to the government's low-key approach to environmental issues last year. Mr Gummer's predecessor, Mr Michael Howard, was forthright in saying last summer that recession had pushed the environment down the political agenda. The government's attitude is now more vigorous. 'There is no question that Mr Gummer is giving countryside and conservation issues a lot of emphasis,' says Mr Jim Turner of the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors, whose members carry out much of the construction work causing Mr Gummer concern. The government's change of tone prompts several questions: why is it now paying greenery so much attention, and how deep is its environmental commitment? Was last week's 'Battle of Wanstonia', as the media dubbed it, an indication that government policy puts construction ahead of the environment, or an unfortunately timed exception? Part of the answer to the first question is Mr Gummer's own greenness. He has adopted an evangelical approach to environmentalism, exhorting people to switch off their lights when they leave the room, walk short distances rather than drive, and put only one cup of water in the kettle. He describes the quest for 'sustainable development' - preserving the natural world for future generations - as 'the most important task of the environment department'. He says this is more pressing even than the thorny question of local government reorganisation, which also falls into his portfolio. 'There is so much to do to achieve sustainable development, and so many people to convince, it can't be put off,' he says. Comments like this have won him support in the green movement, normally critical of environment secretaries. According to Mr Ben Plowden of the Council for the Protection of Rural England: 'Mr Gummer has introduced a welcome note of plain language to the debate, and I think he appears to be genuinely committed to these issues.' A second reason for the flurry of activity lies simply in the momentum that bureaucracy has acquired, environment department officials point out. The UK committed itself at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit to produce a series of detailed reports setting out its strategy on a wide range of issues. The work has occupied dozens of environment department staff. Ministers say, too, that the department is currently free for the first time in months from introducing large-scale primary legislation, allowing them to spend more time on developing the details of green policy. A third reason for this year's burst of greenery, some critics suggest, is the local government and European Parliament elections in May and June. The last European elections, in 1989, saw the Green party grab 15 per cent of the vote, eclipsing the Social Democrat-Liberal alliance. Backbench Tories are increasingly worried that the countryside and conservation are sensitive issues which could surface in the southern constituencies which are traditional Conservative heartlands. Conservative MPs are concerned that conservation efforts are threatened by present transport policies, notably the Pounds 23bn road-building programme. Sir Geoffrey Pattie, Conservative MP for Chertsey and Walton, one of the constituencies affected by the widening of the M25 motorway encircling London, says: 'It is difficult to say how the issue will affect local elections, but when I raise the M25 standard a lot of people flock to me.' He has organised a group of about a dozen MPs to question the need for the road-building programme. The engineering contractors' federation has run repeated tests of backbench opinion and found 'a very big change in level of support for the road programme', according to Mr Turner. Until the middle of last year, 40 per cent of MPs surveyed said infrastructure spending plans were 'inadequate', but that figure has halved. More MPs now consider spending to be sufficient. Rising concern about conservation among MPs and the public provide an opportunity for the Labour party to go on the attack in the upcoming election battles. Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment spokesman, says: 'People are getting more worried about pollution and destruction of countryside. We will be wanting to make these an issue in the elections this spring.' Mr Gummer himself acknowledges that the environment is likely to be an important issue in both sets of elections, although he calls it 'a constant, underlying consideration for people' rather than one of their most pressing concerns. Critics of the government's environment policy argue that its recent green pronouncements are superficial. And if the government is greening its policies specifically with the spring elections in mind, they add, voters will see through the surface presentations to underlying contradictions in policy. The best example of conflict, critics suggest, is that the government appears repeatedly to put roads ahead of the environment. There are likely to be more 'Wanstonias' staged by green activists, they claim. As well as approval for the widening of the M25, the past year has also seen the start of construction of the motorway through Twyford Down in Hampshire. The scrapping of proposals for a highway through Oxleas Wood in south-east London remains one of the environmental campaigners' few successes. According to Sir Geoffrey Pattie: 'We must be getting close to some kind of embarrassment point - Mr Major came out with this great spiel about sustainable development, yet if you put the microscope over some of those paragraphs they don't sit too well with transport policies.' On a broader front, environmental pressure groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, together with opposition MPs, feel that the UK's environment policy contains other anomalies. They have attacked the UK's attempt to persuade the European Commission to give it more time to comply with expensive water standards. Mr Chris Smith says: 'European directives are the only reason we have proper protection on drinking water - if the government were deliberately targeting the green vote, it would not be trying to get drinking water standards revised.' Environmentalists also feel betrayed by the licensing of the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant, last year's most controversial environmental issue. They saw it as an indication that the government values industrial profit above environmental concerns. Mr Gummer's response to such criticisms is that it is always difficult to reconcile environmental initiatives with other priorities. 'We no longer intend to satisfy all the demand for roads that people's use of cars will cause,' he says, but adds: 'There is no question that in some cases we need more roads.' He sees negotiation of these compromises as an inescapable part of his job. But he will find it hard to remove a widespread perception that the government has not yet matched its green words with green action. The extent to which people care about this gap will be tested in the spring elections.</p>

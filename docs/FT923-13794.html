			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Costain share sale triggers fall in price to lowest for 16 years COSTAIN, the troubled British construction group, yesterday denied it was having difficulties with its bankers after the company's share price slipped to its lowest level since 1976. The shares fell by 8p to close at 30 1/2 p last night compared with 220p just 16 months ago and a peak of 366p in autumn 1987. The latest slide appears to have been prompted by the sale of a large tranche of about 400,000 shares through the London arm of a large US investment bank. At one point Costain's share price fell to 29p yesterday, the lowest it has been since December 1976. The fall led to increased speculation in the market about the state of the group's finances prompting the denial that Costain was in problems with its bankers. Mr Tom Slee, finance director, said: 'We continue to have very amicable relations with our banker and nothing has happened to change this.' Costain, in a bid to reduce its borrowings, announced at the end of last month that it would be selling a stake in its profitable Australian coal mining subsidiary which it intended to float later this year. Mr Slee said last night that a statement giving further details of the flotation was expected in the next two to three weeks. Costain failed to pay a final dividend after making a pre-tax loss last year of Pounds 69.2m. It sold its British investment property portfolio in December for Pounds 101.3m in an earlier move to reduce borrowings. Net debt at the end of last year had fallen by Pounds 143m to Pounds 168m reducing gearing from more than 100 per cent to 53 per cent. The figures, however, excluded Pounds 52m of off-balance sheet debt on the proposed Spitalfields office development in east London and Pounds 38m of convertible preference shares. Mr Slee said that borrowings, which normally increase during the first half of the year, had risen to Pounds 208m by the end of June. This was Pounds 20m less than had been expected. The increase was also lower than at the same stage last year. This was before taking any account of proceeds from the Australian flotation.</p>

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / France (4): Jean Peyrelevade THERE is a story that when Mr Jean Peyrelevade swapped his lucrative post as head of Banque Stern in Paris for the chairmanship of Union des Assurances de Paris he swallowed a salary cut of 80 per cent. It was almost certainly worthwhile. UAP is the biggest of the big French insurers and one of the most powerful shareholders in French industry. As chairman, Mr Peyrelevade, the son of a Marseilles schoolteacher, holds one of the most powerful posts in French finance. He owes his position both to his brains and to his political contacts. Mr Pierre Mauroy, an old friend, made him assistant director of his private office as soon as he became prime minister. Mr Peyrelevade is the archetype of that peculiarly French phenomenon - the cerebral socialist financier. After the premier's office came the chair of Compagnie de Suez, one of France's most powerful industrial and financial groups, followed by a lucrative stint in the private sector, as chairman of Banque Stern, while the socialists were out of power between 1986 and 1988. When the socialists returned, so did Mr Peyrelevade to rule the roost over French finance from UAP's opulent offices overlooking Place Vendome. AR</p>

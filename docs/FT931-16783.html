			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Graduate commitment 'weak' GRADUATE recruits are more likely to quit their jobs if they think their colleagues are incompetent, delegates at the annual conference of the occupational psychology section of the British Psychological Society in Brighton were told yesterday. Researchers at Manchester School of Management surveyed 580 graduates in their first four years of work in eight different organisations, returning a year later to study the same sample. The study tested the effect of a range of different work experiences on graduates' intentions to leave and their commitment to their new employers. It found that most graduates, while not actively thinking of leaving, have only a 'lukewarm' commitment to their companies. A total of 50 graduates, including 24 from one company, left their jobs over the year. Graduates generally have good relationships with their colleagues, but 'encounters with unproductive and ineffective people in the organisation . . . did tend to predict high intention to leave'. Pay is less important than uncertainty about career paths and limited opportunities for developing skills in prompting a graduate trainee to leave. Most graduates are satisfied with their opportunities for skill development, but feel they lack clear information about career paths. The project's director, Dr John Arnold, said graduates might be asking the impossible: 'In the current times of change, job titles appear and disappear with amazing rapidity - even their bosses don't know where they are going to be in two years' time.' Graduates usually enjoy a year-long 'honeymoon' in their posts, Dr Arnold said. Responsibility, working on prestige projects, relationships with senior staff, feedback and the success of the company have a limited impact on graduates' decisions to leave their jobs.</p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET LAWMAKERS OK NEW BANKING SYSTEM;  </P> <P> ECONOMICS: PROPOSED LAWS, MODELED ON THE WEST, WOULD STRIP THE STATE'S CONTROL  OVER MONETARY POLICY.  </P> <P> Soviet lawmakers gave approval in principle Tuesday to a new Western-style  banking system, breaking the decades-old state stranglehold on everything from  money supply to family savings accounts.  </P> <P> The new banking laws, expected to take effect by next year, would strip the  government of its control over monetary policy and allot the national bank a  role similar to that of the Federal Reserve System in the United States, with  powers to issue money and set interest rates.  </P> <P> The legislation also would shore up the myriad commercial banks just beginning  to appear here now that communism is yielding to capitalism; no one talks, even  theoretically, about old Marxist dreams of doing away with money altogether.  </P> <P> With billions of extra rubles clogging the Soviet economy and many of the  country's 15 constituent republics fighting to issue their own money, "the  (national) bank should be central and it should be tough," said Victor V.  Gerashchenko, the Soviet Union's current chief banker.  </P> <P> "It should have one currency and one policy," he told reporters, although the  new system also would give the republics' banks virtual independence on  everything except currency and issuing money.  </P> <P> Initial approval by the Supreme Soviet, the country's legislature, for the  revamped banking system is the Soviet Union's latest lurching move away from  central planning and toward a market-driven economy.  </P> <P> The proposed new banking system, Supreme Soviet spokesman Arkady A. Maslennikov  said, "is the first practical step toward dismantling the  command-administrative system," as the old economic system is known.  </P> <P> Unable so far to forge a unified plan for radical economic reform, President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev has begun bringing in changes piecemeal and, recently, by  decree. He has ordered the latest compromise version of an overall reform  program -- the eighth -- to be ready by Monday.  </P> <P> The parliament of the vast Russian Federation, under the leadership of the  outspoken reformer Boris N. Yeltsin, voted Tuesday to introduce its own, more  radical economic reform plan Nov. 1.  </P> <P> Russian Premier Ivan S. Silayev warned the Kremlin not to get in the program's  way.  </P> <P> "If our program is not adopted, we will need other measures, right up to  extreme ones, to secure it," he said, without specifying what action his  government might take.  </P> <P> The rebellious Russian republic brought on a major clash with the Kremlin this  summer when it asserted control over all its own banking institutions,  including its gold reserves. Gorbachev declared the action illegal, and the  Russian government backed down; Yeltsin and Gorbachev later met and agreed to  prevent such crises in the future.  </P> <P> Gerashchenko said bank officials are trying to prevent the state bank from  becoming a political pawn in such struggles between the republics and Moscow  and to make it an independent, stabilizing force.  </P> <P> "We're trying to say, 'Nobody should give commands to the bank,' " he said.  </P> <P> Gerashchenko said Gorbachev's next economic decree, which has been disclosed  but not yet formally issued, will lower the official value of the ruble from  about $1.60 to 50 cents in commercial transactions. The new exchange rate will  apply primarily to the sales and purchases by Soviet firms engaged in foreign  trade.  </P> <P> According to the proposed banking laws, the new central bank also would license  commercial banks, which now number more than 100, to engage in foreign-exchange  deals, which until now had been the exclusive right of state banks.  </P> <P> In its present form, the central bank, known as Gosudarstvenny Bank or Gosbank,  controlled virtually every financial transaction in the Soviet economy.  </P> <P> It channeled all taxes to the government, parceled out government funds to  recipients and oversaw savings accounts and loans.  </P> <P> But it was also part of the government and subservient to the Council of  Ministers. When government agencies overspent their budget, the bank was  generally ordered to use its resources -- in effect, channeling savers' money  -- to cover the deficits; when that was impossible, it issued more money.  </P> <P> In the future, the bank will only answer to the Supreme Soviet, and the Council  of Ministers will no longer be able to subsidize government operations from the  bank's funds. The strong representation of the 15 republics on its board will  give the bank a new federal character as well.  </P></p>

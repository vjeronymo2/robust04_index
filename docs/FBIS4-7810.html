			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dan Andronic: "The Former Head of the </F> Counterespionage Division Discovered Where the SRI's Money Is  Going"]    [Text] Despite the fact that several weeks have elapsed  since the spectacular dismissal of Major General Gheorghe  Diaconescu, the head of the SRI [Romanian Intelligence Service]  Counterespionage Division, the sole explanation given by Major  General Virgil Magureanu, the SRI director, was the lack of  professionalism of the deposed official. That accusation seems  to be childish, to say the least, considering that Major General  Gheorghe Diaconescu worked in the field of counterespionage for  decades and he was one of the fundamental members of the famous  anti-KGB unit titled UM 0110.    Owing to the lack of openness of the SRI, we have to rely on  other information to complete the picture of Major General  Gheorghe Diaconescu's dismissal from his office as head of the  SRI Counterespionage Division. According to such information,  while investigating a number of cases in which foreign citizens  were involved -- a task that was among his duties -- Major  General Gheorghe Diaconescu stumbled across certain firms in  which persons belonging to the SRI leadership, such as Major  General Virgil Magureanu, the SRI director, and Major General  Victor Marcu, the deputy SRI director, were also involved.    The famous filing box that was sealed [following  Diaconescu's  dismissal] by Major General Popa Ulpiu Cherecheanu, deputy  general prosecutor, contains -- or contained -- files containing  operative information, photographs, and audio and video  cassettes proving the involvement of others, apart from the  aforementioned persons in arms trafficking and other, not too  clean deals. It is worth mentioning that the profit obtained  from such deals is not to be found on SRI bank accounts, but  rather on those of certain persons holding important state  offices.    Details later.</p>

			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: New warrants launched TWO NEW warrant issues reflect increasing activity in emerging market debt derivatives, writes Tracy Corrigan. Societe Generale launched an innovative issue of 400 'down-and-out' call warrants on Vnesheconombank's US dollar-denominated syndicated loans. The warrants expire if the value of the loans falls below a pre-determined level on or before the exercise date of July 22 1994, which is also the expiry date. Salomon Bros issued 1,200 call warrants on a basket of emerging market debt comprising Republic of Argentina collateralised fixed-rate bonds due 2023, Republic of Brazil IDU bonds due 2001, Republic of Nigeria par bonds due 2020 and Republic of Venezuela collateralised fixed-rate bonds due 2020.</p>

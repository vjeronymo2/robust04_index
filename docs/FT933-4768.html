			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Minor setback for higher-yielding European sector HIGHER-yielding European bond markets suffered a minor setback yesterday, after enjoying a period of strength, while France and Germany benefitted from the re-evaluation. Markets proved somewhat volatile without the anchor of the US Treasury market, which was closed due to the Labor Day holiday in the US. SPANISH bond prices slid  5/8 of a point, as investors began to wonder whether the market's month-long rally had been overdone. Italian bonds also suffered, but regained some ground as the lira recovered to end only  1/4 point lower. GERMAN 10-year bonds rose about  1/4 point in moderate turnover, boosted by the D-Mark's continuing strength on the foreign exchanges, which spurred further buying from foreign investors. The mark's continuing ascent also had some market participants betting on another near-term cut in key interest rates by the Deutsche Bundesbank, whose Central Bank Council is to meet Thursday. The release of stronger than expected orders data did not dent the market's bullish sentiment although they could be seen as an indication that the economy is poised for recovery, said one trader. Western German manufacturing orders rose 3.2 per cent in July from June, contrary to forecasts of a small decline. The Bundesbank's minor downward revision of July M3 money supply growth to 7.4% from 7.5% had little impact on bond prices. With August M3 expected to have grown significantly due to heavy currency intervention, the July revision was of relatively little importance, said a Frankfurt trader. In the futures market, the September Bund future on Liffe closed at 98.77, up 0.20 points from Friday. IN THE French bond market, the 10-year sector put on the strongest performance, with the Matif's 10-year bond future rising about  1/2 a point. The gains were partly due to technical buying after the bond future breached resistance around 123.20. But some were also attributed to short-covering by players who felt that last week's sell-off had been overdone. Market sentiment remained bullish, underpinned by hopes of French rate cuts in the not too distant future. Still, the Bank of France's decision to leave money-market rates steady did not damp prices as no rate cut had been expected as early as yesterday. The very long end of the French bond market remained soggy, however, after it dropped sharply Friday on heavy selling by a large US investor, said a trader in London. Added to last week's issue of new 30-year bonds, that weighed on the long end, causing the yield curve to steepen, he said. GILT PRICES fell  1/4 point during the morning session, on the back of a strong rise in car sales, then traded unchanged for much of the rest of the day. Suggestions of inflationary pressure stemming from economic recovery fuelled interest in the index-linked sector, encouraging the Bank of England to issue another Pounds 400m tranche of index-linked paper. The December long gilt future on Liffe ended  9/32 lower. THE JAPANESE government bond market gained about  1/4 point, as expectations of an interest rate cut mounted. Three-month certificate of deposit rates hit record lows of 2.65 per cent, suggesting that the market expects an interest rate cut imminently.</p>

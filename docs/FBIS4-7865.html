			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky by </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "Geza  Jeszenszky on the Interrupted Speech -- One Should Condemn Both  Fallow Ideas"]    [Text] Geza Jeszenszky interrupted his speech at the  international conference on the Holocaust in Hungary because  some of the participants began clapping their hands and stamping  their feet to express their dislike for his lecture. According  to our information, the initiator of the provocative action that  interrupted Geza Jeszenszky's speech was a member of one of the  research groups of the Eotvos Loramt Science University. We  asked Jeszenszky's opinion about the incident.    [Jeszenszky] When I said, also referring to Jozsef Antall,  that Nazism and Communism are equally responsible for the death  of millions of innocent people and that these two "fallow ideas"  must be condemned together, for a moment I thought that the  clapping and the noise were signs of agreement; only later did I  realize that the opposite was true, namely that the people  making the noise wanted to stop me from finishing my speech.  Evaluating the "patience" of the back seats, I did not finish  my speech.    [PESTI HIRLAP] Mr Jeszenszky! According to our information,  it was not planned that you would deliver a speech at the  conference.    [Jeszenszky] That is true. The official greeting speeches,  and especially Chief Rabbi Jozsef Schweitzer's words inspired me  to deliver a greeting speech. Jozsef Schweitzer expressed his  hope that the conference would serve the truth and the need for  spiritual peace. I found this justified also because, in my  opinion, it is very important for the new generation to learn  the history and causes of the black year of 1944, because new  genocides are taking place today, and the silent forms of ethnic  cleansing have been known in the Carpathian Basin for 75 years.    [PESTI HIRLAP] What was the main idea of your speech?    [Jeszenszky] I drew the attention to the fact that the  tragedy of the Hungarian Jews had widespread and broad causes,  just like the causes of World War I, namely that there were  quite a lot of people responsible, but some people are more  responsible than others. I also said that the Hungarian  Government, one that is usually called a government of  historians and in which unfortunately there is one historian  less today, continues to be led by the spirit and evaluation of  1944 expressed by Istvan Bibo in his study on the Jewish  question written in 1948.    [PESTI HIRLAP] In your opinion, what led to the Holocaust in  Hungary?    [Jeszenszky] Among the causes of events that took place in  1944, one should definitely list World War I and the subsequent  unjust settlement and the wave of terror in 1919. One should  also consider the responsibility of the policy of the  neighboring countries and of the great powers. One should not  mix the Jewish victims with the army losses, but I find it  necessary to also remember the similar size of other victims, in  addition to the losses of the Hungarian nation through the death  of Jewish citizens. One should not forget that it was Nazism  that made it possible for Bolshevism to spread in Hungary and  that liberation from Nazi occupation and the Arrow Cross rule  was also the beginning of a new terrible dictatorship of several  decades. One should strongly condemn the "Jewish laws" in  Hungary and the anti-Semitic incitement of those years, but  there would have been no deportations and genocide without  German occupation, and Hungary would have received a good mark  for its humanity. There were guilty people in Hungary who  received due punishment, and other guilty people escaped  punishment, probably by joining the Communist Party, but the  Hungarian nation is not a guilty nation.</p>

Engelen Commentary: "Waigel's Home Match"] </F>   [Text] The contrast could hardly have been any sharper: In  Kronberg last Saturday [26 February], the finance ministers and  central bank heads of the seven leading industrial nations were  discussing the state of the reform process in the center of the  former Soviet Union with a high-level Russian government  delegation. At the same time, in Moscow, prominent coup leaders  were leaving prison, cheered by old communists and  ultranationalists.    The release of the coup leaders and the expected further  strengthening of Russian forces opposed to reforms following  therefrom are making it increasingly doubtful whether the  concept of help for self-help that was developed at the Munich  1992 summit and further detailed at the Tokyo 1993 summit, can  remain valid. The meeting of the Group of Seven finance  ministers that was chaired by Finance Minister Theo Waigel and  focused on Russia -- quite expectedly -- did not find an answer  to this question, either for Russia or for the world. The  promises by the ministers flown in from Moscow saying that  monthly inflation will remain below 10 percent this year and the  budget deficit will be cut to 5 percent of the GNP, did not make  any change to that.    But by publishing its nine-item declaration the Group of  Seven -- plus the head of the International Monetary Fund and  the Deputy Heads of the World Bank and the European Union --  once again made it clear: The Western industrial nations will  continue supporting the economic reform process in Russia as  long as the necessary preconditions are met.    Since only a fraction of the billion-dollar aid packages  granted so far has actually been effected to date as a result of  the out-of-control inflation rate and public finances, the  providing of additional financial means could not be a topic at  Kronberg. But the Round of Seven -- after comprehensive  consultations with the Russian Government -- emphasized a new  line at Kronberg: to help develop a credible program for social  support of the reform process. In fact, the West could do very  much in this respect, not only through international  institutions such as the World Bank, but also in the form of  bilateral aid.    Although Russia's reform crisis was at the center of the  Kronberg meeting, the German hosts had to make a considerable  effort to contain -- at least for the conference weekend -- the  tensions between Washington and Tokyo that were triggered by  better access to the Japanese market. An open confrontation  between Japanese and Americans would have made the Germans look  bad. But as chief coordinator of the West's aid for Russia and  as proclaimer of a brightening world economy -- including a  better economic outlook in Germany -- the strained Bonn  treasurer Theo Waigel, at the beginning of the super election  year, managed to enter the small Kronberg G-7 summit in his  books as a successful home match.</p>

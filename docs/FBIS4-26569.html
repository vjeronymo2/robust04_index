			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 23 (CNA) -- Taiwan's trade deficit  with Europe reached an all-time high of US$959 million during  the first five months of this year, according to statistics  released by the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) Thursday [23 June].    BOFT officials attributed the surging deficit to the  lessened  competitiveness of made-in-Taiwan products on the European  market.    During the January-May period, Taiwan's exports to Europe  totaled US$5.335 billion, a decline of 5.6 percent from the  first five months of 1993. Imports totaled US$6.294 billion, an  increase of 10.7 percent, the officials said.    Among the European countries, Germany remained Taiwan's  leading trade partner, accounting for 27.5 percent of Taiwan's  total bilateral trade with Europe.    Despite the gradually recovering economy in Europe, Taiwan's  capital-intensive industries have had trouble penetrating the  European market, an indication that industrial upgrading here  has not yet helped the competitiveness of Taiwan products  overseas.    Taiwan's exports to Europe are mainly information products,  electronic machinery components, bicycles, plastic products, and  sports equipment.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Observer: All rounder What a difference a decade makes. Remember Gilles Loiselle, the Quebec agent-general in London in the early 1980s, who used to champion the case for his province breaking away from the rest of Canada? Well, the former separatist has now popped up as finance minister for all of Canada in Kim Campbell's new cabinet. Before entering politics, Loiselle was a TV reporter in Montreal and one of his last assignments was to cover Charles de Gaulle's famous Vive le Quebec Libre outburst in 1967. How Loiselle came to be converted to the federalist cause remains a bit of a mystery. But he does have experience of one country torn apart by civil strife, having spent most of his 20s teaching in Ethiopia - where, incidentally, he became fluent in Amharic and Italian. His name might not be known in the world's banking parlours, but he could be just the man to organise the next international aid effort to Ethiopia, should the need arise.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Survey of Spain (8): Jobs no longer for life / Examining the labour reform package Changes in Spain's notoriously rigid labour laws to ease the hiring and firing of workers are due to take effect in a few weeks - to the distress of trade unions and the partial satisfaction of employers. The first part of the controversial labour reform package - the introduction of low-wage apprenticeship contracts - is already in place. In contrast to France, where violent protests forced the conservative Balladur government to withdraw its similar 'professional insertion contract' scheme, Spain's Socialist government has pressed ahead. More than 70,000 young people have signed up for the new contracts since the plan was approved in December. Attempts to negotiate with unions on the changes, which include loosening administrative restrictions on redundancies, broke down last year, prompting a partly-successful 24-hour general strike in January. But the government, having limited the scope of its reforms to what it judged politically possible for now, has stuck to its guns. The remainder of the planned changes are due to come into force within the next few days. The reforms mainly involve: Apprenticeship contracts for people between the ages of 16 and 25, starting at 70 per cent of the statutory minimum wage and lasting between six months and three years; An end to the monopoly held by the National Employment Institute (INEM) as job placement agency, making way for private firms; Significant amendments to the 1980 Workers' Statute, the main plank of current labour legislation, making it easier to move employees and, to some extent, to lay them off. The jobs-for-life mentality is deeply engrained in Spain. The Franco dictatorship offered no right to strike or free collective bargaining, but Spaniards became accustomed to security of employment. The 1980 labour legislation, following a period of militancy by unions legalised after Franco's death in 1975, combined new rights with a legacy from the past of heavy state intervention in labour relations. A significant measure of flexibility was brought into the labour market 10 years ago with provisions for fixed-term employment contracts. Until then, almost all Spanish employees were on permanent contracts. Now, according to Dr Simon Milner, a labour relations expert at the London School of Economics' Centre for Economic Performance, 30 per cent of Spanish workers are on a fixed-term basis, the highest proportion in Europe. This deregulation has enabled Spanish companies to adjust more quickly to changes in demand, especially in the private sector where the short-term contracts are most prevalent. These employees accounted for much of Spain's employment growth in the boom years of the late 1980s. However, they also tend to be the first to suffer in hard economic times. As a result, Dr Milner says, the proportion of permanent employees with highly protected jobs has recently been increasing. The amended Workers' Statute will make it easier for companies to move employees from one job to another or between different sites. It will also extend the scope for justifying collective redundancies, not just on economic or technological grounds as at present but also to meet the needs of reorganising production. Employers will have some leeway to make cuts - up to 30 employees or 10 per cent of the workforce for small companies in any three-month period - without having to go through the laborious process applied to 'collective' redundancies. Administrative redundancy procedures, now agonisingly slow, are to be speeded up. This in itself promises to reduce the cost of labour adjustments. However, there is as yet no plan to reduce the level of statutory redundancy payments. These now stand at up to 45 days of pay per year of service in cases where a court deems the redundancies to be unjustified. The minimum level is 20 days, but in practice companies will often opt to pay the higher amount to avoid having to continue pay salaries until the end of a court case. According to a European Commission study published last year, average severance pay in Spain amounted to about 45 weeks, a level equalled only by Italy and more than twice the average for other EU countries. Easing redundancies is a delicate task for a Socialist administration facing the highest unemployment in Europe - almost 24 per cent at the end of last year, according to the government's quarterly survey - and sometimes explosive reactions in regions affected by factory cutbacks. However, a study by the Argentaria banking group reckons that the reform package as a whole could knock four percentage points off the unemployment rate between now and 1998. The government hopes that the new work contracts will help to restrain wage costs and enable Spanish manufacturers to improve competitiveness without necessarily cutting their workforces. Business leaders criticise the scope of the reforms, the large amount of red tape remaining and the discretionary powers left in the hands of judges. Foreign companies may still be wary about the risks of embarking on new ventures. The current measures may not be the end of the story, although ministers are reluctant to talk in terms of a further reform in the near future. 'Multinationals know that this is something that cannot change from one day to another,' says one senior government official.</p>

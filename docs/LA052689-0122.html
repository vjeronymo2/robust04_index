			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME RESALE DECLINE REFLECTS INDUSTRY SLUMP  </P> <P> Sales of previously owned single-family homes fell 1.1% in April, reflecting an  industry slump caused by higher mortgage interest rates, the National Assn. of  Realtors said Thursday.  </P> <P> April resales slipped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.36 million  units, the slowest since February, 1988, when the rate was 3.32 million units.  The rate was down 4.3% from year-ago levels.  </P> <P> "Higher interest rates have stymied efforts of renters to become homeowners,"  said association President Ira Gribin. "First-time buyers, with no equity and a  tight budget, continue to be left behind, particularly in high-cost areas."  </P> <P> The national median price for a single-family home rose $1,500 to $93,500 last  month, up 6.3% from year-ago levels, the NAR said. The higher median price  reflects the purchase of more expensive homes by people less likely to feel the  pinch of higher mortgage costs, Gribin said.  </P> <P> The nation's benchmark mortgage rate ranged from 11.03% to 11.07% in April,  according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., the NAR said.  </P> <P> There were 2.64 million single-family homes on the market in April, a 9.4-month  housing supply. The NAR, the trade group of the real estate industry, forecasts  a boom in resales in the second half of 1989, sparked by a decline in interest  rates.  </P> <P> Regionally, the resales slump was led by a 7.5% decline in the West, which had  been enjoying brisk activity. The West had the sharpest median price increase,  19.5% from year-ago levels.  </P> <P> "It appears that higher rates have worked their way into the hottest markets,"  said NAR chief economist John Tuccillo.  </P> <P> Resales were flat in the South -- the region with the highest sales volume --  while the pace picked up in the Northeast and Midwest.  </P></p>

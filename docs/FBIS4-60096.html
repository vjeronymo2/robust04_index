			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] The following review of the 10 May issue  of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Lawyer Tortured to Death    2. Islamists Win Lawyers Election.    3. Anti-Islamic Quarters Behind Yemen's War    4. 4 May Day of Mourning for Palestine    5. Ban on Islamic Writer Blamed on President    6. Roots of Violence in Dayrut Analyzed    7. Mufti's Fatwa on Child Care Criticized    8. Security Men Kill Student in Asyut  <H5>  LAWYER TORTURED TO DEATH </H5>   An approximately 1,500-word report by Khalid Yunus on pages  1  and 7 describes the "state of anger and furor" that gripped  lawyers following the death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani  during "torture" at a State Security Intelligence office  following his arrest on 26 April. An emergency meeting of the  Lawyers Association Council on 7 May decided to report the  incident to the public attorney to order an autopsy on Madani's  body to determine the cause of death. In addition, the council  decided to "stage a sit-in at the association's headquarters  until an inquiry is opened and the names of the culprits  announced, to hold a funeral march for the martyr from the  association's building, to declare a one-day public strike at  every state court, and to pay a sum to the martyr's family in  compensation." A statement by the council warned that the crime  will not go unpunished. The Egyptian Human Rights Organization  has issued a statement expressing concern and regret at the  circumstances surrounding the death of its member, Madani. The  statement feared that the death could have been the result of  "torture" following his arrest. The organization gave its  account of how Madani was arrested at his office and of the  "illegal and repressive measures" used during the arrest. The  deceased, the statement noted, was blindfolded by security men  and taken to an unknown destination. After noting that his  colleagues confirmed that Madani had been in "good health," the  statement referred to its request to the public attorney on 7  May to set up an independent medical team to conduct an autopsy  on Madani's body.  <H5>  ISLAMISTS WIN LAWYERS ELECTION </H5>   An approximately 100-word unattributed report on page one  reports the victory of named Islamic candidates in elections to  fill half the seats of the Lawyers Association Council in  al-Jizah on 8 May. The turnout is said to have been over 75  percent.  <H5>  ANTI-ISLAMIC QUARTERS BEHIND YEMEN'S WAR </H5>   Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn, in a 2,500-word article on  page 3 entitled "The Desert Storm Reaches Yemen," views the war  in Yemen. Noting that the Gulf war was a "link in a chain to  rechart the map of the Arab region to confront the Islamic tide,  Husayn adds that the "Western camp and its advocates in the  region continue to reshape the region and finish off the  Arab-Islamic front that has rejected the foreign military  presence." After reviewing aspects of what is seen as a Western  onslaught on Islamic movements in Tunis, Algeria, Lebanon, and  Sudan, Husayn says: "Yemen is now paying the price of its  independence," because, the writer adds, it seems that the  United States "accepts nothing short of obedience, blind  obedience." After tracing the course of Yemen's unity and the  Islamists' participation in power through the alliance between  the General People's Congress and the Reform Party, Husayn  claims that as a result, Yemen became an "aberration" of the  U.S. order imposed on the region, in view of Yemen's  independence and the Islamists' participation in power, which  could lead them to win by a majority in any election and thus  rule the country singlehanded. As a result, he adds, the  Marxists of the south were encouraged by some Gulf quarters and  the United States to stiffen their position, even if it led to a  separation from the north. He adds: Dividing Yemen into two  states is the West's "ultimate goal."    Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Guide Mustafa Mashhur echoes the  same theme in part of his approximately 2,000-word article on  page 5. He asks: "What promoted south Yemen to conclude unity  with north Yemen four years ago? And why is it adopting this  stance today, a stance that could bring unity to an end?" He  adds: "We know there are quarters that want to fragment the  Arab and Islamic world and preclude any unity. These quarters  move other hands to stir sedition among the Arab peoples, as was  the case in Somalia, where thousands were killed and hundreds of  thousands were displaced."   <H5>    4 MAY DAY OF MOURNING FOR PALESTINE </H5>   Writer Muhammad Abu-al-Futuh, in an approximately 1,200-word  article on page 4 entitled "A Day of Mourning by Arabism And  Islam for Palestine", writes on the self-rule agreement signed  between the PLO and Israel in Cairo on 4 May. He notes that the  4 May agreement is not the choice of the Islamic people, who  believe that Palestine is Islamic and who have faith that jihad  is the way to liberate and restore it. He adds: "We must  realize that our enemy knows for certain that the threat to its  usurpation of Palestine comes from the pan-Arab current as well  as the rising Islamic tide, and that is why it is lying in wait  against these two forces."    Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Guide Mustafa Mashhur shares  Abu-al-Futuh's views in his article on page 5. He notes that  the Gaza-Jericho agreement has been depicted as a "historic  victory" for the PLO, whereas in fact it is an utter "disgrace,  shame, and humiliation." He points out that the record of the  "Zionist enemy" is replete with incidents against peace, so how  could there be peace between it and the Palestinian people? He  concludes by urging the current Muslim generations not to be  duped by the peace "festivals" aimed at giving legitimacy to the  "humiliating defeat" in this agreement. Palestine, he adds,  will remain alive in the hearts of every Muslim until it is  fully liberated and the al-Aqsa Mosque rescued from captivity.  <H5>  BAN ON ISLAMIC WRITER BLAMED ON PRESIDENT </H5>   In an approximately 600-word article on page 12, Muslim  Brotherhood member and writer Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus notes that  Islamic writer Fahmy Huwaydi's weekly articles in AL-AHRAM are  still banned. After noting that the ban shames the newspaper  itself and discredits the regime's claims that it does not ban  any writer or opinion, 'Abd-al-Quddus points out that a review  of some of the banned articles he has seen shows that the ban is  sheer injustice. One of the articles, he says, speaks about the  application of Islamic Shari'ah in Kuwait, in which the writer  cautioned against any hasty implementation of Islamic rulings  since this could be harmful to Islam. Another banned article,  'Abd-al-Quddus adds, notes the defeat of secularism in Turkey on  its home grounds at the hands of the Islamists. Defending  Huwaydi, the writer notes that the prominent Islamic writer is  accused of being extremist, but his views in defense of the  Copts and democracy attest to the contrary. He adds: "I believe  that banning his articles is not the responsibility of the chief  editor alone, since the owner of the newspaper has greater  responsibility--and by the owner I mean the head of state, who  owns AL-AHRAM as well as other government papers and who makes  appointments there." He notes that it is clear that "the  president of the republic does not encourage any talk about the  application of shari'ah in our country; in fact, the contrary is  definitely true. The prevailing tendency under the current  regime is to try to separate religion and the state." In  conclusion, the writer gives the following advice to the  president: "Beware of those who seek to deify you. They are  the ones responsible for 'Abd-al-Nasir and al-Sadat's drift.  Remember your first years in power, when you were very  sensitive to anything that could tarnish your image among the  people, rejected hypocrisy, and viewed your birthday as a  personal occasion and not an opportunity to glorify yourself."    Touching on the same topic, writer Midhat Abu-al-Fadl notes  in his approximately 1,500-word article on page 8 that there is  a "coordinated media campaign seeking to exclude moderate  Islamists from public work or to harass them, if possible. This  campaign is now focusing on the well-known Islamic writer Fahmi  Huwaydi." He notes that the secularists in charge of this  campaign use all means, legitimate and otherwise, to attain  their goals, which shows that to the secularists freedom of  opinion is nothing but a slogan. He cites as an example an  article by writer Dr. 'Abd-al-'Azim Ramadan published in the  magazine UKTUBAR on 1 May, in which Ramadan accused Huwaydi of  defending terrorism. After refuting Ramadan's claims,  Abu-al-Fadl says that Ramadan is inciting the authorities  against a man whose only fault is using his right of freedom of  speech.   <H5>    ROOTS OF VIOLENCE IN DAYRUT ANALYZED </H5>   An approximately 3,000-word report by Jamal Imbabi on page 6  views the situation in the city of Dayrut, with its violence  between security forces and Islamic groups. The writer  interviews several officials and citizens, who give opinions of  the roots of violence in the city, which is situated 60 km north  of Asyut. Former People's Assembly deputy Ahmad 'Abd-al-Rahim  believes that the ruling National Democratic Party has kept  itself busy with partisan affairs and left the way open to the  Islamic militants to build clinics, schools, and Koranic  recitation centers and to organize religious seminars. In the  absence of a state role, these groups helped the poor and  assisted students. Thanks to the political vacuum, many  accepted their beliefs, 'Abd-al-Rahim adds. Another former  People's Assembly member, Husam al-Kilani, attributes the spread  of these groups and the rise in violence to unemployment and a  deterioration in the standards of living. Teacher Ibrahim Zayid  blames the violence on police brutality and mistreatment of  people. The writer notes that despite the relative calm in the  city of Dayrut, security sources say that 13 senior members of  the group are still at large. According to the chief of  intelligence in Dayrut, once they are captured, 80 percent of  violence in the city will end, since it will be very hard for  the group to find similar experienced people.  <H5>  MUFTI'S FATWA ON CHILD CARE CRITICIZED </H5>   A 200-word report by 'Amir 'Abd-al-Mun'im on page 7  criticizes Shaykh Sayyid Tantawi, mufti of the republic, for  passing what the writer terms a "strange" fatwa, or religious  ruling. The mufti ruled that it is permissible for the state  "to enact a law withholding medical care and educational  benefits from the family's third child as part of its family  planning campaign." According to the mufti, "The officials in  charge may restrict what is permissible if the ruler and  officials see a need for this after consulting with the experts,  so long as the restriction serves the nation's interests."  <H5>  SECURITY MEN KILL STUDENT IN ASYUT </H5>   An unattributed report on page 7 notes that State Security  Intelligence men shot Amin Shafiq Hammam, a student in al-Azhar  University branch in Asyut, after having kidnapped him from his  room in the university dormitory on 25 April. A statement by  al-Azhar University students in Asyut notes that Hammam was  taken in a car to al-Walidiyah neighborhood, where shots were  heard. Next day, the students were surprised to read in the  papers that Hammam had been killed in a clash with security  forces and that he was found to be in possession of weapons and  explosives.</p>

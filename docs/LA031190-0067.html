			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR'S NOTE ON PRAYERS INSPIRES VARIED REACTION  </P> <P> In my opinion, Mayor Richard B. Edgar of Tustin is to be congratulated on his  forthright and just proposal concerning invocations at City Council meetings.  </P> <P> Being of no particular religious persuasion, I can understand why others like  myself or people of any but the Christian faith might feel left out or offended  with the numerous references to Jesus, etc., which seem to be customary in  invocations at most public gatherings.  </P> <P> Possibly a moment of silence and contemplation at the start of each meeting  would serve to create the desired atmosphere of seriousness and solemnity  without causing resentment on anyone's part. I think Mayor Edgar is to be  commended for his perception and sensitivity in this matter.  </P> <P> REBECCA F. McLEAN  </P> <P> Brea  </P></p>

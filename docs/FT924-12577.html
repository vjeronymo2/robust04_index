			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Letter: Stealing the Gatt initiative Sir, The current round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations has slipped from the news. But one imagines that the state of play will probably involve US complaints that a 'level playing field' is being spoiled by French farming subsidies. The US would probably prefer to see an end to unfair distortions with the French coming into line with international norms. The US could steal the initiative as a way out of this impasse were it to create a 'level playing field' by removing one of its own unfair distortions. This could be done charging its industrial and domestic users a price for gasoline that is in line with international norms (shall we say Dollars 3 a US gallon?). I am sure that following this modest gesture, all parties would be absolutely desperate to trade internationally on equal terms] Alan G Hallsworth, deputy director, SIRC, University of Portsmouth, Buckingham Building, Lion Terrace, Portsmouth PO1 3HE</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] President of the republic of Kosova  Dr. Ibrahim Rugova held a news conference in Prishtina today.  Let us go over to a telephone report by Skender Durmishi:    [Durmishi] At today's news conference, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova,  chairman of the republic of Kosova, asked the UN Security  Council to examine the question of repression in Kosova and to  demand, through a resolution, an international protectorate  there. Such a system of international protection, Rugova said,  would be a reward for the peaceful resistance of the Albanians  and would at the same time interrupt the intolerable police  repression in localities and villages of Kosova.    Rugova also informed reporters that this week, repression  and  other police actions, assuming the dimensions of a campaign,  have occurred in 23 communes and in hundreds of Kosovar  villages. As usual, this repression has been accompanied by  fierce brutality through arrests, destruction, violent  press-ganging, etc. At the same time, the persecution of  political activists and local government officials has  continued. Military movements have been observed in the region  of Gjakove, Prizren, Peje, and in Han i Elezit.    Presenting details and other data on the repression, the  president of Kosova said that in addition to the already known  motives, the aim of this repression is to instigate a backlash  against the violence and provocations among the Albanian  population, to which the Albanians have not succumbed.    Despite the repression, Dr. Rugova pointed out that this  week  Kosova is at the center of the international community's  attention. He greeted all the statements and other reactions,  demanding prevention of a conflict in Kosova.    Supporting the NATO attack on Serbian weapons in Bosnia, Dr.  Rugova asked for the destruction of the arms, being the main  cause of wars and tragedies in the region. He again reminded  reporters that the arms were obtained through the sweat of all  the peoples of Yugoslavia. Based on an approach with mystical  elements, as he called it, Rugova stressed that we do not  exclude the possibility that one day the arms will be turned  onto the Serbs themselves.    In the context of these political observations, Mr. Rugova  expressed the hope that Russia will manifest the proper  flexibility on the crisis in former Yugoslavia. Meanwhile, he  asked Greece for a more mature stance in conformity with the  rules of good-neighborliness.    At the end of the conference, Rugova suggested as a  preferred  form for a global and efficient solution the total pacification  of all the regions in former Yugoslavia because of the serious  threats for further expansion of the crisis and war in these  areas.    Condemning the demands of Serbian officials to close the  Soros Foundation and several world news agencies, Mr. Rugova  considered them as attempts to turn these areas into ghettos  with elements of an absurd confrontation with the world. He  thanked the commitment of the Soros Foundation and offered  further cooperation with this foundation as far as the  possibilities and the institutions of our system permitted.    President Rugova also repeated the demand that, as member of  the former Yugoslav Federation, Kosova should be granted the  right to secession, with all the rights and obligations deriving  from it. He also spoke of more intensive contacts with the UN  High Commission for Refugees to prevent Serbian attempts to  colonize Kosova.</p>

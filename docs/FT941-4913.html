			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Arts: Today's Television In today's 'Screen Two' drama well known actors (Richard Briers, Bernard Hill, Billie Whitelaw) star alongside disabled people. Skallagrigg, is adapted from the novel by William Horwood. The title refers to a mythical figure, the hero of stories told by disabled people in hospitals all over the country. Esther, a teenager born with cerebral palsy, undertakes a quest to find this character (9.00 BBC2). Dispatches reports on the case of Paul Grecian who was convicted of selling arms to Iraq in what sounds like a dress rehearsal for the Matrix Churchill scandal (9.00 C4). What is a trebuchet and why has Huw Kennedy been trying for 30 years to build one? According to the English dictionary it is a medieval siege engine using a balanced arm with a weight on one end to sling projectiles at town walls; rather like putting a kitten on a seesaw and dropping an elephant on the other end. My 1924 'Petit Larousse' has a tiny but detailed drawing which shows they were about five times the height of a man. Working Parts (9.45 C4) follows Kennedy's attempts to build one.</p>

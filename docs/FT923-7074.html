			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Barclays to raise capital in US BARCLAYS Bank is planning to raise Dollars 500m (Pounds 261m) of capital in the US using a new hybrid financial instrument which other UK banks are expected to imitate. The proposed issue, details of which were filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday, gives the bank access to equity-type capital while allowing tax savings normally associated with plain debt issues. 'The holy grail is to get tier 1 capital in tax-deductible form,' said Mr Brian Worsley, assistant treasurer at Barclays Bank. 'This structure is as close as we can get.' Under new international capital guidelines which come into effect next year, banks must hold tier 1 and tier 2 capital totalling 8 per cent of their assets. Barclays plans to issue undated, subordinated debt, which qualifies as upper tier 2 capital. This can be converted later, at the option of the bank, into preferred stock, which counts as tier 1 capital. As long as the issue remains in debt form, the interest costs are tax-deductible, providing considerable cost savings over a conventional preferred stock issue. Mr Worsley said that the debt would only be converted into preferred stock if Barclays' tier 2 capital was set to exceed its tier 1 capital, which is not permitted under the guidelines. Barclays current capital-to-assets ratio stands at 8.9 per cent, of which 5.9 per cent is tier 1 and 3 per cent tier 2. National Westminster Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland are among the banks which have also been looking at this type of structure. The same tax benefits are also likely to be available to other European banks, some of which are under considerable pressure to build up capital. A similar structure has already been used in the US by Bankers Trust, but the conversion into preferred stock in that case was mandatory. Barclays, on the other hand, can continue to deduct interest payments from tax until it decides to convert the debt into preferred stock. The structure has been developed by Barclays, in conjunction with Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs, but Barclays has not yet mandated either US bank to arrange the US offering. The structure has been approved by the Bank of England.</p>

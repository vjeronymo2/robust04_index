			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Observer: Bungalow build Clearly a quango that delivers what it promises, Britain's Housing Corporation, which has been having a reorganisation in its central registration and supervision division (RSD). The new-look RSD, whose function it is to regulate the housing associations, is promised a 'flatter structure with shorter reporting lines'. Seldom can a review have been accomplished so deftly. The organigram of the new structure comprises one box inhabited in solitary splendour by the division's director, Derek Young, which is connected by a single line to another, rather jollier box encompassing all 33 'supervision, consents, registration, administration, policy and information officers'. Yup, that's it.</p>

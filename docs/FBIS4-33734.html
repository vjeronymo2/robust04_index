			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 9 Jun (AFP) -- Dominican Republic  President Joaquin Balaguer justified the presence of U.S.  military officers along his country's border with Haiti, saying  it is the result of an agreement with Bill Clinton and UN envoys  William Gray and Dante Caputo.    In statements to the press on Thursday, Balaguer said the  Haitian military leaders' Dominican bank accounts have not been  frozen.    Twelve U.S. Atlantic Command officers arrived at Santo  Domingo on 8 June and immediately transferred to the Haitian  border where they are coordinating with the operations of "their  Dominican counterparts" to prevent violations of the UN-decreed  embargo against Haiti.    The Balaguer government's agreement with Caputo and Gray  includes sending helicopters and sea craft to prevent the entry  of fuel and other articles to Haiti that the embargo prohibits.    Although it has been said the arrival of helicopters would  be  imminent, only the presence in Dominican waters of the USS  Cyclone and USS Tempest has been officially reported so far.    A diplomatic source consulted by AFP has said the arrival of  the helicopters will depend on the report on "logistic needs" by  the UN observer mission, which is comprised of approximately 60  people, who should arrive shortly in the Dominican Republic.</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Currencies under fire The equity market obviously enjoys a scare on the currency front. Yesterday's 39 point gain in London owed something both to the weakness of sterling itself and to the strains which have resurfaced in the ERM. The former, though, carries a degree of risk. A weaker pound may help produce some export-led growth but yesterday morning provided a cautionary reminder that sterling's fall could easily run out of control, forcing the authorities to back away prematurely from their easy money policy. Although the UK has left the ERM, its position would be more secure if tensions within the system forced a cut in German interest rates. The continental economic outlook would improve, creating brighter export prospects. Pressure on sterling would abate, and with it the inflationary threat from unilateral depreciation. From this perspective, currency developments in Europe yesterday were good and bad news. The pressure on the Danish krone is clearly serious. Like Ireland before it, Denmark is suffering from a severe loss of competitiveness against its main trading partners. A belief that this could so undermine the system that the Bundesbank would be forced to cut rates prompted sharp gains on the Paris and Frankfurt equity markets. The bad news, for those looking for lower rates, is that it may take some time for the situation to become critical. Pressure on the French franc is not yet severe enough to warrant action by the Bundesbank at today's council meeting  -especially since it has been signalling continuing dissatisfaction with events on the domestic front. Lower short-term rates in Europe would also help channel overseas flows into the UK gilt market, reducing the funding pressure on domestic institutions. There were tentative signs yesterday that sterling's weakness had prompted a flicker of foreign interest in gilts, but nothing like the flood required to cover next year's deficit. One must not exaggerate. A decisive shift in German policy, if it came, would not be a panacea for the UK. But its problems would look a lot less daunting than they do at present.</p>

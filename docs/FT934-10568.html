			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Generous pricing ensures a good reception for Catalonia RELATIVELY generous pricing ensured a good reception yesterday for the first international bond offering from Catalonia, one of Spain's richest autonomous regions. The success of the FFr1bn offering of 10-year Eurobonds bodes well for the forthcoming issue from the Spanish region of Andalucia, which is expected to launch a FFr1.3bn offering of 10-year Eurobonds on November 15. Catalonia's Eurobonds were priced to yield 35 basis points over the 6 3/4 per cent French government OAT due 2003. The yield spread came at the top end of market expectations of 30 to 35 basis points. Lead manager CCF said that investors had been pleasantly surprised by the yield on the bonds but Catalonia had still achieved a spread equal to or less than those on outstanding French franc Eurobonds issued by the Kingdom of Spain. Mr Xavier Ruiz del Portal, Catalonia's director of finance, said the all-in cost of the offering was 6.47 per cent and that by the end of the day, around 60 per cent of the bonds had been placed with investors. Speaking from Barcelona, Mr Ruiz del Portal said: 'This shows that the bonds have been priced at the right level.' He added that Catalonia was likely to make an early return to the Eurobond market as a result of the success of yesterday's debut offering. CCF said retail demand for Catalonia's bonds had exceeded expectations. Of the bonds sold, more than a third were placed with retail investors, high net worth individuals in particular, and the remainder with institutions. When the bonds were freed to trade, they eased from their fixed re-offer price of 98.773 to 98.63 bid. However, the spread remained at 35 basis points, reflecting CCF's commitment to keeping the spread intact. Wood Gundy launched a CDollars 300m issue of 15-year Eurobonds backed by high-coupon Canadian government bonds. The offering was designed to tap investor demand for long-dated Canadian dollar paper. The bonds were priced to yield 50 basis points over the 7 1/2 per cent Canadian treasury due 2003 and 35 basis points over the interpolated 15-year area of the yield curve. Wood Gundy said that similar offerings had been launched in the US, Canada and Euro-lira markets in the past year. It expected the structure to be adopted in other bond markets where high-coupon government bonds are trading at a substantial premium to their par value. Investors are unwilling to buy such bonds because of their intrinsic capital loss. However, by stripping the coupons from the bonds and placing them in a special purpose vehicle, banks can re-package them as new bonds which can then be sold on to investors. Elsewhere, the downward spiral in yields continued in the Swiss foreign bond market as Elf, the French oil giant, raised SFr125m through an issue of eight-year bonds with a coupon of 4.125 per cent. Syndicate managers said it would not be long before a borrower with a triple-A rating launched an offering of bonds with a 4 per cent coupon.</p>

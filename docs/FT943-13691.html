			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Nationwide sales staff ordered to face retraining Nationwide Building Society, the UK's second largest, yesterday barred its 1,300 authorised financial services staff from giving financial advice to customers until they complete a re-training programme. The ban will affect staff at about two-thirds of the society's 1,000 outlets, including its 300 estate agency branches. Nationwide plans to launch its own life insurance and unit trust subsidiaries next year, but currently acts as an agent for Guardian Financial Services, part of Guardian Royal Exchange. The move follows a routine inspection visit by Lautro, the life insurance industry's regulator, to Guardian Financial Services and its agents. On the day the Personal Investment Authority - the new watchdog to protect the private investor - became operational, the announcement was a reminder that Lautro has been growing in effectiveness. Lautro will be wound up next year. Nationwide said the Lautro visit had revealed shortcomings in its supervision of financial services staff, and it was taking the opportunity to enhance training more generally. Mr Brian Davis, chief executive designate, said Nationwide's action had been taken voluntarily, and was a sign of its commitment to high standards of service. In March, Norwich Union, one of the UK's largest insurers, suspended its entire life and pensions sales force for a month after Lautro identified breakdowns in management controls. The 650 or so Nationwide staff dedicated exclusively to financial services products will undertake an intensive training programme, and the first groups to go through this process will be able to offer advice again from early August. Plans for the remaining authorised staff, such as branch managers who do not deal solely with financial services, have not yet been finalised, but it is possible the numbers who are authorised will be reduced. One of Lautro's concerns was the relatively low number of supervisors or senior financial consultants - 56 - for the size of the sales force. Mr Davis said he did not believe Nationwide had misled its customers, but anyone concerned should contact the society. Guardian sales agents will cover for the Nationwide sales force in some areas. The insurer itself said Nationwide accounted for about 30 per cent of its new business last year. 'Phantom' agent revealed, Page 9 N&amp;P launches home insurance products, Page 18</p>

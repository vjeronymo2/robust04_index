			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: SocGen in move to revive TME index SOCIETE Generale, the French bank, has launched an unusual domestic bond issue linked to a French government bond index, in an attempt to revive interest in the moribund index. The issue is designed to provide a straightforward yield curve play for investors who take the view that the French yield curve - which is currently inverted - is set to shift to a positive shape. Societe Generale hopes to restore interest in the index - the Taux Moyen D'Etat (TME) - on long-dated government bonds. After a period in vogue in the late 1980s, the market in bonds linked to the TME collapsed as the yield curve became more inverted. The FFr1.5bn 10-year issue pays interest of 60 basis points above the TME index. The deal met with strong demand, particularly from French insurance companies, according to Societe Generale. It was also boosted by the French Treasury's announcement last Friday of an exchange programme under which some existing bonds linked to the TME index will be redeemed. Societe Generale believes that the projected shift in the French yield curve will be mirrored in other European markets. It plans to create indices similar to the French TME index on other European government bond markets. The bank plans to launch products linked to these new indices. 'We plan to export this idea to Europe,' said Mr Antoine Paille, director of options at the bank. Tomorrow, Societe Generale will launch a FFr300m to FFr500m 10-year Eurobond. The bond will pay TME plus 20 basis points, with a floor at 7.5 per cent. But if the TME reaches 11 per cent, the floor disappears. In addition to bond issues, the bank is to start making markets in caps and floors (options with upper and lower limits) on the TME.</p>

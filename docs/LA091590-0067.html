			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> ABSENCES MAY LEAD TO SCHOOL ON SATURDAYS  </P> <P> Santa Paula High School students who cut class will find themselves going to  school on Saturday under a new attendance policy.  </P> <P> School officials started the new policy this year because 15% to 20% of the  students were tardy and 6% to 10% were absent each month last year, said  Assistant Principal Fran Meek.  </P> <P> The district receives about $16 a day for each student from the state and loses  the same amount for each unexcused absence, she said.  </P> <P> Ten teachers met over the summer to work out the new policy, which puts the  responsibility for attending school on the student, said Assistant Principal  Dax Bryson.  </P> <P> On the first infraction, the student will have a conference with his teacher. A  second absence will be punished by an hourlong detention and a telephone call  to the student's home. The third time, the student will be referred to the  assistant principal and assigned to Saturday school, Bryson said.  </P> <P> If the student does not show up for Saturday School, an in-school detention  will be assigned, he said. Detention duty requires teachers to give up their  preparation periods to monitor the students, but teachers have volunteered to  do it, Bryson said.  </P> <P> The final disciplinary step would be in-school suspension, which Bryson  described as closely monitored detention. The advantage of in-school  suspension, he said, is the school still receives its regular share of funds  from the state because the student is on campus.  </P> <P> Teachers have gone over the rules with students and copies of the new  regulations have gone home to the parents, he said.  </P> <P> "There is plenty of fear and trembling and gnashing of teeth" on campus,  teacher Basil Augustine said. "I now see students leaping toward their  classrooms when they hear that bell." AMELIA CHAFFEE  </P></p>

The masses of 25 nationalities live and work in  peace and contentment.    In 1993, the Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee made the  decision to develop productive forces by leaps and bounds in  nationality, border, and mountainous areas. The new body of the  provincial government also regarded economic development in  support of impoverished areas as the immediate goal, focusing on  tackling bottleneck issues in the most impoverished, remote, and  backward areas. The Deqen Zang Autonomous Prefecture was slow  in economic development. Related departments of the provincial  government allowed it a flexible policy to increase input into  its infrastructure building, focusing on helping the prefecture  decide and implement the program of doing away with poverty by  the year 2000 and the development of township and town  enterprises.    In 1993, Yunnan allotted some 62 million yuan to support the  development of some 300 projects in nationality areas. The  provincial government has already planned to invest some 10  billion yuan in nationality areas in the 1990's to build a  number of backbone projects in transportation, energy resources,  and mineral production. Presently, construction of a number of  large and medium-sized projects including the Deqen Paper Box  Factory, Nawan Power Station, Zhongdian's Jinshajiang irrigation  project, Dahaoshan Power Station, and Gaotong Airport are  underway or completed. Work in supporting the impoverished in  nationality areas has spread from being conducted in separate  units to extensive development and regional efforts. The smooth  implementation of economic construction has promoted the social  stability of border nationality areas.</p>

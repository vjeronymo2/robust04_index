			<p>BFN     [Text] Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, leader of the opposition  Dominican Revolutionary Party [PRD], who had reported fraud in  the 16 May elections held in the Dominican Republic, said today  that he has a civilian army ready to prevent an election farce.    We do not accept the results provided by the Central  Electoral Board, which gives a slight advantage to President  Joaquin Balaguer, Pena Gomez said in a television program. He  also demanded a review of all vote tally sheets.    Pena Gomez also referred to his remarks during the 1994  elections, when he said that fraud must be proven before a call  for violence could be made.    In a letter addressed to the Central Electoral Board, Jose  Francisco Pena Gomez demands the suspension of the vote count  due to the despicable, serious irregularities detected during  the process. If the vote count continues, Balaguer would be  proclaimed president, he said.    Moreover, Chilean Luis Ayala, chairman of Socialist  International for Latin America, has denounced serious  irregularities in the general elections held on Monday [16 May]  in the Dominican Republic.    In a news conference, Ayala supported the denunciations made  by the PRD presidential candidate who said he would be present  today at the Central Electoral Board to refute the process and  demand new elections in those districts where thousands of  citizens were unable to vote.    Luis Ayala added that Socialist International delegates, in  the Dominican Republic to observe the elections at the  invitation of Pena Gomez, have detected serious and grave  irregularities. Ayala added that citizens linked to Balaguer's  government had two identification cards.    Balaguer was leading when the latest vote count results were  announced.</p>

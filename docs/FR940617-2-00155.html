Such equity related securities may be issued by the issuer of the equity securities itself or by a subsidiary of such issuer. Offerings of straight debt securities are outside the scope of this letter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With reference to the policy statement issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 3, 1993, I am writing to request exemptions from rules 10b&hyph;6, 106&hyph;7 and 10b&hyph;8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for French issuers to the extent set forth in part III below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Offerings By French Companies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The structure of an offering of equity securities in a French company varies depending on whether it is a primary or a secondary offering. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Primary Offerings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> French law grants shareholders of a French company pre-emptive rights to subscribe for shares issued by such company. French law also authorizes shareholders, voting at a shareholders meeting, to renounce such pre-emptive rights. In practice, in the case of a renunciation of such pre-emptive rights, most offerings are conducted so as to grant current shareholders a priority right to purchase new shares before the general public during a period of 5 to 10 days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Offerings With Pre-emptive Rights <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Offerings with pre-emptive rights permit the current shareholders to participate in the capital increase  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> or to sell their pre-emptive rights, which are securities separable from the shares, on the market. The existence of a negotiable pre-emptive right permits detachment of the offering price from the stock market price, because the shareholders who do not want to participate in an offering can, by selling their rights on the market, be compensated for the dilution which could result from an offering price which is significantly less than the market price and/or than their share in the net assets. The discount from the stock market price is generally 10% to 20%. The technique of an offering with pre-emptive rights is principally used for offerings of shares rather than for those of ``composite securities'', such as bonds with warrants or bonds convertible into shares, for reasons of valuation and quotation on the appropriate stock market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

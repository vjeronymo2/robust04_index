			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: MEXICO FREE-TRADE PACT WOULD HELP U.S.  </P> <P> So the United States and Mexico have agreed to start talking about a free-trade  agreement -- similar to the one negotiated a year and a half ago between the  United States and Canada.  </P> <P> So what? Such talks may be bold in concept, but do they really mean anything  much to you?  </P> <P> More than you may think. Mexico offers the United States an opportunity to  create the world's largest market here in North America -- after two decades of  feeling pressured economically by other nations or trading blocs, from OPEC to  Japan's industrial machine to the European Community. A North American  free-trade area, including Canada, would be larger in population and economic  size than the 12-nation EC.  </P> <P> Psychologically, fears of an isolated, threatened U.S. economy would evaporate;  economically, an enlarged market would increase jobs and opportunities.  </P> <P> But any such grouping will face tremendous obstacles. In fact, whether the  potential is ever realized may depend on how well we understand what the talks  with Mexico are all about.  </P> <P> They're about a potential market and industrial producer that could put Eastern  Europe in the shade. Mexico, with a growing population of 88 million -- 40%  under the age of 15 -- is a larger market for U.S. goods than all of Eastern  Europe. And as a producer of goods, it could surpass South Korea.  </P> <P> For some, that may raise a specter of low-cost imports and loss of American  jobs -- Mexican workers make $2 an hour, compared to the U.S. average wage of  $10 an hour.  </P> <P> But in Mexico's case, that perspective misses half the equation. When Mexico  exports, it also imports; unlike many places in Asia and Europe, Mexico uses  U.S. machinery to make its goods. Last year it bought more than $10 billion  worth of U.S. machinery, computers and tools.  </P> <P> Overall, Mexico purchased $25 billion of U.S. exports and sent $27 billion  northward as U.S. imports in 1989, as machinery, food, oil, motor vehicles and  parts flowed in both directions.  </P> <P> All three U.S. car makers manufacture in Mexico, for both the U.S. and Mexican  markets. With 6 million cars for 88 million people -- compared to 185 million  cars for 240 million Americans -- Mexico is one of the greatest potential car  markets on Earth.  </P> <P> Still, potential has been there for years without fulfillment. In the 1970s,  Mexico found new oil deposits and tried to take an industrial leap forward. But  it over-borrowed, wasted money and fell back, buried under billions of dollars  in foreign debt.  </P> <P> Even today's enthusiasm for free trade with the United States is due to  desperation. Mexico's President Carlos Salinas de Gortari needs foreign  investment. And U.S., European and Japanese investors aren't eager -- having  lost too much in peso devaluations in the '80s. In any case, says a business  leader in Japan, where Salinas visits next week, Japanese firms can get  low-cost manufacturing elsewhere:"We have Mexicos closer to us, called Thailand  and Singapore."  </P> <P> So Salinas, the 41-year-old, Harvard-educated economist, must try to attract  back some of the billions of dollars -- perhaps $100 billion, says one expert  -- that wealthy Mexicans have sent abroad. "To do that he wants to tie the  economy to the United States," says Rudiger Dornbusch, an economics professor  at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  </P> <P> Salinas will have to overcome opposition at home from those who say he is  selling out Mexico to the United States, and from U.S. labor and some  industries who see free trade only as cheap competition. And he'll have to  overcome widespread skepticism among global business people and investors that  Mexico can really get its act together.  </P> <P> But Mexico may surprise the skeptics. Despite the reversals of the last decade,  Mexico's economy is in better shape than Spain was 15 years ago when it began  to modernize. Today, thanks to entry into the European Common Market, Spain has  blossomed into one of the world's fastest-growing economies.  </P> <P> With national income per person of $2,300 a year, Mexico today is entering  another, higher stage of economic development, say experts. With help and  orders from U.S. firms, Mexican companies are now beginning to make precision  parts for computers and medical equipment. As they learn, Mexican companies  will make -- and also use -- more complex equipment -- selling to and buying  from the United States.  </P> <P> And as Mexico develops jobs and opportunities at home, fewer of its people will  need or want to go north to pick crops or do menial jobs in U.S. cities.  </P> <P> Sure, that vision may sound ideal. But there is an example to back it up in the  U.S.-Canadian auto agreement of 1965, says Prof. Jose de la Torre of UCLA's  Center for International Business. In that pact, the U.S. auto industry, the  United Auto Workers union and the two governments agreed that certain car  models could be manufactured in Canada and come duty-free into the U.S. market.  In return, U.S. industry got to sell more goods to Canada.  </P> <P> The result was a tremendous boon for Canada, lifting pay scales and living  standards. But the agreement also expanded the Canadian market for U.S. goods,  so that it remains by far the largest customer for U.S. exports.  </P> <P> In international trade as in any other business, the moral is simple: You help  others, you help yourself. That's why President Bush later this year will talk  about free trade with President Salinas.  </P></p>

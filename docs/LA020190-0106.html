			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> WAITING PERIOD FOR RIFLES  </P> <P> People who buy rifles in Santa Monica will have to wait 15 days to take  delivery of their weapons starting next year, under a law adopted by the City  Council this week.  </P> <P> Because state law prohibits municipalities from imposing waiting periods on gun  purchasers for the purpose of making background checks on them, the new Santa  Monica law defines the 15-day wait as a cooling-off period in which no  background checks will be performed.  </P> <P> The council delayed the effective date of the law to next Jan. 1 on the advice  of City Atty. Robert Myers, who said it gives time to state legislators to  adopt similar, overriding legislation.  </P> <P> Local gun shop owners doubted the effectiveness of such a plan. Judson  Swearingen, owner of Cole's Guns, said the law would "divert the legitimate  purchases by Santa Monica residents to stores outside this city."  </P> <P> But Councilman David Finkel said the waiting period would "advance the dialogue  (on gun control). If it does nothing more than that, then it's still a good  idea," he said.  </P></p>

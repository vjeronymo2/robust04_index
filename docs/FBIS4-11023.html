			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Text of communique issued by Electoral Tribunal in Panama </F> City on 15 April]    [Text] Yesterday, 14 April, the president of the Republic  addressed citizens via a national radio and television network  where edited film material, obtained from the archives of the  Presidency, revealed actions of government officials in the past  administration.    Although the Electoral Tribunal is the leading organization  in the electoral process, it is not the Electoral Tribunal's  responsibility to assess this action because, according to the  Constitution, the Legislative Branch is the only branch  empowered to judge the public actions of the president of the  Republic.    The Electoral Tribunal magistrates reiterate our  constitutional independence from the Executive Branch and other  government organizations. We ratify our commitment to guarantee  that Panamanian voters will be able to vote freely on 8 May, and  that their votes will be counted with absolute honesty so that  those who obtain the majority of the votes will be proclaimed  the legitimate winners.    Issued in Panama City on 15 April 1994    Eduardo Valdes Escoffery, President Magistrate    Dennis Allen Frias, Vice President Magistrate    Guillermo Marquez Amado, Member Magistrate</p>

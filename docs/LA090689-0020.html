			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HAIG TO NARRATE COMIC 'ANIMALS' AT LEISURE VILLAGE  </P> <P> Even Alexander M. Haig Jr. is amused by the incongruity of this one.  </P> <P> The former secretary of state, a man who helped orchestrate the Vietnam War and  once described himself as "just an old warrior," will appear at the Leisure  Village Ocean Hills Music Festival in Oceanside this weekend to narrate  Saint-Saens' comic "Carnival of the Animals."  </P> <P> When reminded during a telephone interview from his Washington office that  classical music didn't quite fit his hard-edged resume, Haig let out with a  barking laugh: "Why, for a man of violence, you mean? Well, I guess you're  right, it's not the usual thing I do."  </P> <P> Self-irony aside, he is accustomed to a different stage, on a different scale.  Through much of his career -- as a four-star general and later in the Reagan  Administration as secretary of state -- Haig has played to a global audience on  more weighty issues.  </P> <P> But Haig, who now claims to be divorced from politics following his failed  presidential bid last year, said his festival appearance actually makes some  sense.  </P> <P> His interest in classical music, especially piano pieces, began when, as a boy,  he enjoyed listening to both his parents play. His mother was an accomplished  pianist, as was his father, a musician good enough to give concerts. And Haig  met his wife, Phyllis, following a piano recital she gave in 1950.  </P> <P> "You could say that it's in my blood. With all of that classical music around  you for so long, you have to develop a keen appreciation and have a natural  leaning that way."  </P> <P> Then there's his involvement with Leisure Village, an affluent senior citizens  community in lush North San Diego County. Haig, a member of the board of  directors since 1983, was asked by Leisure Village's developer, Michael L.  Tenzer, to distinguish the festival by adding his name to the program. "This  will be a valuable cultural event but, and we make no bones about it, this has  a marketing objective as well as a cultural objective," Haig conceded.  </P> <P> Still, he was deliberate in emphasizing the event's quality. Under Henri  Temianka's direction, the festival will begin Friday in Maurice Abravanel Hall  with two chamber music ensemble concerts by the California Chamber Virtuosi,  including three movements from Stravinsky's "Petrushka" and Mendelssohn's Trio  in D minor, Opus 49.  </P> <P> Saturday evening, Yehuda Gilad will direct the Strawberry Creek Music Festival  Orchestra in Mozart's "Clemenza di Tito Overture" and Schubert's Third  Symphony. Earlier in the day, Steven Mayer will give a piano recital of Brahms'  Sonata in F minor, Mozart's Sonata in F and a selection of Fats Waller songs,  among others.  </P> <P> Sunday morning will begin with a panel discussion on contemporary classical  music that will include Temianka, violinist Sergiu Schwartz, Mayer and Maurice  Abravanel.  </P> <P> The final Sunday offering will be "Carnival of the Animals," performed by the  California Chamber Virtuosi under Temianka's direction. Haig will read Ogden  Nash's wry verse accompanying this piece comprised of 14 "musical pictures of  animals" for two pianos, string quintet, flute, clarinet and percussion. Before  that, Schubert's "Trout" Quintet will be performed.  </P> <P> In such a pristine setting, there would seem no room for controversy. But as  controversy often found Haig in public life, it has surfaced in Oceanside. The  Times reported in August that Leisure Village's sprawling golf course and part  of its lavish clubhouse were financed with a $27-million loan insured by the  San Diego office of the scandal-torn U.S. Department of Housing and Urban  Development.  </P> <P> HUD officials are concerned because Leisure Village, a private, gated  community, does not provide benefits for the poor. The loan was approved by HUD  in 1981, two years before Haig became involved with Leisure Village.  </P> <P> Haig said he was "surprised" by The Times' report and did not know enough about  the specifics of the case to comment. He was concerned, however, that it might  cast a shadow on the festival, which he hopes will be judged on its own merits.  </P> <P> As for his own performance, Haig conceded, a bit sheepishly, that he wasn't  quite sure how to prepare. His wife will join him on stage, so he plans to  rehearse the Nash sketches with her. He admires the piece, both for Nash's  witty writing and Saint-Saens' music -- the piece has been described as the  composer's most brilliant parody, teasing Offenbach, Berlioz, Mendelssohn and  Rossini -- but he admitted he's a little at sea.  </P> <P> To keep on course, Haig said he'll try to rely on any actorly skills he's  gained during more than 20 years in public office.  </P> <P> "There are two models, you know -- those that start in acting and go into  politics and those that, after a bit of politics, go into acting," he said with  a laugh. "I won't mention any names, but there's a guy out here in California  that fits the former pretty well. I fit the latter, I guess."  </P> <P> Does this represent a new career direction? Haig said he's too busy running his  own international marketing firm to consider any more time on stage. "No, no,  if I get through this one without any problems, I'll be happy. I'm just worried  that I'll miss a beat."  </P> <P> Any interview with Haig is bound to veer toward politics, an area where he  quickly becomes expansive.  </P> <P> Contrary to the derisive tone he took with President Bush during the campaign  for the Republican presidential nomination, Haig is now a loyalist all the way.  Describing Bush's first months as even an improvement on Reagan's, Haig said he  was particularly impressed with the President's handling of the recent European  summit.  </P> <P> There are, however, areas for improvement. Haig believes the Administration  must be more definite in its approach to international terrorism and should not  dismiss military intervention, even when hostages may be endangered. He feels  Israel, a country that has taken an aggressive approach to terrorists, is a  valuable model.  </P> <P> "We have to view terrorism in a new way, that this is an ongoing war between  law-abiding nations and terrorist nations . . . we have to negotiate, but we  can't get too hung up on the moralist issue . . . we can't make too many  compromises."  </P> <P> He also stressed that more money must be given to Poland as it reaches for  democratic and economic reforms. However, instead of "blindly throwing cash at  them," Bush should push for U.S.-sponsored programs that aid "debt  restructuring and the training of managers and the labor force," Haig said.  </P> <P> It's clear Haig gets his blood up while talking about the big picture, but he's  emphatic when pressed about his re-entering politics. "No, I had my stint in  office. I did my bit and loved it, but that part is over. In 1992 I see myself  (campaigning) for Bush, but that's about all I see."  </P></p>

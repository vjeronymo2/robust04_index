			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Nordic and Alpine fresh air: EC can take heart from enlargement talks AT THEIR summit in Brussels on Friday, a rather battered collection of EC leaders will not only be able to cheer themselves that the Maastricht treaty is now ratified, but take heart too that there are at last signs of progress on bringing four Nordic and Alpine countries into the Community by 1995. Amid doubts over the viability of monetary union, the growing jobs crisis and Europe's failure to bring peace to Bosnia, enlargement to bring in Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway is a comfortingly solid goal for the Community to set course for. It has not often seemed that way since the glacially slow negotiations started with these members of the loose European Free Trade Association (Efta) in February. The summit is set to force the pace of the talks, possibly acting on a German proposal made yesterday to hold more regular ministerial negotiations between the Twelve and the Four. On Friday, nonetheless, the European Commission should be able to report to the summit that most of the candidate countries' legislation has been argued into compatibility with the EC's single market, and that the Twelve and the Four have taken big strides in aligning health and safety and veterinary standards and indirect taxation. What is more important, the Commission can at last point to the first signs of progress on the make-or-break issues of the enlargement talks: the compatibility of the (often higher) environmental standards of the applicants, and how to pay for their (much higher) agricultural and regional subsidy regimes. All four applicants will hold a referendum on EC accession, and need to convince their increasingly Euro-sceptical peoples that the Community represents no threat to the quality of their lives and their very 'green' identities. Environmental issues, according to an internal Commission document, 'may prove to be decisive for the successful conclusion of the enlargement exercise'. All four applicant governments fear a No vote if the EC is seen to be diluting what they consider higher standards in order to safeguard border-free trade. The Brussels enlargement task force has thus evolved a three-tier approach, so far well-received by the applicants. Where standards are equivalent, if different, such as on car emission limits, the EC should refuse to budge. Where the EC has set target dates for raised standards, for example on safety belts, applicants would get transitional exemptions. On the trickiest issues, for instance health labelling on products or use of certain pesticides, the EC is proposing to grant transitional exemptions with a review after three years, when applicants should be in the EC and taking part in amending the legislation. The psychology of this approach is as important as the details, given attitudes prevalent in applicant countries that entry is all right just so long as it is the EC which is joining them. 'It is not unintentional,' one senior Commission negotiator remarks archly, 'that it sounds like they're pulling us up to their standards.' But the Commission is adamant that the new member states will not be allowed to use border controls to keep EC products out for environmental reasons. Thus the EC insists that Austria can only keep its transit agreement with the Community limiting EC trucks passing through its Alpine passes if it operates the same curbs on Austrian and non-EC lorries. That attitude will be hard to maintain, however, if the Brussels negotiators lose the argument within the Commission over how to deal with the applicants' heavily subsidised Arctic and Alpine agriculture, which the Four are determined to preserve to keep their countries more evenly populated. In previous enlargements, farm price support differences have been dealt with by border levies to even them out. The differences to be ironed out in this case range from farm price subsidies which are 25 per cent higher than the EC's in Austria to 100 per cent higher in Norway - by because of the single market there will be no borders at which to do the levying. Some Commission agriculture and customs regime officials are arguing that the new member states could keep border controls until their farm prices move into line with the EC's, what would be a long process. The issue has not been decided, but the enlargement negotiators view any such dilution of the single market with horror. 'If you accept border controls for agriculture it's hard to stop them being used for other purposes,' one senior official says. 'We wouldn't get free competition in their markets.' The careful compromises emerging on environment and health and safety standards, moreover, could be unravelled by border controls, he adds. The solution he advocates is direct income compensation to farmers in the four countries, which would cost an estimated Ecu2.2bn (Pounds 1.7bn) a year. The net contributions to the EC budget the Four are expected to make would be around double this. The next stage of the argument would therefore be how to share out the cost of the compensation, and how to finance lavish regional subsidies, which in the Nordic countries are linked to concern for the security of their empty northern territories. EC regional policy, geared to helping backward and industrially stricken areas, does not really measure up to northern Nordic needs. 'They don't need electricity and roads. Their abattoirs are better than our houses,' says one negotiator. 'It's better to be a cow up there.' Again, an income support scheme linked to differences between regions is being looked at. But even if the way forward is now in view, there is still a lot to negotiate: Norwegian determination to retain full control over its energy and fisheries resources; the voting weight and representation these four small countries would get inside EC institutions, at a time when the UK, France, Germany and Spain are seeking to increase big countries' influence; and how the Four, all except Norway formally neutral, would fit into the Maastricht treaty's foreign and security policy. On Friday they will be looking for clear signs that the 12 want to find a way through the thicket.</p>

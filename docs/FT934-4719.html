			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Johnson Matthey improves 6% - Car catalyst side casts shadow over mid-term performance Johnson Matthey, the precious metals technology group, lifted profits before tax by 6 per cent from Pounds 33.2m to Pounds 35.1m in the six months to September 30 1993. The interim dividend goes up from 3.2p to 3.4p. Mr David Davies, chairman, said the group had performed well. The result was widely predicted but analysts came away from a meeting with management disappointed by the performance of the car catalyst business, where turnover was up only 2 per cent, and the share price dipped 3p to 496p in an otherwise rising market. Some analysts also suggested that JM had been a good defensive stock in the recession but was unlikely to gain as much as other companies from the recovery. Earnings per share rose 21 per cent, from 12.1p to 14.6p, after a one-off Pounds 3.7m saving on ACT from the group's enhanced scrip dividend alternative. Mr Davies gave little away about the second half. He said there were some 'encouraging' signs of growth in the US economy but recovery in the UK remained fragile and JM was experiencing poor conditions in other European markets. Platinum group metals prices are important to JM because it takes a percentage commission from Rustenburg of South Africa. Mr Davies pointed out that, although rhodium prices had recovered from their lowest levels, 'any significant improvement in platinum group metals prices is unlikely without sustained economic recovery.' The materials technology division provided the highlight of the half-year and continued its recovery with a 53 per cent improvement in operating profit to Pounds 13.5m. Operating profit at the catalytic systems division was slightly ahead at Pounds 13.2m; in the colour and printing division it was up 19 per cent at Pounds 5m, while the precious metals division's operating profit was down by Pounds 400,000 to Pounds 10.1m. Mr Davies revealed that, after a successful two-year collaboration, JM had signed a license agreement with Sandoz Pharma, the Swiss group, for a class of anti-viral compounds which have a novel mechanism of action against the virus that causes Aids. The compounds were identified at JM's biomedical research facilities and have been patented. Mr Davies also pointed out that. although 50 per cent of JM's profit was earned outside the UK, where it is based, only a small proportion was earned in the growth markets of Asia. The company was attending to this: a Pounds 25m facility had been opened in Japan and the group was 'well down the road' towards establishing a car catalyst manufacturing plant 'somewhere in south-east Asia.'</p>

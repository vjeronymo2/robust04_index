			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3-A;  </P> <P> TRABUCO HILLS IS ON GAME WHEN SWANWICK ISN'T  </P> <P> Throughout the Southern Section 3-A division boys' basketball playoffs,  opposing teams have done their best to contain Trabuco Hills High School's Rick  Swanwick, an imposing 6-foot-10, 220-pound center.  </P> <P> Swanwick came into Saturday's championship in the Sports Arena averaging 20.7  points and 13.8 rebounds per game. Stopping Swanwick was the best way to stop  Trabuco Hills.  </P> <P> Well, not quite. Corona del Mar limited Swanwick to nine points, but Trabuco  Hills' perimeter shooting carried the Mustangs to a 59-55 victory in front of  6,635 fans.  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills (22-6) won by making six of eight three-point shots and making  nine of 13 free throws in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills' four-guard offense more than made up for Swanwick's off night.  Chad Poulos scored 14 points, including four free throws in the final 48  seconds that sealed the victory.  </P> <P> Randy Kriech led all scorers with 19 points, including three three-point shots.  Luis Arenado had eight points and Tim Manning added seven.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar (19-10), the third-place team in the Sea View League, shot only  39% in its quest to win the 3-A title.  </P> <P> Center Brian Spratt, who averaged 20.3 points in four previous playoff games,  score six points going into the final quarter but finished with a team-high 14.  </P></p>

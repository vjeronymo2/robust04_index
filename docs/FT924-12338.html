			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Arts: 'Green Table' revisited - Ballet The Green Table was a dance-icon of the 1930s. It won a prize at a choreographic competition in Paris in 1932, and launched the international career of Kurt Jooss, its creator. And because of its ever-apt theme - the sufferings we know in war - it has acquired a spurious sanctity. To attack it, to declare it a stodgy, albeit well-intentioned, piece is seemingly to attack its moral worth. Well, moral rectitude never had anything to do with choreography, and I have always found Jooss's dances very lumpy going. (When I first saw The Green Table - with Jooss's own troupe, in the middle of the war - I thought it singularly unlike what was raging around us. What remains with me still is a memory of the dramatic weight, the physical density, with which certain of Jooss's finest artists - Sigurd Leeder, Hans Zullig - imbued their actions). Jooss's dance language owed everything to his experience as a student of the movement theorist Rudolf Laban. His quest was for a style in which emotional expression should find its most direct and essential means. In all of his dance works that I saw, there was earnestness, simplicity, and these qualities are clear to see in the revival of The Green Table that entered the Birmingham Royal Ballet repertory on Monday night. BRB's director, Peter Wright, appeared as a young dancer with Jooss, and this staging is his tribute on the 60th anniversary of the ballet's creation. Scrupulously revived by Anna Markard, Jooss's daughter, The Green Table wears its years badly - it looks like an old Art Deco poster blowing in the winds of time. Death (Joseph Cipolla, very good) stamps and stalks; the Standard Bearer (well done by James Bailey) is heroic; a Mother (Marion Tait, the best advocate for Jooss's expressivity) grieves. A girl suffers and becomes a prostitute, and the profiteer (oh, the rubbing of the white-gloved hands]) does his blatant thing. These are cliches. Behaviour is sentimentalised, and movement is as predictable as one might expect when stereotypes are set on stage. The Fritz Cohen score for two pianos is leaden. And so is much of the choreography. Some groupings are still theatrically vivid - the frieze of mourning women; the procession of Death's victims - yet what may have seemed apt or innovatory in 1932, has faded badly, and the dance (unlike, say, the texts of Massine's symphonic ballets of the '30s) lacks an imaginative fire that will touch us. The BRB cast work well, but Jooss's solemnities do nothing interesting for them. This opening programme of the BRB season also brought another acquisition: Ashton's Symphonic Variations. It is a serene masterpiece, and one now so weighed down by its significance - as Ashton's declaration about English classic dance; as a portrait of its sublime first cast headed by Fonteyn and Michael Somes - that I sense that new interpreters are over-awed even before they reach the stage. Monday night's sextet had the anxious and too reverential air of people late for church, busily making up for their mistake by rushing their devotions and looking generally harried. Michael Somes has produced an impeccable text. His dancers, alas, fudged too many moments - a ravishing backward-curving pirouette for one of the men was lost; steps were gabbled beneath rigid torsos. Let them relax, and allow the music to pour through them to shape the dance, and Ashton will look like Ashton. The evening was completed with David Bintley's Flowers of the Forest, very well done. The Hippodrome management, incidentally, deserves its public's thanks for the re-seating of the stalls: sight lines are much improved. The Birmingham Royal Ballet season continues at the Birmingham Hippodrome until October 31.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zheng Yizheng (6774 5030 2973), chief procurator </F> of the Fujian Provincial People's Procuratorate, to the Second  Session of the Eighth Fujian Provincial People's Congress on 14  April 1994: "Work Report of the Fujian Provincial People's  Procuratorate"    [Text] People's Deputies:    I am now going to deliver a report to this congress on the  main facts about the procuratorial work in 1993 and the main  tasks for the procuratorate in 1994 for your deliberation.    In the past year, the provincial procuratorial organs at all  levels, under the leadership of the party committees and under  the supervision of the people's congresses at the same levels,  conscientiously implemented the spirit of the 14th CPC National  Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee; carried out the guideline of "strictly enforcing the  laws and effectively handling cases" in procuratorial work as a  whole according to the spirit and the resolution from the First  Session of the Eighth Provincial People's Congress; intensified  the legal supervisory function; made new progress in all fields  of procuratorial work; and made positive contributions to  maintaining political and social stability and guaranteeing the  smooth development of reform, opening, and economic construction  in this province.  <H5>  I. Concentrate Strength on Handling Major and Serious </H5> Corruption and Bribery Cases    Last year, especially after Comrade Jiang Zemin's important  speech at the second meeting of the CPC Central Discipline  Inspection Commission last August, the procuratorial organs at  all levels resolutely carried out the tasks laid down by the  party central leadership and by the provincial party committee;  vigorously carried out an anticorruption struggle; adopted a  series of measures to crack down on crime more effectively;  handled a number of major and serious criminal cases, including  corruption and bribery cases; and achieved new results in their  work. The procuratorial organs throughout the province placed a  total of 1,876 corruption, bribery, and other criminal cases on  file for investigation and prosecution. Of these, 1,119 were  major cases involving over 10,000 yuan, an increase of 34.5  percent; cases involving between 100,000 and 500,000 yuan  numbered 114; cases involving between 500,000 and 1 million yuan  numbered 22; cases involving over 1 million yuan numbered 13;  and cases involving lawbreaking by cadres at and above the  county and bureau level numbered 52, an increase of 370 percent.  The number of major and serious cases accounted for 62.4 percent  of the total cases placed on file for investigation and  prosecution, a recorrd high. By the end of last year, the  investigation of 1,522 cases had been concluded and involved  1,786 people to be prosecuted. Apart from those still undergoing  investigation for prosecution, and those exempt from prosecution  because of the petty nature of their crimes, prosecutions  against 770 people were brought to the courts. Through handling  these cases, 75.31 million yuan's worth of direct economic  losses caused to the state and the collectives were recovered.    Last year's anticorruption struggle and the actions of  meting  out punishment to those involved in such crimes as corruption  and bribery had the following characteristics:  1. Strength was concentrated on handling major and  serious cases and a number of economic criminal cases involving  huge amounts of money were solved. For example, Zhang  Jianping, head of the first section of the Provincial Foreign  Trade Center Group Minerals and Chemicals Department, accepted  bribes [tan wu 6304 3064] of more than $2.74 million and more  than 640,000 yuan and embezzled [nuo yong 2180 3938] more than  $170,000 of public money. This was the most serious corruption  case in this province since the founding of the PRC. After a  public trial was held, the court sentenced Zhang Jianping to  death. In another case, Zeng Huiyang, a securities dealer with  the Trust and Investment Company of the Construction Bank of  Fujian Province, accepted bribes of 560,000 yuan and embezzled  4.15 million yuan of public money for illegal stock speculation.  After a public trial, the court sentenced Zeng Huiyuan to death  with a reprieve. Cadres at the county and bureau level who were  involved in the corruption and bribery cases on file for  investigation and prosecution numbered 47; and cadres at the  provincial departmental level involved in such cases, numbered  five. These numbers marked an all-time high. In particular, a  major bribery case was cracked in the Min Jiang Hydropower  Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Power Industry. Five  departmental-level cadres, including bureau chief Zhang Chunbao  and bureau party committee secretary Qiao Yanling (both with the  rank of full departmental chief) and 10 bureau-level cadres were  involved in the case. They demanded and took bribes by taking  advantage of their official function in issuing work contracts.  This created strong repercussions inside and outside this  province. The facts revealed in the course of the investigation  of such criminal cases show that if the principal leading cadres  in a department are corrupt and degenerate, crimes there will  certainly be comparatively serious. Therefore, we always gave  priority to the thorough handling of some particularly serious  cases among the major cases.    2. Resolute action was taken to handle criminal  cases which occurred within the party and government leading  organs, the judicial organs, the law enforcement administrative  organs, and the economic management organs. Last year, 756  corruption and bribery cases in these four types of organs were  investigated and handled. Of these, 126 cases were in party and  government leading organs, 180 were in judicial and  law-enforcing administrative organs, and 450 cases were in  economic management organs. The procuratorate in Nanping  Prefecture investigated and handled a major cases involving Qu  Awang and Wei Mingjing, director and deputy director of the  prefecture's hydropower bureau, who were suspected of abusing  their official functions and accepting bribes. The  procuratorate in Quanzhou City investigated and handled the  major case of Lin Wentao and five other customs officials who  were suspected of taking bribes amounting to more than 360,000  yuan and showing favor to smugglers on many occasions by not  checking the smuggled goods. Chen Ganming, deputy director of  the Yunxiao County Public Security Bureau, extorted and accepted  bribes amounting to 34,000 yuan by means of threatening to  arrest some people. Chen, whose dastardly behavior aroused  strong public indignation, was sentenced to life imprisonment  after his trial on the basis of the procuratorial organ's  investigation. The handling of these cases was of great  significance in maintaining the incorrupt nature of the party  and government organs and safeguarding the solemnity of the  state laws.    3. The particularly serious smuggling cases involving  the law enforcement personnel from some administrative organs  were directly investigated and handled according to the relevent  law. Last year, in accordance with Article 13 of the  "Criminal Procedure Law" and the requirements of the "Circular  on Sternly Cracking Down on Smuggling Activities" issued jointly  by the Supreme People's Procuratorate and Supreme People's  Court, the procuratorial organs directly investigated and  handled four particularly serious smuggling cases: In the first  case, Fujian Anhua Development Company participated in smuggling  600 sets of motorcycle parts with a total value of 8.36 million  yuan. The department concerned confiscated the smuggled goods  and imposed a fine on the company but did not transfer the case  to the judicial organ to bring the criminal offenders in the  case to justice. The provincial procuratorate placed the case  on file for investigation and prosecution. The provincial party  committee, the provincial government, and the provincial  people's congress attached great importance to the handling of  this case and strongly supported the procuratorate. After  efforts over one and a half months, the investigation was  concluded and a public indictment was filed to the court. In  the second case, Zhanghai Economic Development Company practiced  fraud when importing 10,000 tonnes of steel products in the name  of 17 foreign-funded enterprises for their own use and then  resold the duty-free goods for 34.7 million yuan, making an  illegal profit of 1.8 million yuan. The company thus caused  6.89 million yuan in losses to the state's customs tariff and  product tax revenue. The Zhangzhou City Procuratorate placed  the case on file for investigation and prosecution and brought  those responsible in the case to justice. In the third case,  Zhanglong Enterprise Co. Ltd. and Zhangan Labor Service Company  collaborated in smuggling 1,000 Hitachi 63-cm color TV sets.  The Zhangzhou City Procuratorate has placed the case on file  for investigation and prosecution. In the fourth case, 12  people, including the leader and members of an anticontraband  team headed by Wang Shaomin, director of the Xiapu County  Industrial and Commercial Administrative Bureau, abused their  official functions by participating in smuggling 899 cartons of  cigarettes worth 2.29 million yuan. The Xiapu County  Procuratorate has concluded investigating the case and has  conducted a public trial. The procuratorial organs' direct  investigation and handling of these smuggling cases played a  positive role in checking the participation by institutions in  smuggling activities and effectively prompting the law  enforcement organs concerned to perform their functions  rigorously.    4. Constant efforts were made to rely on the masses in  performing professional functions. We cannot do without the  people's support in the course of discovering crimes, collecting  evidence, and punishing criminal offenders. Last year, the  procuratorial organs throughout the province received a total of  15,349 items of information and evidence and 11,921 of these  items related to cases currently being handled. More people  provided information using their real names and a larger  proportion of the information was verifiable. The information  provided by ordinary people exposed 69.2 percent of the  corruption, bribery, and other criminal cases on file for  investigation and prosecution in the procuratorates throughout  the province. The procuratorates at all levels adhered to the  principle of "being resolute and prudent and verifying all  evidence" in the course of investigation and employed all legal  means with flexibility to unearth major and serious cases. Last  year, the procuratorial organs in Nanping, Longyan, Fuzhou, and  Quanzhou successfully collected decisive evidence for 14  extremely serious corruption cases, involving more than 300  suspected lawbreakers and over 7 million yuan in ill-gotten  gains. In the course of handling these major cases, 181 related  cases were placed on file for investigation and prosecution, of  which 102 were major cases and 26 were serious cases. The  procuratorial organs also made more effective efforts to round  up criminals at large. Last year, 61 economic criminal  offenders at large were arrested in this province. Ten of these  people were suspects in serious cases involving over 500,000  yuan; four were even suspected in cases involving the huge  amount of over 1 million yuan. In addition, 122 people who had  committed crimes of corruption surrendered themselves to the  procuratorial organs because they were frightened by the power  of the laws.    5. Chief procurators took the lead in handling  cases.We adopted the work system which required that chief  procurators take the lead in handling cases and defined the  responsibilities of chief procurators at various levels for  handling cases of differing seriousness. The chief procurator  of the provincial procuratorate is responsible for handling  serious cases involving over 500,000 yuan and major cases  involving departmental- level cadres; the chief procurators of  the prefectural and city procuratorates are responsible for  handling serious cases involving between 100,000 and 500,000  yuan and major cases involving bureau-level cadres; and the  chief procurators of the county procuratorates are responsible  for handling serious cases involving between 50,000 and 100,000  yuan. Last year, 174 chief procurators and deputy chief  procurators personally directed and participated in the  investigation of 674 corruption, bribery, and other criminal  cases. The chief procurators also personally examined letters  and complaints from the masses and discovered a number of  important clues in some major cases. In the practice of taking  the lead in handling cases, the leaders enhanced their work  ability to make decisions in a democratic and scientific way and  to control the overall work situation.    Last year, the procuratorial organs investigated and handled  286 cases of evading taxes and refusing to pay taxes and 87  cases of counterfeiting trademarks, recovering more than 13  million yuan in direct economic losses to the state and the  collectives.    The cases being investigated and handled in recent years  show  that the seriousness and prominent characteristics of the crimes  of embezzlement and bribery are reflected in the following  facts: First, the criminal cases often involve large amounts of  money and the number of major and serious cases is on the  increase. Second, an extremely small number of leading cadres  abuse the power in their hands in pursuit of private gains,  exchange power for money, and commit serious crimes of  embezzlement and accepting bribes. Third, a small number of  functionaries in the judicial and law enforcement administrative  organs were involved to a serious degree in extorting and  accepting bribes, bending the law, and other irregularities.  Fourth, the incidence of economic crimes increased in some  functional departments which play a key role in regulating the  market economy and in some active economic sectors. Fifth,  there were more criminal activities involving legal persons; in  particular, an extremely small number of law enforcement  institutions were involved to a serious degree in smuggling  activities. Sixth, some new forms of criminal activity appeared  in the stock and securities market and in the real estate  market. Seventh, economic crimes were committed, in many cases,  by people holding concrete power in some specific fields; for  example, those committing crimes of embezzlement were often  people managing money and those extorting and accepting bribes  were often people managing personnel, material, and financial  affairs. Eighth, crimes were committed through collaboration  between insiders and outsiders and between people from different  localities and departments. Ninth, in the departments and  localities where irregularities existed to a serious degree, the  principal leaders were often corrupt and degenerate and the  incidence of crimes was higher. Tenth, many criminal offenders  were motivated by their desire to seek physical pleasures, often  lavishing their ill-gotten gains on leading a dissipated life,  gambling, and visiting prostitutes.    In general, the vast majority of party and state officials  are working honestly and diligently for the benefit of the  general public. However, a small number of seriously corrupt  people certainly exists and we should be fully aware of the harm  and danger their existence poses. As Comrade Jiang Zemin  pointed out, if we take such problems lightly and allow evil to  spread unchecked, then our party and the people's government  will eventually be ruined, as will the great cause of socialist  modernization in our country.    At present, the situation in the anticorruption struggle is  very good and it continues in depth. However, quite a few  problems still remain. The main problems are: The leaders of  some departments and localities still do not properly understand  the necessity to "use both hands to grasp the work and keep both  hands tough," thus they cannot investigate and handle major and  serious criminal cases effectively and the anticorruption  struggle there has not yet achieved good results. In some  places, the local authorities have replaced the laws with their  own oral instructions, using their administrative powers to  interfere in the enforcement of the laws and impeding the  procuratorial organs in their investigation and handling of  major and serious cases. Some units do not transfer the  discovered criminal evidence to the procuratorial organs for  investigation and prosecution. On the other hand, some chief  procurators lack the courage to perform their law enforcement  duties when encountering tough cases; some police officers have  not adapted their law enforcement methods to the needs of the  struggle and have yet to enhance their ability to discover and  verify crimes; some police officers fail to rigorously enforce  the law, or even bend the law, while performing their duties,  thus affecting and disrupting the handling of the cases; the  rate of exemption from prosecution in corruption and bribery  cases is 33.5 percent, which is still too high though it is a  bit lower than in the previous year; and the effectiveness of  the crackdown on crimes has not been markedly improved. In  addition, the local procuratorates are still short of working  funds and their technical equipment, transportation, and  communications remain backward in quality and insufficient in  quantity. This has also affected the efficiency of  investigating and handling major and serious cases. All such  problems and difficulties have to be solved in our future work.    II. Maintaining Stability, Sternly Cracking Down on  Serious Criminal Activities    Persistently inflicting stern and quick penalties on serious  criminal offenders and resolutely cracking down on serious  criminal activities is an important aspect of our efforts to  maintain social stability and is also another key point of the  procuratorial work. Last year, the procuratorates closely  cooperated with the public security organs, the law courts, and  the law enforcement administrative departments in taking  intensive actions to deal with the salient problems in law and  order and to crack down on various crimes.    1. Approving arrest applications and handling cases  transferred by the public security organs for arrest and  prosecution in a timely fashion. Last year, the  procuratorates handled applications submitted by the public  security organs for the arrest of 16,220 suspects and approved  14,395 arrests after examination, an increase of 10.9 percent  over the previous year. The procuratorates handled the cases of  15,327 suspects for prosecution and for exemption from  prosecution transferred from the public security organs and  conducted public trials against 12,062 people, an increase of  6.4 percent. On the other hand, 1,290 people were exempted from  prosecution.    2. Giving priority to cracking down on such vicious  and violent crimes as murder, robbery, rape, causing explosions,  and the illegal use of firearms and cracking down on criminal  gangs with the nature of triads. Last year, the  procuratorates approved the arrest of 5,150 suspects involved in  serious violent crimes and brought 4,137 of them to public  trial, increases of 29.8 and 27.1 percent respectively. The  procuratorates also approved the arrest of 549 members of crime  syndicates and prosecuted 322 of them, increases of 9.8 and 14.6  percent respectively.    3. Taking an active part in the struggle against  highway and railroad robbery, theft, smuggling, illegal  emigration, and prostitution. The procuratorates at all  levels conscientiously carried out the instructions of the  central authorities and the provincial party committee on  suppressing highwaymen and railroad robbers. They dispatched  investigation teams led by chief procurators to key areas and  sections of highways and railroads, cooperating with the  departments concerned in rounding up and suppressing highwaymen  and railroad robbers. Last year, the procuratorates approved  the arrest and pursuit of 1,516 highwaymen and railroad robbers,  increases of 15.6 and 17.6 percent respectively. The  procuratorates in coastal areas intensified the crackdown on  smuggling and illegal emigration and approved the arrest of 101  people suspected of illegal emigration and prosecuted 161 such  criminals (including those arrested during the previous year).  This included the approved arrest of 91 organizers of illegal  emigration (also called "snake heads") and the prosecution 101  such criminals (including those arrested in the previous year).  Action was also taken to punish lawbreakers who committed such  crimes as trafficking in drugs, selling pornographic items,  abducting and kidnapping women and children, and enticing and  forcing women to practice prostitution. The procuratorates  approved the arrest of 391 suspects in such crimes, prosecuting  439 criminals (including those arrested in the previous year).    4. Increasing the advance participation in the  handling of serious criminal cases. The procuratorates  made advance participation in the handling of 2,733 serious  criminal cases from the stage of approving arrests and made  advance participation in the handling of 1,808 serious criminal  cases from the investigation and prosecution stage, increases of  225 and 250 percent respectively. The advance participation in  the investigations and preliminary hearings not only enhanced  the efficiency and quality of the work of approving arrests and  conducting prosecutions but also enabled the procuratorial  personnel to discover facts relating to the cases in good time,  collect sufficient evidence, cooperate with the public security  organs more closely, and supervise the investigation activities  more effectively.    5. Improving the effectiveness of the procuratorial  link in the comprehensive measures for maintaining public  security and public order. Through the public prosecutions  in the courts, the procuratorates played a positive role in  giving publicity to the laws and regulations, helping cadres and  ordinary people increase their understanding of the laws and  regulations and prompting them into abiding by the laws and  regulations. Through handling criminal cases, the  procuratorates also made suggestions to the units where crimes  occurred about removing the hidden perils. The procuratorates  gave more effective reeducation to convicts undergoing reform  through labor and to offenders who were exempted from  prosecution. They also carried out the established measures for  helping and educating offenders exempted from prosecution and  convicts being released after completing their prison terms and  reeducation-through-labor terms by calling on these people and  monitoring their behavior regularly. The procuratorates set up  fixed ties for maintaining law and order with certain factories,  mines, schools, and villages; paid close attention to trends in  society; and organized mass activities of preventing and  cracking down on crimes. The procuratorates conscientiously  carried out the "Law on Protecting Minors" adopted by the  National People's Congress Standing Committee, improved the work  of arrest approval and prosecution involving cases of juvenile  delinquency, and strengthened measures for preventing juvenile  delinquency and for educating and rescuing juvenile delinquents.  The procuratorates conscientiously handled letters and  complaints from the masses and took the initiative in helping  the departments concerned to promptly and properly handle  collective complaints and civil disputes, thus removing various  factors which could affect social stability.    At present, public order in the province is stable on the  whole but the law and order situation remains rather stern. The  hostile forces and individuals within and without the mainland  of China have never stopped their sabotage and secret-stealing  activities; serious criminal cases are still on the increase and  violent criminal cases have been increasing by a big margin; the  activities of crime syndicates in some places remain rampant and  some of these crime syndicates are triads; and factors which can  affect political stability and public order continue to  increase. In law enforcement work, some localities are still  failing to crack down on criminal activities effectively. We  should closely cooperate with the public security and state  security organs, and with the people's courts, in taking  resolute action against counterrevolutionary criminals who  endanger state security in various forms and against serious  criminal offenders, making efforts to safeguard political  stability and public order.  <H5>  III. Performing the Functions in Rigorous Law Enforcement </H5>   Last year, we particularly emphasized rigorous law  enforcement. The procuratorates themselves were required to  rigorously enforce the law and to intensify internal control  over the handling of cases which they directly investigated; on  the other hand, they conscientiously performed the duties of  exercising legal supervision as stipulated by the Constitution  and other laws and intensified the supervision over the law  enforcement work of the other institutions concerned.  1. Intensifying supervision over  investigation.Attention was paid mainly to the phenomena of  not bringing lawbreakers to justice and replacing terms of  imprisonment with fines. The procuratorates rigorously  performed their duty of exercising legal supervision over the  investigation activities of the public security organs. They  also took legal measures to correct the practice of not bringing  lawbreakers to justice or treating innocent people as criminal  offenders, as soon as such problems were discovered. Last year,  in the course of examining the arrest applications and the  prosecution preparations, the procuratorates issued warrants for  the arrest of 223 lawbreakers at large and instituted  prosecutions against 29 criminal suspects who had not been  prosecuted initially; on the other hand, the procuratorates  overruled the arrest of 792 people who had not committed any  crime and whose arrest was unnecessary, decided not to prosecute  66 people who should not have been suspected of having committed  a crime, and returned the cases of 4,359 suspects to the public  security organs for further investigation. The procuratorates  submitted 314 proposals for correcting illegal practices in the  investigation process. Some local procuratorates also  supervised the handling of major criminal cases and took action  according to the laws and regulations to correct the practice of  failing to charge and arrest lawbreakers or replacing necessary  prison sentences with fines. For example, Wang Teh-chin, a  lawbreaker from Taiwan, colluded with six other lawbreakers in  Aoqian Town, Pingtan County, in organizing the illegal  emigration of 112 people and gaining an illegal profit of 1.7  million yuan. Under the legal supervision of the local  procuratorate concerned, the case was properly handled and the  criminals in the case were punished according to law.    2. Intensifying supervision over the trials of  criminal cases and sentencing. Attention was paid mainly to  incorrect court judgments which treated serious crimes as petty  crimes or treated the guilty as innocent, protests being filed  against such judgments. The provincial procuratorate dispatched  special officials to investigate a number of cases in which the  courts announced the innocence of the accused in some  localities. Protests were filed if the court judgments were  found to be incorrect. Last year, the procuratorates filed 50  protests against incorrect court decisions on criminal cases and  put forward 46 proposals to correct the lawbreaking practices in  court hearings.    3. Intensifying discipline supervision over legal  proceedings. Attention was mainly paid to malpractices by  some government functionaries in abusing their powers,  infringing upon people's civil rights, and cases of malfeasance.  Last year, the procuratorates investigated and handled 352  cases of such malpractices as bending the law for private gain,  extorting confessions by torture, effecting illegal detention,  neglecting public duties, and causing serious accidents through  dereliction of duty. Such cases accounted for 81.3 percent of  the lawbreaking cases in the law enforcement field. The  Quanzhou City Procuratorate investigated, in accordance with the  law, the case of Lin Zhaoze and others in the Nanan City Public  Security Bureau, who tortured people under interrogation to  death; the investigation has been concluded and a public trial  held. The Hanjiang District Procuratorate in Putian City  investigated, in accordance with the law, the case of Yao  Yinghuang, a policeman from the Suburban Police Station of the  District Public Security Sub-bureau, who illegally detained and  beat up Chen Guozhang, a people's deputy in Putian County. A  public trail was held and the court sentenced Yao ot one year's  imprisonment, suspended for 18 months.    4. Intensifying supervision over prisons and places  for reeducating convicts. Attention was paid mainly to  such lawbreaking cases as prison management personnel who  practiced corruption, took bribes, performed corporal punishment  and mistreatment prisoners, releasing prisoners illegally, and  neglecting official duties. Supervision over court decisions in  criminal cases and the implementation of such decisions was also  strengthened. The procuratorates corrected the illegal and  unwarranted detention of 70 people, the illegal release of 61  people, and the continuing imprisonment of 18 people who should  have been released. They also corrected the handling of 23  convicts who were improperly released on parole, whose prison  terms were improperly decreased or increased, and who were  released on bail for medical treatment. The procuratorates gave  advice on correcting the illegal practices in prison management,  including illegally prolonging the prison terms of some  convicts. As some prisons and places of correction ordered  convicts or their families to pay unfair and irregular charges  and fees, the procuratorates investigated such problems and  promptly checked such practices. At the same time, the  procuratorates cooperated with the correction institutions in  resolutely suppressing convicts who took the lead in resisting  prison management and acting as overlords among their fellow  prisoners. Prosecutions were brought against 178 convicts who  were undergoing reform through labor or receiving reeducation  through labor when they committed new crimes while serving their  sentences.  5. Intensifying procuratorial supervision over the  handling of civil and administrative cases. Attention was  paid mainly to lodging protests against incorrect court  judgments in civil, economic, and administrative disputes. Last  year, the procuratorates handled 541 such appeals, placed 121  cases on file for investigation, and finished the investigation  of 115 cases. They lodged protests against the court decisions  on 33 of these cases to the procuratorates at the higher levels  and lodged protests on 24 cases to courts, with different  decisions being made by the courts. At the same time, serious  action was taken against the court personnel who made incorrect  judgments in civil cases by perverting justice after accepting  bribes and private gains. Xue Lizhi, deputy chief judge of the  Pingtan County Court, and Lin Maohao, an assistant judge of the  court, accepting 20,000 yuan in bribes when handling a debt  dispute case. They thus practiced fraud and bent the law when  making the judgment. The procuratorate concerned investigated  the case and brought a prosecution against the court officials.  They were sentenced to imprisonment for five and six years  respectively. The procuratorate also lodged a protest against  the first court judgment on the civil case.    6. Intensifying procuratorial supervision over the  handling of appeals. Attention was paid mainly to  reexamining the handling of appeals against decisions on  exemptions from prosecution and against court decisions in  criminal cases. Last year, the procuratorial organs handled 552  initial appeals within their jurisdiction, gave replies to 276  appeals, placed 182 criminal appeals on file for reexamination,  and corrected the decisions on 38 cases. Of the appeals, 151  were against the decision on exemption from prosecution and the  original decision on 32 cases was changed; three were criminal  appeals against the sentences made by the courts and one case  was retried by the court and the original sentence was changed.    Through intensifying supervision over law enforcement the  procuratorates played a positive role in prompting the  departments concerned to rigorously enforce the law,  guaranteeing the unified and correct enforcement of the state  law, and protecting the democratic and personal rights of the  citizens. However, they still could not fully perform the  function of exercising legal supervision and their supervision  was still not effective enough. The environment and conditions  for rigorous law enforcement have yet to be improved. The new  situation of establishing the socialist market economy urgently  requires rigorous law enforcement. The established laws must be  followed and rigorously enforced and those who violate the law  must be brought to justice. Therefore, it is necessary to carry  out legal supervision more effectively.  <H5>  IV. Setting Strict Demands on the Procuratorial Personnel </H5> and Guaranteeing Their Integrity and Ability    Over the past year, the procuratorates at all levels  persistently carried out the principle of strictly performing  procuratorial functions according to law and made great effort  to improve their work and enhance the political and professional  quality of the procuratorial personnel.    In order to guarantee the integrity of the procuratorial  personnel, we adopted five main measures: First, we required  leading cadres to carry out serious self-examination and  self-correction, strictly in accordance with the five-point  anticorruption self-discipline requirements laid down by the  central authorities. Second, we resolutely investigated and  handled lawbreaking and violation of discipline cases occurring  among procuratorial personnel, never shielding the evildoers or  concealing the problems. Last year, we handled 32 such cases,  three of which were criminal cases. Zheng Lilin, an assistant  procurator of the Gulou District Procuratorate in Fuzhou City,  accepted bribes and then absconded to avoid punishment. He is  still on the wanted list. Liu Tong, an assistant procurator from  the Longyan City Procuratorate, joined others engaging in  illicit coal trading and evading taxes. He was sentenced to six  months' detention. Third, we resolutely checked and corrected  the illegal practice of abusing the procuratorial functions by  levying irregular charges. Some grass-roots procuratorates  charged fees for exempting from prosecution, fees for criminal  investigations, guarantee money for repentance and bail,  amounting to a total of 154,600 yuan. All the money has been  returned to those who paid it. Fourth, we seriously screened  and reorganized the business companies run by procuratorates.  The procuratorates throughout the province once ran 36 business  companies; 23 have been closed down, 11 were transferred to  other institutions, and two are still being handled. Fifth, we  conscientiously implemented the "Circular on Strictly Enforcing  Discipline and Rigorously Enforcing the Laws in Law Enforcement  Departments" issued by the Central Commission on Politics and  Law, further establishing and perfecting anticorruption rules  and regulations, strengthening the work of discipline inspection  and supervision, and improving the internal supervisory  mechanisms.    Strengthening ideological and political work. Cadres and  policemen were organized to study the third volume of the  "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" so that they could arm their  minds with the theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. They were also organized in studying the  theoretical knowledge about the socialist market economic  structure in order to enhance their firmness and consciousness  in carrying out the party's basic line. Education was given to  all procuratorial personnel on the issues of rigorous law  enforcement, procuratorial discipline, the principle of serving  the people wholeheartedly, and honestly performing official  duties. Publicity was given to the progressive and exemplary  deeds of the procuratorial personnel who performed official  duties honestly, faithfully, and with selfless dedication and  advanced collectives and individuals in various aspects of the  procuratorial work, especially in the forefront of case  handling, were commended. Through the establishment of the chief  procurator training system, procuratorial diploma courses were  given to procuratorial personnel and professional training was  organized in various forms and through various channels.  Education and training for cadres were strengthened.    Last year, the election of new leading bodies in grass-roots  procuratorates throughout the province was completed. A number  of outstanding young and middle-aged cadres, with integrity and  ability and with professional knowledge and practical  experience, were elected as chief procurators. The leading  bodies in the grass-roots procuratorates were consolidated and  strengthened.    Last year, according to the Supreme People's Procuratorate  instructions, tax affairs procuratorial offices, mainly at the  township level, were consolidated and improved. The management  systems and the organizational structure were improved so that  they functioned more effectively.    Over the past year, the vast number of procuratorial cadres  and police officers in this province demonstrated a high morale  and good working style while facing arduous tasks and difficult  conditions. They were tempered in the anticorruption struggle  and stood tests in that struggle. A number of advanced  collectives and individuals emerged in the work and they made  outstanding contributions to the improvement of the  procuratorial work in all aspects.  <H5>  V. Implementing the "Regulations" and Conscientiously </H5> Accepting the Supervision By the People's Congress    Last year, the procuratorial organs at all levels  conscientiously implemented the "Regulations on Subjecting the  Procuratorial Organs to Supervision by the People's Congresses  and Their Standing Committees" laid down by the Supreme People's  Procuratorate and subjected their work to supervision by the  state power organs. First, continuing to pursue the effective  systems of giving regular work reports, special reports on  important issues, immediate reports on major cases, and advance  reports on personnel changes. Last year, the provincial  people's congress standing committee held the chairman's meeting  and the fourth plenary meeting to listen to the provincial  procuratorate reports on cracking down on the crime's of  corruption and bribery. The meetings also emphasized the need  to bring the functions of the procuratorial organs into better  play. This played an important role in guiding and promoting the  work of the procuratorates in the process of rigorous law  enforcement and effective case handling.    Some local  procuratorates set up the system of keeping a namelist of local  people's deputies and keeping regular contacts with them. They  included the activities of contacting people's deputies in their  routine work plans and made concrete arrangements for this.  Second, chief procurators attended the meetings of the people's  congress standing committees as observers, resolutely carried  out the resolutions and decisions adopted by the people's  congress standing committees, and conscientiously accepted the  law enforcement inspections by the people's congress standing  committees. They also seriously considered the opinions of the  people's congress standing committees and promptly adopted  measures for solving the problems discovered during the  inspections. Third, the procuratorates conscientiously  considered the opinions expressed by people's deputies and the  measures passed by the people's congresses. They assigned  special cadres to take charge of cases and other affairs,  including the motions, proposals, criticisms, and opinions  transferred from the people's congresses. They also gave quick  feedback to the people's congresses. Through accepting  supervision by the people's congresses and their standing  committees, we deeply felt that such supervision was supportive  of our work and, only under the supervision of the state's power  organs, could the procuratorial organs correctly and effectively  perform their functions and fully play a role in exercising  legal supervision.    People's deputies:    In 1994, the general tasks for the whole party and the whole  nation is to grasp the opportunity, deepen the reform, expand  opening, promote development, and maintain stability. The  procuratorial work must be properly oriented to the needs of  these general tasks and must serve their general fulfillment.  At the provincial chief procurators meeting earlier this year,  we fixed our main tasks for the year: Under the guidance of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, we must: Conscientiously carry out the  spirit of the 3d Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee and the instructions by the central leadership on  struggling against corruption; persistently carry out the  principle of "using both hands to grasp the work and keeping  both hands tough"; strengthen the legal supervision function;  rigorously enforce the laws and regulations; effectively handle  cases; concentrate strength on investigating and handling major  criminal cases of corruption and bribery, criminal cases  involving legal persons, and cases of not rigorously enforcing  laws; sternly crack down on serious criminal activities; take an  active part in the comprehensive activities of maintaining law  and order in society; safeguard political stability and public  order; create a benign law environment for reform, opening, and  modernization in this province; and promote the establishment  and development of the socialist market economic structure.    1. In the anticorruption struggle, continue to  concentrate strength on investigating and handling major and  serious cases. Priority is to be given to investigating and  handling criminal cases involving party and government leading  organs, leading cadres, the judicial institutions, the law  enforcement administrative institutions, the economic management  institutions, and their personnel; especially the criminal cases  of corruption and bribery among leading cadres, cases of bending  the law by judicial and law enforcement administrative personnel  in the course of law enforcement, and the criminal cases  involving legal persons. Top priority is to be given to  handling the most important serious cases and the most important  major cases and such cases must be handled conscientiously. No  matter who is involved in such cases, the investigations must be  thoroughly carried out without leniency. It is necessary to  sort out the available evidence and information promptly,  especially that related to major and serious cases. Attention  should be paid to the comprehensive and flexible employment of  various legal investigation means and efforts should be made to  collect decisive evidence. The provincial procuratorate and the  prefectural and city procuratorates should organize, direct, and  inspect the investigation and handling of major and serious  cases more effectively. They should supervise and guide the  work of their immediate subordinates, thus advancing the  struggle in depth, step by step, by removing obstacles and  resistance.    2. Persistently carry out the principle of inflicting  severe and quick punishments on serious criminal offenders  according to law and sternly cracking down on serious criminal  activities. Priority is to be given to cracking down on  such crimes of violence as murder, robbery, rape, causing  explosions, and stealing firearms and cracking down on crime  syndicates, especially triads. Arrests and prosecutions should  be carried out as quickly as possible according to law so that  severe punishments can be inflicted on the criminals through  cooperation with the departments concerned. We must take an  active part in the struggle to crack down on crime syndicates,  solve major cases, and round up criminals at large. We must  also participate in cracking down on highway and railroad  robbery, thefts, abduction, prostitution, smuggling, and illegal  emigration. The procuratorial work related to state security  will be strengthened and severe action will be taken against  criminals who endanger our social and political stability in  various ways. At the same time, the procuratorial link in the  comprehensive management of public security will also be  strengthened.    3. Intensify law enforcement supervision and correct  the problems of not strictly enforcing the law. Attention  will be paid to uncovering various phenomena of not following  the legal procedures in handling cases and not strictly  enforcing the law. We will shortly advance proposals on  correcting such practices. In particular, we shall investigate  and handle such criminal cases among the judicial and  administrative law enforcing personnel as abusing power, bending  the law to seek private gain, shielding evildoers, extorting  confessions by means of torture, effecting illegal detention,  mistreating or employing corporal punishment on people in jail  or under detention, covering up criminal facts, providing false  evidence, and harboring criminals, resolutely bringing such  lawbreakers to justice.    4. Consolidate the contingent of the procuratorial  personnel and enhance their integrity and law enforcement  ability. We will earnestly study the third volume of the  "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," arm our minds with the theory  on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and  continuously enhance the integrity and ability of the  procuratorial cadres and police officers. We must seriously  deal with the corrupt phenomena existing among the procuratorial  personnel and resolutely investigate and handle the lawbreaking  and violation of discipline cases among them. At the same time,  we will persistently carry out the principle of "running the  procuratorates and performing the procuratorial functions  strictly according to law." We will conduct reeducation on  ideals, beliefs, and principles fo all procuratorial personnel  and will require them to strictly abide by laws and discipline,  rigorously enforce the laws and regulations, and handle cases in  a correct manner. We will also conduct discipline and  professional ethical education for them and establish and  perfect the concrete anticorruption rules for the procuratorial  personnel, the responsibility system for case handling, and  various rules and regulations for internal supervision and  self-discipline.    People's deputies: The people's procuratorates at all levels  in this province and all procuratorial cadres and police  officers will, under the effective leadership of the party  committees and under the supervision of the people's congresses  and their standing committees, will continue to make greater  achievements in their work, overcome difficulties, and make new  and solid progress in the effective and efficient handling of  cases, the rigorous enforcement of the laws and regulations, and  in doing down-to-earth work to perform the procuratorial  function in all aspects.</p>

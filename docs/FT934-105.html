			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Back to Britain The US is giving Little America back to Britain, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. The Burtonwood airbase at Warrington in Cheshire will be formally handed over in April. At its peak, shortly after the second world war, Burtonwood's 600 acres housed 18,000 Americans, making it the biggest single site for US personnel in Britain. The last symbol of those days is a 2m sq ft warehouse leased from the Ministry of Defence for more than half a century. The US is spending Pounds 2m refurbishing it, having vacated it in October. The site is to be developed as a business park for inward investors. Its location in what became known as Little America is to be promoted all over the US to attract companies, playing on wartime memories.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Angola governmentand Unita in talks Angolan government and Unita rebel delegates met alone behind closed doors yesterday at peace talks in Ivory Coast, Reuter reports from Adbijan. United Nations mediators and official observers from the US, Russia and Portugal agreed to stay away from the conference room during the first private discussions between the warring parties. The Abidjan talks, formally opened on Monday under UN auspices, are aimed at stopping fighting which erupted after Unita rejected its defeat in last September's elections. Although all sides have reported a good atmosphere, progress was slow and a UN official said the Angolans were avoiding divisive matters that would 'poison the situation.' The Angolan government said it had sharply revalued the kwanza, the national currency. The state news agency Angop reported that as of Wednesday the official exchange rate was adjusted to 4,000 kwanza to the dollar from the previous 7,000 exchange rate. The street market rate is above 10,000 kwanza to the dollar. The adjustment had long been expected following a controversial and unsuccessful move by the previous finance minister, Mr Salomao Xirimbimbi, to align the official and parallel market rates which effectively devalued the kwanza. He was sacked last month and replaced by Emanuel Carneiro.</p>

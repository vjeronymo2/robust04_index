			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 2 May (MTI) -- As many as 7.8 million  citizens will have the opportunity to vote on May 8, with half a  million of them as first-time voters.    Hungary's electoral system incorporates both a simple  majority system as used in Britain and France, and a  proportionate system, applied in other European states. This  combined method is completed by an admission threshold similar  to Germany's. The 1989 Hungarian Election Act originally set  forth four percent of the votes for each party as a minimum for  gaining entrance into Parliament. In January 1994, this minimum  was raised to five percent.    The electoral law has undergone minor changes since 1989.  Keeping the principle of proportionate representation in view,  the law aims at preventing mandates from being scattered among  too many parties. To achieve this, a two-round electoral system  was introduced, enabling the electorate to vote for individuals  as well as for party lists. This year, the first round will be  on May 8, and the second on May 29.    As in 1990, of 386 seats rivalled for, 176 will be filled by  candidates in individual constituencies, whose lists were drawn  up after April 9. (Each constituency consists of 60,000  eligible voters.) 152 deputies will be elected on regional  party lists and 58 on national party lists.    Under the Act, candidates can either be put up by parties  and  other political organizations, or enter the elections  independently. To be qualified as a candidate, at least 750  recommendations have to be collected beforehand.    This year, 130 parties wished to enter their candidates. In  1990, twelve parties were able to draw up national lists and six  reached the four percent threshold.    To win the first round and consequently a mandate,  candidates  have to poll over 50 percent of the votes. (In 1990, there were  only five first-round winners.) If none of the candidates  obtain an absolute majority, a run-off will follow with all  candidates reaching 15 percent in the first round. Should fewer  candidates poll the 15 percent minimum, the top three are  eligible for the second round. As a result, losers of the first  round still play a determining role, as they can encourage their  supporters to back another candidate in the second leg.    Under the Election Act, campaigning must be suspended for 24  hours preceding the election.    Voting is not an obligation but a right in Hungary as in  most  European states. Polls show that with the elections  approaching, the number of citizens who are willing to vote and  have considered their choice is growing. In 1990, the turnout  was 63 percent in the first round of the general elections, and  46 percent in the second. Analysts and polls forecast a 65-70  percent participation rate for this year.    Under the act, besides fielding individual candidates,  parties also draw up regional lists in 19 counties and Budapest.  A party is qualified to put forward a regional list if it  fields a candidate in at least 25 percent of individual  constituencies of the given region. 152 seats are available  through such lists.    To lose the minimum amount of total votes, 58 members of  parliament are elected through national lists, which can be  drawn up by parties having at least seven regional lists out of  20. All the fractional votes are to be distributed among  national-list candidates.    On April 11, the National Electoral Committee (OVB) drew  lots  for the 15 parties which have put up a national list for the May  8 parliamentary elections. Accordingly, the order of the  parties is as follows: Liberal Civic Alliance (Entrepreneurs'  Party), Christian Democratic People's Party, Independent  Smallholders' Party, National Democratic Alliance, Hungarian  Democratic Forum, Hungarian Socialist Party, Workers' Party,  Agrarian Association, Republic Party, Hungarian Life and Justice  Party, Green Party of Hungary, Social Democratic Party of  Hungary, Alliance of Free Democrats, Federation of Young  Democrats, United Smallholders' Party.    This order will be of significance if two or more parties  win  an equal number of fractional votes in their national lists. In  this case, the party which is placed further ahead wins the  mandate. The OVB decided to grant 21,000 forints (HUF) to all  4,164 individual and party-list candidates. Parliament  earmarked HUF100 million for the purpose. Of this sum, the OVB  laid aside more than HUF3 million on reserve.    The final results are expected only after the second round.  As previously mentioned, of the 386 seats rivalled for, 176  will be filled by individual candidates. 152 deputies will be  elected on regional party lists and 58 on national party lists.    According to the National Electoral Committee, the parties  have entered 1,903 individual candidates. The Hungarian  Socialist Party has put up 176 candidates, the Hungarian  Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats 175 each,  the Federation of Young Democrats 174, the Christian Democratic  People's Party 164, the Independent Smallholders' Party 157, the  Workers' Party 156, the Agrarian Association 134, the Republic  Party 84, the Liberal Civic Alliance (Entrepreneurs' Party) 69,  the Hungarian Life and Justice Party 68, the National Democratic  Alliance 59, the Social Democratic Party of Hungary 56, the  United Smallholders' Party 54, the Green Party of Hungary 20,  the Conservative Party 13, the Hungarian Market Party 8, the  Compromise Smallholders' Party 7, the Family Alliance and the  Green Alternative 5 each, the Democratic Coalition, the  Solidarity Party of Gypsies and the Democratic Party 4 each, the  Independent Hungarian Democratic Party and the Social Democratic  Party 3 each, the Party of Hungarian Naturopaths and the  Historical Smallholders' Party 2 each, the Party of the  Hungarian Jobless, the National Party of Hungarian Mothers, the  Pensioners' Party, the Movement of National Forces, the  Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the Party for Historical  Hungary, the Peace Party of Hungarian Gypsies, and the Party of  Hungarian Interests 1 each. Independent candidates number 104.</p>

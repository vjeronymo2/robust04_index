			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Aerospace Eng dives Pounds 271,000 into loss Exceptional charges of Pounds 391,000 relating to cost-cutting and reorganisation threw Aerospace Engineering into the red in the six months to October 31. The Wiltshire-based specialist engineer reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 271,000 for the period, against profits last time of Pounds 1.38m. Turnover declined to Pounds 15.1m (Pounds 18.2m). Mr John Davies, chairman, said the outcome for the second half was 'unlikely to improve' on the first six months. 'I do not now believe that we will see any significant upturn in trading during the current year' he stated. The group has made efforts to reduce borrowings and plans to sell certain 'non-core' assets. Interest charges during the period amounted to Pounds 736,000 (Pounds 609,000). Losses per share emerged at 0.47p (earnings of 2.55p); the interim dividend is cut from 1.56p to 0.5p.</p>

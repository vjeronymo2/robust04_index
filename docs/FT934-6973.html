			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Equity Markets: Hopes of recovery face test - London The focus of attention on the London stock market will swing back towards the corporate front this week as the pre-Budget equity account draws to a close and US markets close down for Thanksgiving Day. Company results have yet to produce the signs of business recovery the stock market has been seeking throughout this year. But this week could prove a turning point. The City's - and Downing Street's - hopes for a consumer-led economic recovery will be put to the test when Allied-Lyons, Northern Foods, Kwik Save and Tate &amp; Lyle deliver their latest trading figures. Overhanging the brewery and food sectors is the threat of changes in VAT or excise duties in the Budget which Mr Kenneth Clarke will deliver only days after the companies report profits, and just before the Christmas selling season. Northern Foods, high quality, domestically-orientated and an important supplier to Marks &amp; Spencer and other high street leaders, has paid the penalty for these characteristics by underperforming the stock market in the past 12 months. Any good news from Northern Foods will be welcome but the market is not enthusiastic, aiming for a rise of under 7 per cent to around Pounds 73m pre-tax. From Allied-Lyons, a dull statement seems to be the best hope. The group is perceived as facing a tough business environment, retail margin pressures and nervousness over Mr Clarke's intentions for drink taxes. But a straw in the wind may have been Whitbread's revelation last week that pub food was the prime boost to its profits expansion. The market's response to Allied-Lyons' statement will set the pace for Grand Metropolitan, Guinness and the other leaders of the sector. Tate and Lyle, the world's largest sugar company and a big player in the US, will offer valuable evidence on the progress of economic recovery across the Atlantic. UK investors might be behind the times here, since the shares were badly hit by a fairly cautious trading statement from the board last September. Market expectations of full-year profits are tightly bunched around Pounds 220m. Analysts are looking for Pounds 125m - Pounds 128m from Kwik Save, the discount supermarket group. The shares have underperformed even the badly mauled food retailing sector recently, caught between price cutting initiatives of the leading chains and the exposure given to the new discounting groups. Analysts will be focusing on the growth in like-for-like sales and margins. PROSPECTIVE P/E RATIO The latest prospective p/e ratio for the '500' index for calendar 1993 is 16.0 according to IBES, the consensus estimates service (last week: 16.1). This compares with an IBES estimated p/e for the '500' of 20.6 (20.7) for calendar 1992. The official FT calculation of the historic p/e, based on the latest reported earnings, is 19.87 (19.79).</p>

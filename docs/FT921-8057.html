			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Observer: Fine-graded At the mention of any big job in British television up pops the name of Michael Grade. There have been endless rumours, for example, that the ITV companies are desperate to recruit the Channel 4 chief as their central scheduler responsible for masterminding the Pounds 500m plus programme budget. Yesterday Grade came as close as he ever will to ruling himself out of the running for this post. 'I ought at this stage to make it quite clear that despite all rumours to the contrary I am not considering taking the new central scheduler job. To quote Sam Goldwyn 'Include Me Out'.' Clearly, Grade is constrained by Channel 4's golden handcuffs and he also wants to see his channel successfully selling its airtime in competition with ITV. However, some believe that Grade is playing an even longer game and has his eye on the top job at the Beeb. He seemed to be lining up for audition for that job at yesterday's FT cable and satellite conference. By praising the BBC governors for realising that it was time to stop concentrating so much on news and current affairs and move more money into popular programmes, he is setting himself up as the man for the job if John Birt were ever to stumble.</p>

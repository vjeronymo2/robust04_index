			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Right-wing violence flares up RENEWED violence against asylum-seekers has flared again in east Germany, Leslie Colitt writes from Berlin. For the third day, nearly 100 young right-wing extremists hurled incendiary bombs, fireworks and stones at a hostel for asylum-seekers in Quedlinburg, Saxony-Anhalt, late on Wednesday night. Police arrested 71 youths, one of whom is being frisked in the picture above. About 200 local people looked on as the assault took place. Some shouted encouragement but most stood passively, according to the authorities.</p>

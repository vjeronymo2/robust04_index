			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> Swing Shift (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.) shows that unpredictable and  refreshing filmmaker, Jonathan Demme, seemingly hamstrung by his star, Goldie  Hawn, in a World War II era feminist home-front comedy-drama that should have  been much better. Christine Lahti, as usual, steals every scene in sight.  </P> <P> Every Which Way But Loose (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.), the biggest box-office  hit of star Clint Eastwood's career, also inspired Norman Mailer's memorable  essay on Eastwood's cinematic cool. It's the one with Eastwood as bare-knuckle  boxer Philo Beddoe, who's better at charming orangutans (named Clyde) than  women, and it's low-pressure, easy-riding entertainment.  </P> <P> Some Like It Hot (Channel 11 Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.) is, natch, Billy Wilder's  all-time champ of a comedy, with Prohibition gangsters, desperate musicians in  drag, and Marilyn Monroe as "Sugar Kane" -- whom an admiring Jack Lemmon  describes as "Jell-O on springs."  </P> <P> Buffs eager for glimpses of the young Kim Basinger might want to examine the  1981 Katie: Portrait of a Centerfold (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.), in which  director Robert Greenwald and a slightly camp cast (Dorothy Malone, Fabian, Tab  Hunter and Don Johnson) try to give us the inside dirt on nude modeling. Others  beware.  </P> <P> Big Shots (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 p.m.) is a mind-boggling  ludicrous 1987 stab at mixing children and crime: a kind of John Hughes road  movie, with two underage boys, one black, one white, improbably driving  cross-country, in the midst of the usual murder and carnage. Robert Mandel  directs -- we hope with a twinge of shame.  </P> <P> For those who believe TV advertising is taking over the movies, writer-director  Michael Crichton's vapid sci-fi sex thriller Looker (Channel 13 Saturday at 6  p.m.) offers disturbing proof. It seems to be about a sinister conspiracy to  make holograms of beautiful women and kill people, but it's shot as if it were  a long advertisement for some product that's never revealed. A bevy of beauties  and stars -- including Albert Finney, James Coburn, Susan Dey and even Vanna  White -- all peddle their wares, coldly.  </P> <P> In Penitentiary III (Channel 13 Saturday at 8 p.m.) Jamaa Fanaka's sequel to  his earlier jail thrillers, Leon Isaac Kennedy, the pawn of rival police and  Mafia boxing teams, proves that three-time losers get the worst of it.  </P> <P> That venerable and much-loved husband-wife acting team, Hume Cronyn and Jessica  Tandy, take center stage in Hallmark Hall of Fame's Foxfire (CBS Saturday at 9  p.m.), director Jud Taylor's film adaptation of the spare but heartwarming  play, written by Cronyn and Susan Cooper, about an elderly Appalachian couple,  humanity's seasons and loves that survive death. Tandy won both the Tony and  Emmy for this part.  </P></p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Berlusconi suspends talks on forming a government Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate, yesterday suspended talks on the formation of a new government after failing to convince the members of his rightwing political alliance to join him in a coalition. The suspension brings to an end only the first phase of manoeuvring among the three parties which won the most seats in last week's general election, but the announcement sent Italian government bond futures into a tailspin in late trading on Liffe, London's futures exchange. Changing his negotiating tack, Mr Berlusconi, who heads the rightwing Freedom Alliance, said talks would resume once Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the Italian president, had chosen a new prime minister. He cannot do that until after parliament reconvenes on April 15. Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia, the populist Northern League and the neo-fascist National Alliance will have a majority in the lower chamber of Italy's parliament when the new deputies take their seats, and a near-majority in the upper house. But the electoral pact between the three parties has been threatened since the election by internal tension, heightened by the repeated acid comments of Mr Umberto Bossi, the League leader. He criticised Mr Berlusconi's suspension of the talks, suggesting that the media magnate had 'lost his nerve'. Mr Berlusconi yesterday called off a meeting between senior League and Forza Italia officials, due to take place today. 'We're not going to go to the League, nor anywhere else,' he said. 'We're not betraying them, we're waiting for the president to give his opinion.' Earlier Mr Bossi accused the leader of Forza Italia, who also controls a clutch of television stations, of manipulating public opinion. He also criticised Mr Berlusconi for bringing a non-politician - Mr Gianni Letta, a senior executive of Fininvest, his media and publishing group - to a meeting last week between the League and Forza Italia. Mr Bossi had snubbed Mr Berlusconi by not attending that meeting. Talks among the parties do not have to begin until Mr Scalfaro has chosen someone to form a government. Mr Berlusconi's new tactic could calm the situation, but it could put pressure on Mr Bossi to apologise for his attacks. International bonds, Page 28</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: INTIMATE HISTORY OF AN ARTFUL LIFE WON'T BE  ON DISPLAY AT THIS MUSEUM  </P> <P> Alice Goldfarb Marquis does not think of herself as a muckraker.  </P> <P> She's a historian, a visiting scholar at UC San Diego, a former newspaper  publisher who earned a midlife doctorate and dedicated herself to serious  research.  </P> <P> Four years ago she decided to chronicle the life and artistic times of the late  Alfred H. Barr Jr., the reserved but iron-willed connoisseur who bestrode the  art world from 1927 to 1969 as founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in  New York.  </P> <P> The result was "Alfred H. Barr Jr.: Missionary for the Modern." The New York  Times called it a "superlative job" of capturing Barr's personality and the  savagery of art world in-fighting.  </P> <P> The reaction at MOMA has been cool. The book will not be included in the  museum's Christmas catalogue, nor will it be sold in the bookstore.  </P> <P> Marquis says she had been assured that MOMA was interested. A MOMA spokeswoman  said the museum never carries biographies, although she declined to explain.  </P> <P> Marquis suspects the museum lions are annoyed because the book discusses Barr's  coolness, his asexual manner, and his fondness for catering to the whims of  rich patrons. She also includes heretofore hush-hush financial information.  </P> <P> The museum stonewalled her efforts to obtain purchase figures for individual  art works. Luckily, much of Barr's private correspondence is being catalogued  by the Smithsonian Institution and thus is open to the public.  </P> <P> "Getting information out of the museum about money is about as easy as getting  inside the Stealth fighter," said Marquis. "Museums love to tell the public how  poor they are and how they need support, but they're reluctant to talk real  money."  </P> <P> Marquis, 59, once published weekly newspapers in the South Bay. Since joining  academe, she has published her doctoral thesis on Marcel Duchamp and a book on  the 1930s, "Hopes and Ashes."  </P> <P> "I remember growing up in New York, spending hours at the museum and thinking  what a wonderful man Alfred Barr must be," she said. "It bugs me that the  people who now run the museum have decided that I should be the target of  censorship."  </P> <P> </P> <P> FBI Agent Stays Off Silberman's Case  </P> <P> Retired FBI agent William F. Roemer Jr., one-time head of the bureau's  organized crime unit in Chicago, says he turned down an offer to help the  defense in the Dick Silberman money-laundering trial.  </P> <P> In his recently published book, "Roemer: Man Against the Mob," Roemer says he  was asked for help by Silberman's attorney, James Brosnahan, but declined  because he has a policy against working on the opposite side of his former FBI  colleagues.  </P> <P> Roemer said he had never heard of Silberman but is well-acquainted with the  record of co-defendant Chris Petti. "I remember Chris when he was a minor  burglar in Chicago," he said.  </P> <P> He won't comment on the merits of the case, but he predicted that Brosnahan's  expected challenge to the "roving" wiretap law that was used against Silberman  will fail.  </P> <P> He noted that, although the law is new, the process is not. The FBI bugged  seven public telephones in Tucson to get information to convict mobster Joe  Bonanno, Roemer said.  </P> <P> "The statute may be new, but the whole idea of tapping public phones has been  tested and upheld in court," Roemer said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Park Pigeons Go on Reduction Diet  </P> <P> Take the item and run.  </P> <P> * News from the avian birth control division.  </P> <P> The pigeon population at Balboa Park is down to about 850. Three years ago it  was 4,000 to 5,000; droppings were at high tide and rising.  </P> <P> That's when the city hired Lloyd Pest Control to begin spreading around  contraceptive-laden corn meal. The results are now in: pigeon pregnancies are  as rare as Charger touchdowns.  </P> <P> * Lest you think opera is for wimps:  </P> <P> Alexander Morozov was one of the few partygoers at Monday night's Sea World  bash for Soviet arts festival performers who could consistently sling the  sledgehammer hard enough to ring the bell in a test-of-strength game.  </P> <P> Morozov, bass soloist from Leningard's Kirov Opera, plays the title role in  "Boris Godunov."  </P></p>

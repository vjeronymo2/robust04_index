			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE CITES DEFENDANT'S HANDLING OF OWN CASE IN DENYING HE IS UNFIT  </P> <P> David Michael Murray opened his defense on 12 counts of fraud Monday by asking  Ventura County Superior Court Judge Kenneth R. Yegan to declare him mentally  incompetent to stand trial.  </P> <P> Yegan denied the motion.  </P> <P> "After having observed you throughout this trial, it's clear to me that you  certainly are competent to stand trial and to act as your own attorney," Yegan  said. "You are doing as good a job as any lawyer, with some exceptions in some  cases where you don't have the code sections down."  </P> <P> Then the judge smiled slightly, as he has frequently while watching Murray  manage his own defense.  </P> <P> The 31-year-old Murray is accused of defrauding Ventura County business people  of goods and services, including hotel rooms, clothing, a bicycle and a  blood-coagulant medicine to treat his hemophilia.  </P> <P> Authorities say Murray was arrested while posing at Nordhoff High School in  Ojai as Shi Stone, the 17-year-old son of an Air Force colonel wounded in the  Panama invasion.  </P> <P> During his opening statement, Murray said that the facts could be interpreted  several ways and that several people could be responsible for the crimes.  </P> <P> Acting as his own lawyer, Murray began questioning defense witnesses Monday  with the same articulate, if hesitant, confidence that he showed while  cross-examining prosecution witnesses during the first five days of the trial.  </P> <P> Murray often objected during cross-examination by Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles R.  Roberts Sr., and Yegan frequently upheld the objections on grounds that  witnesses were testifying to more than they were asked or that Roberts'  questions were improper.  </P> <P> Yegan also sustained objections by Roberts about Murray's vague or improper  questions. For instance, Murray asked a re-called prosecution witness, "Did  anything occur to you after you left the stand the first time that you felt  like you should have mentioned?"  </P> <P> Murray has also offered his own probation report as evidence, even though it  describes a 1980 fraud arrest that charged him with defrauding Carol Moynahan  of $3,000 and a new Mustang while posing as Steven Randall Stringer, an Exxon  oil surveyor afflicted with leukemia.  </P> <P> Murray proceeded gamely, always addressing Yegan as "your honor" and  occasionally passing notes to his private investigator, Russell Noragon, on a  yellow pad covered with notes, stick figures and cartoon speech balloons.  </P> <P> Referring to himself in the third person, Murray retraced the week in January,  1990, when Moynahan testified that he showed up outside her trailer at Hobson  Park on the Pacific Coast Highway.  </P> <P> He then asked if she'd ever known him to use the alias Michael Myers, and if  she knew that it was the name of the killer in the movie "Halloween."  </P> <P> "I've never seen 'Halloween,' " Moynahan testified.  </P> <P> Murray then played a taped interview between investigators and Moynahan, who  could be heard saying she saw Murray in court in 1987 under the name Michael  Myers. Moynahan's taped voice said she believed that she'd heard the name in  discussion about a Simi Valley policeman, "or in 'Halloween,' the horror movie.  His name was also Myers."  </P> <P> On hearing the contradiction, Moynahan looked at Murray from the witness stand  with a bemused smile and shook her head. He showed no emotion and continued the  questioning.  </P> <P> Closing arguments are scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. today.  </P></p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Equal pensions 'do not have to be back dated' EMPLOYERS in the European Community do not have to pay equal pensions to men and women for service before May 17 1990, the date of a key ruling on pay equality, according to a recommendation yesterday from the advocate-general to the European Court of Justice. Making the 1990 ruling fully retrospective could have cost EC employers up to Pounds 100bn. It is for the court to accept or reject the advocate-general's opinion in four pending cases, but it almost always follows his advice. In a 53-page document which is expected to guide the court's final ruling, the advocate-general advised unequivocally that employers should not be liable for additional payments to male workers for any period before its judgment in the case of Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange. The cases involve two British schemes, one German scheme and one Dutch. The main arguments are contained in a case involving former employees of Coloroll, the UK home furnishings company now in liquidation. The advocate-general also advised that in making lump-sum retirement benefits, employers must not take into account that women live longer than men. In these schemes, employees purchase an annuity which will provide them with monthly income for the rest of their lives. Because women live longer, they need bigger lump sums to buy the same benefit. Lawyers in the case said it was unclear whether employers are barred from giving bigger lump sums to women. The advocate-general also advised that employers were free to worsen pension provision for women in their efforts to equalise payments to both sexes. Across Europe, occupational schemes have typically set men's retirement age at 65 while allowing women to receive a pension at 60. Sigh of relief, Page 2</p>

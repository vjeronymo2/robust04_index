It said the elite  unit broke into the house of Sheik Abdel Kareem Obeid in the village of  Jibshit, about 20 miles north of the Israeli border. The report said the  commandos, armed with silencer-equipped pistols, killed one of Obeid's  bodyguards and tied up the sheik's wife. Obeid, his nephew and another relative  then reportedly were taken to the helicopter and flown to Israel. Hezbollah, or  Party of God, seeks an Iranian-style Islamic republic in Lebanon.  </P></p>

The council decided against depriving Rucs of his deputy's  immunity.    The group motivated the resolution with its Jan. 17  statement  on the correctness of Rucs' actions during the Jan. 10 incident  between Latvian authorities and Russian generals.    During the debate, Riga Mayor Andris Teikmanis claimed that  only court could decide on the guilt or innocence of Rucs.  Teikmanis also urged the Prosecutor's Office and court to  investigate into Rucs' actions.    Rucs has said he ordered the detention of the two generals  because they threatened to use force to regain the seized  buildings.    The investigation materials, however, lack corresponding  evidence, senior investigator Biruta Ulpe told BNS.    Rucs' defense attourney Valdis Strauts denies showings of a  crime in the case since it was not preliminary planned and "Rucs  did all he could to prevent the conflict."    The Vidzeme council of people's deputies is still busy with  chairman elections. Among the candidates are Rucs, who was  fired under a government resolution, acting Chairwoman Velta  Nesaule and Deputy Chairman Karlis Lapins.    As reported, Major General Anatoli Vodopyanov and Major  General Nikolai Tailokov were arrested Jan. 10 after Rucs'  directive. The Prosecutor's Office launched investigation on  the same day for excess of service authority and illegal  detention.</p>

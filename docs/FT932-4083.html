			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Court Cavendish issues pathfinder COURT CAVENDISH, the nursing home operator, has issued the pathfinder prospectus for its flotation, which is likely to be 35 per cent by way of a public offer and 65 per cent placing, writes Catherine Milton. Mr Chai Patel, chairman, said the company had tentatively envisaged splitting the shares 50:50 between the offer and the placing: 'After discussions with the Stock Exchange we decided there are an awful lot of issues in the market and we are looking for long term money.' UBS, financial adviser and broker to the flotation, said it hopes to raise about Pounds 15m more than the Pounds 23.6m debt the company is carrying, to give a market capitalisation of Pounds 40m to Pounds 50m. The flotation will bring Court Cavendish to a growing sector of the stock market including Takare, Quality Care Homes, and the most recent entrant, Westminster Healthcare which floated in March. Operating profits dipped to Pounds 2.8m in the year to April from Pounds 3m a year earlier on turnover of Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 13.3m).</p>

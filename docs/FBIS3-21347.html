			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Muhammad Ibn 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Mu'ammar, </F> Saudi economist, in Riyadh; date not given: "Our Economy is  Strong; We Face No Problem With Foreign Obligations"--first two  paragraphs 'UKAZ introduction]    [Text] 'UKAZ AL-IQTISADI posed two important questions to  several financial experts and economists, concerning the future  of the Saudi economy in light of economic and oil conditions in  the world.    Dr. Muhammad Ibn 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Mu'ammar is a member of  the  Shura [Consultative] Council, a well-known economic expert, and  a professor in the King Fahd Oil and Minerals University. He  previously responded to two questions, confirming the strength  of the economic situation in the Kingdom. He stressed the  excellence of the actions taken by the government of the  Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz,  to support the Saudi riyal and to balance expenditure of income.  Those actions are concerned with doubling production revenues  and diversifying sources of income.  <H5>  Increased Role for Private Sector </H5>   ['UKAZ] How does the Saudi budget appear to you in terms of  support for the strength and firmness of the Saudi economy?    [Al-Mu'ammar] Issuing the general state budget for 1993/94  represents our government's commitment to strengthening the  course of economic and social growth for our beloved country.    Despite the fact that exports of crude oil still represent  86  percent of total Saudi exports, i.e., 75 percent of total  governmental income, we see a gradual, tangible increase in the  total of our nonpetroleum exports. They include materials with  added value, such as refined petroleum products, petrochemicals,  and fertilizers; derivatives of the petrochemical industry, like  plastics, synthetic fibers and polyester; agricultural products  such as grain, vegetables, flowers, etc. Moreover, we should  note that the private sector has in fact begun to make very  large capital investments in industrial parks in major cities  like Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam, in addition to the two  industrial cities of al-Jubayl and Yanbu. One must not forget  the important role played by the public sector, represented by  the efforts of the Ministry of Industry and Electricity,  Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry  of Finance and National Economy in supporting and encouraging  the private sector to play the desired role in the growth of the  national economy. This was done through offering various means  of support, such as subsidies, loans, and reduced customs fees  on Saudi exports.    Despite intense world competition, faced by our products  abroad, Saudi Arabia's joining the international General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, known as GATT, will reduce the  pressure of customs barriers that our exports encounter in  international markets. It will also overcome the obstacles that  the private sector faces in the field of foreign investments and  exports, since these two areas support private sector  opportunities, so that it may play its hoped-for role alongside  the governmental sector. It is anticipated that sales of Saudi  national products, through the Saudi Industrial Exports Company,  will have reached 750 million riyals [R] at the end of 1993. [.sup]1[/]     The strength and firmness of the Saudi economy stems from  this. We should note that the growth rate of the private  sector's gross domestic product [GDP] is not less than 5 percent  for the current fiscal year, according to statistics cited in  the state budget for this year. It is expected that the actual  GDP will grow at a 7-percent rate, compared with 9 percent for  1991.[.sup]2[/]    The GDP for the same period is estimated at R381 billion,  according to Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency statistics.    This rate is one of the highest growth rates in the  developing world, following directly after the rapidly  developing Asian nations, like South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore,  Malaysia, etc. We should also not fail to mention the important  fact that inflation rates in our country are still reasonable,  compared with many developing nations. The state has  participated in stabilizing consumer goods through guiding  public expenditures and organizing imports, as well as various  means of support offered to local merchants.  <H5>  Causes of Income Reduction </H5>   ['UKAZ] How can the Kingdom maintain its strong economic  position and continue spending on construction, growth,  development, and modernization, despite the burdens that have  resulted from the Gulf war disaster and despite the falling oil  prices?    [Al-Mu'ammar] You mentioned two important matters in your  question: the falling oil prices of the past 10 years,  specifically 1983-1993, and the consequences stemming from the  Gulf war. Both of these are problems that the Kingdom cannot  deal with alone. On the contrary, international efforts through  the organization of oil exporting nations known as OPEC, of  which there are 12 permanent member states today, including the  Kingdom, are being made to draw up production and pricing  policies for the member states. However, in the middle eighties,  we noted the difficulty OPEC had managing production and pricing  policies by itself. This was because of many important factors  including:    1. Increased oil production by countries outside of OPEC.  Britain increased its oil production to 700,000 barrels per day  [bpd] during 1993. Russia's production also increased to 1.6  million barrels during the same year, i.e., an increase  estimated at 20 percent over the previous year, in view of its  need for hard currency to support its economy.    2. Energy strategies followed in countries belonging to the  International Energy Agency, which has made Paris its  headquarters. Perhaps the most important of these strategies is  the increase of strategic oil storage by industrial states,  estimated at 4.5 billion barrels in the early nineties. World  production of oil did drop slightly to 59.6 million bpd in 1993,  as a result of reduced demand for refined products in those  countries.    3. World economic stagnation in major industrial nations,  such as Japan and Europe, and its ramifications on the world's  demand for oil. Economic growth rates were relatively low; they  are increasing only 1 to 1.5 percent annually in the best of  conditions.    4. Divisions within OPEC nations themselves, either because  of political conflicts like the Iraq-Iran War in the eighties;  the Gulf war in 1990, resulting in the liberation of Kuwait from  the Iraqi invasion, which some world critics have called the  first petroleum war; or other economic reasons that are strongly  connected to general budgets and the balance of payments  deficits of many member states. All of this has induced these  countries to exceed set production quotas and the official  prices set in accordance with OPEC ministerial decisions, out of  a desire to increase their income from oil exports.  <H5>  Resolute Treatment of the Problem </H5>   We are also all aware that since 1985, like the rest of the  OPEC nations and many other countries of the world, including  the major industrialized countries, Saudi Arabia has faced the  consequences of these conditions. However, the Kingdom has faced  them with strength and by following these means:    1. Issuing treasury bonds by the Ministry of Finance and  National Economy, and selling them to borrow money for a fixed  period of time. This represents a guaranteed investment for  purchasers, most of whom are national banks. The value of  governmental bonds held by Saudi banks is less than $15 billion,  according to the estimates of the Ministry of Finance and  National Economy.[.sup]3[/] It is well known that the  disparity in the general budget for 1993 totalled R27.8 billion,  compared with R30 billion for 1992. This difference between  income and expenditures was covered by borrowing.    2. Full receipt of customs fees pertaining to the state in  various sectors. This includes services for telephone,  electricity, and water; customs duties on imports in airports  and harbors; and, security sectors, such as traffic, passports,  etc. These fees represent important income for the state of not  less than R5 billion.    3. Continuing to guide the state's general expenditures  through a reduction in spending in various state organizations.  Total expenditures allocated in this year's budget amounted to  R160 billion, compared with R197 billion for the last fiscal  year.    4. Continuing to support OPEC efforts to stabilize oil  prices  under a specific production ceiling that will serve the economic  development plans of the OPEC nations.  <H5>  Practical Solutions for the Crisis </H5>   It is well known that the current OPEC ceiling is 24.5  million barrels, or some 40 percent of world oil production,  while the actual production capacity of OPEC nations is 28  million bpd. The average sale price of a barrel of Arab light  (34 degree) oil is $11, while Saudi Arabia's production of crude  oil reached 8 million bpd at the end of 1993. The fluctuation of  prices could be dealt with through reducing OPEC production by  1.5 to 2 million bpd, but the recent OPEC ministerial conference  regarded this idea as unlikely, in view of the possibility of  non-OPEC producers' increasing their oil production at the  expense of the OPEC nations.    5. Stabilizing the Saudi riyal's current exchange rate  vis-a-vis hard foreign currencies through supporting it with  Saudi foreign monetary reserves which, in the first part of the  last decade, totalled $130 billion, according to IMF estimates.  The minister of finance and national economy, Shaykh Muhammad  Aba-al-Khayl, has pointed out that the Saudi currency was fully  covered by a special reserve of hard currency of more than $20  billion.[.sup]4[/] It is clear that the percentage of  governmental domestic borrowing is about 94 percent of the  total, while the country's foreign borrowing from international  banks is only 6 percent, i.e., an estimated amount of $4.5  billion. This undoubtedly means that the Kingdom's foreign  obligation is very limited, and could be repaid within a short  time, inasmuch as the greatest percentage of borrowing is local  and not foreign.    With regard to the percentage of budget deficit to gross  national product, we found it to be 52 percent of this product.  To a considerable extent, this is the same as rates found in  advanced industrial nations, such as the United States and  France.[.sup]5[/] If we take into consideration the  completion of the infrastructure for most of the physical and  human development projects, and the large trade surplus in its  favor in the balance of foreign trade payments, which is  estimated at R81 billion for 1991[.sup]6[/], we find that  Saudi Arabia is proceeding ahead surefootedly to support its  national economy.     -  Dr. Muhammad Ibn 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Mu'ammar    -  Born in al-Ta'if in 1955    -  Received his secondary education in al-Ta'if    -  Went to the United States in 1975 for university study.

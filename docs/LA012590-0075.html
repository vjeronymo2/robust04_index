			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> BROOKLYN RAPPERS 3RD BASS THROWN OUT BY LL COOL J  </P> <P> With the Black Rock Coalition going strong and a hip-hop show the most popular  program on MTV, 3rd Bass, a new Brooklyn rap group with an album in the Top 10  of Billboard's black music chart, uses its whiteness the same way Heavy D uses  his girth: as a cute gimmick.  </P> <P> "Do you see any white boys on stage?" they asked at a Palace showcase on  Tuesday sponsored by hip-hop radio station KDAY.  </P> <P> Well, yes, one who shuffles like Grant Schumaker on "The Garry Shandling Show,"  another who gesticulates with a cane like Art Carney in "Harry and Tonto." 3rd  Bass thanked "all the brothers and sisters . . . who can see the soul under the  skin."  </P> <P> They made hideously offensive AIDS cracks, just like Ice-T. They tentatively  bellowed their hits into a microphone like rappers on their first tour, which  they are. And -- big mistake -- they brought out LL Cool J for their last  couple of numbers -- the effect of which was kind of like Michael Jordan  stepping into a schoolyard basketball game or Anita Baker sitting in at a piano  bar. With his clear tenor, polysyllables and astounding machine-gun  articulation, LL cut through the murky, bottom-heavy mix. "I juice the party  like jumper cables," he rapped, and he did: The crowd, galvanized, seemed to  wake up for the first time that night. (De La Soul and Eazy-E also appeared on  stage.) LL has never been this good; 3rd Bass was all but forgotten. JONATHAN  GOLD  </P></p>

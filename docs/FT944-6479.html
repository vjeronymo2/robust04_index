			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Aoki sells stake in Westin Hotel group for Dollars 561m Aoki, a Japanese construction company, has sold its shareholdings in the Westin Hotel group for Dollars 561m to US real estate investors Starwood Capital Group and a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs. Aoki sold its shareholdings in two Westin group companies, Westin Hotel and Westin International Europe, which operate 63 hotels in 11 North American and European countries and the Westin trademark rights in South America. Aoki is another company on the list of Japanese corporations struggling with overseas investments made during the economic 'bubble' of the late 1980s. The construction group, together with a group of US investors, bought the Westin hotel chain of 80 hotels in 19 countries in 1988 for Dollars 1.35bn. Immediately after the purchase, Aoki and the investors sold off the Westin Mauna Kea in Hawaii and the Plaza in New York for more than Dollars 700m. Since then the Japanese company has faced mounting interest payments on its debts and last February attempted to sell the hotel chain to a Mexican investor. The company said it would use the income from the sale to repay the group's outstanding loans of about Y52bn (Dollars 526.5m), which includes funds borrowed for the initial purchase of the hotel group. The proceeds will also be used to cover the Y34bn in loan guarantees by Aoki to its resort subsidiaries. Westin will own the trademark in North America, South America, Europe, Africa and the Middle East. In Asia, Aoki will maintain ownership of the Westin trademark and enter into partnership with Westin there.</p>

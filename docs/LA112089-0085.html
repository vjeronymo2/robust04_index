			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VAN TO VAN COMBAT;  </P> <P> IT'S CHAOS, SOMETIMES, AT LAX AS MORE THAN 30 FIRMS VIE FOR PASSENGERS.  </P> <P> It was smooth going in front of the Los Angeles International Airport one  recent Wednesday as two Department of Airport officers policed the movement of  airport shuttle vans in and out of Terminal 1. But once the officers left, the  usual chaos resumed.  </P> <P> Within minutes, 12 airport shuttle vans from five different companies descended  on the passenger island. About half of the drivers jumped out and began trying  to solicit passengers to share a $10 van ride downtown or pay up to $50 each to  go to such faraway destinations as Newport Beach. Inevitably, arguments broke  out as fully loaded vans pinned to the curb battled empty vans still seeking  passengers.  </P> <P> "It's pure hell out there," said John Taylor, who has been driving vans for  Supershuttle since 1986. "If you are not fighting other vans, you are fighting  the (rental car) buses, the hotel buses and passenger cars."  </P> <P> With thousands of passengers arriving each hour at Los Angeles International  Airport and the relatively low cost of acquiring a vehicle, van shuttles may  look like an easy, no-risk business. But the proliferating number of airport  shuttle van companies has produced cutthroat competition, airport congestion  and almost daily confrontations between drivers at the world's third-busiest  airport, officials say.  </P> <P> Some 30 privately operated van companies with 650 vehicles now serve the  airport, compared to just two companies in 1971, according to airport  officials. Competition has increased so much that Airlink, a Southern  California commercial bus operator, cited the skyrocketing growth of vans when  it shut down its 19-mile-long airport-to-downtown bus service last year.  </P> <P> Even industry leader Supershuttle, with about 200 vans and estimated annual  revenue last year of nearly $50 million, is feeling the pinch. Last year, it  took out a $14,000 newspaper advertisement to tell Department of Airport  officials that Supershuttle and its customers had " . . . the most to lose from  chaos and irresponsible practices at the airport."  </P> <P> "We are all having problems with the number of shuttle van companies serving  the airport," said Rod Ramsey, chairman of the Shuttle Van Assn. of Southern  California and president of City Shuttle in Van Nuys. "We are a young industry,  and the potential for growth is tremendous. (But) we have a few bad apples we  need to weed out."  </P> <P> In response to the complaints, the Department of Airports imposed a moratorium  in September on new van operators and is considering new rules that would limit  the time that drivers could solicit passengers during each stop and even force  van operators to install devices that would electronically track how many trips  the vans made to and from the airport.  </P> <P> "There's too much wheeling and dealing going on on the curbs," said Tom  Drischler, transportation coordinator for the Department of Airports' unit that  oversees ground transportation. "Drivers spend more time on the ground hustling  up business than they do driving their vans."  </P> <P> Almost unheard of a decade ago, shuttle vans now carry tens of thousands of  passengers who used to drive to the airport or relied on taxis and buses to  transport them. Profit margins for operators are razor thin, typically less  than 2%, several shuttle van companies say. But transportation experts say vans  have become popular because they offer a compromise between a taxi, which is  faster but costs more, and a bus, which is less expensive but slower.  </P> <P> On the airport-to-downtown route abandoned by Airlink, for example, cab fare is  a flat $26.50 and van service is $9 to $11, compared to the $6.50 that Airlink  had charged last year.  </P> <P> "Basically, you have got economics accounting for the growing popularity of  vans," said Martin Markovich, transportation planner for the Southern  California Assn. of Governments. "But you also have demographic changes as  well."  </P> <P> Markovich noted that there is a greater percentage of single households or  dual-income families in which husband and wife hold jobs and, therefore, don't  have time to transport household members or guests to and from the airport.  </P> <P> "Another demographic change," Markovich said, "is that most people don't go  downtown anymore." With urban sprawl, he said, more passengers arriving at LAX  are going to a wider variety of destinations -- stretching from Orange County  to the San Fernando Valley. As a result, he said, large commercial carriers  such as Airlink have trouble filling up a 50-passenger bus that goes to a  single destination.  </P> <P> By contrast, vans operate in a much more flexible manner: They pick up  passengers by appointment at their homes or businesses (very much as taxis do),  but unlike taxis, vans may make one or more stops to pick up additional  passengers along the way. Travelers can hail vans, just as they do taxis, at  designated points outside airline terminals.  </P> <P> It is this last aspect of van service, however, that has made van competition  especially fierce in California, experts say.  </P> <P> In many states, door-to-door airport vans may only pick up passengers who have  arranged for the service in advance -- normally by at least a day. But  California regulators operate under "a very loose interpretation" of what  constitutes advance notice, said Ray A. Mundy, a transportation professor at  the University of Tennessee who is executive director of the Airport Ground  Transportation Assn.  </P> <P> If a customer calls from the airport or hails a van from the curb in  California, that constitutes advance notice, Mundy said.  </P> <P> But while the short-notice rule can be convenient for those seeking  transportation on the spur of the moment, it can be frustrating for passengers  who want to be delivered to their destination in a timely fashion.  </P> <P> Craig Stack, a customer service representative supervisor for Los Angeles-based  TTMC Co., which helps manage van shuttle passenger relations, tells of  passengers who have been driven around the airport for 20 minutes or longer  while the driver seeks more customers to fill up his van.  </P> <P> And the Department of Airport's Drischler said his unit recently discovered  that some van drivers were trading away passengers like chattel to other fully  loaded vans headed for the same destination because the drivers didn't deem it  financially worthwhile to make a trip with fewer than three customers.  </P> <P> "The only way we found out about it was that one of the passengers left his  luggage in the van he was forced out of," Drischler said.  </P> <P> Surprisingly, such incidents have generated few complaints to regulatory  authorities, said Ebi Esule, a transportation engineer with the state Public  Utilities Commission, which regulates van and bus service within California.  </P> <P> "My impression is that the public feels they (vans) fill a very vital public  need," said Esule.  </P> <P> The van explosion began in 1981, when the PUC opened up a market then dominated  by cabs and buses. According to a Department of Airports' study completed two  years ago, vans shuttled less than 3% of airport passengers, versus 54% using  private cars and 16% using taxis. (Buses, rental cars and other forms of  transportation also had slices of the market.)  </P> <P> Today, however, most observers believe that vans have increased their share of  the estimated 44 million travelers who use LAX each year.  </P> <P> They have been aided in their expansion by the PUC.  </P> <P> Before 1981, the PUC granted few licenses to new airport bus or van companies.  "If there was a bus line that already served the area, the commission would say  no," said PUC spokeswoman Carole Kretzer.  </P> <P> But the commission changed its philosophy as federal officials continued  deregulating transportation among the states in the early 1980s. The watershed  year, experts say, came in 1981 when the commission allowed the Trailways Bus  Co. to operate along Greyhound routes.  </P> <P> "Now it's very open," said Kretzer. "We encourage more competition because,  theoretically, it leads to better service and lower prices."  </P> <P> Van companies now serve virtually every neighborhood in Southern California.  One company -- Seoul Shuttle -- specializes in serving Koreatown. Passenger  rates have barely risen among shuttle operators in the past five years, experts  say.  </P> <P> But the free granting of licenses to new van operators has upset Department of  Airport officials and industry leaders, who banded together earlier this year  and formed the shuttle van association to help lobby for stricter van operating  rules.  </P> <P> "If they throw this thing open to anyone," groused Mitchell Rouse, president of  Supershuttle, "they are going to get the lowest common denominator of van  operator, who doesn't have the burden of having to provide a system to get  customers to the airport . . . (but) only flags them down at the curb in front  of the terminals."  </P></p>

			<p>920328 FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Baker's curse - Ballot Box Sebastian Coe, the Olympic gold medallist and Conservative candidate for the Cornish constituency of Falmouth and Camborne, has fallen out with Kenneth Baker, the home secretary. Baker appeared in the constituency on Wednesday to dismiss Coe's locally bred opponents as 'mediocre and obscure'. The venerable Falmouth Packet newspaper (established 1827) reported on its front page that the home secretary had treated the Cornish like dirt. Coe has been apologising ever since.</p>

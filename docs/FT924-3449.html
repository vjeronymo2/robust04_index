			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Arts: Faure at the Wigmore - Weekend concerts in London More than the other London concert-venues, the Wigmore Hall can claim a history that is valuable in its own right. The signed photos on the walls of the new Bechstein room, a meeting-place for sponsors created out of the old basement during the recent refurbishment, recall some of the great names who have appeared there. It was an excellent idea to take up the potential of that historical tradition in this re-opening season. The Nash Ensemble has put together a 'Commemorative Wigmore' series of six concerts, all of which feature programmes performed at the hall between 1910 and 1944. Audiences can reflect on the changing expectations of music-lovers over the century and also muse on some of the marvellous performances that must have been heard. What a temptation to think oneself back to June 9 1925. That was the date of the Wigmore's memorial concert to Gabriel Faure, who had died the year before. The roll-call of artists who appeared (Cortot, Lionel Tertis, Henry Wood, to name but three) was long and prestigious. Programmes of this kind were generous in those days, too, and the Nash Ensemble's re-construction on Sunday afternoon stretched into the early evening. Tertis's place was taken by the Nash Ensemble's Roger Chase, modestly eloquent in the Elegie for viola, Op. 24. Cortot's seat at the piano was occupied by the Ensemble's Ian Brown, who played the Theme et Variations, Op. 73, most likely without the idiosyncracies of his great predecessor. The main part of the programme, however, was given over to the melodies. And rightly so, for this is where the heart of Faure's music palpably beats. The constant pleasure in each of these small groups of songs was the playing of Malcolm Martineau, who had the right drawing-room atmosphere at his fingertips - especially when he was accompanying the soprano Yvonne Kenny, the most stylish of the afternoon's three singers. From recordings of the great Faure interpreters, Bernac and Souzay above all, we know that it is possible to find more sunset luxuriance in 'Soir', more resentment in 'Prison'; but Kenny sang the songs simply and with beauty, except when the voice hardened a bit at the top. Felicity Palmer has the measure of the deeper songs, but with her mezzo the hardness became intrusive; Adrian Thompson pushed the music, and his tenor, too forcibly. At either end of the programme the Nash Ensemble gave splendid accounts of the favourite Faure Piano Quartets, the joyous ending of the C Minor sending the audience out on a wave of those elating harmonies so typical of the composer at his happiest. A fine start to the series: the next three concerts, taken from the Wigmore's war-time years, look especially fascinating.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON TOP OF EVERYTHING;  </P> <P> BRIGHT OR NEUTRAL, LONG OR SHORT, IT'S THE JACKET THAT REALLY COUNTS  </P> <P> WHEN DISCUSSING summer wardrobes, designers in Milan, Paris, New York and  Southern California agree: Keep the underpinnings basic (a unitard will do),  and make the jacket exciting.  </P> <P> Whether chartreuse, orange, chrome yellow or warm white, today's jackets are  colorful.  </P> <P> They're also roomy and relaxed but not sloppy. Armani shows long,  East-Indian-inspired, tissue-weight jackets, while Chanel's are shorter and  gently shaped. Donna Karan has designed sleek, fluid styles, and those by  California designers range from short and boxy to long and lean.  </P> <P> Detailing is important: Waists may be nipped in with belts, shirring and curvy  seaming; buttons are often decorative, and collar and pocket treatments create  subtle novelty touches.  </P> <P> This jacket wardrobe is exceptional in every way except price -- each jacket is  under $300.  </P> <P> Model: Holly Kimsey/Mary Webb Davis.  </P></p>

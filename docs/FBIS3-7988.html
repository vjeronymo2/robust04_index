			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["S.I."-signed report: "Hungarians Beyond the Border and </F> Regional Leading Role -- The MDF's National Foreign Policy"]    [Text] The Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] sees the  protection of the Hungarian minority beyond the border as the  main task of Hungarian foreign policy. This is revealed by the  party's foreign policy program, even though, formally, this  issue only occupies the second place after its Europe policy.  However, the program accepted by the MDF's national meeting  last weekend -- which, after finalization, arrived at MAGYAR  HIRLAP on 24 February -- advocates foreign policy with a  national basis in almost all its paragraphs, and some kind of  intention to achieve a regional leading role can also be  detected in it.    Contrary to the big opposition parties (the Alliance of Free  Democrats, the Federation of Young Democrats, and the Hungarian  Socialist Party) whose program documents are scientifically  based, were made with foreign affairs professional methods, and  which also clarify theoretical issues, the MDF's foreign policy  program is structured around election slogans ("We Have  Preserved and Will Keep Our Country's Stability" or "Let the  Hungarians Be the Motor of Development," "Let the National  Minorities of Europe Have a Fair Future," and so on) and it does  not deal with theoretical issues.    The MDF program names two major foreign political goals. The  first one is full engagement in the life of developed Europe,  and the second one is "establishing good relations with the  neighboring countries such a way that this is concomitant with  the lasting settlement of the situation of minority Hungarian  national communities." This hierarchy of goals does not  essentially differ from the priorities of the major opposition  parties but almost all paragraphs of the MDF's program are  permeated with the fact that the Hungarians beyond the border  nevertheless have priority.    All the MDF program says about the issue of joining the  European organizations is that "Hungary cannot be left out," but  it does not talk about the necessary preparations. About NATO  membership, it says that "the possibility of a full NATO  membership has opened before us" but it does not deal with the  problems posed by a possible NATO membership (the ones that can  be raised, for example, if Hungary and its neighbors are not  accepted into NATO at the same time).    The intention to acquire a regional leading role is the  other  important characteristic of the program. "It is the MDF's goal  that, with the help of its policies and in accordance with our  central position, Hungarians become an organizing force in  Central Europe's economy through the abilities and industrious  nature of our people." In other places, the program allows it  to be felt that the MDF sees Hungary as an example to be  followed by the neighboring countries.    The notion that was also part of the government program four  years ago can again be seen: Relations with non-neighboring  countries should be subordinated to politics relating to the  Hungarians beyond the border. The MDF again declares that such  relations have to be formed with the more distant countries  which serve the interests relating to the Hungarians living  beyond the border.    According to the MDF, the improvement of the Hungarian  minorities's situation beyond the border is a task of the  Hungarian Government's foreign policy. The program states that  the national minorities have the right to self-determination,  including territorial autonomy; it emphasizes that the  application of collective national minority rights has to be  urged at all international forums (which, however, is usually  received with suspicion at the moment in Europe).    The program devotes much space to praising the achievements,  and it attributes certain facts to the MDF's merit which did not  have much to do with the MDF (for example, Hungary's acceptance  to the Council of Europe in 1990, a few months after the  establishment of the MDF government).</p>

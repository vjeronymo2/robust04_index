			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vlastimil Stana: "Air Force and Air Defense in </F> the Next Century"]    [Text] Part of the change in the Czech Army is the  transformation of the Air Force and Air Defense [PVO]. This  complicated operation, which certainly will not take place  without some radical cuts, and thus also some scars on the face  of the Air Force and PVO, is the consequence of the changed  strategic conditions and the real reduction of resources  earmarked for the Army. All the changes that the Air Force and  the PVO are currently undergoing are not the last ones. Already  in existence are plans for the look of the department in about  1995, and concepts for the look of the Czech Air Force in the  next century are also known. This was discussed at a news  conference by Pavel Strubl, Air Force inspector and PVO general.  <H5>  New Command System </H5>   One of the substantive changes is the creation of a  three-step system of command. Basically it is composed of the  staff of the Air Force and the PVO of the Army of the Czech  Republic [ACR], which handles not only organization and command,  but also formulates the concept and plans for the future  development of the department. Established as operational steps,  designed primarily for the immediate command of the units, were  the 3d Tactical Air Corps with its command headquarters in  Hradec Kralove, and the 4th PVO Corps (Stara Boleslav). The  active component is represented by the Air Force squadrons and  PVO units. Among the largest in the Air Force is the 31st  Tactical Air Force Base (ZTL) in Caslav, the 32d ZTL base in  Namest nad Oslavou, the 33d Helicopter Base in Prerov, and the  34th Air Force Training Base in Pardubice. The PVO corps is  composed of the 4th Interceptor Aircraft base in Ceske  Budejovice and the antiaircraft missile brigades and regiments  located in Drnov, Brno, Ostrava, Rozmital pod Tremsinem,  Kromeriz, and Strakonice.  <H5>  Changes in the Air Force </H5>   On the basis of analyses and after weighing the human,  financial, and material possibilities, the General Staff worked  out a concept for the development of the Air Force and the PVO  up to the year 2005.    In the case of the Air Force, it is assumed that this year  there will be a radical reduction in aircraft inventory, and 77  fighter planes, 11 combat helicopters, 20 trainers, 10 transport  and special planes, and 20 transport helicopters will be taken  out of commission. Altogether, this will reduce the aircraft  inventory by a full 30.6 percent! Next year the Air Force will  be located at six airfields, and subsequently will have five  permanent airfields at its disposal. The total number of 54  existing airfields will be reduced to 29. In addition to the  five permanent ones, seven airfields will be occupied by airport  administrations, nine airfields will have paved runways, and  eight will have grassy surfaces.    The plans also include changes in the equipment of the Air  Force. Two bases, those in Caslav and Namest, would have  subsonic planes L-159 of Czech manufacture and supersonic  multipurpose planes. In connection with this we learned that as  of this year there are no more plans to operate MiG-29's, or to  make any further purchases of Russian equipment. The  multipurpose supersonic plane is definitely going to be a plane  of Western manufacture. But it is premature to talk about the  precise type of plane. The air transport base (Praha-Kbely)  would be equiped with large-capacity long-range jets to provide  passenger service for government officials, and with mid-range  planes (for example, Hercules) designed to transport people,  materiel, and paratroopers, including the rapid deployment  brigade. Also available would be small-capacity mid-range planes  (for example, L-610). The Prerov base, in addition to the  helicopters, would be home to propeller planes Z-142, subsonic  L-39's, and L-159's. The modernization of the air force will  begin this year with the purchase of Z-142's.  <H5>  Future of the PVO </H5>   Basic changes will take place above all in the combat and  operational use of the signal, antiaircraft missile, and  interceptor aircraft units. First of all, positional defense of  installations will be abolished and replaced by defense of  important regions, with the possibility of concentrating forces  in the main operational direction.    There will be not only organizational changes in the PVO,  but  also reductions in the number of people and garrisons and an  overall reduction in the cost of operations. The readiness  system of the Czech Republic will thereafter be secured only by  the signal corps and the interceptor aircraft units.    The current equipment of the PVO should serve until the year  2010, the equipment of the signal corps until the year 1998.</p>

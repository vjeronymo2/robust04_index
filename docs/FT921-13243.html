			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Personal View: Russia needs three kinds of economic aid - and quickly Two months ago, the president of Russia, Boris Yeltsin, formed a new government pledged to radical economic reform. That government has a clear strategy, and has already put in place many of the elements central to it. The first is the freeing of markets - for goods and services, and for foreign exchange. On January 2, most consumer prices were freed. Only a few basic goods remain controlled and their prices have, on average, tripled. Most industrial prices, except those of energy and freight transport, are also free. After 75 years of price control, this was a big step. Some people say that the government should have gone more slowly. I do not agree. The queues in the shops were quite intolerable. Money had become so useless that much of the trade between enterprises was done by barter. An economy of that kind can never prosper. In any case, once price rises become expected, they must be allowed to happen. If not, suppliers are unwilling to sell and supplies to the market fall steadily. It would have been nice to be able to privatise first, but delay was impossible. Russia shall, however, privatise as fast as practicable, and at least as fast as the countries of eastern Europe. Some ask: 'How can people afford the higher prices?' This largely misses the point. The prices only rose because the people - taken as a whole - had the money to spend. Care must be taken, however, to protect the poorer people - such as pensioners - who already used to spend all their income. We have done all that we can to protect these groups. On January 1 the basic pension, child support and the minimum wage were increased by 90 per cent. This is less than the rise in prices, but any bigger increase would have been irresponsible. Pensions cannot be paid by printing money, as happened last year. Any more generous social safety net will have to depend on foreign assistance. Freeing domestic prices is the principal step to a healthy market economy. But Russia is also determined to participate fully in world trade. This means freeing the market for foreign exchange. Up to now, foreign exchange has been grossly under-priced and allocated by government officials. On January 1, the government created the framework for a normal foreign exchange market. Importers will buy dollars through their banks at a market exchange rate. Exporters will have to sell to the government at least 10 per cent of their foreign exchange earnings (at the market price). As soon as they become more confident that real convertibility has been established, they will certainly sell more. There will thus be a unified foreign exchange market. There is one exception - which is, in fact, superficial. Exporters of oil, gas, timber and precious metals will have to sell to the government 40 per cent of their foreign exchange earnings at half the market price. This is, in essence, a royalty similar in effect to the levies taken on natural resource exports by most governments in the world. Freeing markets is the first element in the reform. The aim is that prices should rise once and for all - to eliminate the monetary overhang - and then remain stable. The task of stabilisation is the most difficult, and involves three steps. First, the budget must be balanced. This is a goal from the first quarter of this year. On the expenditure side, freeing prices means that most subsidies will be eliminated, especially on meat. Drastic cuts will also be made in defence procurement. On the tax side, much of the old, indirect tax structure has collapsed, and, for the last three years, the Finance Ministry has been preparing instead a value added tax. The VAT has now been introduced at 28 per cent. There are also an enterprise wage tax (37 per cent) and a profits tax (32 per cent). The tax yield is difficult to forecast, but the government shall do all it can to collect in revenue as much as it spends. This is one significant step in achieving monetary control. The other is to impose effective limits on lending to enterprises. Here the government is engaged in urgent discussions with the central bank, since effective limits are essential to the success of the programme. The final need is to stabilise the rouble. At present, the supply of foreign exchange is so small that the rouble is grossly undervalued. Prices of traded goods in Russia today are about 20 times below world prices calculated at the existing exchange rate. This situation is fraught with danger. Unless the exchange rate appreciates, prices are bound to go on rising many times over. Tight money is the key to raising the external value of the rouble. But we also need to peg the exchange rate, in order to set a ceiling to inflation and to give enterprises the confidence to part with their dollars. Unfortunately, Russia has no international reserves for this purpose: they were squandered by the Union government. Foreign assistance is urgently needed in preparing a fund to stabilise the rouble. While we have already taken significant steps towards establishing financial discipline, there has to be some moment soon when all the remaining measures are put in place. If we are to stop inflation rolling, March is the time to act. The possible package is being discussed with the International Monetary Fund, since a programme that is to succeed must have outside support. We need three kinds of help. The first is humanitarian aid. The western response here has been generous and we greatly welcome the conference today in Washington called by Mr Baker. The second is general balance of payments support. Last year, imports fell by more than a third. This had a devastating effect on living standards and on industrial production which depends on certain critical imports. We cannot immediately restore our exports, so help is essential to prevent economic collapse. Finally, we need a stabilisation fund to peg the rouble at a reasonable rate. The sums of money needed are similar on a per head basis to those given to Poland. President Yeltsin wrote to the G7 about the stabilisation fund in early December. The G7 countries are now waiting for the outcome of our discussions with the IMF. However, it would greatly help Russia's ability to plan if the G7 finance ministers, at their meeting in Washington later this week, could give some indication of what help might be available on what conditions. Stabilisation plans must be announced as soon as possible. Unless the people can see that inflation is going to be capped, wages will increase again and we shall then be into a disastrous wage-price spiral. Aid offered now can help prevent this. It would be much more valuable than aid offered later. The author is deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation and minister of economics and finance.</p>

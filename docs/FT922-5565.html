			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tight copper supply forecast COPPER producers will struggle to keep pace with future demand because of shortages of smelting capacity, said Mr Alex Balogh, chief executive of Noranda Minerals, the Canadian group, yesterday. It was impossible to justify investment in new copper smelters because the expected rate of return on capital was inadequate, he said. New smelters would almost certainly take much longer to be built than some observers expected - but analysts had probably also underestimated the industry's ability to squeeze more production out of existing smelting capacity. For example, Noranda might spend more than USDollars 50m to double output from 53,000 tonnes at its Gaspe copper smelter in Quebec. Noranda's Horne smelter, also in Quebec, might expand capacity over time. Horne once was able to treat 1.3m tonnes of copper concentrate (an intermediate material) a year but this had been reduced to 700,000 tonnes (producing because of environmental pressures. Horne's output might be increased again to 850,000 to 900,000 tonnes. Mr Balogh said: 'I have been in this business for more than 15 years and in all that time smelters ran with charges giving an unacceptable rate of return on the capital required just to keep them running - just to stop the roof from leaking'. New copper smelters had been built but for political or strategic reasons and this would be the case in future, he added during a presentation in London. Expansion at Gaspe depended on Noranda buying a high-quality copper project or operating mine outside Canada because the mine near the smelter would last had only another seven years. Noranda had looked at 20 copper projects and mines and was still in discussion about six of them. Through Falconbridge, in which Noranda has a 50 per cent stake, the group has an interest in Collahuasi, which promises to be one of the Chile's biggest copper projects. Mr Balogh said it would take at least another year to complete drilling there to work out a mine plan because the ore body was so big and rich. He said the copper industry would probably scrape by in future but supply would be tight, so prices could be expected to remain buoyant. Noranda expected copper to range in price between Dollars 1 and Dollars 1.10 a lb this year, between Dollars 1.25 and Dollars 1.40 next year and between Dollars 1.30 and Dollars 1.50 in 1994.  -----------------------------------------------------------                     METAL TABLE  ----------------------------------------------------------- Base metals price range estimates (US cents a lb)  -----------------------------------------------------------          Zinc     Copper     Nickel    Aluminium 1992    55-60    100-110    325-375      60-65 1993    60-70    125-140    450-550      75-90 1994    65-80    130-150    550-650    100-120  -----------------------------------------------------------</p>

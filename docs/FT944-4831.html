			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Adams expects US fund-raising ban to be lifted Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, expressed confidence he would soon be allowed to raise funds for his organisation in the US after a meeting at the White House yesterday with President Bill Clinton's top foreign policy adviser, reports George Graham from Washington. 'We're satisfied it will be resolved and resolved in a satisfactory way,' he said. As a condition of his current visa to the US, Mr Adams is required to refrain from fundraising, but Sinn Fein has set up an organisation in the US and wants to start collecting from Irish Americans. A senior US official said: 'Basically, I wouldn't rule it out. We've got some issues we're continuing to work through with him.' The US has said it can only allow fundraising if the IRA stops buying weapons in the US, and if there is concrete progress towards disarming the terrorist group. Sinn Fein is also trying to set up transparent accounting procedures that would offer some assurance money it raised is not going to the IRA.</p>

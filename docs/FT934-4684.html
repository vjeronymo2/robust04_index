			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Injunction awarded against Smith Barney A US judge issued a preliminary injunction yesterday prohibiting the Wall Street securities house Smith Barney Shearson from diverting its mutual fund administration business away from the Boston Company, the money management company that Mellon Bank bought from Shearson last year for Dollars 1.45bn. The injunction follows a lawsuit filed by Mellon in September which contended that Smith Barney Shearson had been breaking an agreement the two companies concluded when Shearson merged with Smith Barney in March. Under the pact, it was agreed that the Boston Company would continue to administer Shearson's mutual funds, an arrangement that had been established in 1992 when Shearson, then part of American Express, sold the Boston Company to Mellon. Mellon's original lawsuit claimed that Smith Barney Shearson had dodged its obligations to grant its mutual fund administration business to the Boston Company by creating new funds that were replicas of the funds that the Boston Company had run for Shearson. Mellon has taken the issue to court because the job of administering the Smith Barney Shearson funds provides the bulk of The Boston Company's Dollars 170m in annual fund servicing revenues. Under the terms of yesterday's injunction, which will last for seven years, Smith Barney Shearson is blocked from providing administrative services to any fund it acquired because of the Shearson merger, any fund that is similar to existing Shearson funds, or any new fund created after Smith Barney agreed to acquire Shearson on March 12. The injunction also forces Smith Barney Shearson to recommend to the boards of the relevant funds that the Boston Company administer the funds. Smith Barney Shearson said yesterday that it was disappointed at the judge's ruling, which would prohibit the firm from providing administrative services to the funds 'on a more competitive cost basis'. It said it would appeal against the ruling.</p>

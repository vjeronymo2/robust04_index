			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ole Vigant Ryborg: "Danish Skeleton in the </F> Closet"]    [Text] Danish overevaluation of the merits of the  environmental guarantee before the national referendum on the EC  package in 1986 has in reality rendered the guarantee unusable  for Denmark and weakens Denmark in negotiations on environment  and health issues.    Health Minister Torben Lund has dusted off the environmental  guarantee and has been advocating use of it in connection with  the food-coloring directive. In other places -- particularly in  the central administration -- there is very little enthusiasm  for turning this kind of political leverage into a legal  proceeding.    There was no hesitation in the voice of Prime Minister Poul  Schluter when on 28 January 1986 he rose from his seat in the  Folketing and ascended the podium:    "Many spokesmen have said: We wish to make our own decisions  in the environmental sphere, and I well understand this. We will  achieve this, and will achieve it in a better way than before.    ``But now we will have a different system, a system that  enables us to make our own national regulations. It is  unprecedented in the EC for this to be acknowledged in EC law.  It is incorporated into the treaty itself in Article 100 A.''    The prime minister played his trump. At that point, it was  just a month until the Danish people were to go to the polls and  accept or reject the so-called EC package. The prime minister  and his enthusiastically pro-EC foreign affairs minister had  serious domestic problems. A majority of the Folketing was  opposed to Danish acceptance of the "package." There were two  parts to the EC package, in particular, that had caused a  majority in the Folketing to urge a no vote. The first was the  additional power the European Parliament would assume, and the  other was the fear that the environment would take second place  to harmonization of the inner market.    While the issue of the European Parliament's role was a very  technical matter, the discussion around the so-called  environmental guarantee evolved in 1985 into an orgy of Danish  assurances about the guarantee's merits. The guarantees for  Danish health and the future of the environment were touted  within the Folketing, the Marketing Committee, in statements  issued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry, and in commentary from  the daily press. Yet, it is interesting to note that after eight  years, it has never yet been "necessary" to invoke those  guaranties. This despite obvious problems in the EC related to  solvents, cancer-causing agents, and the most recent issue on  food coloration. The cause: Nearly every case in which the  environmental guarantee might be invoked provides an opportunity  for exposure of the fact that the Danish interpretation of the  environmental guarantee is not viable.  <H5>  Negotiation Problems </H5>   It is not exactly a well-kept secret that Denmark employs a  much wider interpretation of the use of the environmental  guarantee than that laid down by the European Commission's legal  services. Or compared to the other EU [European Union] nations.  Even before the national referendum in February 1986, the  question of Denmark's interpretation was raised and later  discussed. One place it was discussed was at the conference held  in Copenhagen in April 1987, in which the general directors of  both the Council of Ministers and the Commission's legal  services, Dewost and Ehlermann, clearly laid down a ruling that  made the guarantee less usable than the Danish interpretation  would have it.    The fact that there is a discrepancy in the interpretations  is not unusual, but the very strict Danish interpretation of the  environmental guarantee has ultimately become a problem for  Denmark in the negotiations in Brussels.    A number of centrally placed Danish diplomats have admitted  to INFORMATION that the Danish interpretation is a distinct  inconvenience when Danish officials and ministers in Brussels  must fight to maintain Danish standards on environmental and  health issues. These officials argue that if those in Brussels  could "threaten" the Commission with the idea that Denmark might  invoke the environmental guarantee, such a threat could  influence the Commission to alter its proposals in a direction  more favorable to Denmark.  <H5>  Guarantee or Sop? </H5>   The basic difference in the interpretation of treaty Article  100 A, which contains the environmental guarantee, is largely a  matter of the extent to which this article is a genuine  guarantee for a better environment and the extent to which it is  a kind of sop to those countries who are likely to vote against  the directives on the inner market when they are put to a vote.  In 1985/86, there was no question in the Danish mind that the  article was a real guarantee.    "In those instances in which the uniform technical  regulations do not adequately safeguard health, work  environment, or the environment in general, a member nation may  introduce national measures with the object of fulfilling this  goal," Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, then foreign affairs minister,  assured the Folketing on 28 January 1986. He was backed up by a  number of statements issued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry in  the period before the national election.    However, in at least four areas, the Danish interpretation  of  the guarantee diverges from the interpretation in other places.  This concerns:     -  Regulations established in committee procedures.    -  The  extent to which a nation must vote negatively in order to invoke  the environmental guarantee.    -  The extent to which a nation has  the right to invoke the environmental guarantee for the purpose  of introducing stricter regulations at a later date, after an EC  regulation has already passed.    -  Which party should bear the  burden of proof when the EC Court is called upon to determine  whether a nation may set higher standards for the environment  and health.  <H5>  Food Coloring </H5>   Of these, the final point is the crucial reason why Denmark  on a number of occasions has refrained from invoking the  environmental guarantee. Both in the case of warning labels for  cancer-causing substances and in the present case of the  so-called food-coloring directive, problems have arisen because  there is disagreement among the technical experts on the  inherent danger of the substance. While, in Denmark, it is  regarded as a fact that a number of substances allowed by the  directive are dangerous, a number of experts from other  countries consider these substances to be harmless. Therefore,  if Denmark is to invoke the environmental guarantee with any  effect, a crucial question must be who would have the burden of  proof if such a case should go before the EC Court. The European  Commission does not hesitate in this matter. According to the  Commission, the country that wishes to invoke the environmental  guarantee has the burden of proof before the Court to  substantiate its claim. The Danish interpretation is exactly the  opposite.    "It is obvious that if the Court is to render an opinion on  the allegation of misuse, it is incumbent upon the party  bringing the complaint to substantiate it. The burden of proof  on the member nations will as a result be lighter," wrote Kent  Kirk, the current Conservative EU spokesman, in a commentary in  INFORMATION on 24 February 1986.    Should Denmark invoke the environmental guarantee in  conjunction with the food-coloring directive, the fact that  Denmark overinterpreted the guarantee in 1986 would in all  likelihood be revealed.  <H5>  Freedom of Action </H5>   And, if at a later point, it could be shown that some of the  substances that are now permitted by the food-coloring directive  in Denmark were dangerous, it would not be possible to tighten  up on Danish regulations by invoking the environmental guarantee  without the risk of raising a conflict over interpretation.    "It must follow that even if the Council has passed joint  regulations, a member state can retain more comprehensive  pre-existing regulations; that a member state can choose  directly at the time of passage and implementation of the EC  regulation to impose stricter national regulations, or else  choose in the first instance to utilize the joint regulations,  but later -- in light of developments -- choose to tighten these  through the use of national regulations," wrote the Foreign  Affairs Ministry in a statement issued 30 January 1986.    Evidence that the Commission does not agree with this  interpretation can be found, among other things, in an answer  given by the Commission in the European Parliament on March 1987  to Else Hammerich, a member of the EC Parliament at that time.    One problem with the food-coloring directive is that, once  the directive is passed, a special committee will continually  revise the list of substances that are allowed or prohibited. In  the debate on the directive, former Industry Minister Jan  Trojborg has put a great deal of emphasis upon the fact that  Denmark was able to insert a clause to the effect that in the  period before the directive goes into effect this committee  should evaluate a number of substances again. The Danish  interpretation of the environmental guarantee suggests that  Denmark could also avail itself of the environmental guarantee  with regard to the committee's later work, while the Commission  in its answer to Hammerich clearly said no to that kind of use  of the guarantee. The EU Court has, as a result, decided that if  Denmark wishes to invoke the environmental guarantee on the  food-coloring directive, it must occur immediately after the  passage of the directive.    The environmental guarantee has again been dusted off by,  among others, Health Minister Torben Lund who has urged using it  in connection with the food-coloring directive. But, in other  places -- especially in the central administration -- there is  very little enthusiasm for turning this kind of political  leverage into a legal proceeding. Denmark has too many potential  skeletons in the closet for that.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Why the Financial Times has a new look THE CHANGES to section one of the Financial Times today represent the latest in a series of design modifications aimed at improving the appearance and usefulness of the newspaper. In order to increase typographical clarity, we have increased the space between lines of text throughout the newspaper. We have also switched from an eight to a seven column grid on the front page, the back page of section one and on certain features pages. This will help us to display features and news reports more attractively. Compensating changes have meant that these improvements will not involve any loss of words. The world news and business news summaries on the front page have been replaced by a single column summarising all prime news items of interest to FT readers. This column will continue to offer busy readers a two-minute world news briefing. We have also sought to improve the signposting of various elements in the paper and to increase the orderliness of its five basic sections: international news, UK news, features, company news and market news. In the coming months, this will enable us to add new features and to extend the statistical services of the newspaper. We have tried to minimise changes to positions of regular items. From today, however, an expanded appointments column will appear in section one of the paper rather than on the back page of section two. It has been renamed People and can be found today on page 14. All the other changes are aimed at improving the appearance and readability of the newspaper. A second phase in the redesign, mainly affecting section two, will appear in the autumn. Readers dislike changes in their daily newspaper, and we have deliberately limited our redesign to the minimum necessary to achieve the goals of greater clarity and orderliness. All the same, it will take a little time to get used to the new look - especially the summary column on the front page, which is one of the newspaper's best read and most valued features. Our belief is that the benefits of the changes will become increasingly apparent in the coming months. We hope that you will agree.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> GOINGS ON SANTA BARBARA;  </P> <P> SATURDAY PUSH;  </P> <P> SINGER KENNY LOGGINS WILL AGAIN LEAD AN ANNUAL TELETHON TO BENEFIT THE NEEDY OF  THE TRI-COUNTY AREA.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara singer Kenny Loggins, a veteran of benefit concerts and  fund-raisers, came up with the idea of Christmas Unity four years ago.  </P> <P> The nonprofit organization is a unified campaign throughout the counties of  Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo to attract money, food, toys and  clothing for the needy.  </P> <P> Loggins again heads the annual Christmas Unity Telethon, scheduled from 5 p.m.  to 1 a.m. Saturday on KEYT-TV, Channel 3. Among his guests will be actors  Michael Douglas and Jane Seymour. The past three telethons have raised more  than $350,000, and Loggins said he hopes this year's event will set a new  pledge record of $200,000.  </P> <P> Contributions come from throughout the tri-counties, with the money donated by  each county going directly back to that area.  </P> <P> Also in the Christmas spirit of unity, the Santa Barbara Trust for Historic  Preservation will stage a bilingual play tonight through Dec. 16, (except  Mondays). "Una Pastorela" is in the tradition of the many shepherd's plays that  were brought by European settlers to California, then a part of Mexico.  </P> <P> In the 1850s, Pablo de la Guerra, who lived in Santa Barbara, transcribed one  of the plays. Five years ago, Francisco Gonzalez, a Santa Barbara resident,  found the script in the mission's archives and adapted it as a bilingual play,  to be performed by both professional and amateur actors in the community.  Gonzalez, a former member of the rock group Los Lobos, also wrote the music for  the lyrics.  </P> <P> The fifth annual presentation will be at the Presidio Chapel, 124 E. Canon  Perdido at 8 p.m., with an additional 5 p.m. performance weekends. Tickets are  $5. Call 966-9719.  </P> <P> Beatrice Wood, an internationally known Ojai artist, will have an exhibit of  her ceramic art at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art Saturday through Jan. 20.  </P> <P> Her pottery, both wheel-thrown and handcrafted, is known for its iridescent  glazes. The exhibit will focus on a selection of her larger vases, but some of  her figurative works and tiles will also be included.  </P> <P> Admission to the museum is $3, and is free Thursdays and the first Sunday of  each month. Call 963-4364.  </P> <P> For holiday entertainment with a twist, the public will provide the  entertainment and a bunch of animals will serve as the audience. The Santa  Barbara Zoo will hold its annual Sing-to-the-Animals afternoon of Christmas  caroling Sunday. It's mostly for the kids but anyone who wants to sing to the  bears and monkeys and lions is invited.  </P> <P> Carolers should meet at the information booth at the zoo's parking lot at 2  p.m. Participants will be led on a musical tour of the zoo with a  representative who will provide commentary and background information on the  animals. Admission is $4; children $2. Call 962-5339.  </P> <P> The Santa Barbara City College Jazz Ensemble will play at 8 p.m. Monday at the  Garvin Theater. Admission is $6.

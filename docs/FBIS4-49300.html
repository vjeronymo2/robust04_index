			<p>BFN     [Text] Shijiazhuang, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Efforts should be  made to strengthen regional co-operation to promote economic  development along north China's Bohai Bay, an official said here  today.    Chen Liyou, deputy governor of north China's Hebei Province,  said that the Bohai economic rim is China's third economic  booming area following the Zhujiang and Chang Jiang River Deltas.    Located at the center of the Bohai rim, Hebei should give  top  priority to the development of regional economic co-operation,  he said.    He added that redoubled efforts should be made to strengthen  infrastructure facilities such as highways and ports in the  province to promote regional prosperity.    Hebei serves as a major gateway for the country's coal  exports from inland provinces and also as a link for other  provinces and cities within the economic rim, including  Liaoning, Shanxi and Shandong Provinces, and Beijing and Tianjin  Cities, the official said.    The province also boasts geographical advantages and rich  natural resources. It has a coastline of 487 km.    He noted that the provincial government has decided to work  hard to upgrade its numerous state-owned enterprises in the  metallurgy, chemicals and building materials industries.    The province has also made great efforts to harness the  Yanshan and Taihang Mountains to bolster economic development  and social stability in the area of Beijing and Tianjin and on  the north China plain.    In infrastructure construction the province has listed ten  major projects to fit in the development of the Bohai economic  rim, the official said.    Talking about railway construction, he said that emphasis  will be placed on the building of the Shenmu-Huanghua Railway  leading from northern Shaanxi Province to Bohai Bay, and the  Handan-Jinan Railway from Handan City in Hebei Province to  Jinan, capital of Shandong Province.    At the same time, he said, the construction of the northern  section of the Beijing-Shenzhen and Beijing-Shanghai Expressways  will also be accelerated this year. And the pace of building  other expressways and highways in the province will be quickened.    He added that an expressway and highway network will soon be  built in the ring area, including roads and highways for coal  transportation.    In addition, construction of ports and airports in this area  will be strengthened. The focus will be on building the  Huanghua Port, the Jingtang Port at Tangshan City and the  Shijiazhuang International Airport.    Speaking of energy resources, the deputy governor said that  to ease the bottleneck in power supply in the area, the province  will step up the building of its own power stations while  importing electricity transmitted from Shanxi Province and the  Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.    He said that in telecommunications construction nearly 20  national and local optical fiber lines will be built within the  province.    The official said that the focus of iron and steel  industrial  construction will be on the expansion and rebuilding of six  major steel production bases to produce a total of more than  five million tons a year.    The province will also channel more funds toward the  development of several water-control projects to meet the demand  for drinking water in the Beijing-Tianjin area.</p>

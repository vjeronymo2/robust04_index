			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Book Claims GM Approached Honda: General Motors unsuccessfully approached  Japanese auto maker Honda Motor Co. about a joint venture or merger before GM  joined forces with Toyota Motor Co. in California, according to a new book on  the largest American car maker. The book, "Rude Awakening: The Rise, Fall and  Struggle for Recovery of General Motors" by analyst Maryann Keller, also says  GM's treasurer suggested three years ago that it would be more prudent for the  auto maker to settle for 35% of the U.S. car market rather than devote its  energies to regaining the 45% share it once held. The book is being published  by William Morrow &amp; Co. and will be available next week.  </P></p>

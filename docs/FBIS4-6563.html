			<p>BFN     [Text] On behalf of the Government's Standing Committee,  Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai has approved the targeted  development plan for the Bac Bo lowlands. The plan was  presented at a recent meeting with chairmen of the people's  committees of Hanoi and Haiphong Cities and of Quang Ninh, Ha  Bac, and Hai Hung Provinces.    Under the plan, the cities of Hanoi, Haiphong, and Ha Long  of  Quang Ninh Province will play a strategically important role in  the socioeconomic stabilization and development program for the  Bac Bo lowlands and the country as a whole. Hanoi, Haiphong,  and Ha Long will become the entrances to the Bac Bo lowlands and  key industrial centers. These cities show great potential in  tourism, mineral resources, manpower, and sea-based economy.  They also create many favorable conditions for exploiting and  upgrading local sea port facilties to the same standards set by  other sea ports in a number of Southeast Asian countries.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Constitution of the CPPCC -- adopted on 11 December 1982 by </F> the Fifth Session of the Fifth CPPCC National Committee and  revised by the Second Session of the Eighth CPPCC National  Committee in March 1994]    [Text] General Principles    In the course of many years of revolution and construction,  the Chinese have established the broadest patriotic united front  led by the CPC. It embraces democratic political parties,  nonparty democratic figures, people's organizations, minority  nationalities, and patriotic figures from all walks of life; and  it includes all socialist working people, patriots who support  socialism and uphold the unification of the motherland, and  compatriots in and from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and  Chinese nationals residing abroad.    The PRC Constitution provides that the system of multiparty  cooperation and political consultations under the CPC's  leadership will exist and develop for a long time to come.    The Chinese People's Political Consultative Committee  [CPPCC]  is a patriotic united front organization of the Chinese people.  It is an important organ of multiparty cooperation and  political consultations under the CPC's leadership. In  exercising the powers of the National People's Congress [NPC],  which had not yet been founded, and representing the will of the  Chinese people, the First Plenary Session of the CPPCC  proclaimed the founding of the PRC in September 1949, thereby  fulfilling an important historical function. Since the convening  of the First NPC in 1954, the CPPCC has continued to do much  work in China's political and social life and in the field of  friendly activities with foreign countries, thus making great  contributions in these respects. Since the convening of the  Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee in  December 1978, the CPPCC has continued to play an important role  in eliminating chaos and restoring order; consolidating and  developing political stability and unity; shifting the focus of  state affairs to economic construction; promoting reform,  opening up, and socialist modernization; striving for national  reunification with the return of Taiwan; and launching the  struggle against hegemony and safeguarding world peace.    Led by the CPC following the founding of the PRC, Chinese  people of all nationalities have abolished the system of  exploitation and have established a socialist system.  Fundamental changes have taken place in the class situation in  Chinese society. The worker-peasant alliance has been further  consolidated. Intellectuals, like the workers and peasants, are  force to be relied on in our socialist cause. The overwhelming  majority of people formerly belonging to the exploitive classes  have now become laborers earning their own living. The  democratic parties, which have advanced along with the CPC in  the people's revolution and construction and which together with  it have undergone trials and made important contributions, are  playing increasingly vital roles as political coalitions of  sections of the socialist working people and patriots supporting  socialism connected with them. A socialist relationship based  on equality, unity, and mutual help has been established between  China's different nationalities. Patriotic figures in religious  circles are taking an active part in the country's socialist  construction. Patriots in and from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao,  and Chinese nationals residing abroad love their motherland,  uphold her reunification, and support her construction. China's  patriotic united front has taken on greater vitality in the new  historical period, and it remains an important "magic weapon"  for uniting the Chinese people in their struggles to build up  their country and achieve national reunification. It will be  further consolidated and developed.    China is in the primary stage of socialism, and the main  contradiction at present is the contradiction between the  people's ever-increasing material and cultural needs and the  backwardness of our social production. Because of internal  factors and influences from abroad, the struggle of the Chinese  people against hostile forces and elements at home and abroad  will still be a protracted one. Class struggle, although  continuing to exist within limits for a long time to come, will  no longer constitute the principal contradictions in Chinese  society. The basic task of the Chinese people of all  nationalities is to act in accordance with the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, uphold the  basic line in the primary stage of socialism, concentrate their  efforts on socialist modernization, and work hard and  self-reliantly to achieve the modernization of industry,  agriculture, national defense, and science and technology step  by step to turn China into a strong and prosperous socialist  country with a high level of culture and democracy. On the  political basis of love for the PRC and support for the  leadership of the CPC and the socialist cause, the CPPCC will do  all it can to further strengthen and develop the patriotic  united front, mobilize all positive factors and unite all people  who can be united, work with one heart and with everyone  contributing ideas and efforts, focus on economic construction,  protect and develop the political situation of stability and  unity, advance the socialist democratic and legal systems,  promote socialist spiritual civilization, push forward the  development of the socialist market economy, and fulfill the  fundamental tasks of the people of all nationalities across the  country.    The CPPCC is an important instrument of socialist democracy  in our country's political life. In accordance with the policy  of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" between the  CPC and the democratic parties and nonparty figures and the  principle of "treating each other with all sincerity and sharing  weal or woe," it participates in political consultation with  regard to major state policies and important issues concerning  the people's life and it practices democratic supervision by  making suggestions and criticism.

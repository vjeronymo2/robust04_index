			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / High turnout in S African poll OUTSIDE the Jan van Riebeeck school polling station in Cape Town yesterday there was a consensus: everyone in the 100-metre queue planned to vote 'yes' in South Africa's make-or-break referendum - or if not, they were keeping quiet about it. There was a big turnout, with long queues forming at many polling booths around the country as whites cast their votes in the most important poll in South Africa's history. 'In my 40 years in politics I have never, never seen a voting turnout as high as the one for this referendum,' said one anti-apartheid politician. About 70 per cent of the 3.3m white electorate cast their votes, with polling as high as 80 per cent in some areas. Reformers and the right-wing opponents were both predicting that they would be the victors when the outcome is announced this morning. For a day at least, the intense rivalry of the campaign was set aside. Some polling stations, festooned with colourful posters, had an almost festive air. Party officials on duty, Conservatives and reformists alike, carefully tended their portable braaivleis (barbecues), enjoying a ritual that transcends party politics. The day passed without serious incident. The violence that has racked townships in the three weeks since President FW de Klerk called the referendum abated yesterday. By 9am hundreds of voters from the comfortable Cape Town suburb of Gardens had passed through the school gates, clearly sharing a sense of the momentousness of the occasion. Voter after voter proclaimed that there was only one choice in the poll: 'Yes, of course.' Yes for peace, yes for prosperity, yes for international sport and investment. Given the relatively liberal politics of Cape Town - worlds away from the harsh racist attitudes prevalent elsewhere - a majority 'yes' vote from Gardens would be scarcely surprising. Most voters said they did not expect their lives to change much if they voted 'yes' for power-sharing with blacks. Outside the City Hall polling station in Durbanville, just outside Cape Town, one voter put it this way: 'A 'yes' vote won't make any difference at all to my life. But a 'no' vote would be disaster.' Asked whether 'yes' meant he would accept a black man as president, he hesitated, looking around for a way to escape the question, before conceding: 'Well, maybe in a few years.' Voters in neighbouring Kraaifontein, a blue-collar suburb which is expected to vote resoundingly 'no', have a more immediate worry: squatters. Mr Frank Kratz, a former white settler in South West Africa, now Namibia, insisted that the town was surrounded by 50,000 squatters. 'Kraaifontein knows that the new South Africa means squatters. And they are voting no,' he said. On the edge of the town, the squatters who have so upset Mr Kratz and his neighbours sit outside hovels made of tin and packing cases, plastic and cardboard. The camp has no water, no toilets, no amenities. A local resident said he wanted whites to vote 'yes'. 'If they vote yes, then maybe we will get jobs, and they will do something about this place.' Even so, he seemed far from persuaded. Budget options, Page 4</p>

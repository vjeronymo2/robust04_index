			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hugo Caligaris] </F>   [Text] The meeting between [Radical Civic Union, UCR,  leader] Raul Alfonsin and Cordoba Governor Eduardo Angeloz has  been postponed because Angeloz changed his plans and will not be  coming to the federal capital this week. No new date has been  set for the meeting.    Angeloz' spokespersons told LA NACION that his decision  follows his desire to remain in his province on 29 April because  state employees will hold a public demonstration. They added  that Alfonsin flatly rejected the Cordoba Province proposal to  reorganize the UCR. This proposal includes shortening Alfonsin's  mandate and calling internal elections to elect a new UCR  president, a post that the governor of Cordoba wants.    Late last night, Alfonsin's highest-ranking spokespersons  had  no news about the postponement, which Angeloz decided over the  weekend. This faux pas shows the seriousness of the internal  crisis.    On 26 April, Alfonsin had a long meeting with Pascual  Cappelleri, Cesar Jaroslavsky, Marcelo Bassani, and Simon Lazara  to discuss "administrative matters" of the Constituent Assembly.  On 29 April, the Justicialist will be asked for a meeting. At  this meeting, the UCR will demand that the first vice presidency  of the Constituent Assembly be given to one of its members.    Here is another sign of tension among the people from  Cordoba: Up to 26 April, the Alfonsin faction stressed this post  would go to Ramon Mestre, the former mayor of Cordoba City. On  26 April, after the meeting with Angeloz was postponed, the  Alfonsin faction announced that nothing had been resolved yet.    Mestre is a member of the negotiating commission together  with Cappelleri, Jaroslavsky, and Bassani. He did not show up on  26 April at the UCR headquarters to participate in the lengthy  meeting between Alfonsin and his followers.</p>

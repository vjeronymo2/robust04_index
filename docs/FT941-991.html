			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Coalition's grip grows tighter: Local government elections France's governing centre-right coalition last night appeared set to strengthen its grip on local government following the second and final round of voting in regional council elections. After a strong showing in the first round on March 20, the RPR-UDF coalition headed by Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, was well placed yesterday to win control of up to eight departments, adding to the 75 of France's 95 departments it already held. The opposition Socialist party, which suffered a crushing defeat in last year's general elections, was well placed to win four more departments. A strong performance is important for Mr Balladur, who has seen his personal popularity decline steadily since the beginning of the year and who is currently confronted by a powerful challenge from the country's student movement. Tens of thousands of students have taken over to the streets over the past few weeks to protest against a law which allows young apprentices to be paid less than the minimum wage. A survey published yesterday by the BVA polling institute found 64 per cent of voters wanted the law repealed. But analysts said the issue might not have a big impact on the regional elections. These elections, which represented the first significant test of the government's support since it took office in March last year, concerned the 1,372 districts in which there was no outright winner in the first round. The seats involved were last contested in 1988, when the Socialist party recorded strong gains. The 95 conseils generals are an important part of France's structure of local government. Their responsibilities include the management and development of public services, such as transport and health care, outside urban areas. In the first round of the regional elections, the RPR-UDF coalition won 44.7 per cent of the vote, compared with 28.7 per cent for the Socialists. The extreme right National Front won about 10 per cent of the vote, with the ecologists suffering a sharp fall in support to just over 2 per cent.</p>

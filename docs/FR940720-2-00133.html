The Exchange is proposing to list warrants based on the Nikkei 300 Index. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The Nikkei 300 Index is comprised of 300 stocks which are representative of the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (``TSE''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange also has proposed to list and trade options on the Nikkei 300 Index.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34198 (June 10, 1994), 59 FR 31282 (June 17, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Index was designed and is maintained by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. (``NKS''). The Index's component securities were selected for their high market capitalization and high degree of liquidity, and are representaitve of the relative distribution of industries within the broader Japanese equity market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The median capitalization of the companies in the Nikkei 300 Index on March 31, 1994 was  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=1 --> y <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 340.1 billion ($3.3 billion at the exchange rate of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=1 --> y <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 102.75 per US$1.00 prevailing on March 31, 1994). The average market capitalization of these companies was $7.5 billion on the same date and using the same rate of exchange. The individual market capitalization of these companies ranged from $875 million to $75.5 billion on March 31, 1994. The largest stock accounted for 3.41 percent of the total weighting of the Index, while the smallest accounted for 0.04 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Index is a capitalization weighted index and is calculated by multiplying the price of each component security (in Japanese yen) by its number of shares outstanding, adding those products, and dividing by the current Index divisor. The Index divisor initially was determined to yield a benchmark value of 100 on October 1, 1982. The divisor is adjusted for certain changes described below. The Index's closing value on July 8, 1994 was 301.48. For valuation purposes, one Nikkei 300 Index unit (1.0) is assigned a fixed value of US$1.00. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Index will be maintained by NKS. To maintain continuity of the Index, the divisor will be adjusted to reflect certain events relating to the component securities. These events include, but are not limited to, changes in the number of shares outstanding, spin-offs, certain rights issuances, and mergers and acquisitions. The competition of the Index will be reviewed periodically by NKS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Warrant issues on the Index will conform to the listing guidelines under Amex  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Company Guide <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 106, which provide that (1) the issuer shall have assets in excess of $100,000,000 and otherwise substantially exceed the size and earnings requirements of Section 101(a); (2) the term of warrants shall be for a period ranging from one to five years from the date of issuance; and (3) the minimum public distribution of such issues shall be 1,000,000 warrants, together with a minimum of 400 public holders, and a minimum aggregate market value of $4,000,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nikkei 300 Index warrants will be direct obligations of their issuer subject to cash settlement in dollars, and either exercisable throughout their life ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , American style) or exercisable only on their expiration date ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , European style). Upon exercise, or at the warrant expiration date (if not exercisable prior to such date), the holder of a warrant structured as a ``put'' would receive payment in U.S. dollars to the extent that the Nikkei 300 Index has declined below a pre-stated cash settlement value. Conversely, holders of a warrant structured as a ``call,'' upon exercise or at expiration, would receive payment in U.S. dollars to the extent that the Index has increased above the pre-stated cash settlement value. If ``out-of-the-money'' at the time of expiration, the warrants likely would expire worthless. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Amex has adopted suitability standards applicable to recommendations to customers of index warrants and transactions in customer accounts. Amex Rule 421, Commentary .02, requires a Senior Registered Options Principal or a Registered Options Principal to approve and initial a discretionary order in index warrants on the day entered. In addition, the Exchange, prior to the commencement of trading, will distribute a circular to its membership calling attention to specific risks associated with warrants on the Index. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

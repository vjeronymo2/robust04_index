			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO DISCOVERY  </P> <P> MORE VIDEOS:  </P> <P> "Moonlighting" (1982), directed by Jerzy Skolimowski. 97 minutes. Rated PG. An  unforgettable story of four Polish construction workers sent to London to  renovate the foreign getaway of their wealthy boss.  </P> <P> It's comical, touching, newsy and political -- a heartfelt tale of workingmen's  values and Western consumerism.  </P> <P> "Smile" (1975), directed by Michael Ritchie. 113 minutes. Rated PG. One of a  series of Michael Ritchie films about America's unbending faith in traditions  and pageantry, no matter how tarnished. In this one, it's a beauty pageant that  takes it on the chin. Look for an 18-year-old Melanie Griffith as one of the  contestants.  </P> <P> "The Pajama Game" (1957), directed by Stanley Donen and George Abbott. 101  minutes. No rating. The plot is frivolous and obvious, the acting hammy, and  much of the dialogue outright dumb, but who cares? This musical, starring Doris  Day and John Raitt, is buoyed by Richard Adler/Jerry Ross songs and Bob Fosse  choreography. And it's good, clean American fun.  </P> <P> "Heart Beat" (1980), directed by John Byrum. 109 minutes. Rated R. This  character study of Beat Generation legends Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady and  the woman they both loved is an enjoyable piece of nostalgia, a kind of '50s  version of "Easy Rider." It stars Nick Nolte, John Heard and Sissy Spacek.  </P> <P> "Cutter's Way" (1981), directed by Ivan Passer. 109 minutes. Rated R. The story  of a crippled veteran, his best friend and their efforts to solve a murder.  It's one of the best introspective character studies in years, a welcome island  of reality in Hollywood's sea of fantasy. DOUG LIST  </P></p>

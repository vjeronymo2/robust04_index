			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Digital sells its 7.9% interest in Olivetti Digital Equipment, the US computer company struggling to cut costs, has sold nearly 100m Olivetti shares, acquired for Dollars 287.8m in 1992 as part of an ambitious plan to strengthen links with the Italian computer group. The 7.9 per cent stake was gradually sold during the slack holiday period. At yesterday's closing Olivetti share price, it would be worth about L230bn (Dollars 147.43m), although the US group yesterday declined to reveal how much it received for the sale of its stake. However, Digital said that it wrote down in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1994 more than half of the intangible assets, valued at Dollars 204m, included in the Olivetti stake. Digital said that the sale did not mark the end of product and technological co-operation. The US company stressed that it would continue to be an important client of Olivetti for components, terminals and PCs, and a partner in markets where Olivetti is present. However, industry sources pointed out that the divestment, part of an extensive programme of sell-offs by the US company, had weakened the two-year-old accord, originally heralded as a bold move to buy access to Europe's largest personal computer group. Recession and management problems at Digital have undermined those ambitions. The US group announced an extensive programme of restructuring earlier this year, involving the sale of assets and the loss of 20,000 jobs. Olivetti put a brave face on the news, pointing out that the sale of a large block of shares had been 'easily absorbed by the market, and in particular institutional investors', with no marked effect on the share price. It added that some 75 per cent of its capital was now owned by small shareholders and institutional investors, of which 50 per cent are foreign. Digital announced its plan for closer co-operation with Olivetti in June 1992, buying some 4 per cent of the Italian company immediately and indicating that it would increase its holding to as much as 10 per cent over two years. The US group accelerated its investment programme last year, lifting its holding to 8.21 per cent by May this year, which made Digital the largest Olivetti shareholder after Cir, one of the holding companies of Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Italian company's chairman. The stake has since been diluted by capital increases and the conversion of bonds into shares.</p>

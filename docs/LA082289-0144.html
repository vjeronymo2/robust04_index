			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LAST STUDIO DRIVE-IN PICTURE SHOW  </P> <P> Thirty some years ago Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox scored big with "Rebel  Without a Cause" and "The Seven Year Itch." If you were watching James Dean and  superblonde Marilyn Monroe in those days, you may have been trying to score too  -- at least, if you were in the back seat of a '49 Ford at one of the nation's  4,000 drive-in theaters.  </P> <P> The drive-ins, introduced to postwar America's booming families as a way of  getting out without having baby-sitting bills, became the teen-age haunt of the  '50s.  </P> <P> "It's where everyone went on the weekend," says 50-year-old Ronn Teitelbaum, a  lifelong resident of Los Angeles and the president of Johnny Rockets restaurant  chain. "It was definitely a hangout. It made little difference what the movie  was, 'cause by the end of the school week we'd just say, 'Meet ya at the  drive-in on Saturday night.' We'd go in groups of four or five cars and  afterwards we'd go and get a soda."  </P> <P> You didn't have to be there to appreciate it, though. Wednesday night, in the  last of four events on the Los Angeles Conservancy's "Last Remaining Seats"  series, the Studio Drive-In in Culver City is hosting "Nifty Fifties Night,"  complete with '50s music, a Hula-Hoop contest, a tailgating party and a  screening of "The Girl Can't Help It," a 1956 musical comedy that featured rock  'n' rollers Little Richard and Fats Domino and starred Jayne Mansfield and Tom  Ewell.  </P> <P> Ewell, who also co-starred with Marilyn Monroe in "The Seven Year Itch," will  make an appearance at the theater.  </P> <P> "We're bidding a fond farewell to the Studio Drive-In," says the Conservancy's  associate director Gregg Davidson.  </P> <P> The theater is scheduled for demolition within the next 18 months. This year,  Southern California also will lose the Pickwick in Burbank and Westchester, and  the Centinela Drive-In near the Fox Hills Mall on the Westside will be replaced  by a housing development.  </P> <P> "These 20-, 25-acre parcels of land are very strategically located (near  interstates) and prove more worthy as real estate developments," says Milton  Moritz of the Pacific Theater chain, which operates the Studio and 63 other  drive-ins in Southern California and about 2,000 nationwide.  </P> <P> "The drive-in is far from being lowered into the coffin and frankly I think  there will always be drive-ins. There are a lot of people who just don't want  to go to a walk-in," says Moritz.  </P> <P> With double features like "Batman"and "Lethal Weapon 2" playing at the  drive-in, you just might tolerate the cramped quarters of a Hyundai to see Mel  Gibson and Kim Basinger on a 50 x 100-foot screen.  </P> <P> First-run movies are playing and succeeding at drive-ins for the first time in  recent years. In fact, five out of the six top-grossing movies for the summer  are playing simultaneously at the walk-ins and drive-ins: "Batman,"  "Ghostbusters II," "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," "Lethal Weapon 2" and "Dead  Poets Society."  </P> <P> "The last two years have really been the two best years for drive-ins in a long  time," says Moritz. "Years ago you had what were known as sub-runs," he adds.  For instance, the first-runs being released in Hollywood at Mann's Chinese or  Egyptian theaters weren't released at the drive-ins until a week or even a  month later.  </P> <P> Besides first-runs, there are other incentives for going to a drive-in today,  not the least of which are cost and comfort. "People are rediscovering that  this is an easy way to go to a movie," says Moritz.  </P> <P> First of all, a family of four can attend for $9 -- $4.50 per adult, children  under 12 free -- and save whatever they'd pay their baby-sitters. They can  watch "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" and talk it to death without disturbing anyone  around them. They can smoke to their heart's content without getting thrown out  by an usher. As Moritz puts it: "At the drive-in you're master of your own  ship."  </P> <P> Drive-ins have undergone a number of renovations in recent years. At  multiscreen complexes such as the Winnetka in Chatsworth, which was patterned  after the indoor theaters, Moritz says: "We have as many as six to eight box  offices operating at once." Cars and trucks can line up at the ticket booths  one hour before the show.  </P> <P> Fortunately, the sound system has been improved too. Gone are the days of the  squawk box. Pacific theaters, among others, uses a system called Cine-Fi, which  enables drive-in goers to listen to the movie through their car stereo. "If you  have a great radio, you'll have great sound; and most cars today have great  radios," says Moritz.  </P> <P> Still, few would dispute the fact that a car stereo can't compete with  Lucasfilm's THX or Dolby, the sound-enhanced stereo systems being used at most  indoor theaters these days.  </P> <P> "There's no denying that (THX and Dolby) are far more impressive and offer a  better presentation of the sound effects," says Tim Warner, president of the  National Association of Theater Owners (NATO) in California.  </P> <P> What's most modern is not always better, though. The cars of yesteryear were  bigger and more comfortable according to Teitelbaum, who watched a lot of B  movies in his '49 Ford convertible at the Olympic Drive-In in West Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Teitelbaum says he doesn't go to drive-ins today, but said he might show up at  the Studio on Wednesday for nostalgia's sake.  </P> <P> "We're used to watching TV at home, lying there comfortably in bed or on the  couch," he says. "Besides, for Southern Californians who spend a large  percentage of their time in cars anyway, (there is no incentive.)"  </P> <P> Many people with short memories or with parents who are still sensitive to the  issue after all these years say the drive-in's reputation as a passion pit is  myth and legend. Teitelbaum has a clear memory of what they were.  </P> <P> "Absolutely they were passion pits," he said, laughing. "At that time nobody  would even consider living together or spending the night together. There was  no way you could get into a motel, so the drive-in was really the only place to  go."  </P> <P> Teitelbaum also remembers going with his parents when he was young: "We watched  two movies, a short subject, a cartoon and the (Movie Tone news). It was the  only picture we had of what was going on in the world."  </P> <P> Actor Tom Ewell, 80, said in a telephone interview that he never went to the  drive-ins himself.  </P> <P> "I like to believe that when you go to see a movie, you almost fall in with the  people on the screen," he said, "(but) the drive-ins were too big and there  were all those cars around and I never felt that I could lose myself if I was  watching a movie there. I like more contact with the people performing."  </P> <P> With Wednesday night's guest appearance at the Studio Drive-In, he'll be a man  of his word.  </P></p>

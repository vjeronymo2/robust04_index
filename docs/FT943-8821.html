			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / The Markets: Protesting too much - Global Investor There should be limits to how much worry you can expend on something you regard as a certainty. That is, however, not a principle which the US markets appear to be recognising this week. Despite rallying on Friday, the bond market remains nervous that the Federal Reserve will use Tuesday's meeting of the open market committee to raise short-term interest rates for the fifth time since February. The market's worries virtually scuppered Thursday's Dollars 40bn auction of 30-year bonds. But both bond and equity markets have now put themselves into a no-win frame of mind, where none of the courses which the Fed might adopt will prove reassuring. True, some indecision is justified by the way that successive sets of economic data alternate in suggesting strength and weakness in the economy. Thursday's retail sales figures for July showed prices, excluding car sales, rising by 0.4 per cent, slightly faster than Wall Street's expectations, but Friday's consumer price index figures then showed a smaller rise than analysts expected. However, the markets have reckoned that this pot-pourri of data will eventually throw up enough signs of capacity constraints to prompt the Fed into raising rates. That is probably right, given Fed officials' touchiness to the charge that they left rates too low for too long last year, and the anecdotal evidence from the Fed's own survey of its 12 district banks which suggests labour shortages and renewed consumer spending. The bond market is now virtually discounting a 50-point rise this week. Perversely, if that does not emerge, bonds may even slump on fears that the Fed has not been tough enough, and the market might well continue to assume a further rise by autumn. If the bond market's jitters are not calmed, it will be hard for equities to advance. But if there is a 50-point rise, equities may well take it badly; despite the strength of second quarter corporate earnings, shareholders remain nervous that the recovery is fragile and that profits could falter just as interest rates rise. Tuesday's meeting is unlikely to deliver a quick solution to that paralysis. Takeover flurry Among other reasons for fretting, Wall Street analysts have feared that a rate rise could undermine the current wave of takeovers, particularly if accompanied by a strengthening of the dollar. A survey of cross-border mergers and acquisitions* published last week by KPMG Peat Marwick, the international accountancy and consultancy firm, suggests that it would not. The most striking feature of the report, a quarterly worldwide survey of acquisitions, is that it confirms Wall Street's impression that much of the impetus behind current takeovers is overseas capital. In the past six months, according to KPMG, non-US companies spent more on acquisitions, joint ventures and stakes in the US than US companies spent abroad. This reverses the pattern of the past two years, when US 'exports' of deal capital outstripped imports. The switch has occured despite the absence of the Japanese from the world's takeover party. According to KPMG, the total value of Japanese acquisitions and investments outside Japan fell from Dollars 6bn in the first half of 1993 to Dollars 1bn in the second half and to Dollars 2bn in the first half of this year. There are obvious dangers in over-interpreting such surveys, given the lumpiness of the data, which is easily skewed by large deals. But the KPMG report, which tracks all publicly-announced deals between companies from different countries, numbering some 4,000 a year, does shed some light on the phenomenon. KPMG unsurprisingly attributes some of the inflow of foreign capital to the US to the dollar's weakness. Now that earnings are picking up, US companies look cheaper to foreign rivals than they have done for years. The survey also suggests uncontroversially that the steady rise in the size of acquisitions in the past few years - and in the frequency of 'mega-deals' - represents corporate confidence that the capital markets are willing again to fund rapid, large deals. That confidence could increase if Japanese investors overcome their nervousness about foreign exposure. Recent capital account figures suggest that they might: in June, there was a net outflow of Dollars 7.7bn long-term capital from Japan, including purchases of foreign bonds by Japanese investors. But you do not need to invoke the return of the Japanese to argue that high levels of takeovers will continue. The survey shows that nearly a third of all deals in the past 18 months in particular, measured by value, were driven by the extensive restructuring under way in the world's pharmaceutical, media and telecommunications industries. The figures also throw up an apparent paradox: a surge in deal making between companies across the 'Nafta' borders. In theory, last year's North American Free Trade Agreement, which lowered trade barriers between the US, Mexico and Canada, should reduce the need for a company to buy rivals across those borders in order to serve its markets. Yet companies spent Dollars 7bn on deals across Nafta borders in the first half of 1994 alone, and Dollars 11.4bn last year, compared to only Dollars 2.5bn in 1991. Mr Stephen Blum, a KPMG corporate finance director, suggests that the activity represents a preliminary shuffling of the pack of mature businesses such as food and textiles in anticipation of the growth in trade which will follow from Nafta. It also, he argues, reflects the 'creation of a seamless North American infrastructure' in industries such as telecoms. For instance, Nextel, the US telecoms group, is assembling a digital wireless network through a web of stakes in Canadian and Mexican companies, while Mexican companies have bought into satellite groups north of the border. That amounts to a more complex picture than the bargain-hunting scramble, prompted by the dollar's weakness, which some have portrayed. It suggests too that Wall Street's takeover advisers have little to fear from the Fed and the markets this week. * KPMG Quarterly analysis of cross-border transactions, KPMG New York (212) 909 5108.</p>

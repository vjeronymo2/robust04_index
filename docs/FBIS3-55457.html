Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys received a letter  from Christopher this week, saying the Brussels summit would be  a favorable possibility to start closer security cooperation  between the alliance and the newly emerging democracies in  Eastern Europe, including Lithuania, the Lithuanian Foreign  Ministry said.    Christopher said the summit is likely announce that NATO  will  welcome new members in the future. The alliance's evolutionary  expansion would preserve its strength, harmony among its members  and its ability to act.    The secretary of state said the Partnership for Peace  program  offers Lithuania close practical cooperation with both military  and political structures of NATO.

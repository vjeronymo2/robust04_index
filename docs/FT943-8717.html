			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Business and the Law: Intellectual licence - Proposed new patent guidelines in the US The arrival of new guidelines on the licensing of intellectual property, from an administration that has sometimes appeared to promise a new and more aggressive approach to anti-trust enforcement, has been anxiously awaited by lawyers and high technology companies. In the end, guidelines from the Department of Justice last week for a 60-day public comment period represented less of a change than some had feared. They recognise that the restrictions in many patent licensing agreements can be conducive to innovation and competition, rather than necessarily anti-competitive. Moreover, they contain no hint of mandatory licensing, which some officials had hinted they might try to enforce on companies whose technology dominates certain markets. Yet there is a shift in tone from the 1988 rules, which these proposed guidelines would replace, and from the laisser-faire attitudes of the Reagan Department of Justice. 'The 1988 guidelines had, perhaps, a subtext that anything goes, and that subtext is not present in these new guidelines,' says Mr Joseph Kattan, an anti-trust lawyer at the Washington office of Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius. The guidelines say that the Department of Justice will challenge some licensing agreements which it believes are used to restrict competition. In the 1980s, most patent licensing arrangements were viewed as vertical relationships between supplier and customer, rather than horizontal relationships between competitors, and thus less subject to challenge. The new guidelines show a greater willingness to treat the relationship between licensor and licensee as horizontal when the two would be actual or likely potential competitors had they not signed a licensing deal. While the existence of a horizontal relationship 'is not inherently suspect', it does open up more possibilities for challenge. There is not, however, a wholesale return to the ideas pervading the department in the 1960s and 1970s, when the underlying assumption was that patents were monopolies and were really narrowly defined exemptions from the normal anti-trust rules. Then, Justice defined 'nine no-nos' and brought many in-tellectual property cases and lost a high proportion. The new guidelines preserve much of the Reagan era view that patents and other forms of intellectual property create desirable incentives for innovation and productive activity by rewarding entrepreneurs, inventors and creators. 'The anti-trust laws and the intellectual property laws share the common purpose of promoting innovation and enhancing consumer welfare,' said Mrs Anne Bingaman, the assistant attorney general who heads the Department of Justice's anti-trust division. One departure is the definition of a safety zone within which the Department of Justice will not usually challenge a licence's restraints as long as they are not so flagrantly anti-competitive that they should be treated as unlawful per se, and as long as the licensor and licensee together account for no more more than 20 per cent of each market affected by the agreement. But because the zone is defined in terms of market share rather than dollar terms, there is uncertainty over how the market will be defined. For example, is the developer of a plain paper fax machine competing in the same market as makers of old thermal paper faxes, or has it created a new market in which its share is greater than 20 per cent? 'It's a good idea in that it gives comfort to people in an area in which they should have comfort, but if your innovation beats the socks off the alternatives in cost and quality, then it is probably a new market,' says Mr Donald Baker, a former assistant attorney general at the Department of Justice who practises anti-trust law in Washington DC. The guidelines also contain the first theoretical elaboration of the idea of innovation markets, although the concept has already been used, for example in a complaint last year against the proposed acquisition of a General Motors subsidiary by ZF Friedrichshafen. The Department of Justice argued the merged unit would almost monopolise the facilities for research on bus and lorry automatic transmissions. 'If the capacity for research and development activity that likely will produce innovation in technology is scarce and can be associated with identifiable specialised assets or characteristics of specific firms (which may or may not currently participate in the relevant technology or goods markets) it may be appropriate to consider separately the impact of the conduct in question on competition in research and development among those firms,' the guidelines state. What the department says and what it does may not, however, be the same. As one anti-trust lawyer points out, guidelines are written by 'intellectual front-office types', while cases are brought by back-room litigators who want to win cases - and Ms Bingaman's division has hired more of this species. Moreover, intellectual property lawyers have to take a long view in advising clients: will a licensing restraint stand up not only under this administration but in future? The question is not made simpler by the old age of some of the Supreme Court precedents, which might not survive in today's Court. Recent cases brought by the division in the intellectual property field suggest a more aggressive attitude in this administration. 'I don't have any doubt that the US is going to see a far tougher anti-trust policy than it did in the 1980s,' says Professor Robert Pitofsky, an anti-trust expert. While investigations began during the Bush administration into the licensing arrangements enforced by Pilkington, the British glassmaker, for its plate glass technology, the deployment of large platoons of government lawyers and economists that persuaded Pilkington to settle came under the Clinton administration. Attracting most attention is the settlement with Microsoft, the computer software group whose Dos and Windows operating systems give it a mighty position in the software market for IBM-compatible personal computers. The consent decree negotiated with Microsoft is actually limited. It avoids pursuing the argument that Microsoft has leveraged its de facto monopoly position, and declines to pursue the idea of erecting a Chinese wall between the company's operating system and applications software divisions, concentrating instead on some specific pricing and distribution complaints. Nevertheless, some of Ms Bingaman's predecessors from the 1980s have said they would not have brought the case.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Intellectual property: US Justice Department's new guiding principles  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  - Anti-trust laws apply to intellectual property as they do to any    other property  - Anti-trust enforcement should not unnecessarily interfere with the    licensing and transfer of intellectual property rights  - The Justice Department will not presume that a patent, copyright    or trade secret will necessarily give its owner 'market power'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

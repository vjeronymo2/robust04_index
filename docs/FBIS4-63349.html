			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 23 TASS -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister  Sergey Shakhray and President of Tatarstan Mintimer Shaymiyev  are going to propose to Ukraine and the Crimea to settle their  dispute like Moscow and Tatarstan did.    Shakhray told reporters on Monday that the example of  Tatarstan can show to the leaderships of Ukraine and the Crimea  "how it is possible to settle relations between a strong centre  and a strong region".    In Tatarstan secessionist moods were strong until Moscow  agreed to sign a bilateral share-power agreement with it.  Kazan, in its turn, agreed to participate in elections to the  new Russian parliament which failed in the republic mostly  because the local leadership was against them.    "We want to remind the Ukrainian and Crimean leaders that  relations between Moscow and Kazan could have developed along a  very bad scenario in their time, but Russian and Tatar leaders  had common sense enough to embark on the path of compromises and  concessions", Shakhray said and added that the situation  "normalised politically and economicaly" after the share-power  deal between Moscow and Kazan was reached.</p>

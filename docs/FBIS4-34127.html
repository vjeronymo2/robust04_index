			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 13 Jun (PL) -- An editorial published today  maintains that although the Cuban Government's applied financial  adjustment measures postpone salary increases for now they do  not seek to reduce the people's real income.    The weekly magazine TRABAJADORES indicates there is concern  and uncertainty among the people regarding their income,  following the decisions to cleanse the local economy and reduce  excess cash in circulation, calculated at 11 billion pesos (an  amount equal to dollars).    The measures include increasing certain prices and tariffs  and eliminating several subsidies. The steps are directed at  reactivating production and, therefore, supply. Experts say  these factors will contribute to the restoration of the people's  buying power.    After stressing this is not the time to raise the issue of  general salary increases, the editorial column reminds readers  the amount of cash in circulation does not necessarily determine  the amount received but, rather, its purchasing power.    It goes on to explain that Cuban black market activities are  often awarded certain virtues, but this activity, also known as  the underground economy and deemed illegal and unproductive on  the island, feeds on the state's resources or those that should  be sold to the state. It simply redistributes the goods instead  of promoting production.    Along this same line, and given the black market's inability  to generate more products or services to meet the demand, it  would be inconsistent to raise the people's salary with the  current excessive levels of cash already in circulation.    The article also finds "salary adjustments to meet the price  increases" an economic nonsense. This also renders as unviable  production incentives by way of monetary awards or salary  increases.    The TRABAJADORES editorial does recognize, however,  influential sectors of the national economy, such as tourism,  oil, mining, agriculture, the sugar industry, transportation,  power generation, port movement, and other such activities do  receive economic incentives in foreign currency for their  production efforts.    TRABAJADORES underscored this procedure is consistent with  the new economic system the Cuban authorities have designed,  under the present circumstances, "to bring the Socialist formula  of payment in accordance with the quantity and quality of each  worker's contribution."</p>

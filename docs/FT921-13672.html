			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / The real pains of withdrawal One can only envy the Americans. When the dollar rises sharply in thin markets, contrary to the current game plan, there is no agonised national debate, nor even anything which could be dignified as a policy decision. An un-named Treasury official (aka Mr David Mulford, surely) simply rings one of many friends in the press and remarks that there is 'no economic justification' for the rise. Now go long on the dollar if you dare; his next call might be to more influential friends in the Group of Seven. The fact that they might not share his view, and that a strong dollar is profoundly welcome to the more embattled of America's trade partners, is immaterial. In thin markets, talking the dollar down is usually highly effective. The subsequent fall in the dollar can be explained as a market movement, not a national disgrace; and so the growth of exports, currently the only positive factor in the US economy, is protected. Messrs Major and Lamont, inspecting the frost damage to the few green shoots they claimed to have found, must sometimes sigh in frustration. A devaluation would no doubt be seen as disgraceful and even cowardly; but it would work. There is no more reliable stimulus to a depressed economy than a gain in competitiveness, as Mrs Thatcher at least understood after the recovery from recession and over-valuation in 1982-83. It is also potentially inflationary; but that effect is most immediate in a fully stretched economy. It might be very slow and muted in this depressed, scared, price-cutting economy. There is still an economic case for sticking to the painful road we have chosen, but it is essentially long-term, and highly debatable at that. The decisive objections are political; and for different reasons, a possible future Labour government will find itself equally politically constrained. But the decision will not be taken for want of discussion. Meanwhile, the debate helps to sustain the pressure for a parity change, because it is bound to make the currency markets edgy. That means higher interest rates than would otherwise be needed, and a potential sterling crisis every time the trade figures take a lurch into the red. And in a vicious circle, each crisis will tend to renew the arguments. If and when the decision is finally taken - perhaps in a final pre-monetary-union realignment in Europe - the chancellor of the day will not be able to say, as poor Philip Snowden did in 1932: 'Nobody told us we could do that.' The case in favour of the hard road would be easier to support if its proponents were blunter about just how hard it is. A frank challenge usually gets better results than double-talk and evasion. What we are engaged in is an attempt to change national behaviour, and especially the habit of British employers of buying productivity improvements, or just plain peace, with 'excessive' wage increases. The excessiveness may be clear from a national point of view, but to a company which has just raised productivity and quality as, say, Rover has done, the figure may even look like a bargain. The strategy is already producing the desired results in the most internationally exposed sectors of the economy; but it is anybody's guess how long it will take for good new habits to spread to the more sheltered regions, and bring the averages down. (Perhaps it is this contrast which explains why some defenders of the present exchange rate argue that we should stick to it because it is already working, and some because it has not had time to work.) Pessimists guess at a long depression (as in Eire); optimists at some years of sluggish growth (as in France). The choice may look unattractive, but it is crucial. Slow growth and fairly stable employment are not much fun, but they are tolerable; but a long depression would provoke both people and capital into emigration. For that reason, the seemingly technical debate about the equilibrium exchange rate for sterling deserves much more serious attention than it has had up to now; it could settle the depression-versus-growth issue. This column is not the place to get into the details; but it can list some of the pertinent questions. The first is to ask the defenders of the present exchange rate to produce some technical case for what they are saying. Until now, it is the devaluers who have made all the running, attempting to estimate what rate would not only produce an appropriate trade balance (in surplus, that is to say, in a recession), but would tend to balance the flows of long-term capital, so that sterling need not be indefinitely sustained by attracting hot money. The resulting estimates of over-valuation are in the 10-20 per cent range. The stick-it-out school, by contrast, relies on evasion ('Policy cannot change the real exchange rate'; or 'Nobody can know the 'right' rate, anyway'), trade shares (flattered recently by the now-dead German boom) or largely meaningless history. The claim that the chosen rate is in line with the real average of the last two decades is true, but insignificant: it is the average of a roller-coaster whose track, set by oil resources and capital market fashions to name but two, is being reconstructed as we rise. All we know for certain is that British money wages are still quite low, and social costs not only below average, but likely to fall further behind the main European economies. That is why Nissan and others continue to invest here, and is the real long-term case for hope. But the short-term case for despair is that British unit costs are still rising faster than among our main competitors. Any over-valuation must be clawed back not just by falling into line with the competition, but by outperforming it. This means that every percentage point of over-valuation will probably take at least a year of misery to correct; so the numbers are vital. A government which understood this would surely be demanding a container-load of detailed studies. Its chances in the next election but one could depend on it.</p>

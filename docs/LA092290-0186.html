			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAKING THE HOME -- AND WORLD -- MORE ACCESSIBLE TO THE DISABLED  </P> <P> Access is an ongoing challenge for the disabled, according to Jim Wickersham,  who has been an occupational therapist at Casa Colina Hospital for  Rehabilitative Medicine in Pomona for 18 years.  </P> <P> "They have many forms of access problems," he says.  </P> <P> "The most basic has to do with space, how to enter and get around in their  living quarters. But people need access to the world as well -- no one wants to  be housebound."  </P> <P> Wickersham uses the telephone as one example.  </P> <P> "The phone company offers 'manual' service to the handicapped free of charge.  For people who can't dial or press buttons, telephone companies provide  equipment that connects them directly with an operator who handles the call for  them. It works with a speaker phone."  </P> <P> Other access-related devices are available too, from private elevators to  electronically controlled carousels (similar to those in dry-cleaning stores)  that "bring" clothes to a person.  </P> <P> "But unless you're wealthy or have incredible insurance benefits, these things  are just not within the range of most people," Wickersham notes.  </P> <P> "What occupational therapists try to do is find practical solutions for our  clients. Since every case is unique, it takes a team effort: the client, the  family, the physical therapist, the social worker.  </P> <P> "In the end, the best solution is what fits the situation."

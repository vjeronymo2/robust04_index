			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> HARD-LUCK LIFE IN HOBO JUNGLE;  </P> <P> HOMELESS: AS MANY AS 100 MEN AND WOMEN FIND SHELTER IN SHANTIES IN THE VENTURA  RIVERBED. THEY WERE ANGERED TO LEARN THAT AN ACCUSED CHILD MOLESTER LIVED IN  THEIR MIDST FOR A YEAR.  </P> <P> The men and women who live in a makeshift camp along the Ventura River bottom  known as Hobo Jungle are worried that the arrest of an accused child molester  living among them has given their homeless community a bad name.  </P> <P> Members of the river-bottom camp say they were surprised and outraged when they  learned that Don Ray Moore, a 56-year-old fugitive wanted on 21 felony counts  of child molesting, had been hiding out in their midst for almost a year.  </P> <P> "If we ever find another child molester in Hobo Jungle he'll have to dig his  own grave," said an eight-year resident called Silver because of the color of  his hair. "It brings the heat down here, and they start asking questions."  </P> <P> Ventura police do not believe other fugitives are hiding from the law among the  tents and bamboo huts along the river bottom northwest of Main Street, they  said last week. Men wanted for petty theft and public drunkenness, yes.  Hardened criminals, not likely.  </P> <P> Homeless advocates describe the people of Hobo Jungle as desperate drifters,  men and women who have fallen out of luck. Many drink too much. Some sleep off  their hangovers in the afternoon. Others collect recyclable cans for petty cash  or panhandle shoppers in town. But most do not commit dangerous crimes,  authorities agreed.  </P> <P> "I think this guy was the exception," said Lt. Art Farrar, who heads the  Ventura Police Department's patrol division. "We're dealing with a lot of  marginal . . . people that have been displaced by society. I don't think we're  dealing with wanted fugitives."  </P> <P> The area many Ventura residents call Hobo Jungle is actually known by the  homeless themselves simply as the river bottom. It is about half a mile from  the site of an earlier Hobo Jungle that was part of the town's history during  the Depression.  </P> <P> Before World War II, men down on their luck would jump off the train as it  slowed into Ventura, pitching tents for the night among the lush vines and  trees of Seaside Wilderness Park.  </P> <P> The park, a city preserve, allows no campers today, said Jeff Price, chief  ranger with the state Department of Parks and Recreation, which helps patrol  and protect the area.  </P> <P> Now the homeless live under the Main Street bridge and beyond in the river  bottom parallel to Peking Street. Ventura residents, however, still casually  use the phrase Hobo Jungle to mark the general location.  </P> <P> The homeless camp is hard to spot at first. While broken crates and empty beer  bottles litter the area, most of the actual dwelling places are hidden in  clumps of brush. On a recent morning, as the camp slowly awakened, one couple  dragged themselves off a mattress after dawn to take two bags stuffed with  recyclable cans up to town for change.  </P> <P> Marcy Canuet, 37, a former professional housekeeper from Connecticut, poked at  her husband, Leon, and said he had been up until 3 a.m. combing the beaches for  abandoned cans. She apologized for her makeshift home, which the couple moved  into from another Hobo Jungle site only two days before.  </P> <P> "It's not done yet," she said. "We have to get a table and stuff. I want to get  a table and put it over there." The four corners of her house are tent poles  covered with tarp. A ripped mattress covers half the floor area. Dirty pots sit  by the remains of a campfire, and a blue dress hangs from a rope tied between a  pole and a tree.  </P> <P> "It's better than being up there in an alley," she said. "You can smoke down  here. You can smoke cigarettes, drink wine. You live in a shelter, you have to  be in bed by 9 and up by 6."  </P> <P> Police officers rarely hassle them in their territory, she said. "They want us  down here," she said. "They don't want us up there."  </P> <P> Plainclothes and uniformed officers patrol the area "regularly" in cars, on  foot and by bicycle, Lt. Farrar said, "in proportion to calls for service."  Calls for service, however, are rare, and arrests in the area have been low.  </P> <P> Crime and arrest reports for the police district that includes the river bottom  show nine of 112 arrests were made in the Hobo Jungle area since January. From  January to December, 1989, 15 arrests were made in the river bottom. Many were  for public drunkenness, said Revis Robinson, supervisor of the Ventura Police  Department's crime analysis unit.  </P> <P> "We arrest a lot more drunk people coming out of bars than we probably do in  Hobo Jungle just because we don't get complaints from people in Hobo Jungle,"  Robinson said. "I don't know if there's really more crime down there."  </P> <P> The people who live in the river bottom violate no city ordinances with their  structures, said Carol Green, a spokeswoman for the city manager.  </P> <P> State, city and county officials are not quite sure how much acreage is  occupied by the pitched tents and lawn chairs, but many place the number of  people living there above 100.  </P> <P> "I mean, how many ants are in an anthill," Price said.  </P> <P> Regardless of the number, several people in the riverbed said they regard  themselves as family and resented learning that Moore was wanted as an alleged  child molester.  </P> <P> In Silver's camp Thursday morning a small group joined the 46-year-old  Washington native and his wife, Sharon Foster, whom they call Ma, on the torn  chairs and a couch gathered in a circle near their tent. A three-foot-high wall  of dusty green wine bottles framed one corner of their camp.  </P> <P> "We're probably all running away from something," said 39-year-old Butch  Ranquist. "But we're not down here to hurt people."  </P> <P> Foster nodded. "One bad apple makes the whole bunch look bad."  </P> <P> The homeless range from families in financial trouble to the mentally ill to  those who choose to drift as a way of life. Many of the river-bottom residents  seem to be drifters, said Sue Sturtevant, business director for Project  Understanding, an organization that helps feed and shower the homeless.  </P> <P> "If you didn't have anywhere else to go it doesn't sound that bad," Sturtevant  said. "I think I'd rather be in this riverbed then on whatever street it is in  Los Angeles where all the drugs are.  </P> <P> "It hasn't rained in so long, so there's no water in the river. And the price  is right."  </P> <P> River-bottom dwellers say the Jungle affords them anonymity, privacy and the  freedom to drink and to come and go as they please. A minister comes to recite  prayers on Tuesdays, and last summer many residents attended a couple's  riverbed wedding reception.  </P> <P> Several men have dug holes for shelter under the Main Street bridge. They are  affectionately called trolls by those in the riverbed. Into a space about as  large as a pick-up truck bed, Clyde Simkins, 61, has hauled two ragged sofas  and a bed. Discarded shelves line his walls, and the remnants of a shopping  cart make a door for his dwelling.  </P> <P> "The fact that there are elaborate camps down there . . . is a positive  testimony to human spirit," said Nancy Nazario, homeless ombudsman for the  county Public Social Services Agency. "People tend to like a territory that  they can have an illusion of control over. I don't know what homelessness in  this county would look like if we didn't have it."  </P> <P> Nazario, who reports the county's total homeless population at about 2,000,  said the river bottom has a bigger proportion of single homeless, many with  alcohol abuse problems.  </P> <P> Thursday morning, a few men roused Silver from bed and handed him a can of  beer. Between sips he twisted his graying beard and eventually pulled a pack of  cigarettes from his pocket to toss among the group. The men and few women  chided one another about their habits and their pasts.  </P> <P> "We take care of each other and that's more than the people up town do," Foster  said. "They've got their houses and their money, and they don't care about each  other."  </P></p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Extended dollar weakness hits bonds, equities After Monday's weakness, when Mr Helmut Kohl's German election victory and the strength of the D-Mark helped to push the dollar to a two-year low, the US currency was looking shaky again yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. European bond markets lost ground, some more than others; the effect on equities was similarly varied, but generally depressing. FRANKFURT weakened slightly in official floor trading, the Dax index easing 6.12 to 2,084.76, and took a more serious tumble in the post-bourse where the Ibis-indicated Dax closed 26.00 lower at 2,069.58. Turnover fell from DM8.5bn to DM6.3bn. Once again, the weakness of the dollar made its most serious impact on the big cyclical exporters, and carmakers in particular as Volkswagen denied rumours that it had lost money in foreign exchange markets. By the end of the post-bourse, BMW was down DM19 over 24 hours, Daimler by DM15.20 and VW by DM16.70, to DM786, DM764.50 and DM447 respectively. However, carmakers also took the lead in Germany's pre-election rally: before that, on October 7, these three were priced at DM745, DM730 and DM438; there were suggestions during the session that investors were switching out of the sector, and into banks and utilities. The post-bourse blew more froth off some other stocks: Continental, the tyremaker, lost DM8.50 at DM225; the vulnerable Metallgesellschaft DM8.90 at DM159.10; Schering, and its drug prospects, fell DM34 to DM964; Mannesmann, and its mobile telephones story, by DM16.50 to DM389; and, circling back to dollar-influenced, cyclical recovery prospects, Deutsche Babcock by DM7 to DM230. PARIS drifted lower in a session that failed to come alive. The CAC-40 index ended off 7.82 at 1,898.60, after moving in a narrow range between 1,912 and 1,892. The forthcoming Renault part-privatisation remained at the forefront of investors' minds, although the vehicle sector was yesterday pulled in different directions: Peugeot down FFr13 at FFr769 and Valeo up FFr3 at FFr283.10. Hoare Govett said recently that it had a preference for the carmakers over the equipment makers, and rated Valeo a sell, in spite of having upgraded 1994 and 1995 earnings forecasts for the company. 'An acquisition (by Valeo) remains a distinct probability, possibly in the automotive electronics sector, where Valeo has no real experience: a development which would weigh on short-term profitability,' said the broker. MILAN was lower, with investors unnerved by news that the government was prepared to reopen budget negotiations over pensions cuts with the unions, and the Comit index lost 10.72 or 1.7 per cent to 626.66. Robert Fleming Securities commented that the Italian market had underperformed Europe by approximately 4 per cent, or 8.9 per cent in dollar terms, during the last quarter, eroding outperformance since the beginning of the year to 14.5 per cent, or 10.2 per cent in dollar terms. 'Continued sales from foreign institutions have compounded the effect of the sales by domestic private investors, scared off by persistently high rates and the inherent instability of the government.' Industrials led the market lower, with Fiat L110 or 1.7 per cent down at L6,200 and Montedison losing L20 or 1.6 per cent at L1,201. Pirelli fell L33 or 1.5 per cent to L2,216 after exceptionally heavy trading was reported on Seaq International in London on Monday, with 57m shares, or almost 4 per cent of the company's capital, changing hands. The London volume puzzled one analyst who noted that only 6.5m shares changed hands in Milan on Monday. He added that there was no fundamental reason for the stock's weakness. A L61 or 8.6 per cent rise to L771 in Gaic was prompted by comments by the Ferruzzi Finanziaria chairman Mr Guido Rossi that Ferruzzi was considering a full bid. Ferruzzi fell L44 to L1,322. ZURICH saw industrials marked lower because of the weak dollar before the malaise spread over to the banks and insurers. The SMI index gave up 33.1 or 1.3 per cent to 2,542.5. Roche certificates fell SFr155 or 2.6 per cent to SFr5,680 as Credit Suisse downgraded the stock and trimmed its earnings forecasts, following Monday's nine-month sales figures. Goldman Sachs, which had already taken the certificates off its buy list, also reduced its 1994 earnings forecast to reflect the pharmaceuticals group's restructuring costs. UBS slipped SFr15 to SFr1,275 ahead of today's press conference at which, the board has said, it wants to answer various issues surrounding its battle for influence with BK Vision. AMSTERDAM was weaker, with the AEX index settlng down 2.94 at 405.50. Nedlloyd, the transport group, was among the day's steepest losers, off Fl 2.90 at Fl 55.00, as Goldman Sachs in London lowered its 1994 profits estimate by 30 per cent to Fl 90m. Mr Pierre Stiennon, an analyst at Goldman, commented that while the group had achieved savings in cutting its internal costs, its main external sectors - ocean shipping, European road transport and the Neddrill drilling subsidiary - were under pressure. However, Goldman was maintaining its hold recommendation ahead of the company's third-quarter results due on November 30. MADRID's domestic bond market reacted forcibly after a September budget deficit, and a December inflation forecast of 4.3 to 4.6 per cent; equities took in these, and the arrest in Barcelona of the financier Mr Javier de la Rosa, and the general index dropped 4.62 or 1.5 per cent to 296.69. Mr Jerry Evans, European equity strategist at Klenwort Benson, noted that in addition to the macro influences, this was a market where banks and utilities, both vulnerable to falls in bond values, accounted for nearly three-quarters of the market's equity capitalisation. Banks, utilities and construction stocks were all weak yesterday, with BCH down Pta75 at Pta3,035, and Endesa off Pta140 at Pta5,570.

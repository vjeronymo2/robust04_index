			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Reduced loss at Waverley Mining Waverley Mining Finance, the Edinburgh-based investment company, reported a loss of Pounds 58,639 before and after tax for the six months to September 30. The outcome, which compared with losses of Pounds 107,267 at the same stage of 1991, came on gross income ahead from Pounds 38,243 to Pounds 50,334. Losses per share came out at 0.5p (0.9p). The net asset value per share declined from 25.2p in March to 21.9p at end-September reflecting, the company said, a varied performance within the smaller company sector and the weakness of the Australian and Canadian currencies. However, the fall in sterling since the period-end had seen the value improve to 24.8p.</p>

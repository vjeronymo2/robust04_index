			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CARDINALS' TEWKSBURY BEATS ASTROS AFTER STUBBS RUINS PERFECT GAME  </P> <P> Bob Tewksbury, once one of the New York Yankees' top prospects, was the No. 12  pitcher on the St. Louis Cardinals' staff coming out of spring training.  </P> <P> The only reason he was on the roster was the lockout that shortened spring  training and kept pitchers behind schedule.  </P> <P> Not only is the 29-year-old right-hander no longer the last man on the staff,  he is one of the bright spots in a dismal season for the Cardinals.  </P> <P> After his performance Friday night at St. Louis, and with John Tudor on the  disabled list, Tewksbury is probably the staff's top pitcher.  </P> <P> Tewksbury had a perfect game until Franklin Stubbs punched a double to left to  open the eighth inning.  </P> <P> Tewksbury (8-3) settled for a one-hitter and a 5-0 victory over the Houston  Astros. Tewksbury, who won nine games for the Yankees in 1986 before developing  arm trouble, was 1-0 with the Cardinals after being brought up late last  season.  </P> <P> Tewksbury's earned-run average is 2.78, but in his last 10 starts, it is 1.68.  He has not given up a walk in his last three starts.  </P> <P> "It would have been nice to go all the way," Tewksbury said, "but I really feel  good about the way I pitched. It will probably feel good for four more days,  then it'll be time to pitch again.  </P> <P> "It was a sinker down and away that Stubbs hit. The only way he could get a hit  was to punch it. Unfortunately, that's what he did. If he pulls it, it's a  ground out."  </P> <P> Stubbs, the Astros' cleanup hitter, said he knew the Astros were in trouble  because he kept leading off innings.  </P> <P> "He takes a little off, puts a little on," Stubbs said. "He had it all  tonight."  </P> <P> Tewksbury settled for his second consecutive shutout.  </P> <P> "You can't get much better than that," Cardinal Manager Joe Torre said. "That  was a clinic, a real masterpiece."  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 7-4, Cincinnati 1-3 -- The Pirates brought Mike York, a 25-year-old  right-hander, up from the minors to pitch the first game of this doubleheader  at Cincinnati.  </P> <P> There might be second thoughts about sending him back right away.  </P> <P> York held the leaders of the West to six hits and no runs in seven innings in  the opener to win his major league debut.  </P> <P> "We will have to talk it over. "We'll decide later tonight whether to keep him  around, " Manager Jim Leyland said.  </P> <P> "I was so nervous, I wasn't sure if I would throw the first pitch on the bounce  or to the backstop, " York said. "I think I threw a strike and after that I was  all right. I guess the nervousness flattened out my curve. I threw only about  two good ones all night, but we won."  </P> <P> The Pirates came from behind to win the second game on a tiebreaking single in  the eighth inning by Jay Bell, who earlier hit one of the Pirates' three home  runs. Bobby Bonilla, who hit one in the first game, and Jeff King also homered.  </P> <P> Barry Bonds had a single and stole two bases in the first game to become the  first Pirate to hit 20 home runs and steal 40 bases in a season.  </P> <P> San Francisco 3, New York 2 -- Matt Williams hit a three-run homer and Steve  Bedrosian earned his first save since May 30 in this game at San Francisco.  </P> <P> The loss dropped the Mets two games behind the Pirates. The Giants, who ended a  five-game losing streak, moved to within 7 1/2 games of the division-leading  Reds in the West.  </P> <P> The Mets' runs off winner Scott Garrelts came on a pinch two-run homer by Tom  O'Malley.  </P> <P> Chicago 7, Atlanta 0 -- Mike Harkey had an extra reason for getting the Braves  out quickly at Chicago. He and some teammates were going to an M.C. Hammer  concert.  </P> <P> "The other guys were putting pressure on me to get it over," Harkey said.  </P> <P> Harkey (12-5) responded with a three-hitter, struck out six and walked none. He  needed slightly more than two hours to get the job done.  </P> <P> Shawon Dunston hit two home runs and drove in four runs and Mark Grace also  homered for Chicago.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 2, San Diego 1 -- Dale Murphy hit his first home run for the  Phillies at San Diego and Jose DeJesus (4-4) pitched a six-hitter to beat the  Padres.  </P> <P> The long drive into the left field seats was Murphy's 18th homer of the season  and the 27th of his career at Jack Murphy Stadium, the most by a visiting  player.

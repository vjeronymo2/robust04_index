			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 2 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Minister of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi met here this  morning with visiting Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans  and his party, and they exchanged views on bilateral economic  and trade relations and other issues of common interest.    Wu said that Sino-Australian economic and trade relations  have been developing rapidly and well, quoting statistics from  China's customs that bilateral trade volume last year reached  three billion U.S. dollars, up 29 percent over the record figure  of 1992.    China had a 800 million U.S. dollars trade deficit with  Australia last year with import at 1.9 billion U.S. dollars and  export, 1.1 billion U.S. dollars. Wu said that China hopes to  have a balanced trade by increasing trade.    The Australian foreign minister arrived here yesterday as  guest of his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen.</p>

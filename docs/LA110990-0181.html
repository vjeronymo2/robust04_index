			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CZECHS GET U.S. TRADE BENEFITS  </P> <P> President Bush today signed legislation to extend most-favored-nation trade  benefits to Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> He called the measure "an important milestone not only in U.S.-Czechoslovak  relations, but also in Czechoslovakia's re-integration into the global economy  and the community of free nations."  </P> <P> Under the agreement, the United States and Czechoslovakia will grant each the  lowest possible tariffs on their goods.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration earlier awarded the preferential trade status to Poland  and Hungary in the aftermath of the upheaval in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Bush said he was "particularly pleased" to sign the measure at this time  because he will be in Prague, Czechoslovakia, later this month as part of an  eight-day trip to Europe and the Persian Gulf.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RILEY TOPS SUPERVISORS IN REELECTION FUNDING;  </P> <P> WAR CHESTS: HARRIETT M. WIEDER REPORTED JUST $148.40 IN CONTRIBUTIONS. SHE HAS  RELIED HEAVILY ON LOANS TO COVER $21,752.43 IN EXPENSES SINCE JULY.  </P> <P> Veteran Supervisor Thomas F. Riley was the top fund-raiser among the three  Orange County supervisors up for reelection in June, with campaign  contributions totaling $107,100, according to financial statements filed this  week.  </P> <P> Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder of Huntington Beach has raised the least of the  three board members on the campaign trail, reporting $148.40 in contributions.  </P> <P> Newly elected Board Chairman Don R. Roth raised $71,172 during the latest  reporting period, July 1 to Dec. 31. He has $103,762 in cash on hand, financial  statements show.  </P> <P> The other two supervisors, Roger R. Stanton and Gaddi H. Vasquez are not up for  reelection this year.  </P> <P> Among Riley's largest contributors were Barry Brief of the Stein-Brief Group,  Ranney E. Draper of Diversified Shopping Centers and Laguna Niguel Investors,  who contributed $1,000 each. During the reporting period, Riley spent $35,061  on campaign consultants, postage and printed materials. He had $88,071 cash on  hand, financial statements show.  </P> <P> Roth's largest single contribution of $2,800 came from the political action  committee of the Assn. of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs, with headquarters in  Garden Grove. The PAC gave Roth, who is often at odds with Sheriff Brad Gates,  $4,050 during 1989. Roth had $103,762 in cash on hand.  </P> <P> Along with contributions from major developers, Roth, a former Anaheim city  councilman, also received campaign money from the Anaheim Police Officers  Assn.'s PAC, plus $700 from Disneyland, $500 from the Lettuce Amuse U Comedy  School Inc. and $2,500 from the Los Angeles Fire Fighters Local 1014.  </P> <P> On the other side of the ledger, Roth spent $43,958 during the latest reporting  period, most of which went for such campaign-related expenses as postage,  meals, consultants, and to pay the firm running his reelection effort, Campaign  Management Inc. of Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Wieder's campaign spending has far outpaced her fund raising, according to  financial statements. Wieder, who is seeking her fourth term, has spent  $21,752.43 since July. She has relied heavily on loans to cover expenses so  far, her statements show.  </P> <P> The most recent loan to Wieder's campaign, $9,000, was received in July; it  could not be determined who made the loan. The required form detailing the loan  was left out of Wieder's financial statement, and she could not be reached for  comment.  </P> <P> Wieder has also received two earlier loans totaling $40,000.  </P> <P> Wieder's campaign funds paid for a trip to Europe last fall, where she attended  a women's forum at a cost of $2,237, according to her financial statement. She  also attended the prestigious John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard  University, where the tuition was $5,800.  </P> <P> Among her other large expenditures were $1,200 in attorney fees paid to the  Washington law firm of Wunder, Ryan, Cannon &amp; Thelan. No details on the  expense were available.  </P> <P> Gates, who made public his decision to seek reelection a few weeks ago, raised  $1,000 during the filing period. Gates, who faces no serious opposition in his  bid for a fifth term, had long been expected to seek reelection. He received a  total of $127,050 in campaign contributions in 1989, financial statements show.  </P> <P> Gates had received just one contribution since July: $1,000 from George  Argyros, owner of a Costa Mesa development firm. The two largest expenses  reported for his campaign during the latest reporting period were $6,876 paid  to an accounting firm for preparing his campaign expense reports and $2,121 in  car phone bills.  </P></p>

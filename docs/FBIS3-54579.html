Al-Hariri, who began an official visit to Britain on Monday,  during which he met with Prime Minister John Major and Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd, said that Syria and Lebanon are agreed  on signing together with Jordan a peace agreement with Israel.    Al-Hariri said it is early to talk about a meeting with  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin before reaching an  agreement on a full Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory  and before a halt to the shelling of civilians in southern  areas. The Lebanese prime minister described the matter as not  personal.    Asked about the possibility of Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat visiting Lebanon, al-Hariri said that "'Arafat has to  submit an application for the visit, and we will consider it."  Asked whether the visits Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the  Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine--General Command,  makes to his forces' positions in southern Beirut are conducted  with permission from the Lebanese state, al-Hariri said that "he  has not looked at Ahmad Jibril's passport."    Al-Hariri renewed his rejection of [Palestinian] settlement.  He was answering a question about whether he was being subjected  to international pressures to settle the Palestinians,  especially as Lebanese officials always talk about his  rejection. Al-Hariri said that "it is Lebanon which is raising  this question, because the Constitution does not allow that, nor  does the present government. Our position on settlement is  attributable to its adverse effect on the demographic situation  in Lebanon, and hence on the political situation."    Al-Hariri pointed out that the Gaza-Jericho agreement did  not  talk about the future of 300,000 Palestinian refugees living in  Lebanon.    On the al-Ta'if accord, al-Hariri said that "any  constitution  or agreement can be developed. I emphasized that in my speech  at the Chamber of Deputies. I stressed that this change and  development must be based on common coexistence, balance, and  political participation."    On the extent of Lebanon's willingness to request the Syrian  forces' withdrawal from its territory if Israel agrees to  withdraw, al-Hariri said: "We will study this question at the  right time and in the light of new developments. The Syrian  Army is playing a positive role in safeguarding security and  restoring stability in most parts of Lebanese territory."  [passage omitted]    On the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the Lebanese prime minister  said that the fate of this agreement is to be decided by the  Palestinians and their institutions.    The Lebanese official is expected to leave London for Beirut  tomorrow.</p>

			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY SPOT: PLAZA DE LA RAZA TO CELEBRATE THE COLORFUL LIFE OF VAQUEROS  </P> <P> Plaza de la Raza holds a weekend "Salute to the Vaquero" with a rodeo,  saddle-making demonstrations and rope dancing at its home in Lincoln Park.  </P> <P> Vaquero is Spanish for cowboy, and this is the celebration of Southwest and  Mexican cowboy history and trappings. In the gallery, an exhibit celebrates  cowboy life in the Old Southwest. Outside, craftspeople will demonstrate their  skills in silver, leather and glass, with items for sale.  </P> <P> The children's game area will include a wheel of fortune, ring toss and other  games of chance. Food booths will feature hot dogs, carne asada and soft  drinks.  </P> <P> Non-stop entertainment is scheduled today and Sunday during festival hours,  noon to 6 p.m.: Tex-Mex bands, mariachis, marimba, children's ballet folklorico  and a special traditional dance performance that incorporates rope jumping.  Sunday at 3 p.m., vaqueros will compete in horseback events in a real charreada  (Mexican rodeo).  </P> <P> All the activities will radiate from the plaza's courtyard and museum, spilling  onto the broad, flat lawn of Lincoln Park. Everything is free, except for food  and games.  </P> <P> The plaza is at 3540 N. Mission Road, Lincoln Heights. Information: (213)  223-2475, after noon.  </P> <P> SPECIAL EVENTS  </P> <P> Can't wait for the upcoming sequels to "Back to the Future" and "Gremlins"?  Console yourself with an afternoon of previews at Sunday's Los Angeles Comic  Book and Science Book Convention, now ensconced (after a few trials elsewhere)  at the Pasadena Convention Center, 300 E. Green St. Clips of the films, plus a  featurette on the making of "Back to the Future," begin at 2 p.m. At 1 p.m.,  there will be a featurette of Disney's newest animated film, "The Little  Mermaid," with a few of the animators on hand to talk about their work. There  will be free buttons from the films (while supply lasts). The show -- plenty of  old and new comics, toys, baseball cards and more -- runs from 10 a.m. to 5  p.m. Admission is $3. Information: (818) 954-8432.  </P> <P> Joanie Bartels sings to youngsters in her big-band-singer-sort-of voice and  seems to know just what children want to hear -- "Mairzy Doats," "The Witch  Doctor," a little bit of the Beatles. She'll sing songs from several of her  best-selling tapes, including her latest ("Bathtime Magic," designed to coax  even the most resistant child into the tub) at a free mini-concert today at 11  a.m. at Pages Books, 18399 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana. She'll stay afterward for an  autograph session. Information: (818) 342-6657.  </P> <P> Craig Taubman will play original, upbeat rock 'n' roll at a Sunday concert at  Kids Gym, USA, 12526 Riverside Drive, North Hollywood. Taubman, the star of  several Disney videos, likes to get his young audience (3 and older) into the  act, so he passes out maracas and other instruments to encourage them to join  in the fun. Taubman plays the guitar and is backed by a small band. The concert  lasts about 40 minutes and is $5 (under 3, free). Information: (818) 985-8200,  after noon.  </P> <P> OUTDOORS  </P> <P> The brush at Franklin Canyon is big and overdue for a fire (a cyclic event,  rangers say). Because everyone at the park is on fire alert anyway, they've  decided to spread the word with Sunday's family-paced walk focusing on fire  ecology. Docent Jo-Ann Caudill will talk about the chaparral plants, which can  live six months without water and can survive periodic fires. Meet at 10 a.m.  at the ranch house. The ranch is north of Beverly Hills. Taped information:  (213) 858-3834.  </P></p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Whitecroft makes Pounds 3.25m property sale Whitecroft, the building products, lighting and textiles company, has exchanged contracts for the sale of its Hillsborough Barracks property in Sheffield for Pounds 3.25m cash. The property is the largest in Whitecroft's portfolio and represents a significant step in its objective of withdrawing from property. Some Pounds 325,000 of the consideration is receivable immediately, with Pounds 2.6m on completion and the balance due on March 1 1994. The proceeds will be used to further reduce group borrowings. Last week Whitecroft disposed of Randalls, its Zimbabwe subsidiary, for Pounds 1.08m.</p>

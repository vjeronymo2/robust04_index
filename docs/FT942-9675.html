			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Liffe 'launches misconduct probe' The London International Financial Futures Exchange is believed to be investigating a case of misconduct by one of its members. Liffe had no comment on the matter but it is thought to involve an independent trader who was carrying out business on behalf of JP Morgan, the US investment bank. The bank also declined to comment. Although banks are members of Liffe, they sometimes execute orders through independent traders if they want anonymity. Sources said the trader was reported to Liffe's market supervisory division after he was seen 'acting inappropriately' in the Italian government bond futures pit. The trader was thought to be 'front-running' - executing his own order before his client's and thereby taking advantage of the price movement caused by the execution of a large order. However, JP Morgan's clients were protected at all times, sources said.</p>

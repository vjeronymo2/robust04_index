			<p>BFN     [Text] The first stage of talks between Chairman of the  Chinese State Council Li Peng and Turkmenian President  Saparmurad Niyazov ended in Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] on Thursday.  The two sides discussed the possibilities of economic  cooperation between the two countries.    Niyazov and Li Peng expressed interest in developing  contacts  in trade, light, fuel and energy and chemical industries, Head  of the Information and Press Department of the Chinese Foreign  Ministry Shen Guofang told a briefing of journalists in  Ashkhabad on Thursday. In his words, "the signing of four-five  intergovernmental agreements is possible" on 22 April, but  "their texts are yet to be coordinated."    As INTERFAX learned from well-informed sources, the  Turkmenian leadership is considering the proposal by the Chinese  side to grant a credit worth 50 million yuan ($6 million).    The guests also suggested discussing the joint construction  of two plants in Turkmenistan for the production of bricks and  metallic items for seismo-proof building.    The two sides also discussed the possibility of building a  gas pipeline Turkmenistan-China, but a representative of the  Chinese Foreign Ministry said that this issue "was not discussed  in detail, because the project demands specific preparation and  technical and economic foundation."    The talks will continue on 22 April.</p>

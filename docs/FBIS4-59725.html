			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 16, IRNA -- Iran's Red Crescent Society  (IRCS) has so far sent some 5,000 tons of relief supplies  including foodstuff and clothings to Bosnia-Herzegovina since  the start of Serbian aggression against Bosnian Muslims,  reported the IRCS's public relations department today.    The relief supplies, shipped aboard seven airplanes, 25  trucks and a cargo ship, have been sent to the war stricken  Bosnian Muslims, the report said.    In order to avoid high transportation costs, the IRCS has  also purchased relief supplies worth about dlrs 250,000 from  Bosnia's neighboring countries and has distributed them among  Bosnian Muslims, it said.    The IRCS's relief operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is  coordinated by four of its branches, three of which are located  in Zagreb, Sarajevo and Slovenia.</p>

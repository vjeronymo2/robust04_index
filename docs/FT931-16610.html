			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Warlords drive wedge between US and the UN: The limits of peace efforts have been exposed THE round of Somali peace talks which ended yesterday has exposed the shortcomings of United Nations peacemaking efforts and underlined difficulties facing the world body in arranging an accord in the deeply fragmented country. In another critical test of UN capability in dealing with the cold war legacy and ushering in a 'new world order' the UN has emerged bruised and and is now faced with having to reconsider its long-term political role in Somalia. The UN and Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, its secretary general, have also been hard pressed to fight attempts by Somali warlords to exploit real and imagined divisions be-tween the UN and the US and drive a wedge between the two. In a statement distributed to the conference yesterday Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed, Somalia's most important warlord, said on behalf of his Somali National Alliance (SNA) that 'UN bureaucrats, from the secretary general downwards, have failed time and again to demonstrate an understanding of the intricate political problems in Somalia.' Gen Aideed attacked the organisation of the political conference by Mr Boutros Ghali and questioned the UN's ability and impartiality. Even before the conference started Gen Aideed was trying to undermine the UN. On Sunday, the day before the official opening, he organised an angry and unpleasant demonstration against Mr Boutros Ghali during his humiliating visit to Mogadishu. Gen Aideed and his other clan-based faction leaders have spent most of the conference filibustering - determined to frustrate efforts at agreement on a national political reconciliation conference before Mr Boutros Ghali departs today. Senior UN officials said yesterday that since Sunday's visit the UN has received further violent threats against its personnel who are based in the southern part of the city controlled by Gen Aideed. One UN official said privately the UN was now forced to consider whether it should withdraw its political bureau from Mogadishu. 'If getting Somalis to the peace table means getting out of Somalia then we will get out,' he said. UN officials say they are dealing with the legacy of their involvement in Somalia which has inevitably created enemies among the warlords who face losing their power base. But critics say the UN is reaping the harvest of its neglect of Somalia during 1991 when the country first slid into anarchy and starvation, and its subsequent inefficiency in re-establishing security for a humanitarian operation. 'What gave Boutros Ghali, the Organisation of African Unity and the League of Arab States the right to sit on the dais and open a peace conference on Somalia?' asked Mr Hassan Mahdi, a member of the SNA delegation. 'They did nothing when we were suffering most and are now they are trying to jump on the bandwagon of American success.' Many US officials privately share the warlords' criticisms of the shortcomings of the UN. They point to their own rapid successes made in the past month since US troops first landed in Somalia including restoring relative order, gearing up a massive relief effort and brokering the first serious peace talks in Mogadishu. Serious divisions have emerged between the US and the UN. Mr Boutros Ghali has tried unsuccessfully to pressure the US to disarm the factions. Differences have also emerged over plans for the handover from the US-led operation to one led by the UN. Some State Department officials clearly believe that they are better able to guide Somalia to peace and reconstruction and are privately hoping that President-elect Bill Clinton will give them an expanded remit in Somalia when he moves into the White House this month. Publicly, US officials continue to say that they are fully committed to the UN. Gen Aideed, however, believes the differences are real and can be exploited to his advantage. 'The SNA hopes and expects major donor countries, especially the United States, would reassess their positions vis-a-vis the UN and the Somali crisis,' Gen Aideed said. For some reason Gen Aideed and his allies believe US oversight of the peace process offers them the best hope of maintaining their power. Somali critics say the US operation has fuelled these beliefs by basing itself in the part of the city Gen Aideed controls and forging links with his main financier, Mr Osman Arto. Some angry UN officials allege privately that the US is encouraging the anti-UN camp, and as a concession to Gen Aideed has breached a number of agreements, such as operating under a UN flag and providing proper security to the UN. They say the talks in Mogadishu should have been organised on UN soil instead of being arranged by the US special envoy at the US embassy. 'At this critical moment the US, the major player, is sitting on the fence watching us struggle,' complained a UN official. Few observers expect the ambiguity of the UN-US relationship to be clarified before Mr Clinton takes office. But in the meantime the UN has suffered a further loss of credibility at the peace conference which might hamper its future efforts at peacemaking.</p>

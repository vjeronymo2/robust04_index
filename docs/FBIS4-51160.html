The delegation, headed by Boun Nhang Vorachit [name as  received], member of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party  Central Committee and mayor of Vientiane City, arrived here on  May 19 to attend a two-week course here on economics and  technology.    During the meeting, Hu, a member of the secretariat of the  CPC Central Committee, said China and Laos are friendly  neighbors and their peoples have enjoyed a long history of  amicable contacts.    Over the past few years, he noted, the relations between the  two parties and the two countries have grown smoothly.

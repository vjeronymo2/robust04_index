			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / UN sanctions against Libya now in force New Security Council sanctions against Libya came into force yesterday to put pressure on Tripoli into surrendering two men accused of bombing Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, in which 270 people died, Reuter reports from the UN. The Security Council, at the urging of the US, Britain and France, adopted the new sanctions on November 11. But it gave Libya a grace period until they went into effect at 5.01am GMT yesterday. The sanctions freeze Libya's financial assets abroad but exclude future funds derived from oil, natural gas or agricultural commodities exports. Sanctions in force since April 1992 ban all civilians' flights to and from the country and the sales of aircraft parts and arms. They can be suspended if Libya surrenders the two accused for trial in Britain or the US in connection with the bombing. Libya also must satisfy demands of a French magistrate investigating the mid-flight bombing of France's UTA Flight 772 over Niger in 1989 in which 171 people died.</p>

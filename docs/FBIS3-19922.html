According to a report by  the Swedish military intelligence and security service, the  Russian Armed Forces are now in such a weak state that they  would not be able to attack Sweden. Timo Seppaenen reports from  Stockholm:    [Seppaenen] The Russian bear is sick and weak, says Jan  Blomquist, the head of the analysis section of the Swedish  general staff. The same view is shared by the defense forces'  entire intelligence and security service, which lists a number  of reasons for its assessment that Russia is militarily  completely enfeebled.    The manpower of the Russian defense forces is now 1.2  million  men. The number of people in the war machine is nearly 50  percent smaller than in the feared Soviet Army. The current  Russian Army is suffering a considerable staff shortage and it  is not even capable of managing the training of conscripts  properly. Russian conscripts are now given only simple basic  training in guard duties, if one is to believe the Swedish  experts.    Russia's Baltic Fleet is barely a shadow of its former self,  and because of lack of money it cannot carry out military  exercises. For that reason, the Russian troops would no longer  be capable of carrying out a landing. According to Swedish  experts, the shortage of money has also cut the training of  Russian pilots so much that air safety is already threatened.  Russian Air Force pilots clock up from 20 to 40 flying hours a  year while NATO pilots clock up at least 100 hours, or even over  150 hours a year.    The Swedes are also reassured by the information that  Russia's arms production has collapsed. In 1988, Russia still  built 3,500 tanks, last year the figure was only 200. The  leaders of the Swedish defense forces do remember, however, that  the Russian Army is still in possession of almost inexhaustible  arms reserves, where one can even find missiles with nuclear  warheads. The size of those reserves is not, however, such a  big deterrent as before, partly because Russia has gone over to  democracy. According to the Swedish defense forces, as a  consequence of this, Russia does not have the political will to  raise the readiness of the country's army to the level required  for an offensive.    Hearing of the assessment by the intelligence and security  service, Swedish Defense Minister Anders Bjork was quick to warn  that the Swedes should remember that sharpening the claws of the  Russian bear does not necessarily take very long. Sweden cannot  lull itself into too strong a sense of security as long as  politicians like Zhirinovskiy have a chance to rise to power in  Russia, Bjork said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by </F> unidentified correspondent -- live]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] For weeks now, indignation has  been mounting across the world over the carnage in Rwanda. Do  you believe that the intervention you have been advocating since  yesterday can be of some use?    [Juppe] I hope so, with all my heart. We have been very much  involved in the last few weeks, ever since this tragedy, which  goes beyond the limits of horror, began. First of all, on the  humanitarian front, you must know that there are already a  number of nongovernmental organizations, the Red Cross, the  UNHCR, with the help of France...    [Correspondent, interrupting] Excuse me, Mr. Juppe, but it  is  quite clear that humanitarian operations are not much use --  they are not, at any rate, sufficient...    [Juppe, interrupting] One moment, I would like to explain  what we have done, because we cannot simplify things. We did  this. We must remind people of this, we are still doing it  today. There are people on the ground doing this, trying to  evacuate young orphans from Kigali in order to get them to  safety from the threat of extermination. Second, we have tried  to obtain the dispatch of a United Nations force, and we had to  fight for this in New York, but it is still not on its way.  Finally, we tried to obtain a cease-fire. It was signed on  paper yesterday in Tunis, thanks to all the diplomatic efforts  we made.    [Correspondent] Yes, but it does not seem that it is being  respected.    [Juppe] It is not being respected, and this is why today,  faced with the impossibility of imposing a cease-fire, faced  with the delays at the United Nations regarding the 5,500 men  due to be sent to Rwanda, France has said: We are prepared to go  in. We are prepared to go in because we have to put an end to  the daily massacres.    [Correspondent] Very well: Is France prepared to go in  alone?    [Juppe] No. We think that we have to go in with our European  partners and with....    [Correspondent, interrupting] With whom, then, since the  Belgians today...    [Juppe, interrupting] Hang on, we cannot rush this, this is  a  serious matter...    [Correspondent, interrupting]. No, but this is an important  issue, because we would like you to answer our questions. The  Belgians today said that they were not prepared to go in --  logistic aid, perhaps, but certainly not men...    [Juppe, interrupting] You do know a lot, don't you?    [Correspondent] This is what we have heard from Belgium.  Great Britain also says no. Can you name any countries?    [Juppe] If you allow me to say so, I would like to say that  as soon as we broached this idea, without rushing into it,  seriously of course, we tried to make some contacts. Those  contacts were made this afternoon with our European partners,  the Italians, the Belgians, the Spanish, and others, and we are  currently examining what the response might be to France's  initiative.    There must also be African countries taking part in this  operation, and we have already received positive responses from  several countries that I will not name because you must realize  that this is a complex and dangerous operation, and a degree of  discretion is necessary.    [Correspondent] By when do you expect results?    [Juppe] We have to move quickly, I think, but, I repeat,  this  operation is dangerous and it must be properly organized, in  cooperation with officials in the Defense Ministry. This is why  the president, the prime minister, the defense minister, and I  discussed this issue yesterday, as soon as the idea had been  broached with our partners.    [Correspondent] Do you envisage these soldiers being sent to  Rwanda itself, or will they be based in neighboring countries  for specific operations?    [Juppe] This is a humanitarian operation. We are talking  about going in to save people. In your earlier report, we saw  the survivors fleeing on the roads; others are surrounded, under  immediate threat of extermination, and these are the people we  would like to protect.    This is not a political intervention to separate one side  from the other. It is a humanitarian operation to save people.  [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Even the Tutsi population, for whose  protection this operation would be mounted, is not ready to  welcome you.    [Juppe] I perfectly understand this reaction. The massacres  and the horror were such that a good dose of passion and  misunderstanding resulted. We have to remove this  misunderstanding. We are talking to Rwandan Patriotic Front  [RPF] officials in Brussels and Rwanda at this very moment to  try to clarify the situation with them. I heard this RPF  official saying that we are going to occupy Rwanda. As I  explained to you a short while ago, it is quite the contrary.  We are not about to mount a political operation in favor of one  side or another, but on the contrary, to protect the entire  population, the Tutsi population, first and foremost, when it is  threatened. I hope that in clarifying this, we are talking  about the same objective.    [Correspondent] Do you think that in this country, where an  unimaginable level of barbarism has been reached, humanitarian  work can be done without the backing of a military operation?    [Juppe] Yes, obviously, it depends on what we do. We should  know what we want. Forty-eight hours ago, or three or four days  ago, France was accused of not doing enough. Today, we are the  only country to say we are ready to go in there and we are still  being told this is not enough. I think the decision -- which is  a proposal, I must stress -- should be coordinated with our  partners, with the green light from the United Nations, for a  limited period of time and on the basis of clear objectives. We  are not going to war in Rwanda, that is not the objective, let  us be serious. We are going to mount an operation to save lives  within the framework I described earlier. France is the first  to make such a proposal; I think this deserves to be taken into  consideration. If everyone says no, then everyone will assume  their own responsibility. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] A final question, on Bosnia. Will our troops  be back soon, has a date been set for their return from Bosnia?    [Juppe] Everybody knows that if nothing happens this summer,  we will have to draw the necessary conclusions. People mention  only the negative aspects of the conflict at the moment, in the  vein of: What if it does not work? I would like to stress one  point. A cease-fire has been holding for 10 days now. It took  effect on 10 June and it has been observed. Some insignificant  skirmishes have taken place here and there, but generally, peace  has been restored, or at least the cease-fire is holding.  Sarajevo is living again. The European Union has been busy  laying down conditions for rebuilding the town of Mostar,  devastated by war, with police forces working under the banner  of the Western European Union. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] So our troops will remain there for the  moment?    [Juppe] Yes, our troops will remain there. [passage omitted]</p>

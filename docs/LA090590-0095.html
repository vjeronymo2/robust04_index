			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BANK BUYS DEPOSITS AT COLLAPSED S&amp;L  </P> <P> Southern California Bank paid $101,000 on Tuesday for nearly $135 million in  insured deposits at the failed Western Empire Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine,  which was seized by regulators in February.  </P> <P> The thrift's two branches opened Monday as offices of the Downey-based Southern  California Bank after the transaction was approved late Friday by federal  regulators running the S&amp;L.  </P> <P> Southern California Bank will keep Western Empire's Yorba Linda branch -- the  thrift's original headquarters and the heart of its operation -- but will close  the Irvine branch within a month, said Norman Morales, the bank's executive  vice president.  </P> <P> The ultimate cost to taxpayers for the S&amp;L's collapse was estimated at $24  million by the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency that operates and  liquidates failed thrifts.  </P></p>

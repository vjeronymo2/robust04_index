			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The situation remains tense on the Tajik-Afghan  border, INTERFAX reports. Last night, Russian border guards  foiled an attempt by an armed group to cross over from  Tajikistan to Afghanistan, or rather from Afghanistan to  Tajikistan -- I beg your pardon -- in the area of section five  of border post no. 12 of the Pyandzh border detachment.    Yesterday, in the area of the same border post, Russian  border guards discovered a group of Tajik opposition fighters  who intended to violate the border. In an exchange of fire that  followed, three armed violators were killed, and the others  retreated.    Also yesterday, two rockets were fired at border post no. 12  from the territory of Afghanistan. Fortunately, there were no  casualties among the border guards.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Office Automation (20): Ways to unlock the information blocks - Developing ideas across the company / Unipart, the vehicle components group, is increasingly finding that groupware supports its lean, team-based structure. The on-line computer system means fewer meetings, yet greater discussion Work group software could have been made for Unipart - and the company is certainly taking it on in a big way. Unipart became one of the success stories of the 1980s after the 1987 management buy-out of the vehicle components manufacturer from Rover Group. The company was streamlined into an organisation with fewer hierarchical layers and an emphasis on team working. Its last reported turnover was more than Pounds 660m and pre-tax profit was up 29 per cent at Pounds 19.8m. Work group software found a Unipart 'evangelist' in the early 1990s in the shape of Mr Mick Moignard, who had become a user through his work on committees in the international computer users group, Guide. Mr Moignard, a consultant in Unipart Information Technology, the group's computing operation, found that the Notes software product from Lotus Development enabled committee work to be done with fewer meetings yet greater discussion: members shared their views through the on-line Notes system. For the last nine months Mr Moignard has been working full-time on Notes in Unipart. Growth in the use of the system has been such that since last June Notes has been allocated its own dedicated central processor. 'Notes fits in very well with the corporate culture and the lean, team-based organisation that Unipart has created,' Mr Moignard says. Applications have become wide-ranging but Unipart started with a relatively simple system for the company's reception desk. When members of staff arrange meetings with visitors they enter the details. The reception desk has access to the information and when a visitor arrives a security name badge is printed at the touch of a key. 'This system was developed in a couple of hours, which made quite an impact,' Mick Moignard says. The next application was a catalogue system for Unipart U (for university), a big training initiative launched last autumn to encourage all staff to commit themselves to continuous learning. The Pounds 2.5m venture included fitting out a training centre with 14 lecture and seminar rooms and providing a library, open 15 hours a day for study and the loan of books, periodicals, videos and computer software for training. Notes was used to put the catalogue on-line to everyone's personal computer. 'In effect, Notes has taken the library out of its room and on to people's desks, where they can browse for books and other materials,' says Mick Moignard. 'Again, Notes made an impact because development is straightforward and the resulting system is easy to use.' After these early successes, Notes was considered for more ambitious projects, notably supporting a large team working on refitting warehouses. Most of the team members were scattered across the head office in Cowley, Oxford, but a couple were working with suppliers in the US. 'The main requirement was easy and simple access to shared documents such as specifications and work-in-progress reports,' Mick Moignard says. All staff had to work from the same version of a document and had to be able to contribute to it from their own offices in different parts of the building and even in the US. 'Without shared documents you risk having individuals holding different versions on their own PCs and working from them,' Mr Moignard says. 'This way everyone always sees the up-to-date version. If information is kept by individuals, then it's corporate information which is not available to the corporation. This company sees shared information as power, not personal information. Notes promotes the shared information view: we've certainly seen attitudes changing since it was introduced.' The warehouse project support system was set up so that changes could only be made by named individuals but anyone could enter comments: these are linked to a document in the database. The documents are mostly produced through word processing software but some drawings have been scanned in and are held as document images. Important new issues are discussed at a senior level in the overall project and then allocated to work teams. A team manager might assign an issue to an individual. This handing-on of responsibility is recorded through the system, which automatically adjusts the access controls at each step. Again, fast development and ease of use have proved attractive - 'modifying the system and adding facilities are very straightforward and demand very little programming effort,' Mick Moignard says. 'The users come to us but we do the changes with them, so they have a very strong feeling of ownership about the system and their information.' Other work group applications are now being developed to help manage information technology projects. A little system has also been produced to capture views on the internal Notes courses, which introduce end-users to the product in half a day. About 170 of the 600 personal computer users in the group now use Notes and the number is growing steadily as more and more applications are added. About 30 people are on-line at a time. Mick Moignard says the alternative to Notes in most of these applications would have been a conventional database management system - 'that would make things more difficult,' he says. 'People would have to learn about database directories, data structures, networking and so on. 'One attraction of Notes is that it works on less formal data structures. For example, with the catalogue system we could scan in book covers and blurbs or 20-second clips from the videos. With traditional database tools, you are more limited in what you can do.' The potential of using Notes in different ways - for example in project management and to catalogue the library - cuts training costs, he points out  -'one lot of training covers a vast range of applications: each time you use Notes in a new application it reinforces the original training.' He is not too concerned yet about Notes demanding extra disc storage. He agrees that the ease of use could tempt users to load up a system with information: his own idea of video clips is one example. But he adds: 'It's also possible that work group software uses less disc space overall, because it manages a central store of corporate information, whereas without it people are likely to be setting up their own databases and documents, possibly duplicating each other's efforts.' Mick Moignard is clearly a committed evangelist on work group software. But he constantly points to the way new Notes users have become enthusiastic converts. 'Our users certainly now have that strong feeling of ownership of information. They no longer feel it's locked up in a mainframe computer and that they can only get at it in certain complicated ways. There's a wide variety of application ideas emerging across the group. We certainly see it helping us to support the lean structure of the company and to provide IT systems where they've been regarded as expensive or complicated in the past.'</p>

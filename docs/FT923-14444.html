			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Malta's PM survives vote on EC failure DR Eddie Fenech Adami, the Maltese prime minister, survived a vote of no confidence yesterday following the decision by EC heads of state in Lisbon not to include Malta in a list of countries lining up for full membership of the Community. The motion was tabled by the opposition Labour Party which claimed the government had deluded Maltese about the island's chances of being accepted as a full EC member. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, had argued institutional changes would be needed if Malta were to be allowed to join. Greece that insisted Cyprus would have to be admitted if Malta's application was approved. Maltese government officials said yesterday the island's application is expected to come up for review again at an EC council of minister's meeting within six months - by which time the EC commission will have finalised its opinion on the Maltese application. The Maltese now plan to put their case more forcefully. The foreign minister, Dr Guido Demarco, will have his first opportunity this month when he meets the British foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, in London.</p>

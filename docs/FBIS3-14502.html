He gave the assurance in Geneva, Switzerland, yesterday  while answering questions from newsmen shortly after the 12th  meeting of the Ministerial Monitoring Committee of the  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. From Geneva,  energy correspondent Alex Udoh reports on the outcome of the  meeting:    [Begin recording] [Udoh] In a communique issued at the end  of  their meeting, the ministers decided to maintain the present  overall production ceiling of 24.52 million barrels of crude oil  per day for the remaining part of the year 1994. In doing so,  they pledged strict adherence to their individual allocated  production levels of last year. The OPEC ministers said they  would not tolerate any violation of the agreement, pointing out  that necessary sanctions would be imposed on defaulting member  countries.    Briefing newsmen after the meeting, the minister of  petroleum  and mineral resources, Chief Don Etiebet, said Nigeria was in  support of the decision reached at the meeting. Chief Etiebet  said although Nigeria favored a cut in production as a means to  firm up oil prices, that could not be borne in isolation. Chief  Etiebet, however, gave detailed explanations on why the decision  will not affect Nigeria's present budget.    [Etiebet] [passage indistinct]    [Udoh] Chief Etiebet stated that Nigeria had a [words  indistinct] system to maintain a production quota of 1.85  million barrels per day of crude oil allocated to it.

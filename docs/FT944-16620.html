			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Siemens' dream factory in Singapore - The island republic is the base for German group's sales in Asia-Pacific region Mr Hartmut Lueck, managing director of the Siemens semiconductor plant in Singapore, has the sort of problem many of the world's industrialists dream about. His factory is working round the clock, every day of the year, yet it still cannot produce enough to satisfy demand. 'A few years ago neither Siemens nor anyone else realised how big the demand for semiconductors would be,' says Mr Lueck. 'Take the use of semiconductors in mobile phones. When mobile phones first appeared we thought they would be used mainly by businesspeople and professionals. Now - in this region at least - they have virtually become a piece of costume jewellery.' Siemens first established an electronics factory in Singapore in 1970. Now it employs 1,600 people at a new components plant capable of turning out more than 300m semi-conductors a year. Singapore serves as the base for Siemens' components sales in the Asia Pacific region. Like many other companies, Siemens is increasingly focusing on the region as the area of future large-scale sales growth. Later this month the entire board will be flying to Singapore for the first board meeting to be held outside Germany in the company's 147-year history. For Siemens as a whole, the Asia-Pacific countries - stretching from Pakistan to Australia - represent one of the world's most promising growth regions. The group's business there has been growing at double-digit percentage rates and is expected in a few years to be as large as that in the US, accounting for some 15 per cent of turnover. As a provider of complete energy, transport and tele-communications systems, Siemens aims to play an expanding role in the economic growth of Asia. The group's order volume in east and south-east Asia rose by 50 per cent to DM5.4bn (Dollars 3.5bn) in the financial year to end-September 1993; worldwide orders totalled DM84bn. In its last annual report, the group described south-east Asia as 'an extraordinarily dynamic' electrical and electronics market. In volume terms, Siemens does not compete with the world's biggest semiconductors manufacturers such as NEC of Japan and Intel of the US. But with the world chip market forecast to grow by between 50 per cent and 100 per cent by the end of the decade, Siemens Singapore is confident that business will continue to expand. Last year sales from Siemens Singapore operations reached nearly DM800m  - a rise of more than 50 per cent on the 1992 figure. This year sales have already exceeded DM1bn, fuelled by growth in the region's telecommunications industry, particularly in China. Mr Lueck feels his company has some advantages over competitors. Siemens started its Singapore factory in the 1970s, in order to benefit from the island republic's low wages. 'Though wages have risen here, they are still low compared with Germany or the US and are an important factor in our operations,' says Mr Lueck. 'But the character of the semiconductor industry is changing. Now cost is not so crucial. The most important thing is innovation and being first - then you make your own price. You can also then achieve cost advantages through volume and quickly recoup your costs - in order to invest in the next cycle of the industry.' Accumulated investment in Singapore by Siemens is put at DM450m. Siemens also has two other regional plants, both in neighbouring Malaysia, which together employ nearly 4,000 people. 'It's very important to be based in the region you are selling to,' says Mr Lueck. There are other advantages. Aided by a Singapore government grant, Siemens is opening an integrated circuit design centre linked to a similar facility at headquarters in Munich. When Munich sleeps, the design centre can take over. Technological advances in the semiconductor industry are rapid: every three or four years a new generation of chips comes along which is far more powerful than its predecessor. 'By working round the clock the R&amp;D and innovation cycles are shortened,' says Mr Lueck. 'That's vital for remaining competitive.' The wafers from which the chips are cut are flown in from Europe. Finished chips used to go back to Germany for testing, but now that is done in Singapore and Malaysia. Siemens Singapore does have its problems. Labour shortages and job-hopping are top of the list. About 30 per cent of the workers at the Singapore plant travel each day from Malaysia. For its top engineers Siemens has had to hold recruitment drives in the US and elsewhere to lure talented Singaporeans back home. Though the semiconductor market is buoyant, Mr Lueck says the industry is unpredictable. 'It's a yo-yo industry - almost overnight you can go from chronic shortages to overcapacity. You always have to be flexible and ready to adapt to change. 'But in this region at least the trend seem to be on an upward curve, with sales likely to rise by between 18 and 20 per cent each year. For the time being it's not too bad.'</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BURRELL BEATS LEWIS AGAIN, ENDS SEASON UNDEFEATED;  </P> <P> TRACK: AMERICAN WINS 100 METERS IN ATHENS IN 10.04. HE HAS WON EIGHT STRAIGHT  INTERNATIONAL RACES.  </P> <P> Leroy Burrell completed a perfect IAAF Grand Prix season in the 100 meters  today, beating world record-holder Carl Lewis for the second consecutive time.  </P> <P> Burrell, out of the blocks quickly, was timed in 10.04 seconds in the Grand  Prix final. It was his eighth victory on the international track and field  circuit.  </P> <P> Lewis, the two-time Olympic gold medalist in the 100, finished third in 10.12,  a tick behind Mark Witherspoon, the runner-up in 10.11. The first three  finishers are teammates on the Santa Monica Track Club.  </P> <P> Burrell's victory gave him the Grand Prix 100-meter title, worth $10,000, and  the men's overall title, worth $25,000.  </P> <P> But Burrell, who has the year's best time -- 9.96 -- did not threaten Lewis'  world record of 9.92 today.  </P> <P> "My target was to win and I did," Burrell said. "It was a very good race. . . .  I was tired because I had a lot of races this year."  </P> <P> In their only other meeting this season, Burrell beat Lewis in the Goodwill  Games at Seattle in July.  </P> <P> "Nothing went wrong," Lewis said. "Burrell did his job. I expected to have a  better start."  </P> <P> Jamaica's Merlene Ottey, winner of the 200 meters in 21.88, also earned $35,000  -- $10,000 for being the women's 200 champion and $25,000 for being the overall  women's champion.  </P> <P> Ottey also won both titles in 1987.  </P> <P> Burrell and Ottey each finished the season with 63 Grand Prix points.  </P> <P> In a surprise, Zambia's Samuel Matete edged American Danny Harris in the  400-meter intermediate hurdles. Matete posted a career best of 47.91.  </P> <P> Harris, the 1984 Olympic silver medalist and the first hurdler to break 48  seconds eight times in one season, finished second in 47.93.  </P> <P> Harris ran the season's best time of 47.49 at Lausanne, Switzerland, in July  and until today was unbeaten in 13 races this year.  </P> <P> "It's great to beat Harris," Matete said.  </P> <P> Kenya's William Tanui won the 800 meters in 1:44.95, with Algerian Reda  Abdenouz second in 1:45.17 and Kenyan Nixon Kiprotich third in 1:45.17.  </P></p>

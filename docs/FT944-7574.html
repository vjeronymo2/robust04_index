			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Weaknesses seen in careers advice Vocational guidance for British school leavers is inferior to careers advice given to young people in other European countries, a study released today says. The report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research compares careers education in the UK with Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands. It found that careers training in mainland Europe gave young people of 'average and below-average attainments' better expectations than in Britain. The report said that teachers were instructed in vocational guidance while their British counterparts were not. Advice was focused on specific careers and continental students were provided with more effective work experience programmes than young people in Britain.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Compaq triples sales of its PCs COMPAQ Computer doubled its first-quarter sales and earnings and tripled the number of PCs shipped. 'The company's performance in the first quarter was driven by record demand for our products from a broad base of customers,' said Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, president and chief executive. Net income in the quarter jumped to Dollars 102m (Pounds 67m) or Dollars 1.23 per share, from Dollars 45m or 53 cents per share while revenues increased 106 per cent to Dollars 1.6bn from Dollars 783m. Net earnings were boosted by a lower tax rate. The company said it had adopted an international investment strategy that has lowered its estimated tax rate to 24 per cent, from 33 per cent in the first quarter last year. Analysts said the expansion of the company's manufacturing operations in Singapore would lower its effective tax rate. 'We achieved these record results while driving down operating expenses,' Mr Pfeiffer added. Operating expenses were down in absolute terms as well as a percentage of revenues, the company said. 'Our challenge is to sustain our growth and maintain our focus on improved profitability by closely managing our gross margins and tightly controlling expenses.' Mr Daryl White, Compaq chief financial officer, said market growth had been stronger in North America than in international markets. In Europe revenues increased by 59 per cent to Dollars 673m in the first quarter, but this was the lowest regional growth rate. North American sales were up 159 per cent at Dollars 795m.

In March, it launched 39 new PCs , and demand for these models has been particularly high, the company said, although shortages of several components have constrained its ability to keep up with demand. Mr White said Compaq was optimistic that sales will remain strong throughout 1993, despite predictions from analysts that growth in PC sales will slow down. 'We are planning for slower growth, but based on first quarter momentum it doesn't seem likely,' he said. 'We have a large backlog of orders.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rod MacJohnson] </F>   [Text] Koidu, Sierra Leone, June 5 (AFP) -- Exactions  against civilians by the Sierra Leone army in its three year war  against rebels have resulted in the troops failing to win the  hearts and minds of the people, their new commander said here on  a recent inspection tour of the front lines.    Colonel Kelly Conteh was appointed chief of the general  staff  in April on his emergence from a Ghanaian military college, with  the job of shaking up the Armed Forces.    "What I have discovered after taking office is that the  Army's inability to win civilian support is due to its negative  actions, including harassment, seizure of civilian properties  and arbitrating in civil matters," Konteh said in an interview  in this diamond centre 250 kiLometres (150 miles) east of  Freetown.    As a result, "we know of instances where civilians have  openly collaborated with rebel elements, giving them food and  (allowing) them to mine diamonds for their own benefit," he said.    "We are also studying claims of people giving information of  strategic locations to the rebels."    Following his appointment, Conteh appealed for new recruits  to the Armed Forces to help restore peace in the country, but he  said that much of the current trouble stemmed from people being  taken on without proper checks of their records.    "We shall weed out the undesirables," he said, vowing that  he  would not compromise in whipping the army into shape.    "I want to head an Army that has an unblemished record and  keep on the side of protecting the nation," Conteh said.    He claimed that the civil war between the military-led  government and the United Revolutionary Front was all but over,  despite continued reports of violent attacks by the rebels.    "I cannot give a time frame but I doubt whether we would be  talking about the war in six months' time," he said.    But in the displaced persons' camp at Goindama, 120  kilometres southwest of Koidu, the largest in the country, the  200,000 inmates no longer believe in such assurances.    Humanitarian aid workers said that more than half of them  were in their third period at Goindama. Twice before, they had  left to go home at the invitation of the government, only to be  forced to return by rebel action.    "We are fed up with coming and going," a former teacher  complained.</p>

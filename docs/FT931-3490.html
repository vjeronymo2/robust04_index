			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Packer pays ADollars 49m for 5% stake in Fairfax NINE Network, the Australian television group controlled by Mr Kerry Packer, yesterday revealed that it paid ADollars 49.7m (USDollars 35.5m) for a 4.98 per cent stake in John Fairfax Holdings, the newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black. The announcement prompted speculation that Mr Packer was planning a bid for Fairfax, which owns the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian Financial Review and The (Melbourne) Age. However, the re-election on Saturday of Australia's Labor government means there is little prospect of a change in the law regulating cross-media shareholdings, which would be required before Mr Packer could bid. The conservative opposition coalition had indicated that it might change the law, which prevents broadcasting operators from acquiring shareholdings of more than 15 per cent in newspaper groups. If he wished to bid for Fairfax, Mr Packer would have to dispose of his controlling 38 per cent shareholding in Nine Network, which would free him from the cross-media ownership restrictions. Mr Packer sought to take a 15 per cent stake in Fairfax when it was acquired in 1991 by a consortium led by Mr Black, chairman of Hollinger, the Canadian media group and proprietor of the UK Telegraph group. He was forced to withdraw from the consortium after widespread criticism of his prominent role in the Australian media threatened the success of Mr Black's bid. Nine Network said it had bought the Fairfax shares as an 'attractive investment'. There were no 'current plans' to increase the shareholding. Nine Network also announced a 1.3 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 39m for the six months to the end of December. The board declared an interim dividend of 7 cents, fully franked, compared with nil last year. The board said Mr Packer would resign as chairman, as previously announced. He will be replaced by Mr Bruce Gyngell, who was head of TV-AM, the former British television broadcaster.</p>

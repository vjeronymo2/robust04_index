			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN REFORM MOVE, CHINA HIKES TRANSPORT PRICES  </P> <P> The Chinese government Saturday took its most dramatic step in more than a year  toward reform of the country's irrational pricing system, announcing sharp  increases in transportation fares.  </P> <P> Prices of train tickets, unchanged since 1958, will jump an average of 112%,  while domestic air tickets will rise 77%, State Council spokesman Yuan Mu  announced in a nationally televised speech. Fares on ships and ferries are to  go up 96%, he said.  </P> <P> Yuan, a close associate of Premier Li Peng, forcefully defended the price hikes  as needed to cut government losses, fight illegal ticket scalping and cut  overcrowding. The measures will promote the development of transportation  infrastructure and the national economy, he said.  </P> <P> Announcement of the increases, which take effect Tuesday, reinforces government  assertions that some economic reforms will continue even in the wake of a  year-old economic retrenchment program and the ascendancy in June of hard-line  leaders who called in the army to end student-led protests demanding political  reform.  </P> <P> More sweeping price reforms, however, have a low priority in the current  regime's short-term plans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 26% Inflation in 1988  </P> <P> The government has continued to emphasize a fight against inflation, which ran  at an official rate of 26% last year, and reassertion of control over various  aspects of the economy.  </P> <P> It has particularly emphasized cutting non-essential construction projects,  fighting tax evasion and trying to prevent companies from profiting by  acquiring goods at low, state-controlled prices and reselling them at market  prices.  </P> <P> Yuan said Saturday that there has been some initial success this year in  battling inflation and that this makes the adjustment of transportation fares  easier to carry out. He also said that all organizations have been forbidden to  raise commodity prices on grounds of higher transportation costs.  </P> <P> Government leaders have repeatedly said that the retrenchment program, now  scheduled to last for another three years, is intended to create conditions for  carrying out additional market-oriented reforms. Many Western analysts,  however, believe that some high-ranking orthodox Marxists are trying to use the  retrenchment program to stop or reverse the reforms.  </P> <P> Premier Li is suspected by some analysts of favoring Stalinist-style central  planning, which has been only partially eliminated in China. Li has repeatedly  denied this, and in a speech last month, he declared that all reforms  previously approved by the Communist Party and government should be continued.  Li was quoted by the official New China News Agency as specifically mentioning  such cutting-edge reforms as commercialization of housing and creation of  enterprise share-holding systems. Experiments in these areas should continue  but "under careful control and step by step," Li said.  </P> <P> It is clear, however, that Li and his closest associates in the government are  far less enthusiastic about rapid market-oriented reforms than former Communist  Party chief Zhao Ziyang, who was removed from office in June for refusing to  use force against the student demonstrators.  </P></p>

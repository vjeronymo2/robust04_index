			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> U.S. REPORT SAYS GENETIC ENGINEERING OF ORGANISMS IS SAFE  </P> <P> Organisms produced by genetic engineering techniques are fundamentally no  different from those produced by conventional crossbreeding and are "not  inherently dangerous," according to a report issued Wednesday by a special  committee of the National Academy of Sciences.  </P> <P> For tests of some microorganisms that have a potential to threaten the  environment, the committee recommended introduction of a "suicide gene" that  would cause the mutated bacteria or virus to self-destruct after the test.  </P> <P> But overall, there is no need for a major revision of existing rules governing  the release of genetically engineered organisms into the environment, the  committee said.  </P> <P> Instead, the decision to release engineered plants, bacteria and viruses into  the environment "should focus on the characteristics of the plant or  microorganism itself, not the techniques used to create it," said biochemist  Robert H. Burris of the University of Wisconsin, chairman of the panel.  </P> <P> Engineered plants are especially safe, the committee said, because they  "rarely, if ever, escape to cause problems in the natural ecosystem." Release  of microorganisms requires more study, but "no adverse effects have developed"  from such introductions in the past, according to the report.  </P> <P> Since the techniques of genetic engineering were first developed 15 years ago,  controversy about the potential danger has surrounded it. Critics have charged  that mutated bacteria or plants released into the environment during tests  could escape and produce an ecological disaster. The new report seems to  discount those objections.  </P> <P> But activist Jeremy Rifkin of the Foundation on Economic Trends, a long-time  opponent of genetic engineering, attacked the report as "irresponsible public  policy," charging that the committee was motivated by "politics, not science."  </P> <P> To date, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection  Agency have issued about 80 permits for field testing of engineered organisms,  most of them plants. But officials expect much larger numbers of applications  in the future because of the great potential of genetically engineered  organisms.  </P> <P> Applications currently being pursued include bacteria that would degrade  environmental pollutants and extract metals from ores, food plants that would  flourish under dry or salty conditions, viruses that would control insect pests  and crops that would resist weed killers and pests and, eventually, produce  their own fertilizer.  </P> <P> The panel was created last year by the academy at the request of federal  regulatory agencies to determine whether new rules should be developed for  evaluating the growing number of applications.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Field Testing  </P> <P> The panel noted that "society has benefited greatly from the use of genetically  modified microorganisms and plants" and that field testing of new species "is  essential" for the development of still better species.  </P> <P> The testing of genetically engineered plants, they concluded, is particularly  hazard free because scientists have already tested "hundreds of millions of  genotypes . . . over decades" with no adverse effects.  </P> <P> The report said genetically engineered plants may be safer than those produced  by crossbreeding because the gene transfer is more precise.  </P> <P> "The (genetic) techniques are . . . more predictable than the classical  methods," Burris said at a Washington press conference.  </P> <P> Critics have argued that the biggest risk of field testing such plants is that  they will escape and become weeds. But the committee concluded that the  physiological characteristics that enable plants to thrive as weeds have been  bred out of the crop species that researchers are experimenting on so that  there is little risk that such plants could survive if they escaped from test  plots.  </P> <P> Hence, there is no need to change the way such experimental tests are  evaluated, the committee concluded.  </P> <P> "The laws as they exist now are adequate for this," said panel member Edward L.  Korwek of the Washington-based law firm of Hogan &amp; Hartson.  </P> <P> Researchers have less experience with microorganisms, the panel said, but  ecological uncertainties can be addressed by considering the changed properties  of the microorganisms, in addition to such environmental considerations as  nutrient availability.  </P> <P> In particular, the panel concluded that the fear of creating hazardous  microorganisms, or pathogens, is overstated.  </P> <P> "It is highly unlikely that moving one or a few genes from a pathogen to an  unrelated nonpathogen will confer on the recipient the ability to cause  disease," the report said.  </P> <P> If the microorganisms being studied are potentially hazardous, risk could be  minimized by using suicide genes, "specific genes that would do their job and  drop dead," said panel member Richard E. Lenski, an ecologist from UC Irvine.  Committee members conceded that such suicide genes are not yet available,  however.  </P> <P> Overall, the panel concluded, the familiarity of researchers with the  experimental organisms and the altered genes is the best criterion to use in  evaluating field-test proposals.  </P> <P> "Field tests . . . can go forward when sufficient information exists to permit  evaluation of the relative safety or risk of the test."  </P> <P> Thomas H.

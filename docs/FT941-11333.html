			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Akbank leaps 125% to TL3,700bn Pre-tax profits at Akbank, Turkey's largest retail bank, jumped 125 per cent to TL3,700bn (Dollars 213m) in 1993. The rise mostly reflects the continued strong performance of the Turkish economy. Akbank, which is listed on the Istanbul stock exchange, is 60 per cent owned by Sabanci, Turkey's second-largest family-owned conglomerate. Last year, it's loan book increased by 80 per cent to TL56,100bn. The bank was active in consumer lending, a relatively new area which grew by 600 per cent in 1993. Like other Turkish banks, Akbank is expanding rapidly its consumer business. Akbank's consumer activities are closely linked with the financing of the parent company's recently launched car manufacturing venture with Toyota of Japan. The bank completed a Dollars 100m syndicated loan in 1993, its first foreign borrowing. However, unlike other Turkish banks, Akbank has refrained from large foreign borrowings - it funded its lira loan book from deposits. These grew by 47 per cent to TL32,200bn in 1993 and account for about 90 per cent of bank funding. This leaves Akbank less exposed than most of its competitors to the impact of the recent 12 per cent lira devaluation, and the changes in reserve requirement introduced by the central bank. The changes - redefining reserve requirements to reflect a bank's total liabilities - will be felt more by non-deposit-taking banks, particularly foreign banks. The Turkish government's 21 per cent state in Turk Otomobil Fabrikasi (Tofas), the car assembly group 42 per cent owned by Fiat, will be sold by private placement with US institutions together with a European issue and a local Turkish offering. Shearson Lehman Bros and J Henry Schroder Wagg are advising on the deal which is expected to raise about Dollars 550m. Tofas is Turkey's largest car producer with a 45 per cent market share.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Britton launches Pounds 121m agreed bid for NMC Britton Group, the acquisitive packaging company, has launched a Pounds 121m bid for NMC, the London-based packaging group. The recommended takeover would result in an almost threefold increase in Britton's market capitalisation. It would build up Britton's strength in the UK polythene market, but its primary motivation is the purchase of NMC's highly profitable US subsidiary, UPC, the largest independent carton business in the US. If successful, Mr Jack Hutton, UPC's president, will join the Britton board, but the other NMC directors will resign. These directors, accounting for 12 per cent of NMC shares, are being well rewarded. Mr Robin Williams, Britton chief's executive, said compensation payments to NMC's directors and advisers would exceed Pounds 3m. Bid speculation on Wednesday pushed NMC's share price up by 42p to 159p. They rose just 1p yesterday in the face of a bid which values the ordinaries at 169p. Britton's shares fell 4p to 161p. The enlarged group would have combined annual sales estimated at more than Pounds 200m, with some 60 per cent coming from UPC. That would represent an enormous leap for a lossmaking oil and gas company acquired by ex-Salomon Brothers bankers, Mr Robin Williams and Mr Simon Beart, in March 1992. Mr Williams said Britton could add value to NMC's UK packaging operations, while removing substantial head office costs and investing more capital in the development of UPC. NMC is forecast to have made at least Pounds 10m profit in the year to March, putting it on a p/e of slightly more than 16 times, significantly lower than Britton. Britton is offering 100 new shares and 400p cash for every 100 NMC shares, and 90 new shares and 400p cash for every 100 warrants. Investors can opt for a higher proportion of cash. It is also offering 28 new shares for every 33 NMC convertible preference shares, with a cash and convertible share alternative. Britton is also launching a rights issue of one convertible stock unit for every 3 Britton shares. The stock automatically converts at 150p, if the bid succeeds. The issue will raise Pounds 25.7m, bringing post-acquisition gearing to between 30 per cent and 35 per cent. COMMENT NMC was the late-1980's glamour stock in the packaging sector, but badly-performing UK investments had left it ripe for a takeover. There is no real industrial logic to Britton expanding into cartons, but an acquisition was expected, and provisional estimates suggest that its 1995 p/e will be brought down to about 14.5. Britton will take time to digest this latest morsel, but the numbers look good, and the shares should maintain their premium rating.</p>

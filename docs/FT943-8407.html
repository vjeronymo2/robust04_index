			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Swiss Bank Corp falls to SFr1.19bn in first half - Operating income hit by bond trading business Swiss Bank Corporation, Switzerland's third largest bank, reported a 45.1 per cent drop in consolidated profits before taxes and provisions in the first half to SFr1.19bn (Dollars 869m). This is a worse performance than its two local rivals, Union Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse. A collapse in income from trading in bonds and interest rate instruments was the main cause of a 23 per cent fall in operating income to SFr3.38bn, while operating costs were flat at SFr2.19bn. Citing an improvement in economic conditions and in borrower quality, SBC halved its bad debt provisions to SFr585m. Together with a 29 per cent cut in income taxes, this limited the fall in net income, which was SFr438m, to 36 per cent. SBC said the results were below expectations, but said it was 'cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the second half, which will largely depend on how the financial markets develop'. The bank, which has put large resources into developing a sophisticated trading business in recent years, suffered a 63 per cent fall in income from this volatile area to SFr537m. It said profits on foreign exchange and European equity trading were ahead of expectations, but results from trading in bonds and interest rate instruments suffered. While the SBC trading result was slightly less dismal than the 68 per cent fall in trading income at UBS, it was far worse than the 35 per cent drop at Credit Suisse. Also, UBS was better able than SBC to cushion the big drop in its trading income from its lending and commission businesses. SBC net interest income was down 15 per cent to SFr1.37bn because of 'continuing pressure on margins' and commission income was up 11 per cent to SFr1.34bn. UBS net interest income was down 8 per cent to SFr1.78bn and its commission income up 10.8 per cent to SFr2.14bn. While UBS knocked operating costs down by about SFr77m to SFr2.6bn, SBC's costs fell by only SFr13m to SFr2.18bn. SBC said the 9.7 per cent rise in overheads reflected branch network restructuring and an expansion of its international activities. SBC led the big three in cutting personnel costs, indicating the increasing proportion of compensation that is performance related. SBC staff costs were down 6 per cent to SFr1.4bn, while those at UBS were down 4.4 per cent to SFr1.85bn. The Credit Suisse personnel bill was up 6 per cent to SFr1.46bn. SBC's 53 per cent reduction in bad loan provisions was much more aggressive than the 26.4 per cent cut at UBS. Credit Suisse did not publish a figure for first-half provisions, but the reduction was probably large. The bank, whose profit before taxes and provisions was down 27 per cent to SFr1.75bn, said its net income was only slightly down.</p>

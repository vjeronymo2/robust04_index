			<p>BFN     [Text] More than 4,000 participants of an unauthorized  rally in Petropavlovsk, North Kazakhstan, said they had no  confidence in the government and demanded its resignation.    The demonstrators, mainly representatives of Communist and  Socialist movements as well as Cossacks, voiced their discontent  over the social and economic situation both in their city and  the republic as a whole and passed a resolution demanding the  government's resignation.    In their opinion, the Kazakh president must bear  responsibility for the republican government which has proved  unable to lead the economy out of the crisis.    The demonstrators supported the region's economic  independence and free trade with neighboring regions of Russia.    One of the organizers of the rally, Valeriy Ilyin, told  INTERFAX that if these and other demands, mainly concerning  state regulation of prices, centralized rationing of basic food  staples, indexation of people's deposits with savings banks,  were neglected, they could resort to other forms of civic  protest allowed by the Kazakh Constitution.    The rally appealed to the Kazakh parliament session to open  on April 19 to consider the issue of dual citizenship and making  Russian the official language.    The demonstrators also demanded the leader of the local  Russian-speaking community, Boris Suprunyuk, be set free.  Suprunyuk had been detained on April 13 on charge of spreading  ethnic strife. The participants of the rally also said they had  no confidence in the region's prosecutor.</p>

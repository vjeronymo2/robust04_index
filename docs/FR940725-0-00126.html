			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> (Ex. 6&hyph;15) commented:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> If an employer is just dealing with a common element like high flash point fuels, oxygen content, carbon monoxide, or hydrogen sulfide, which are easily detectable with electronic measuring devices, you do not need a skilled chemist, provided you have a well trained and equipped competent person.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA agrees that a competent person is capable of testing atmospheric conditions and certifying spaces for entry, and that Marine Chemists are certainly capable of performing that testing. However, the proposal would also have allowed the employer not to designate a competent person if the testing were done by a Coast Guard authorized person. OSHA has determined that this would not promote adequate safety because the Coast Guard authorized person may not have been trained to have all the skills and knowledge of a competent person. In fact, Coast Guard authorized persons are only allowed to authorize someone to test and certify a space ``Safe for Hot Work.'' (See the text of 46 CFR 35.01&hyph;1(a) through (c), 71.60(c)(1), and 91.50&hyph;1(c)(1) in Appendix B to subpart B). A shipyard that relied only upon Coast Guard approved persons would not have an individual who had all the skills and knowledge necessary to protect employees from atmospheric hazards in confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres. Therefore, consistent with the previous standard, an employer can only avoid designating a competent person(s) if the employer states that all testing will be done by a Marine Chemist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In paragraph (b)(2), OSHA has carried forth most of the requirements of previous paragraph (a)(2), which addressed the recording of information on employees who have been designated competent persons. An employer is still required to keep a list of his or her competent persons, but the employer will have more flexibility in determining the form of the record, and instead of being required to send the list to the OSHA area office, employers will be required to maintain the list and make it available upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(2) of the previous rule required the employer to indicate on a ``Designation of Competent Person'' (OSHA 73 form) either the names of employees designated as competent persons or that the prescribed functions of a competent person would always be carried out by a NFPA Certified Marine Chemist. In addition, a new OSHA 73 form had to be completed when additions or changes were made to the information concerning persons designated as competent persons and that it be filed with the local OSHA area office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The exception in paragraph (b)(1) which allows an employer to designate ``any person who meets the applicable portion of the criteria [for competent persons] set forth in paragraph (c)'' in certain situations was in the previous standard at &sect;1915.7(d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Application <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA proposed that the employer prepare a ``certification record,'' that would include the employer's name, the identification of the designated competent person or a statement that a Marine Chemist or a Coast Guard authorized person would be used, the date of training, and that the employer maintain the most recent record on file. Coast Guard authorized persons were also to be added to the exception from designating a competent person. The proposal also eliminated the need to use an OSHA 73 form for recording the information required by the standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this final rule, OSHA addresses the proposed requirements under three separate paragraphs. In paragraph (b)(2)(i) of the final rule, OSHA continues to require employers to keep a record of employees who have been designated as competent persons or a statement that the employer plans to use a Marine Chemist for the testing of atmospheres.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b)(2)(ii) continues the requirement that the record of designated persons be maintained but adds a requirement that the employer make the record available for inspection by OSHA, NIOSH, employees, or their designated representatives. This is consistent with other OSHA standards including &sect;&sect;1915.1025(l)(2) and 1915.1027(o), and with industry practice. OSHA believes it is imperative that competent persons be easily identified because their skills are critical for the provision and maintenance of a safe workplace. In addition, the new requirement will facilitate enforcement of the maintenance of records requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA has eliminated the requirement to use an OSHA 73 because OSHA believes that the OSHA 73 form requires more information than is necessary. The primary purpose of the ``Designation of Competent Person'' form was to provide the identification of employees designated as competent persons or to indicate that a Marine Chemist would be used to perform tests. OSHA believes that such information can be recorded and provided in other ways.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the OSHA 73 form is no longer required, it no longer needs to be provided to the OSHA area office each time a change is made. Now employers can maintain the record of designated employees at the place of employment or other location, such as the main office of the employer, so long as the record can be provided for inspection upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Coast Guard MIONY (Ex. 6&hyph;4) and Mr. Alan Spackman (Ex. 6&hyph;5) supported the elimination of OSHA Form 73, but only if the employer is required to maintain the alternative method of certification. Mr. Spackman (Ex. 6&hyph;5) stated,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This action is acceptable only if the employer is required to either post or make the competent person's certification record available upon request and without retaliation to employee and other persons who may be in the workplaces. The proposal fails to give this assurance.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA believes that by allowing alternative reporting media for identifying designated employees and by requiring that records be maintained and made available for inspection rather than submitted to the local OSHA area office, the final rule addresses Mr. Spackman's concerns. Bay Shipbuilding Corp. (Ex. 6&hyph;15) commented,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Form 73 is non-productive and obsolete. The form could be revised to indicate information such as name, date, employment/experience in shipbuilding/repairs/ship breaking, and schooling or training *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Councillors warned of tough times THE NEW local government minister, Mr David Curry, told the Association of Metropolitan Authorities yesterday that this year's settlement for local government 'will be tough'. He also differed sharply from local authority leaders on the issues of capping council budgets and the distribution of government grants to councils. All parties on the AMA - meeting at a conference in Coventry - voted for radical changes to local government finance in what they called a 'Coventry Declaration' for local accountability. The declaration stated: 'Accountability cannot be effective when on average authorities raise less than 20 per cent of their revenue through locally determined sources. To remedy the accountability deficit business rates should be restored to local control and additional sources of local funding should be investigated.' The AMA also called for: An end to the capping of authorities' budgets as a 'negation of local accountability'. A review of standard spending assessments, which were criticised by the Audit Commission last month. General grants, rather than ear-marked grants for specific purposes. The relaxation of restrictions on the use of capital receipts and on borrowing. Mr Curry pledged to make the system of standard spending assessments for councils fairer if he could, and to conduct a review of standard spending assessments openly. But he added: 'Local authorities spend about Pounds 60bn a year. You have to decide how to use that money. You are no bit players, and that is why it is nonsense to suggest that local democracy is under threat.' He made clear that he wanted to avoid confrontation, by saying: 'You can, and do, influence our thinking and actions. I cannot promise always to agree with you - I do promise always to listen.' Mr Jack Straw, Labour's local government spokesman, also addressed the conference, and supported several of the councillors' recommendations. He called for the abolition of capping, saying that 'every year, the system will throw up perverse and erratic consequences'. He also endorsed the call for non-domestic rates to be set locally, saying that such a move would more than double the proportion of local authority budgets set locally. Mr Straw repeated his call for an independent commission to decide on grants to councils, and for annual elections in each authority, which would have the power of veto over council budgets. He said: 'This would apply the principle of no taxation without representation to local self-government.'</p>

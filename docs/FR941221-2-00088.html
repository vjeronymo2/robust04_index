			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ETA is using about $30 million of the funds to award grants to develop and implement One-Stop Career Center systems in conjunction with local communities. Of these funds, $26.4 million is being used for awards to States, on a competitive basis, for planning/development and for implementation of One-Stop Career Center systems, both of which must be done in conjunction with local communities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this solicitation, ETA will award $3.5 million in grants to up to 10 communities with local One-Stop Career Center systems. We anticipate awarding grants in the $250,000 to $500,000 range depending upon each State's proposal and the number of grants to be awarded. These competitively awarded grants are available to local communities that have already developed a local system and would like to serve as ``learning laboratories'' for other States and local communities in developing One-Stop Career Center systems. It is anticipated that these local communities will serve as test sites for new One-Stop approaches and innovations, and undertake a broad range of dissemination and technical assistance activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. The One-Stop Career Center System Framework <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As envisioned, the One-Stop Career Center system will provide universal access to basic high-quality services for at least DOL funded programs. A guiding principle behind the One-Stop concept is that individuals should have access, through One-Stop, to a broad range of employment, training and education services. This implies at least one physical location that provides comprehensive services to any individual seeking such services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Beyond this, States and their local areas have a great deal of flexibility to design the One-Stop system that best serves the community, which may include many variations. For example, the One-Stop Career Center system may be physically located in one comprehensive site, in many sites, through electronic and technological access points, or through a combination of these approaches. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Designs may include on-site services for only selected programs in the One-Stop Career Center while linking to other programs. Under this scenario, any individual can receive information on possible eligibility for services which may be accessed through another service center_the so-called ``no wrong door.'' A design may provide full access to every employment, training and education program in a single One-Stop Career Center in the community which is linked with other specialized centers and electronic and technological access points. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

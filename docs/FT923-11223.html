			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Arts: Shades of the past - Theatre OSCAR WILDE always knew better than he wrote. Now he has posthumously pronounced on Sharman Macdonald's new play, Shades, at the Albery Theatre: 'All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That's his.' Shades is a tragicomedy about a woman, her son, and her mother. It makes slow-paced, unusual drama, boldly conceived and well acted, but strangely unaffecting. Pearl (wonderfully played by Pauline Collins) is a 42-year-old widow, trapped between her cossetted son and her stern mother. The action is set in 1950s Glasgow during a night out with her beau, Callum. The play rests on the over-close relationship between Pearl and her ten-year-old son (well played by Matthew Steer). She has ambitions for him and has made sacrifices: 'We could have a better life if I didn't pay for your education.' But she will not let him go. She looks elsewhere for security. After dancing with Callum (James Cosmo), Pearl proposes marriage. He rejects her. She returns home to her mother, a matter-of-fact Presbyterian, and to her bedwetting son. The action has an appropriate claustrophobia, aided by Christopher Morley's gloomy design. Simon Callow's direction slows it to a flat sameness: fastening a dress, putting on a jacket, folding a bow tie, are deliberate significant acts. The shades of the title refer to the dark interiors of Pearl's home and to the ghost of her husband. A brighter elsewhere appears in memories of Pearl's happily married past, of VJ Day: 'We went to bed, and for joy, we made a baby.' The play's weakness is that it gestures to the past instead of showing the present. Shakespeare or Chekhov give sufficient information so that their characters become explicable; rather than probing back in time, they show the action advancing. The problem with Shades is its refusal to show rather than tell. The play's strength lies in its subject, ideal for Collins' talents: a woman on the threshold of middle age trapped between an idyllic past and a daunting future, holding on to a son who will move from one to the other in leaving her. It would make a good short story in its present form. Growing old alone is usually the literary province of men; Kafka said it best 80 years ago: 'It seems so dreadful to stay a bachelor . . . always having to say good night at the front door, never to run up a stairway beside one's wife, to have only side-doors in one's room leading into other people's living-rooms.' Shades puts the woman's view. For a limited season at The Albery Theatre (071-867-1115).</p>

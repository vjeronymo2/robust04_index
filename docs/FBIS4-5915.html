			<p>BFN     [Text] India has offered to put up a modern gas-based  thermal power plant in Vietnam. The Indian power minister, Mr.  N.K.P. Salve, heading the Indian delegation to the Joint  Commission meeting in Hanoi also offered to take up more  exploration work for oil and gas in Vietnam. The Vietnamese  foreign minister, Mr. Nguyen Manh Cam, asked for greater  training of Vietnamese personnel in oil and gas exploration by  India. Calling for greater financial arrangements to meet the  target of $100 million in their two-way trade, Mr. Cam invited  Indian investments in railways, power, telecom, and other  infrastructure projects. Our Southeast Asia correspondent says  India offered its technology and expertise in a wide area  covering mining, petro chemicals, food processing, textiles,  cement, sugar, pharmaceuticals, computer software, hotel  industry, and defense equipment.</p>

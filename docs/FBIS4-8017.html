			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov by </F> Lyubomir Denov; place and date not given: "Valentin  Aleksandrov: There Is One Officer or Sergeant to Each Soldier"]    [Excerpts] [Denov] Mr. Aleksandrov, for a long time now  people have been talking about upcoming cuts in the Army. The  new budget implies that this is inevitable. When will it take  place?    [Aleksandrov] No one could doubt any longer the fact that  with this budget we cannot have a 100,000-strong Army.  Something must be done, although I by no means agree to the  concept "cuts." What will actually happen is, first of all,  retirements, and second, structural changes in the Army.    Since there is no more space in which to retreat, and since  the new draft bill on defense has no chance of being adopted at  second reading, I decided to apply the existing law. I do not  want to leave a grave heritage to my successor.    According to the military service regulations colonels  should  retire at the age of 50, and lieutenant colonels at 45. These  regulations are based on the 1958 Law on Universal Military  Service, which was amended for the 11th time in 1979.    [Denov] What does it mean in numbers?    [Aleksandrov] According to the list a bit more than 3,000  officers will retire.    [Denov] Would the combat ability of the Army not suffer?    [Aleksandrov] This is a reasonable question. Since I had  reports about a certain tension among the officers, I decided to  investigate thoroughly the cadre issue in the Army. These are  some of the generalized assessments of the officers who were  polled: To reduce the inflated payrolls of the General Staff,  the Ministry of Defense, the armies, and the divisions; to  eliminate the unnecessary Ground Troops Command; to dismiss all  officers with a service of more than 20 years.    What do the figures show? There is one officer or sergeant  to each soldier in our Army! This is an incredible luxury,  which only countries like the United States or the UK could  afford. The ratio between soldiers and commanders in Turkey is  12:1; in Greece it is 8:1. Their combat ability has not  suffered because of this; the opposite is true.    If the Air Force and the Navy require a larger number of  officers and sergeants because of the higher degree of  professionalism, a ratio like the existing one is inadmissible  in the Ground Troops, which are the backbone of the Army.    A great part of the officers actually do not implement  commanding functions. Some 24 percent of the officers serve in  structures which do not deal with the management of the Army or  in other departments.    Our Army is becoming dangerously old. The young officers are  only 45 percent of the officer corps.    Our Army is full of clerks. The number of combat officers is  five times smaller than the number of their colleagues in the  staffs and officers. Those figures are shocking! [passage  omitted]    [Denov] When will a final decision on the new personnel  figures be adopted?    [Aleksandrov] As a minister I already adopted my decision.  The government fully supports me. The supreme commander in  chief has no remarks in principle. I have the impression that  the political forces also approve. At the beginning of April my  decision will be discussed by the Supreme Military Council. I  also have the support of Army General Lyuben Petrov, chief of  the General Staff. [passage omitted]    [Denov] Is it true that after the changes the Army personnel  will be cut from 100,000 to 55,000?    [Aleksandrov] There is an opinion according to which with  the budget the parliament adopted we can maintain only a  55,000-strong Army. This conclusion is based on the methodology  of a UK institute. I issued an order to the General Staff  according to which an analysis is made at present regarding  precisely what Army could we maintain. However, in this case it  is more important to decide whether we should have a smaller but  combat-ready Army, or to leave a fantastic big number of people  with questionable qualifications. Personally, I prefer the  quality to the quantity. [passage omitted)</p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / La Malfa tightens party grip THE leader of Italy's Republican Party, Mr Giorgio La Malfa, has emerged considerably strengthened from his party's 38th congress which concluded at the weekend. The final vote gave near unanimous support for Mr La Malfa's attempt to make his small party the central element in a new realigment of the country's political groupings pressing for institutional and electoral reform. None of those who questioned his presidential style of leadership - including Mr Bruno Visentini, the party's elder statesman and former minister - have been retained on the Republicans' 185-strong national council. Critics have been excluded and 91 new, and mostly young, people have been brought in, among them 27 women. The Republicans won just under 5 per cent of the vote in the general elections last April. Although this was a modest improvement on their performance in 1987, Mr La Malfa had hoped for broader electoral support for a party which stood in opposition to a renewal of the four-party government coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Liberals and Social Democrats. The Republicans continue to suffer from their public image of a minority party appealing to an intellectual elite. They hope to broaden their appeal by establishing themselves as reformers.</p>

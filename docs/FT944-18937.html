			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Tebbit and Bennites team up for 'best of Thatcher' video There may be little love lost between the hard right and the hard left inside parliament, but outside they are joining together in the mutual pursuit of profit. Lord Tebbit, former chairman of the Conservative party, who was once described by Mr Michael Foot, former Labour leader, as 'a semi house-trained polecat', has teamed up with an employee of Mr Tony Benn, the veteran leftwinger, to make a video about Lady Thatcher. Called No] No] No], the video went on sale earlier this week. It chronicles Lady Thatcher's final year in the Commons and is directed by Ms Ruth Winstone, long-time editor of Mr Benn's diaries. It is intended to 'make 'em laugh and make 'em cry', with famous clips including Sir Geoffrey Howe's resignation speech and Lady Thatcher's own defiant performance after the vote of no confidence. No] No] No] is the first video since the Commons lifted its ban earlier this year on using its television footage for commercial purposes. A video of Mr Benn's top 10 moments since the cameras were allowed in to parliament in 1989 was released last year as an experiment. 'After making 'the best of Benn', Wedgie's office thought 'this is a great idea'. They realised that even hotter property than Tony is Mrs T,' Lord Tebbit said. 'I was approached by these good leftwing socialists who had seen a market opportunity. They asked me to act as raconteur, and as I'm a great believer in encouraging capitalism, I said yes.' He said the video had been made on an 'almost zero-budget', and noted that they would not need to sell many copies, which retail at Pounds 9.99, to make a profit. If No] No] No] - likened by Lord Tebbit to the CD of Nat King Cole's 20 greatest hits - does well in the charts it will be followed by other parliamentary releases. However, Lord Tebbit doubted whether any other MPs, Lady Thatcher and Mr Benn aside, were colourful enough to merit a 'best of' video, and said that future videos might concentrate on debates. Mr Charles Frater, director of Parliamentary Films, which produced both the Thatcher and Benn videos, said he had considered Mr Dennis Skinner, outspoken Labour MP for Bolsover, as a subject. But he felt it would take too long to watch the miles of available footage to find enough funny moments for the video. It is far from certain how large the market is for these videos, especially for those on debates. Parliamentary Films has experimented with pilot films on the election of the speaker of the House and the wild mammals protection bill. The company's optimism that these obscure titles would go down well in schools has not been borne out. 'There was not much public enthusiasm for them,' said Mr Frater, a former communist from South Africa who now describes himself as 'more left than right'. By contrast, 3,000 people had paid Pounds 12.99 for the Benn video, which he said was 'not bad going'. Lunch with the FT, Section II Page XIII</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Venezuela restarts sell-offs Venezuela's new government has decided to re-start the country's stalled privatisation programme by offering to sell a state-owned airline, Aeropostal, 'at the end of March,' according to the new head of privatisation. Mr Abdon Vivas Teran, a long-time congressman, was appointed to manage the privatisation programme by President Rafael Caldera, who began a five-year term in February. The previous government planned to sell the airline several times, but lacked political support. It also wished to sell three electric power companies and other state-owned assets. Aeropostal, which has domestic and international routes, has serious financial problems and needs a large capital infusion to survive. Mr Vivas Teran said the Caldera government wanted to ensure that workers in nationalised companies obtained a greater number of shares than in the past. As a first step, he said potential buyers of Aeropostal would have to agree to allow workers to purchase 20 per cent of its stock and to continue granting existing benefits. Venezuela initiated an ambitious privatisation plan in 1990, but sales of important assets did not materialise after a failed coup d'etat in early 1992 plunged the nation into turmoil. The programme gained over Dollars 2bn from the privatisation of a telecommunications company, another airline and a variety of other companies.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Leading Article: No deal in Bosnia The agony of the Bosnian Moslems continues. Their position has been compared, by various people at various times, with that of the Czechs in 1938 or that of the Palestinians in and after 1947. The Czechs were put under intolerable pressure, by people who claimed to be their allies, to accept the amputation of their national territory as the only alternative to a hideously destructive war. They accepted, only to find that within six months the state was destroyed anyway. The Palestinians, asked by the international community to accept partition of their country on ethnic lines, refused - only to suffer defeat after defeat and be told each time, in the name of realism, that they must make do with an even smaller fragment of territory than they had previously rejected. The Czech analogy is an indictment of the west for appeasing aggressors. The Palestinian one is intended, usually, as a hard but necessary lesson for the Bosnians themselves: to take what they can get, before it is whisked off the table. But the actual position of the Bosnians, and the moral position of the west, is worse than either analogy suggests. The Czechs in 1938 were only asked to give up that part of their territory whose population was predominantly German; and the western powers had the excuse that the alternative was a war they were not yet ready to fight, though they were preparing for it. The Palestinians in 1947 were at least offered a territory on which a more or less viable state could have been built; moreover their adversary was prepared to accept the deal in good faith, and could reasonably have been expected to respect the partition had they agreed to it. Military power None of those conditions apply in Bosnia today. The Bosnian government has already lost the greater part of its national territory, including many areas where Moslems were in the majority until the fighting started. The west has ample military power to defeat the aggressors, should it choose to do so. The territory now on offer to the Moslems is too fragmented to be the basis of a viable state. And they have no reason whatever to believe their adversaries, especially the Serbs, would implement the agreement in good faith if they accepted it. The Serbs have done a deal with the Croats, in a cynical attempt to exploit the latest peace plan of the European Union, which suggests that sanctions on Serbia might be gradually lifted if the Moslems were given a state comprising one third of the country, as they had demanded in September. On paper the deal does offer the Moslems that percentage, but the map of the proposed territory makes no sense, whether demographic, economic or military. Lamentable record The Moslem enclaves in eastern Bosnia would be completely isolated, Sarajevo virtually encircled by the Serbs and cut off from its suburbs, and the Moslems would no longer have the access to the river Drava in the north that they were previously promised. Moreover the deal was negotiated by the president of Serbia, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, not by the Bosnian Serbs. Even if Mr Milosevic reached it in good faith, his previous record in imposing concessions on the Bosnian Serbs is lamentable, and his authority has now been further diminished both by the loss of his own parliamentary majority and by the re-election of a Serb leader in Croatia whom he had previously deposed. The EU, it should be stressed, has not endorsed this offer. The Serbs must realise that they have to improve it drastically, and be prepared to implement it, before there can be any question of lifting sanctions. At the moment they have once again turned the world against them by stepping up the bombardment of Sarajevo, and interfering with relief supplies, in a blatant attempt to put pressure on the Moslems. Yet Nato, which back in August threatened air strikes on Serb positions if the 'strangulation' of Sarajevo continued, seems further than ever from taking any action. Instead, the British and French governments have been adding to the pressure on the Moslems by hinting they may withdraw their troops in the spring if no agreement is reached. This can only encourage the Serbs in their intransigence.</p>

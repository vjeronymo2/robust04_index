			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT;  </P> <P> COMMISSIONER WHO CRITICIZED LOSES POST  </P> <P> A planning commissioner who sharply criticized the City Council during his  recent unsuccessful campaign for a council seat lost his seat on the commission  last week.  </P> <P> Harold Kaufman, who spent a two-year term on the city's first Planning  Commission, was not reappointed by the council for another term.  </P> <P> Kaufman, an insurance claims settler, was the only city commissioner seeking  reappointment to be rejected for a new term.  </P> <P> "I guess that's politics," Kaufman said. "But I plan to continue being active  in this city as much as I am able to."  </P> <P> While campaigning for a council seat in the June 5 election, Kaufman had openly  criticized the City Council members for overturning Planning Commission  decisions. He also accused them of being too influenced by developers.  </P> <P> Seven candidates sought three council seats in that election. Kaufman came in  fourth.  </P> <P> Last week, when making appointments to three commission seats, the council  chose incumbent Lynn Dawson and newcomers Robert Montgomery and James Hyde.  </P> <P> City Councilman Mike Eggers, who had borne the brunt of Kaufman's criticism  during the campaign, entered the motion naming the three appointees. The vote  was unanimous.  </P> <P> Eggers denied it had anything to do with the council race.  </P> <P> This is not a campaign issue," Eggers said. "I can withstand personal attacks;  I've been attacked before."  </P> <P> But, Eggers said, "we wanted people with respect for each other and respect for  the staff and, based on (Kaufman's) comments, he doesn't have much respect for  the council. With all the work we have to do, putting together a general plan,  a redevelopment agency and a $3-million capital improvement budget, I wanted  everybody moving in the same direction."

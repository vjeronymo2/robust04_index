			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Ex-directors are imprisoned TWO former directors of Fox Milton, a London securities dealing firm, have been jailed for six months for cheating the Inland Revenue of Pounds 130,000, it was disclosed yesterday. Mr Philip Raisey, who was chairman, and Mr Stephen Wright, company secretary, sang gospel songs in their City of London dealing room while they were carrying out the fraud, an Old Bailey jury heard. Judge Brian Capstick said a deterrent sentence was necessary in spite of the men's former good characters and their religious beliefs. 'This was a fraud on the innocent taxpaying public,' he said. The two men had embarked on a 'consistent plan' to cheat the Inland Revenue. He ordered them to pay Pounds 30,000 each towards costs of the case after hearing that the police investigation and the three-month trial had led to costs of Pounds 645,248. The pair were jailed on Tuesday but a reporting ban was imposed pending a possible appeal and further prosecution. The ban was lifted yesterday. Mr Raisey, of Chislehurst, Kent, and Mr Wright, of Sevenoaks, Kent, were convicted of conspiring to cheat the Queen and the public revenue.</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / MPs back value tests for drugs The government yesterday appeared to back plans to introduce tests that would require new medicines prescribed on the National Health Service to prove themselves to be economic or medical improvements on older rivals. It praised proposals made by the Commons health committee in July that would give new drugs five years' grace after they were approved for sale. After this 'those which were found to be less effective, or more expensive with no therapeutic advantage, than competitor drugs would be excluded from being prescribed on the NHS', said the select committee in July. The Department of Health's response to the report yesterday said that it was considering such 'national prescribing list' schemes. The department said: 'The way in which such a scheme might operate is well described by the select committee.' The NHS drugs bill is rising faster than in most big countries with the exception of the US, in spite of last year's 2.5 per cent price cut imposed by the government through its Pharmaceutical Prices Regulatory Scheme. The prospect of a national prescribing list improving cost-effectiveness was backed by the Labour party. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the government needed to 'examine with more urgency the potential of a national prescribing list' which would direct research by drug companies towards examining the cost-effectiveness of new drugs, which would be of more use to the NHS. Dr Joe Collier, editor of Drugs and Therapeutics Bulletin, said: 'This is a very exciting development and I'm delighted that the Department of Health appears to warm to it.' The Association of the British Pharmaceuticals Industry, which has long resisted radical reform to the way in which drugs are assessed and prescribed, attacked the proposal. It remained 'convinced that any such list restricting the availability of medicines would not be in the interest of patients and would also adversely affect the search for much-needed new treatments'. It said the health department had conceded that a national prescribing list would not be cheap or easy to operate. Such a scheme would be radical even in a world where healthcare reforms are being considered by many countries. So far, only Canada and Australia have insisted on considering the economic impact of individual drugs. The department rejected the committee's recommendations that prescription charges and the number of people eligible for free prescriptions be cut. It also rejected the committee's concerns that the drug industry's voluntary code of practice for marketing to doctors might be being breached and that statutory restrictions on promotional activities such as gifts and hospitality were not being enforced.</p>

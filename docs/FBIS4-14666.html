			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Kudrina video report; from the "Dalniy Vostok" </F> program]    [Text] There is and undoubtedly will always be a demand for  electricity. Here we have a different type of problem: How to  overcome the region's energy crisis. This was the purpose of  the recent conference in Khabarovsk which discussed the problems  of using small-capacity nuclear power plants in the Far East,  the Far North, and the Baykal regions.    We have been discussing the development of nuclear energy in  the Far East region for a long time. The energy crisis in the  territory forces us to return to this subject. It has been a  pressing problem for a quite some time, but because of financial  difficulties today, it has become even more complicated. If we  assess the situation using Khabarovsk Kray as an example, it is  enough to cite two factors to be convinced of the extreme  complexity that exists in the energy situation. The supply of  gas from Sakhalin has been reduced twofold. Our own local coal  supply provides less than 4 percent of the requirement, and the  rest of the coal is brought in. We are critically short of the  money needed to buy the coal. [video shows meeting in session,  then cuts to show V.M. Malich, chief of a department of the  Vostok-Energo organization, addressing the meeting]    [Begin Malich recording] It is necessary to point out that  there have been no new power-generating capabilities introduced  in the Far East since 1990. Many of you in the hall here know  that from 1980 to 1985, we commissioned a little less than 1,800  megawatts of power. Between 1985 and 1990 it was even less, 800  megawatts, and since 1990, nothing. That is, currently we are  not commissioning anything, not even power-generating  capabilities which could and should cover the capacities that  are being lost. [end recording; video shows participants in the  meeting]    The power engineers see the solution in the completion of  the  TET [heat and electric power plant], the GES [state electric  power plant], and the GRES [state regional electric power plant]  projects already begun -- of which there are quite a few in the  region -- and in the building of small-capacity nuclear power  plants. [video cuts to show V.T. Lebedenko, general director of  the combined board of Far East nuclear power plants]    [Begin Lebedenko recording] Nuclear power generation began  to  develop in the form of draft projects after the government  adopted decrees on measures to provide the regions with fuel and  energy resources. As you might recall, the first project was  for a Far East nuclear power plant, the technical and economic  substantiation plant, for which was completed and handed over  for checking by the experts. This year we are faced with  deciding whether or not this plant is to go into operation.  This is precisely where Vyacheslav Mikhaylovich [not further  identified; possibly V.M. Malich] and I have a divergence of  views, although I will not be adamant. [end recording; video  shows meeting, a wall map entitled "Electric Power -- Far East  Economic Region and the Baykal Region"]    Power engineers favoring traditional fuels and those  favoring  nuclear power have agreed on one thing: Both were satisfied  with the alternative of building small-capacity nuclear power  plants in the Far East, the Far North, and the Baykal regions.</p>

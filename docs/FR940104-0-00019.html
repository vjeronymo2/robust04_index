			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ozark asserts that the Commission's order is not at all clear whether it is relying upon the modified definition of ``control'' to support its decision here. If the Commission's decision rests at all on ``whether acting alone or in conjunction with others'' language, Ozark submits that the Commission's decision is in error. Ozark argues that the effect of the additional language is to establish ``control'' in a 1% voting interest owner of a corporation. Ozark asserts that the language creates an irrebuttable presumption of ``control'' by anyone holding at least a 10% voting interest in a corporation, contrary to the clear statement in the balance of the regulation that the presumption of control is rebuttable. Ozark contends these two effects result from the indisputable fact that any interest holder must act with the requisite plurality in order for any particular action to be taken by a corporation or a partnership. Ozark states that in its case unanimity is required for most actions so all partners must vote in the affirmative in order for particular action to be taken. Ozark asserts that the fact that unanimity is required, again, does not constitute control but, rather, evidences a lack of control. Accordingly, Ozark submits that the modified definition is inconsistent with the existence of a rebuttable presumption, is arbitrary and capricious, and lacks any basis in reasoned decisionmaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Commission Ruling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission rejects Ozark's request for rehearing. Ozark argues that the Commission's definition of ``control'' is inconsistent with the existence of a rebuttable presumption. We disagree. Section 161.2 states that ``control (including the terms `controlling,' `controlled by,' and `under common control with') includes, but is not limited to, the possession, directly or indirectly and whether acting alone or in conjunction with others, of the authority to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of a company. A voting interest of 10 percent or more creates a rebuttable presumption of control.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In Order No. 497&hyph;A, the Commission specifically addressed the issue of joint venture pipelines and stated that overlapping interests create an incentive to grant an affiliate preference. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission applied the definition in section 161.2 to several pipelines that had requested rehearing, including High Island Offshore System, U&hyph;T Offshore System, Trailblazer Pipeline Company, Sea Robin Pipeline Company, Northern Border Pipeline Company and Great Lakes Gas Transmission Company. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Tenneco, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the court upheld the definition of control and the way in which the Commission applied it to Northern Border Pipeline Company. In considering Ozark's petition for review, the court remanded the Commission's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> application <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of the term ``control'' but not the definition of the term. Thus, Ozark's request for review of the definition of control is a collateral attack on Order No. 497&hyph;A and the Commission rejects it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 CFR 161.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Order No. 497&hyph;A at 31,593.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 49 FERC &para;61,340 (1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To consider whether there is control here, we will review all the evidence Ozark has submitted on the issue. On March 10, 1987, Ozark filed an application under section 7 of the Natural Gas Act for a certificate of public convenience and necessity. In that application, Ozark stated that it is a partnership and submitted its partnership agreement, which shows that Ozark is jointly owned by four partners, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that the partnership will be managed by a management committee, which will consist of equal representatives from each partner, and will be operated by OPGC. In addition, OPGC selects the President of Ozark, who also acts as the CEO and the Chairman of the management committee. On July 5, 1988, Ozark emphasized that its General Partnership agreement specifies that no action may be taken by the management committee except by unanimous approval. On January 3, 1993, Ozark presented, for the first time, a partial copy of a corporate resolution dated June 26, 1991. This states that ``the President of Ozark or his designee is hereby authorized to execute interruptible transportation agreements on behalf of Ozark.'' Because Ozark's partners ceded to the President the authority to enter into interruptible transportation agreements, no partnership vote is required. All of Ozark's firm capacity is committed to Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company and Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation. Therefore, Ozark claims that its partners cannot ``control'' transportation either affirmatively or negatively through veto power.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Ozark's owners are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Ozark Gas Pipeline Corporation (OPGC), which is a direct subsidiary of USX Corporation. Other subsidiaries include, TXO Production Company, Marathon Oil Company and Delhi Gas Marketing Corporation. The activities of TXO Production Company, the marketing affiliate, have been subsumed into Marathon Oil Company. However, TXO Production Corporation still ships on Ozark, as does Delhi Gas Marketing Corporation, another marketing affiliate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Tennessee Ozark Gas Pipe Company, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, which is in turn, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tenneco, Inc. Tennessee's marketing affiliate is Tenngasco Corporation (Tenngasco), which is a shipper on Ozark.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Columbia Gulf Transmission, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Columbia Gas System, Inc. Columbia Gas' marketing affiliate, Columbia Gas Development Corporation ships on Ozark; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Caney River Transmission Company, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ONEOK, Inc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We disagree. The partners still have authority to direct the management and policies of Ozark and could, at any time, revoke the authority over interruptible transportation from the President. Moreover, under the terms of the partnership agreement, OPGC selects the President of Ozark and operates Ozark. OPGC's marketing affiliates ship on Ozark. OPGC has the requisite control described in section 161.2 of the Commission's regulations because it operates Ozark and, through the President it selects, manages the pipeline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

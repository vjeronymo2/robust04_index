			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Swedish Bonds: Investors receive confusing signals IT HAS been a week of mixed news for Sweden's government bond market. The good news came in two doses: first a statement from the governor of the Central Bank saying he wanted to see the krona tied more closely to the European Monetary System; and secondly a firm commitment from the Centre-Right coalition government, which came to power last autumn, to its policy of low inflation. The bad news was the fact that Sweden's forecast budget deficit is well above earlier expectations, leading to concern about government borrowing. 'We want the present unilateral linkage of the krona to the Ecu to be replaced by a system whereby the krona is tied to each individual EMS-currency with a central rate around which the exchange rate fluctuation is permitted to be plus/minus 2.25 per cent,' said Mr Bengt Dennis, governor of the Riksbank, on Thursday. 'That is the system which the majority of EMS countries use and which we will put into practice when we become members of the EC.' He added that by doing so, the krona's theoretical exchange rate fluctuation against the majority of EMS currencies would be almost halved. 'A closer link to the other EMS currencies would definitely mean less fluctuation in the krona, reduce the risk of future devaluations and force a tight monetary policy,' said one Swedish banker. Friday's supplementary budget also contained some welcome news for the bond market. Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, stressed her government's commitment to keeping inflation down, overturning years of high inflation under the Social Democrats. Consumer prices (December-to-December) increased by 10.7 per cent in 1990 and by 8 per cent last year, but are forecast to rise by only 2 per cent in 1992 and by 2.2 per cent the year after, the Centre-Right government said. However, concern about the size of the budget deficit rather overshadowed the good inflation projections. The central government budget deficit for the 1992-1993 fiscal year (which runs from July 1-June 30) is estimated at SKr101.8bn, corresponding to 6.9 per cent of GDP. Only four months ago, the government had forecast a figure of SKr71bn, so the more pessimistic revision came as a rather unpleasant surprise. The government warned that there would be a further weakening in the 1993-1994 fiscal year before the deficit started to decrease.</p>

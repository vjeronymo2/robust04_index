			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An environmental assessment (EA) of this proposed action has been completed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (enclosed). Based on the EA, and in accordance with the guidelines for determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the significance of proposed federal actions (40 CFR 1508.27) and EPA criteria for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initiating an environmental impact statement (EIS) (40 CFR 6.605), EPA has concluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the proposed General NPDES permit will not result in a significant effect on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> human environment. The proposed permit will not significantly affect land use patterns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or population, wetlands or floodplains, threatened or endangered species, farmlands,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ecologically critical areas, historic resources, air quality, water quality, noise levels, fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and wildlife resources, nor will it conflict with local, regional, or state land use plans or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policies. The proposed permit conforms with all applicable federal statutes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> executive orders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed General Permit includes the same technology-based permit limits,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established by regulation (40 CFR part 440, subpart M), as the individual permits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently do. The recirculation of process wastewater is required and the settleable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solids concentration of the allowable discharge (i.e. excess water) is limited to 0.2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> milliliters per liter. Water quality-based limits are also included in the proposed permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed permit covers, in addition to conventional open-cut placer mining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations, placer mining operations utilizing hydraulic methods to remove  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overburden, and suction dredges. The proposed permit limits for the hydraulic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overburden removal operations are based on the state sediment standard and best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional judgment and are the same as the limits for the conventional operations. The limits for the suction dredge operations would be based on best professional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> judgment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed General Permit would reduce the yearly administrative burden of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA associated with the processing of numerous individual permits. Because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed General Permit and individual permits include essentially the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, the primary impact related to permit type is expected to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative. No negative impacts to EPA, other agencies or operators are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed General NPDES Permit may contribute to an improvement in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental conditions because it would reduce the permitting administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workload thus making available limited time that could be used for higher priority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities, such as permit compliance and inspections. The inclusion of suction dredge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations in the General Permit will improve the monitoring and compliance of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed action, the new source placer mining proposals requesting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coverage under the General Permit would continue to be subject to individual NEPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviews. This will enable EPA to evaluate the site-specific and cumulative impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with the individual projects. Where an EA concludes that significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts are not anticipated, a Finding of No Significant Impact would be issued and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the new source project would be granted coverage under the General Permit. If EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines that significant impacts from a proposed new source project may occur, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EIS would be prepared prior to EPA's final permit decision. Therefore the site-specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts of those projects would continue to be evaluated and considered prior to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit actions. An individual permit may also be required by EPA in lieu of coverage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the General Permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the above reasons EPA has determined that an EIS will not be prepared for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments pertaining to this Finding of No Significant Impact may be submitted to: Rick Seaborne, Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Review Section, 1200 Sixth Avenue, WD&hyph;126, Seattle, WA 98101.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No administrative action will be taken for at least 30 days after the release of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finding of No Significant Impact. EPA will fully consider all comments before taking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final action. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;&blank;Sincerely,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Charles E.

			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> OPERATIC 'NURSE' NEEDS DOCTOR  </P> <P> Patrons of the Metropolitan Opera got a little more drama than they had  anticipated when mezzo-soprano Helga Dernesch fainted on stage.  </P> <P> Dernesch, who was playing the vocally demanding role of Nurse in Richard  Strauss' "Die Frau ohne Schatten," "paused, coughed and fell to the floor"  about 50 minutes into the 60-minute first act of the three-act opera Monday,  said Metropolitan spokesman Charles Sheek.  </P> <P> "Then the curtain was brought down and we decided to take an intermission," he  said.  </P> <P> Dernesch was attended by the house doctor, who concluded that "she may be a  little anemic, but she's fine and she's going home," said Sheek.  </P> <P> The opera resumed with another singer, Diane Curry, singing the part, Sheek  said.  </P></p>

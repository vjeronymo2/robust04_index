			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chilean Foreign Minister Enrique Silva Cimma this  afternoon disclosed Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de  Lozada's official response to the invitation conveyed to him by  Chilean President Patricio Aylwin to attend the Chilean  presidential inauguration.    Sanchez de Lozada says that it is not still advisable for a  Bolivian president to attend an official ceremony. He added  that his wife Ximena Iturralde de Sanchez de Lozada will  represent him.    Silva Cimma read to the press Sanchez de Lozada's reply:    [Begin Silva Cimma recording] He says that for reasons that  are not beyond President Aylwin's illustrious acknowledgement, a  visit by a Bolivian president to Chile to attend an official  ceremony is not yet advisable. He has, however, empowered his  wife, Mrs. Ximena Iturralde de Sanchez de Lozada, to represent  him as a proof of his consideration and personal esteem toward  their excellencies President Aylwin and President Frei Ruiz  Tagle. [end recording]    Sanchez de Lozada also conveyed thanks for the invitation  conveyed to him by his Chilean counterpart Patricio Aylwin, and  wished the best success to future President Eduardo Frei  Ruiz-Tagle.    Silva Cimma said it is not suitable to speculate on this  response which, according to him, does not affect bilateral  relations.    [Begin Silva Cimma recording] I hope this letter will not  lead to speculations, considering that the reply to the  invitation was made in a very delicate way and in terms that I  think are self- explanatory. Therefore, I am simply announcing  the official report, and that is it. [end recording]    Diplomatic relations between Chile and Bolivia were  disrupted  after the Pacific War of the last century, when Bolivia lost its  outlet to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

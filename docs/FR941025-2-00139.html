It was designed by and is maintained by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. The Index is fully described in SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;14, the Exchange's rule filing relating to the listing and trading of options on the Nikkei 300. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See supra,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Index warrant trading.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The warrants on the Index would be direct obligations of their issuers and would be cash-settled in U.S. dollars. The warrants would have either American or European style exercise. Upon exercise, or at the warrant expiration date in the case of warrants with European style exercise, the holder of a warrant structured as a ``put'' would receive payment in U.S. dollars to the extent that the index value has declined below a pre-stated cash settlement value. Conversely, holders of a warrant structured as a ``call'' would, upon exercise or at expiration, receive payment in U.S. dollars to the extent that the index value has increased above the pre-stated cash settlement value. Warrants that are out-of-the-money at the time of expiration would expire worthless. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Warrant listing standards and customer safeguards.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;90&hyph;08, <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  the Exchange established generic listing standards for index warrants, which are contained in CBOE Rule 31.5(E). The filing also established certain sales practice rules for the trading of index warrants, which are contained in Chapter IX of the Exchange's Rules. The listing and trading of index warrants on the Nikkei 300 would be subject to those guidelines and rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28556 (October 19, 1990), 55 FR 43233 (October 26, 1990). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Rule 31.5(E), (i) issuers shall meet the CBOE's size and earnings criteria for equity issues and have assets in excess of $100,000,000; (ii) the term of the warrants shall be for a period ranging from one to five years from the date of issuance; and (iii) the minimum public distribution of such issues shall be 1,000,000 warrants, together with a minimum of 400 public holders, and have an aggregate market value of $4,000,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because index warrants are derivative in nature and closely resemble index options, CBOE would also require safeguards designed to meet the investor protection concerns raised by the trading of index options.

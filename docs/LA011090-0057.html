			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> PENTAGON PUTS PANAMA CIVILIAN DEATHS AT 220;  </P> <P> INVASION: ESTIMATE SUGGESTS 10 DIED FOR EACH U.S. SOLDIER WHO FELL. DEFENSE  FORCES LOSSES ARE PUT AT 314.  </P> <P> The Pentagon, in its first accounting of non-military casualties in last  month's U.S. invasion of Panama, said Tuesday that about 220 Panamanian  civilians were killed in the fighting that followed the assault by 27,000  American troops.  </P> <P> At the same time, the Pentagon estimated that 314 members of the Panama Defense  Forces were killed.  </P> <P> The estimate of civilian deaths, which is almost certain to add new fuel to the  controversy over the cost of the U.S. action, suggests that almost 10  Panamanian civilians died for each of the 23 U.S. soldiers who were killed.  </P> <P> Pentagon spokesman Robert Hall disputed estimates that have placed the number  of killed Panamanian civilians as high as 1,200. He noted that the American  estimate of 220 was slightly higher than the 203 estimated by the Panamanian  Institute for Legal Medicine, which records and investigates all suspicious or  violent deaths in the country.  </P> <P> Both the U.S. and the institute's estimates included victims who may have been  looters, out-of-uniform members of the Panama Defense Forces or those belonging  to Gen. Manuel A. Noriega's armed "Dignity Battalions."  </P> <P> "We cannot guarantee to you that they were all civilians," State Department  spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said. "If it was a PDF member in civilian clothes  . . . that has not been sorted out."  </P> <P> In reaching their estimate, American military investigators visited civilian  hospitals and relief agencies and reviewed death records of Panamanian  civilians since Dec. 20, when the invasion began.  </P> <P> Defense officials said they were confident that independent estimates would  support the Pentagon's count. The Panamanian Red Cross is investigating the  numbers of civilian deaths and casualties.  </P> <P> The highest estimate came from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who alleged in a  television interview Monday that the United States had killed 1,200 persons.  Many of them, he said, were buried in mass graves.  </P> <P> Jackson did not say where his estimate came from, but a spokesman later said  that the data had been provided by the New York-based Caribbean Action Lobby,  which canvassed Panamanian funeral homes and hospitals. Efforts to reach  officials of the group Tuesday were unsuccessful.  </P> <P> Officials at the State and Defense departments said they could not determine  whether the Panamanian civilians were killed by U.S. or Panamanian troops. But  Pentagon officials and returning soldiers said that U.S. forces operated under  orders designed to minimize the numbers of civilian casualties.  </P> <P> One Administration source said, for instance, that planners of the operation  prohibited the use of "indirect-fire weapons," which lob their ordnance over  longer distances but with uncertain accuracy. Only the AC-130 gunship, an  aircraft that fires at ground targets with high accuracy, was authorized to  initiate fire against such targets, officials said.  </P> <P> The strictures also included "rules of engagement" that most soldiers  interpreted to mean that they must be shot at before they could open fire on  Panamanians in or out of uniform.  </P> <P> "We were briefed once, and the (guidelines) were too broad," said Sgt. Kenneth  Jeffries, an artilleryman with the 7th Light Infantry Division who returned  earlier this week from Panama to his home base at Ft. Ord, Calif. "You let  yourself get shot (at) first before you shot back, if you wanted to make sure  you didn't go to jail. If we had been in heavy firing, I think my unit would  have been in some trouble."  </P> <P> In one instance, defense officials said that a young Army Ranger burst into a  roomful of unarmed Panama Defense Forces recruits and held fire long enough to  ascertain that none of the frightened troops were armed.  </P> <P> In other instances, soldiers said that isolated snipers hid among crowds of  Panamanian well-wishers and shot at U.S. convoys as they passed. The U.S.  troops were told they could not return fire under such conditions.  </P> <P> "We were told if we felt we were in danger and there was no alternative, we  could use what force was needed," said Spec. 4 Charlie Harris, a paratrooper  who returned Monday to Ft. Bragg, N.C. "But everybody out there was nervous; it  was an urban area. A lot of guys got out and shot first, asked questions  later."  </P> <P> Although Harris said he knew of one case in which a Panamanian was mistakenly  shot, he added that U.S. troops were more often injured as a result of the  inexperience of many of their comrades.  </P> <P> "We had a lot of friendly fire," Harris said. "A couple of guys got hit."  </P> <P> Pentagon officials said the United States intends to compensate the Panamanian  families of those who died. One Administration official said such compensation  would be extraordinary in a situation in which civilians became casualties of  combat.  </P> <P> In the Vietnam War, however, the United States in many cases issued small  "solatium payments," which did not admit any liability on the part of U.S.  forces, to the families of civilians killed during combat operations.  </P> <P> SEARCH CONTINUES -- Panamanians are still looking for missing relatives.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 9 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry's  Yulgok special inspection team announced Wednesday that it has  arrested three field-grade officers for their involvement in  irregularities stemming from "the Yulgok project," a program to  build up the nation's military power. The team also punished  the chief of the Navy's Signal Corps and nine other officers for  neglecting to supervise eight programs related to the Yulgok  project.    The chief of the inspection team, Lt. Gen. Chang Pyong-yong,  announced the results of the two-month probe into the Yulgok  project at the Defense Ministry building.    Navy Cmdr. O Yun-hwan was arrested last week after it was  disclosed that he had informed a trader of the expected bidding  price for shooting control equipment on military ships, in order  to negotiate a contract for a higher price than the expected  bidding price, at the end of 1991.    Trader Chon Won-hong received more than 1,154,000 U.S.  dollars, indeed higher than the expected bidding price, from the  Defense Ministry for importing and providing the shooting  control equipment, thus making an undue profit of more than  190,000 dollars.    Cmdr. O received roughly 80 million won (about 100,000  dollars) from Chon, who was also arrested early this month.    Cho Ki-hyon, head of Chong U Construction Co., Ltd., was  arrested for bribing two officers to win the order and for using  a particular construction method at military schools on the  outskirts of Kwangju and Kimhae.    Army Col. Chong Sok-yong and Air Force Lt. Yim Myong-yong  received 20 million won and 47 million won, respectively, from  Cho. Both were arrested in January.    The inspection team also said that Daewoo Corp. drew up a  behind- the-scenes contract with Lockheed Aircraft Ltd. of the  United States for mediating the Navy's purchase of sea patrol  planes (P-3C), besides the official contract.    Daewoo received an official commission of 3 billion won from  Lockheed and asked for an extra 18.4 billion won under the  secret contract, only to be rejected by Lockheed.    The inspection team reviewed the Air Force's F-4E Phantom  fighter improvement project and decided to cancel it due to  excessive expenditure and U.S. restrictions on transferring  advanced technology to South Korea.    On the Korea Navy Tactical Data System (KNTDS) program, the  inspection team said the Navy did not judge U.S. development of  the system precisely and paid the American company, Litton Ltd.,  2.7 billion won unnecessarily for the system.    Chang said after the announcement that his team had carried  out a strict investigation of former defense ministers including  Kwon Yong-hae and Choe Sae-chang, but had found nothing untoward.    Meanwhile, Chang added that the inspection team will ask the  Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry to cancel the registrations  of the 11 businesses which are involved in the Yulgok  irregularities including Koverseas Ltd.    The Yulgok special inspection team, comprised of the Armed  Forces special inspection group, the Defense Security Command,  joint investigation team and the ministry's law officers,  finished a mission yesterday that began last Dec. 28.</p>

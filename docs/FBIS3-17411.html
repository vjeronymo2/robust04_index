			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Shakhray, nationalities and regional </F> policy minister, by Tatyana Sukhomlinova under the "Autograph"  rubric: "Sergey Shakhray: I Will Take Part in Elections, But  Only as a Voter" -- place, date not given]    [Text] Sergey Shakhray's name is often mentioned among  those who are expected to run for the Russian Federation  presidency. According to the Party for Russian Unity and Accord  [PRES] leader, participating in the elections is not a priority  for him. As such, he singled out "the creation of a robust,  effective political party, because without such a system there  is nothing to be done in politics."    [Shakhray] I also see another objective in the next few  months -- to create an effective staff at the Ministry for  Nationalities and Regional Policy. So far there has been a lot  of fuss about it. But we do not have a ministry yet. A minister  and five deputy ministers have been appointed. It has been  abolished three times within the past two years. That is all.    [Sukhomlinova] Your party has been portraying itself as an  all-Russian organization that recognizes the principles of  federalism and local self-government and is oriented toward a  market economy. But what is the use of it?    [Shakhray] Our objective is to set up our representation in  all echelons of power: from the federal government to the  Federation components' bodies of economic authority. This will  take two or three years of work. The PRES already has its  branches in 66 regions. We have a membership of 22,000 people.  But there should be allies, a political infrastructure around  the party.    [Sukhomlinova] What is your attitude to your rivals?    [Shakhray] The issue is not the word "rival." At present,  the political picture is dominated by the struggle between three  political and economic elites: the regional and sectoral ones,  and that of Moscow. The regional and sectoral elites are now  joining forces against the Muscovites. But the Moscow group  itself is divided into four blocs. As far as it is concerned,  one should not forget that 70 percent of Russia's banking  capital is concentrated in Moscow...    [Sukhomlinova] What four blocs of the Moscow elite are you  talking about?    [Shakhray] If I were to answer your question specifically,  certain names would have to be mentioned... Everything will be  clarified in April. Unfortunately.</p>

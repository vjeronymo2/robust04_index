			<p>BFN     [Text] The Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP] has reaffirmed  that the Iraqi Kurds are standing in one line against the forces  of evil and aggression in defense of the unity, dignity, and  independence of great Iraq under President leader Saddam Husayn.    This came in a statement issued by the party at the end of  an  ordinary meeting held today. The meeting was devoted to  discussing the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan and the tragic  events there as a result of the bloody armed clashes between the  traitors and agents belonging to the humiliated Barzani and  Talabani as well as the ongoing events in fraternal Yemen whose  national unity is threatened with secession and apostasy.    In its statement, the party emphasized that despite all the  imperialist conspiracies and intrigues and the mean 30-state  aggression as well as the subsequent traitorous and treacherous  chapters--which have continued incessantly in the form of the  continued blockade on the Iraqi people's Arabs, Kurds, and other  fraternal nationalities--the Iraqi people, by virtue of their  steadfastness and endurance, have managed to foil all forms,  links, and chapters of the conspiracy and preserve their  national unity with their heads high behind the banner of God is  Great. This banner is carried with all vigor and loftiness by  the unique President leader Saddam Husayn.    In the statement, the party said that such traitors and  agents as Barzani and Talabani are symbols of agentry and crime.  The forces of the U.S.-Zionist evil and aggression deputized  these agents to implement a subversive and criminal conspiracy  against the Iraqi people after they failed to achieve their  objectives during the brutal 30-state aggression and its  successive chapters with the aim of isolating Iraqi Kurdistan  from Iraq, the mother homeland. These forces also lured these  agents into giving them a free hand in the region and fulfilling  their sick dreams at the expense of the struggle, blood, and  martyrs of the Iraqi Kurds who continue to be a true sword  defending the unity of both lofty Iraq and its people as part of  a unique autonomy. No Kurds in any world state have been  granted such autonomy.    The statement also pointed to the risks posed by the  continued unfair blockade imposed on the Iraqi people. This  blockade has gravely harmed the Kurds, exactly like other  nationalities in Iraq., This harm threatens death as a result of  the scarce food and medications in addition to the serious  situation the Iraqi Kurds are experiencing due to the ongoing  bloody fighting between the symbols of agentry; namely, the  Talabani and Barzani groups [words indistinct] tens of Iraqi  Kurds everyday.    With regard to the ongoing events in fraternal Yemen, the  KDP  stressed the need to halt all forms of foreign interference in  Yemen's internal affairs. The party described this interference  as a grand conspiracy which is targeting Yemen's unity and which  is not less heinous than the brutal 30-state aggression on the  Iraqi people. The party renewed its support for the just  legitimate and constitutional struggle which the fraternal  Yemeni people are waging in defense of their national and  historic unity against the secessionist and renegade forces.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Faysal al-Husayni, Palestinian leader in the </F> occupied territories, by Umberto De Giovannangeli; place and  date not given: "`They are Hunting the Arabs -- Israel Is  Pretending Not To See'" -- first paragraph is L'UNITA  introduction]    [Text] "This is a tragic day, not only for the Palestinians  but also for the entire peace process in the Middle East. When  massacres like the one in Hebron take place, it means that there  is increasingly less room for talks and then all hopes will  vanish." Faysal al-Husayni does not hide his pain and anger.  "What happened," he stressed, "is horrible not only because of  the size of the massacre. Hundreds of unarmed people were there  to pray and had entrusted themselves to the protection of the  Israelis. The result is there for everybody to see. Now, do  not tell me that this was the isolated act of a 'madman': It  would be an offense against common sense and an insult to the  memory of the victims. The evidence that we have collected is  clear-cut: More than one person fired, an authentic commando  that acted with lucidity and that had planned the criminal act."    [De Giovannangeli] At such a dramatic moment, what requests  are you making to the Yitzhaq Rabin government?    [Al-Husayni] Words of condemnation do not help. Concrete  acts that demonstrate the real willingness of the Israeli  authorities to strike at the extremist colonists and the extreme  right-wing Jewish groups are needed. We are asking for the  immediate opening of an inquiry that will not merely shed full  light on who the executors and the instigators of the massacre  are, but that will also ascertain the responsibility of the  Israeli military authorities who had to guarantee safety in holy  places. This is only the first step; it should be followed  immediately by others...    [De Giovannangeli] Which?    [Al-Husayni] Israel must acknowledge without reserve that  the colonist movement is now a paramilitary organization that  has chosen terrorism as its tool of political action. We are  asking Rabin to ban these groups and to arrest the leaders who  in these years, and even after the Washington accords, have  acted undisturbed, openly disseminating proclamations of war,  and organizing authentic "Arab manhunts." We are saying to the  Israeli prime minister: Any further hesitation in acting  against the terrorists of the settlements, any further  postponement in the implementation of the Washington accords,  could definitively cancel the positive things that have been  constructed over the past months.    [De Giovannangeli] Is a ban on extremist groups sufficient  to  save the negotiations?    [Al-Husayni] It is the minimum condition, a basis for facing  the issue in depth: the dismantling of Jewish settlements in  Gaza and the West Bank. Rabin has always wanted to postpone  discussions on this point, which is decisive for achieving real  peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. After the  Hebron massacre any delay in resolving this problem would sound  like an objective act of complicity with the extremists. We  know well that not all the colonists are terrorists, but we also  know that -- and this fact certainly does not escape the Jewish  military authorities -- that the settlements have now been  transformed into operational bases for Israeli paramilitary  groups: It is where they train themselves, it is where they  keep large quantities of weapons. For this reason the  settlements should be dismantled already during the transition  phase. It is the mere presence of the colonists in the  territories that creates tension and fuels violence.    [De Giovannangeli] In which terms does the Hebron massacre  reintroduce the issue of safety in the territories?    [Al-Husayni] Israel has always seen this problem from a  unilateral point of view, like a fact that concerned its  citizens only. And this definition has weighed heavily upon the  Taba negotiations. Rabin deceived himself by thinking that he  could get everything and the opposite of everything: The accord  with the PLO and the support, or at least the non-ostracism, of  the colonists that have always supported the nontransferability  of "Judea and Samaria." On the other hand, the Hebron massacre  bears witness to the impossibility -- which moreover was  repeatedly denounced by the PLO -- of entrusting the safety and  the life of the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank to the  Israeli troops. An immediate initiative by the United Nations  is needed and in particular by the United States and Russia, the  "cosponsors" of the negotiations on the Middle East: We are  asking that the Palestinian population in the territories be  placed under international protection until the withdrawal of  the Israelis is completed. Only in this way can new massacres  be avoided.</p>

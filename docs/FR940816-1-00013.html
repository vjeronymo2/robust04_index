			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the first category_vessels which have not transited the Canal before October 1, 1994, the proposed regulation establishes a proposed new rate of $0.26 per PC/UMS Net Ton. This rate of $0.26 per PC/UMS Net Ton is expected to result in a booking fee near the rate assessed under the existing system. In other words, the amount paid by an individual vessel at $0.26 per PC/UMS Net Ton will closely approximate the amount it would have paid at $0.23 per Panama Canal Gross Ton. The new booking fee rate system will be applied to a limited number of vessels inasmuch as the number of first-time transits involves a relatively small number of vessels each year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, the Commission's intention is to revise the rate in a manner which maintains fees at approximately the same level as currently paid by individual vessels. Retention of the $0.23 rate_merely fixing fees at $0.23 per PC/UMS Net Ton_could reduce individual booking fees as much as 20%. Inasmuch as the intent of this proposal is solely to reconcile paragraph 103.8(e) with the new standard tonnage measurement and not to otherwise alter the booking fees, the agency proposes the $0.26 rate which approximates present booking fees without increasing customer costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the other and larger category_vessels which have previously transited the Canal, the proposal retains the existing booking fee computation method. This recommendation has its genesis in the proposed revisions to the Rules for Measurement of Vessels using the Panama Canal. The PC/UMS proposed rule contains transitional relief measures which preserve existing tonnage for ships transiting the Canal between March 23, 1976 (the date of the last significant rules change) and September 30, 1994, inclusive. In the instant proposed rule, the Commission proposes that the method for assessing booking fees for these vessels be similarly retained. Vessels meeting the aforementioned PC/UMS requirements for transitional relief which use the booking system after September 30, 1994 will not be affected inasmuch as they will continue to pay the same fee_$0.23 per Panama Canal Gross Ton. For these previously-transiting vessels, the booking fee would change only in the event the vessel undergoes a significant structural change, defined in the PC/UMS as a change in the volume of the vessel of 10% or more. Under the PC/UMS, a vessel undergoing a significant structural change loses its entitlement to the relief measures and becomes subject to application of the PC/UMS measurement formulas. In such an instance, the new rate of $0.26 per PC/UMS Net Ton would be applied to the vessel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has been exempted from Executive Order 12866 and, accordingly, the provisions of that directive do not apply to this proposed rule. Even if the order were applicable, the proposed regulation, which concerns ``rates'' and ``practices relating'' thereto, would not constitute a ``rule'' as that term is defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601(2)) and would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under that Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A review of the environmental effect of the proposed measurement rule changes concludes that the proposed change will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. An environmental impact statement is not required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Administrator of the Panama Canal Commission certifies that these proposed regulations meet the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order No. 12778.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 35 Part 103  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Advance reservations, Booking system, Order of transit, Panama Canal, Vessels. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, it is proposed that 35 CFR part 103 be amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 103_GENERAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING VESSELS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

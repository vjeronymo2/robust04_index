			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Dec 4 KYODO -- Tokyo and Beijing have agreed  to conclude a bilateral agreement on environmental cooperation  focusing on measures to check acid rain, government sources said  Saturday [4 December].    The agreement is expected to be signed when a top Japanese  Government leader visits China, the sources said. The date of  the leader's visit to China has not yet been fixed.    Air pollution in rapidly industrializing China is believed  to  be partly responsible for acid rain in East Asia. Sulfur  dioxide, nitrogen and other acid rain-causing emissions  originate from the burning of fossil fuel, such as coal and oil.    Acid rain damages buildings, kills fish by acidifying lakes  and rivers, and is believed to be fatal to trees.    Japan has sealed similar environmental agreements with the  United States and South Korea, but the accord with China is the  first to refer explicitly to the problem of acid rain.    The government places high hopes in the joint battle against  acid rain, all the more since Beijing and Seoul vowed  cooperation on air pollution in an agreement in October.    ``Together with the Japan-Korea agreement on environment  protection we will be able to proceed on a trilateral basis with  joint acid rain research and counter-measures,'' an Environment  Agency official said.    The agreement will also stipulate regular consultations to  set up a network of survey stations to measure air pollutants in  line with a five-year agency project, which aims at determining  how much of Asia's acid rain originates from Chinese and South  Korean emissions.    China released 160,000 tons of sulfur oxide into the air in  1991, according to the Chinese Government, an amount 15 times  greater than that released by Japan.    While the Chinese Government concedes that sulfur dioxide  emissions will continue to increase with the country's rapid  economic growth, it questions whether domestic pollution affects  other countries.    ``We have a lot of acid rain in China, too, but I don't  think  that pollutants from China cause acid rain in Japan,'' Xie  Zhenhua, director of China's State Environmental Protection  Bureau, said recently in dismissing such allegations.    Jiro Kondo, chairman of the Japan Science Council, welcomed  the agreement as ``basically good,'' but warned of a biased  approach to acid rain.    ``Actually, desulfurization devices and other technological  support are necessary. Cooperation will only be fruitful if we  avoid viewing Japan as the country suffering from pollution,  while terming China the polluter,'' said Kondo.    Meanwhile, officials at the Ministry of International Trade  and Industry (MITI) voiced misgivings the envisaged treaty could  cause. A conflict of responsibilities among government bodies  could arise, if existing MITI projects in China are included in  the framework.    MITI started environmental dialogue with China's State  Planning Commission in April 1992 and supports the country with  an annual amount of 6 billion yen for testing of desulfurization  and smoke filtration plants and the dispatch of experts.    If subject to the treaty, MITI projects would require  approval by the Foreign Ministry and the Environment Agency.  Officials fear that the time-consuming procedures -- often more  than two years from application to the final approval -- would  hamper an effective and flexible response to China's  environmental problems.</p>

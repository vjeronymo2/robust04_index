			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Party agrees to Nigerian power talks NIGERIA'S Social Democratic party (SDP) has agreed in principle to form an interim national government to replace the military regime on August 27, provided that it can choose key members of the government and that elected local, state and legislative institutions remain intact. The National Republican Convention (NRC) is joining the SDP in talks with President Ibrahim Babangida on terms agreeable to both parties and the military government. The NRC would be a more grudging participant, preferring the option of new elections before August 27. According to a presidential spokesman on Tuesday, the military government would dissolve all democratic institutions and possibly the two army-created parties unless they were ready for fresh elections by the end of July. The SDP has rejected the option of fresh elections before the military hand over because they insist that their presidential candidate, Mr Moshood Abiola, was a fair winner in the June elections. The government has annulled those polls and banned Mr Abiola from standing in fresh elections. SDP officials say that the inclusion of Mr Abiola as head of the interim government is a condition of their acceptance. 'Things have reached a collision course and that would not help the parties, the military or the people,' said Mr Amos Idakula, spokesman for the SDP. 'We are opting for this because it is the only way to get the military out of power. This interim government would be a buffer between the outgoing regime and elected civilian government. Elections held under the military would have no credibility.' The civilian protest in Lagos which has paralysed the country's commercial capital for three days has made clear popular rejection in south-west Nigeria, the main base of Mr Abiola's support, of fresh elections before August. 'We would not be fooled by that,' said a Lagos civil servant. 'The June polls results should be upheld. There is no option being offered by the government, it is an ultimatum. We could not accept new elections under them.' The two parties met in Abuja yesterday and agreed on the need to maintain elected civilian institutions and to end military rule in August, but the NRC accuses SDP of intransigence in ruling out elections under the existing regime. 'We are paying for the sins of the SDP,' said an NRC spokesman in Abuja. 'Our position is that there should be new elections immediately. But if the SDP show restraint and table proposals which are in the national interest, we are prepared to negotiate if it will preserve the corporate unity of Nigeria.' Soldiers have restored order in Lagos as protesters await details of the plan for an interim national government. Mr Uche Chukwumerije, the information minister, denied reports that anyone had been shot in Lagos. Contrary to local reports, the main casualties on Tuesday were the result of a road accident in which a taxi driver ran over some youths in road blockade and was lynched by a crowd.</p>

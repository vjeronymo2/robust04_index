			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japan and France agreed  Thursday [26 May] to hold talks to exempt construction materials  being traded between the two nations from inspection, Japanese  Government officials said.    Japan's Construction Ministry and France's Housing Ministry  will confirm which materials will be eligible for exemption by  the end of October.    The plan, which is slated to come into effect in November,  will also cover construction methods.    France will be the first country to agree to have talks on  such a reciprocal requirement with Japan, though Japan hopes to  make a similar agreement with the United States and with Canada,  they said.    An examination is required for construction materials and  methods by each government for safety measures against strength  or fire. But each country has its own requirement.    For instance, a certain French construction material that  meets French standards has to be checked again in Japan when it  is imported here.</p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS HOPE LATE FADES WON'T LEAD TO EARLY EXIT FROM PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> Dig back through a month and a half of Socker games and you can find what  turned out to be the dress rehearsal for Saturday's semifinal playoff loss to  Dallas.  </P> <P> Different team. Same score. Same result.  </P> <P> At the San Diego Sports Arena March 22, the Sockers were sailing along with a  4-2 lead when Wichita scored three goals in 1:38 to steal the victory, 5-4.  </P> <P> How familiar.  </P> <P> The agony was longer Saturday, but the aftereffects may be of more consequence.  Dallas scored three goals within 4:46 of the fourth quarter and won, 5-4, tying  the series at one game each.  </P> <P> So the Sockers have arrived for three games at Reunion Arena knowing this could  be the last stop on their Major Indoor Soccer League title defense tour.  Tonight's 5:35 game will be followed by games Saturday and Tuesday. If the  Sockers lose them all, the season is over.  </P> <P> Perhaps their biggest immediate concern is a tendency to fade late in a game.  Their record in overtime this season is 2-10, and lapses such as Saturday's  seem to be most prevalent in the fourth quarter. Nobody is sure why.  </P> <P> "Maybe we lose a little bit of focus late in the game when we get ahead,"  defender Kevin Crow said. "I think sometimes we want to play a little bit more  freely before we put the game away. We get a little more individual and  selfish. The point is not to get to the point where you allow them to tie. Once  the game is tied, it's too late."  </P> <P> The Sidekicks, who clearly don't measure up to the Sockers in terms of talent,  are proving true to their reputation as a tireless team with a strong work  ethic. By all rights, the Sockers should have won Saturday, but Dallas' players  hustled to take advantage of each Socker mistake.  </P> <P> "Dallas played with a lot of emotion," midfielder Brian Quinn said. "When we go  to Dallas, if we don't match that, we'll be in trouble. We've just got to get  the killer instinct back. It's far from over. It's going to be a long,  drawn-out struggle."  </P> <P> Quinn, as with team scoring leader Branko Segota, has yet to return to form  after missing much of the second half of the season with a strained arch.  Segota's hamstring has fully healed, Socker trainer Bill Taylor said. But his  shot hasn't. Socker Coach Ron Newman said he is hoping to get more production  from both players as the playoffs progress.  </P> <P> Newman said he might make changes in the lineup tonight. Chris Chueden, who  didn't dress for Saturday's game, will make the trip and allow Newman more  options in the midfield.  </P> <P> In the long run, Saturday's loss might benefit the Sockers, serving as a  reminder that Dallas is capable of scoring an upset in this series. The  Sidekicks were the Sockers' first choice as a playoff opponent, but if  overconfidence was a problem before the series began, it shouldn't be after  Saturday.  </P> <P> "You should shake it off, but you should remember it," Crow said. "Hopefully  we'll learn a lesson from it. I don't think we've turned up the intensity like  the other teams have. That concerns me."  </P> <P> The Sockers are 2-2 this season in Dallas, winning, 2-1 and 7-1, and losing,  4-3 and 5-3. Saturday's was the first Sidekick victory at the Sports Arena this  season.  </P> <P> With a laugh, Newman says the Sockers' biggest problem is this: "The  commissioner allows them to have the same number of players in the playoffs as  we do, and that's a pain in the (tail) sometimes."  </P> <P> Socker Notes  </P> <P> Tonight's game will be telecast live on Prime Ticket at 5:35 p.m. and tape  delayed on XTRA (690) at 7:25 . . . Forward Steve Zungul leads the Socker  offense in the playoffs with seven points -- two goals and five assists.  </P></p>

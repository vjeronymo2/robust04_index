It  reflected topical matters of Russia's development, consolidation  of the state and all its institutions, stregthening of law and  order in Russia", Yegor Gaydar, leader of Russia's Choice  parliamentary faction, said on Thursday. He spoke at the  colloquium "The future of reform in Russia" held in St.  Augustin, Germany. The colloquium was organised by the Konrad  Adenauer foundation close to the Christian Democratic Union.    The Russian president could have spoken more definitely on  economic matters, believes Georgiy Zadonskiy, influential deputy  of the State Duma. "I followed closely Boris Yeltsin's message  to the Federal Assembly. I believe it has not set out a firm  economic course", he told ITAR-TASS. "This can be used both for  continuing the deepening of reform and for trying to consolidate  the power of bureaucrats which the president mentioned".    Zadonskiy said he has no sense that the president and the  government have adopted a common stand for adjusting reforms.  He believes Yeltsin remains on positions of reform, but  vagueness on matters of state regulation of the economy is quite  dangerous.    "The president's message to parliament leaves an ambiguous  impression", said chairman of the communists faction in the  State Duma, Gennadiy Zyuganov. Nevertheless he welcomes  Yeltsin's ideas for the consolidation of statehood and  separation of powers between subjects of the federation.  Zyuganov told ITAR-TASS that the meeting between the head of  state and parliament on Thursday "looked like a dialogue". He  said the report did not have signs of the search of an enemy.  Quite the contrary, it was an attempt to rally forces for the  sake of normalisation and reconciliation.    Zyuganov still believes the Russian Federation will be  unable  to cope with any of its problems unless there is a renewed  union. From this viewpoint he approves of the fact that the  president attaches priority to the strengthening of ties within  the Commonwealth of Independent States. Zyuganov again deplored  the fact that Russian leaders had not set themselves this task  earlier, in the framework of the union.</p>

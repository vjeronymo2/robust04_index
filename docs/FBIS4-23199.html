			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] forces have  captured Nyanza military camp in Gitarama. Several government  soldiers and civilians who have been imprisoned in the camp were  set free. RPF forces have received cooperation of the residents  in the area, who are handing over arms and ammunitions that were  supplied by government functionaries. As RPF forces advanced  toward the town of Gitarama, the self-imposed government is on  the run to unknown destinations. Some sources say that the  government may now be in the town of Kibuye near the Zairian  border while others say that the government may now be in  Gisenyi, also near the Zairian border. Some cabinet ministers  have been sighted in the town of Gisenyi and others have already  taken refuge in other countries, pretending to be on diplomatic  missions. [passage omitted].</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Travel: Tea and cake - then the earthquake struck / Mark Hodson got more than he bargained for when he visited Banaue, in the Philippines AT THE bus station in Baguio City, four hard-faced Filipino drivers sat huddled around a table drinking beer. A sign on the wall said: 'No sleeping on the tables.' On the radio, Bruce Springsteen was singing Born To Run. It was 6am. The town of Sagada was eight hours away by bus along the Halsema Highway, a narrow rock and dust track carved into the sides of the mountains 7,000 feet above sea level. Our wooden-sided jalopy spewed out black fumes as it crawled up the first hill. At the top, we watched the sun peer over the mountains and bathe the rice terraces below with warm morning light. If the scenery wasn't breathtaking enough, there was always the driving. On downhill stretches our driver screamed around blind hairpin bends on the wrong side of the road with his hand on the horn and his foot on the gas. I had picked up a hint about the standard of driving in the Philippines when, at the bus station in Manila, I was offered an insurance policy with my ticket to Baguio. For around 25p I could relax in the knowledge that if I were killed on the trip my family would receive about Pounds 5,000. Strangely, it did not make me feel any easier, but as the odds seemed generous I paid up. Now we were in the heart of the central cordilleras, two days' hard driving out of Manila, where rebel ambushes, earthquakes and falling rocks would have made the idea of insurance ludicrous - and premiums prohibitive. When we finally made it to Sagada, I found a lazy, one-street town in a small valley and surrounded by pine forests and lush terraces. But for all its beauty, this was bandit country - the last frontier between law enforcement and the rich cannabis fields of the north, controlled by the communist New People's Army. I found a room in a guest house for Pounds 1 a night, and a cafe across the road that sold home-made chocolate cake. In the evening, at one of Sagada's two bars, I was cornered by a Filipino guide with one tooth who told me a girl from New Zealand had been involved in a road accident that day. A bus from Banaue, the next town on my itinerary, had veered off the road and crashed down the side of a mountain. 'She is in the hospital here,' said the guide. 'You can go and see her.' I asked if she was badly hurt. 'Oh, yes,' he replied cheerily. 'She's dead.' I nodded sagely, wondering how to make my escape when I was saved by the bell. It was 9.50pm, said the barman; we had 10 minutes to drink up and get back to our rooms before the curfew came into force. I went without argument. I was woken by the sound of pigs squealing beneath my window. I stumbled out into bright sunshine where a young boy said: 'Good morning, you want to buy some hash?' A gang of teenagers wearing bandanas, basketball shorts and flip-flops swaggered up the street with rifles slung over their shoulders. I asked the boy if they were rebels. He grinned: 'No man, that's the army.' After breakfast at the Shamrock Cafe, I set off to find Sagada's hanging coffins, a collection of unusual graveyards said to lie on the outskirts of town. Along the main street, men in tribal skirts squatted outside thatched huts sharpening long knives while families sold cakes and Coca-Cola from their metal-walled houses. I stopped several times to ask directions but the children just giggled and the adults waved vaguely at the hills ahead. After an hour of aimless wandering I was on the point of giving up. Then I looked up and saw them, clusters of rough wooden coffins lodged in cracks and crevices high in the sheer rock faces. I walked further and found other unmarked coffins carved out of tree trunks and placed in piles at the mouths of caves. These strange tombs were built by local tribespeople who believed the dead souls would return to the Earth's core. The custom has been abandoned and some coffins prised open, possibly for the benefit of tourists, to reveal greying skeletons draped in tattered cloth. The trip to Banaue was by jeepney, a brightly-painted minibus converted from an old American troop carrier. Just two jeepneys a day made the trip, one at 6am and the other at 6.30am. We stopped three times on the way: once to buy breakfast of pancakes and coffee, and twice at army checkpoints on mist-covered mountain tops. The road into Banaue passed some of the most dramatic rice terraces in the world. Whole hillsides had been carved into horizontal slices. It has taken the people of the Ifugao tribe 2,000 years to build these terraces, step by step from the ground up, using bare hands and primitive tools. Engineers have come from around the world to study the sophisticated irrigation system and marvel at the 12,000 miles of mud walls. I spent two days in Banaue exploring the terraces, walking for hours in the clear mountain air, losing my way and finding it again. On the afternoon of the second day I went to a cafe in town. I was sitting with a cup of tea and slice of cake, nursing my blistered feet, when the earthquake struck. First, my cup started shaking on the table. I looked down and saw the table shaking; then I looked up to see that the whole building was shaking. I ran into the road to find the population of the town there already, looking very worried. The quake lasted about 15 seconds, maybe less. It seemed longer. There was no structural damage, just a few vegetable stalls upset, pictures knocked off walls. It had measured 5 on the Richter scale. At the epicentre, in Baguio City, it reached 5.7 and left 25 people injured. I was told it was the worst earthquake since one three years earlier which had measured 7.7 and killed 1,600 people across the region. Two hours later the rains came, torrents of water battering the houses and flooding the streets with mud. As the storm raged into the night, I cowered in a cafe drinking beer with an English teacher from Hackney. Every now and then a loud rumble would echo through the valley and we would freeze in terror, tensed for another earthquake, then burst into wild laughter when we realised it was only thunder. Next day, life had returned to normal. The air had cleared, the ground was drying out, people were laughing. I squeezed into a bus packed with farmers, sacks of rice and live chickens and took a bumpy 10-mile ride higher into the hills. The driver pulled up at a steep footpath beside the road and pointed me towards Batad, my next stop. It was a two-hour walk to the top of the hill. Below, a patchwork of terraces stretched over the valley floor and up the sides of the surrounding mountains like a huge green amphitheatre. In the middle lay Batad - two dozen Ifugao huts and one concrete house dotted around a tiny church with a rusted tin roof. Two small boys in torn shirts led me down the hill, along the tops of dry stone walls and through dusty back yards. We arrived at the concrete hut where a woman called Christina showed me to my room. It was 20 pesos a night and there were no other guests. Rice is everything there. I slept with rice fields all around and in the mornings I was woken by the sound of rice being pounded in mortars carved from tree stumps. I spent my days on Christina's terrace watching children wash clothes on the rocks while women prepared meals and their husbands crouched around bottles of tupuy, a throat-searing rice wine. In the evenings, the palm trees filled with fireflies. After dinner, Christina's 10-year-old daughter and her friend would sing tribal songs and dance in the glow of a kerosene lamp. Spanish missionaries converted the Ifugao to Catholicism and on Sundays the families went to church and sang haunting hymns that could be heard across the valley. But these people still practise head-hunting. Although their ancient disputes with neighbouring villages have long been resolved, decapitation is still considered a legitimate way of righting a wrong. In 1977, a bus driver who ran over and killed a child was seized and summarily executed. Head-hunting is not the only tradition that has survived in Batad. The villagers still worship Bulul, a rice god, and nail the skulls of slaughtered pigs to the walls of their huts to ward off evil spirits. There were some parts of the soul that not even the conquistadors could reach.</p>

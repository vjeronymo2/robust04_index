			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CALCAVECCHIA'S VICTORY LEADS U.S. IN DUNHILL  </P> <P> Mark Calcavecchia won the only match that mattered Sunday, lifting the United  States to a 3 1/2-2 1/2 victory over Japan in the final round of the Dunhill  Cup at St. Andrews, Scotland.  </P> <P> Calcavecchia, in the first pairing of the afternoon matches, built a  four-stroke lead after three holes and went on to a seven-shot triumph, his  second victory of the day against overmatched Hajime Meshiai.  </P> <P> That gave the United States an insurmountable 3 1/2- 1/2 lead and secured the  Americans' first title in the five-year history of this medal-match play event.  </P> <P> Calcavecchia, the British Open champion, had 12 birdies and an eagle in his 36  holes over the Old Course and played those two rounds in 133, 11 under par.  </P> <P> He beat Meshiai, 67-68, in the morning matches, then scored six birdies on the  front nine in the afternoon and matched the best round of the tournament in a  66-73 rout.  </P> <P> Calcavecchia's winning match was set up by Tom Kite's rally for a critical  half-point in the morning half of the 36-hole final.  </P> <P> Kite was two shots back with three holes to play against Naomichi Ozaki before  he rallied.  </P> <P> Kite hit a wedge to four feet for a birdie on the 16th to pull within one and  flipped a sand wedge shot to four feet for the birdie that tied it on the 18th.  Kite and Ozaki each had a four-under-par 68.  </P> <P> Beth Daniel capitalized on Pat Bradley's three-putt bogey on the 17th hole for  a one-stroke victory in a $350,000 tournament at San Jose.  </P> <P> Daniel's victory, the fourth in her last six tournaments, earned her $48,750  and pushed her over the $2-million mark for her career. After going winless for  more than four years, Daniel has earned more than $500,000 in 1989.  </P> <P> Daniel, who began the day with a three-stroke lead over Bradley, shot a 73 and  finished the 54-hole tournament at 205, tying the course record set by Jan  Stephenson in 1987. Bradley shot a 71 to finish at 206. For the third  consecutive day, they played in the same threesome.  </P> <P> On the 17th hole, Daniel drove nearly out of bounds and left her approach shot  40 yards short. But while Daniel went up-and-down to save par, Bradley  three-putted from 45 feet, missing an eight-footer for par.  </P> <P> "In that situation, I hate to see anybody lose," Daniel said after her  wire-to-wire victory.  </P> <P> Bob Charles of New Zealand shot a five-under-par 67 to win the Space Coast  Senior PGA tournament at Melbourne, Fla.  </P> <P> Charles had the final day's best round at the Suntree Country Club to win his  fifth senior event of the season and $45,000.  </P> <P> His 54-hole total of 13-under 203 was six shots ahead of runner-up Butch Baird.  </P> <P> Bill Britton earned $135,000 for his first PGA tournament victory without  having to lift a club as the final round of the $750,000 Centel tournament at  Tallahassee, Fla. was rained out.  </P> <P> Britton took a four-stroke lead with a nine-under-par 63 Saturday and finished  54 holes with a 200.  </P></p>

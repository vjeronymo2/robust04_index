			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Washington speaks with one voice and sends mixed messages 'One of the things the Chinese need to understand,' said a senior US Treasury official yesterday, 'is that for the first time in years, Washington is speaking with one voice,' Nancy Dunne writes from Washington. But even with one voice, it is sending very mixed messages. On Thursday, administration officials threatened to slash China's textile quotas by more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 672m) a year in retaliation for alleged cheating on quotas, but then approved the sale of three US satellites for launch on Chinese rockets; announced that China was at last ready to open talks on its missile sales; and praised Beijing's moves to open its market. It was the textile action which made the headlines and brought threats of retaliation from Beijing. Importers say no proof has been presented - even to the Trade Representative's industry advisory group - of a transshipment problem as massive as US officials claim. Textiles negotiations are always complex and protracted. The latest have been particularly difficult because the US has been insisting on the inclusion of a specific clause against transshipment which allows for treble penalties and provides authority to inspect overseas manufacturing facilities. Sixteen countries have agreed to the measure, but nine - including India and Pakistan - have not. 'It's a tough pill that we're asking China to swallow,' said Mr Rich Brecher of the US-China Business Council. 'The US may have thought if it got China, perhaps the others would fall into line.' According to Ms Julia Hughes, vice president of government relations with Associated Merchandising Corporation, the Chinese have begun to act against transshipment and ought to be encouraged rather than criticised. Importers see numerous avenues for compromise. But the tough government line has left many in Washington perplexed over whether it is a payoff to the domestic textile industry, a display of machismo to prod China on human rights and further trade liberalisation, or a miscalculation.</p>

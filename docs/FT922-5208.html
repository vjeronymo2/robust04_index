			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Business as usual at Anglo-Yugoslavia Anglo-Yugoslavia, a Yugoslav bank operating in London, said yesterday it was carrying on with business as usual after the Bank of England and Treasury had confirmed that it was regarded as a UK resident bank, writes David Barchard. Mr Michael Cowdrey, deputy managing director, said the bank, with a balance sheet of about Pounds 70m, was subject to applying the same sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro as any other bank in the UK. This may pose some problems as Anglo-Yugoslavia is mainly owned by Serbian and Montenegrin institutions.</p>

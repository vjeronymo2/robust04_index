			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (25): Signposts in all directions - Transport Policy / Charles Batchelor finds helpful hints along the way Transport &amp; Planning by David Banister E &amp; FN Spon, Pounds 39 248 pages A new bypass cutting through attractive countryside; the time it takes get to work or to the shops by train or bus; the privatisation of British Rail. Few subjects are calculated to stir a heated debate as those relating to transport. Transport Planning does not set out to provide an answer to the questions prompted by government transport policies - or the lack of them. But in attempting to trace the evolution of transport planning and its relationship to policy decisions, it provides some helpful hints along the way. David Banister follows the development of postwar transport thinking from the days of 'predict and provide', when planners drew up road plans with the simple aim of accommodating projected traffic growth. This approach was being challenged by some forward thinking individuals in the early 1960s. But the long lead-times involved in transport projects and the mesmerising effect of the car on planners and politicians meant it took more than a decade before the change in attitudes began to work its way through. As the 1970s progressed, greater weight was given to public transport and planners began to act on the realisation that new roads not only absorbed existing demand but generated increased car use. In parallel with this came a radical shift in the approach taken by politicians towards a more deregulated environment where the market decided. Like many members of the travelling public, Banister, director of the planning and research centre at University College, London, has his doubts about the results of this change. He questions the value of bus deregulation, which has served to speed up the gradual fall in bus use, and the privatisation of British Rail. The problem for those who argue for a greater role for public transport is the overwhelming attractiveness of the car. The basis on which people plan their lives, with home often far from the place of work, and attitudes to car ownership has changed radically over the past three decades. It will be hard to persuade people back on to public transport. Yet unrestricted growth in the use of the car threatens irreparable damage to the environment. A strategic vision and a planning framework are required to allocate resources and choose priorities, Banister suggests. The problem for successive British governments is that transport policy is driven by conflicting requirements to reduce environmental damage, curb the demands of transport on budget resources and preserve freedom for the car owner. This confusion has not helped the government's attempts to involve more private capital in the building of transport infrastructure. The private sector wants low risk projects which have a short pay-back period and provide a good return. Yet most transport projects have long pay-back periods and low rates of return. They involve large capital investments at the outset and are often subject to cost overruns. The government cannot expect to withdraw completely, Banister warns. Lack of an all-embracing policy framework has not slowed the pace of transport initiatives. Recent months have seen a reduction in the motorway building programme and the announcement of new planning guidelines to curb the growth of out-of-town developments. The pace of recent change makes this a timely book.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Husayn Abu-Salih by </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given -- first  three paragraphs are AL-MUHARRIR introduction]    [Text] Sudanese Foreign Minister Husayn Abu-Salih has  stressed that he presented to the Arab League Council a detailed  memorandum on the plot concocted by some western countries aimed  at dividing Sudan and separating parts of it. He said that  Sudan is confronting these schemes with firmness and that it  possesses the power to abort them.    Asked by AL-MUHARRIR on the latest developments in the issue  of Hala'ib between Egypt and Sudan, Abu-Salih said he has met  with his Egyptian counterpart 'Amr Musa and agreed on continuing  the dialogue regarding this problem as well as on overcoming the  obstacles in bilateral relations. He added: We are working  together to establish distinguished Egyptian-Sudanese relations  because they are strategic relations. These special relations,  he added, should be an example and the cornerstone for strong  Arab relations.    The Sudanese foreign minister noted that the two countries  reached agreement to resume the meetings of the Hala'ib  committee. He said that Presidents Mubarak and al-Bashir charged  him and 'Amr Musa with discussing all aspects of bilateral  relations, reviewing the various problems, and defining ways to  tackle them. He said that Khartoum will receive the Egyptian  foreign minister soon to discuss the unresolved problems.    [AL-MUHARRIR] Have you noticed any positive response from  Cairo to overcome these differences?    [Abu-Salih] We refused to announce the contents of these  differences through the media and agreed to discuss them quietly  at the negotiating table and during the joint bilateral  meetings. We found a positive response, seriousness, and a  desire to tackle all these issues. This will be achieved  through expediting some meetings and holding talks under the  chairmanship of both ministers.    [AL-MUHARRIR] Are you optimistic over the normalization of  bilateral relations?    [Abu-Salih] Yes. We have been optimistic for a long time.  Bilateral relations only need reinforcement of confidence and  rebuilding of bridges.    [AL-MUHARRIR] What is your assessment of the current  Sudanese- Arab relations?    [Abu-Salih] I would like to stress that Sudan's main concern  is to develop and strengthen relations with the Arab brothers.  This is a firm strategy from which we will not deviate.  Proceeding from this, we support all initiatives aimed at  achieving strong and stable relations among the Arab countries.  We also work toward bypassing the current state of  fragmentation.    [AL-MUHARRIR] Once again, who is behind the plot aimed at  encroaching on the unity of Sudan, particularly in the South?    [Abu-Salih] As I said, some western countries are playing  the  Southern card in an attempt to divide Sudan. Our people,  however, supported by our Arab brothers, will foil these schemes  which are not only aimed against Sudan but against pan-Arab  security. This constitutes a threat to the entire nation. We  reject any encroachment on our sovereignty or territorial  integrity no matter what the price.    [AL-MUHARRIR] What are these foreign quarters exactly?    [Abu-Salih] America and Britain are not far from what is  happening. Many symposiums are being held in these two  countries whose main concern is the situation in southern Sudan.  They claim that the people there must be granted the right to  self- determination. We absolutely reject this because in the  South there are armed rebels who represent only the minority.  Our task is to hold dialogue with them although they do not  represent the South.</p>

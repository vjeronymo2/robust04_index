The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant's Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicant is a trust company incorporated and doing business under the laws of the State of New York.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicant meets the qualifications of section 26(a)(1) of the Act for a trustee or custodian of a unit investment trust. Applicant currently serves as trustee of various unit investment trusts sponsored or co-sponsored by, among others, Van Kampen Merritt; Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated; Nike Securities L.P.; Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.; Quest For Value; Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Inc.; and Unison Investment Trusts Ltd. and may in the future act as trustee of trusts sponsored by these and other sponsors. Under each trust indenture, and as required by the Act, applicant has responsibility for the custody of the securities held in the trust. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Various sponsors of trusts for which applicant acts as trustee have created, or have expressed an interest in creating, trusts whose investment objectives contemplate investment in securities denominated in foreign currencies and in foreign securities. Foreign securities, especially securities issued in the European market, are issued generally in bearer form. With the growth of the European securities markets, the problems with bearer instruments entailed by the necessity for presentment of certificates or coupons for payment of principal of or interest on the securities have led to the increased importance of a book-entry system to speed clearance of trades and collection of principal and interest payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Euroclear and CEDEL are the largest clearance and custody systems of internationally traded securities in the world. They were organized principally to provide a simple, economic and automated means of settling secondary market transactions in internationally traded securities regardless of the geographical location of the parties to the transaction. The branch of Morgan Guaranty in Brussels, Belgium operates Euroclear, and is subject to regulation by the New York and federal banking authorities and the Belgian Banking Commission. Belgian law governs Morgan Guaranty's liability as custodian and operator of Euroclear under the contract between Euroclear and each participating entity. CEDEL was founded as a limited company under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. CEDEL is headquartered in Luxembourg and has representative offices in London, Tokyo, New York, and Hong Kong. CEDEL operates under the supervision of the Institute Monetaire Luxembourgeois, the Luxembourg Monetary Authority, which is also the banking control authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicant believes that securities deposited in Euroclear or CEDEL are at least as effectively protected as the same securities would be if directly deposited with a foreign branch of a United States bank, or shipped to the United States for custody, for several reasons, including: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) the insurance coverage for Euroclear and CEDEL depositaries and their outstanding loss records; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) the expertise and experience of the banks holding securities for Euroclear or CEDEL; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) the efficiencies resulting from handling large quantities of the same issue; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) the excellent track records of Euroclear and CEDEL; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) the close scrutiny of Euroclear and CEDEL services resulting from the market's dependence upon (and hence concern for) these services and the oversight of the depositaries; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) the depositary agreements pursuant to which securities are held by Euroclear and CEDEL depositaries, which impose high standards of care on the depositaries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

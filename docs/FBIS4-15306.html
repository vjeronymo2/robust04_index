			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Rodrigo Fernandez report: "`Orientation Toward Russia Is </F> Economic"]    [Text] Moscow -- Yevgeniy Saburov, the new head of  government of the autonomous republic of Crimea, which forms  part of Ukraine, was born in Yalta 48 years ago and belongs to  the new batch of politicians who emerged in the final stages of  perestroyka, but even among them he is an unusual politician: A  poet, mathematician, and economist, he never belonged to the  CPSU or joined another party when the Communist monopoly ended.  An Orthodox believer, he was baptized in 1968, when to profess  Christianity openly was a challenge to the Soviet regime. In  the spring of 1991, Saburov was one of the chief ideologists and  authors of the economic program which served as a basis for  Boris Yeltsin's election program, when the latter ran as a  candidate for the Russian presidency. He then became a Russian  deputy prime minister and economy minister. Following his  victory in the Crimean presidential election, Yuriy Meshkov  offered him the premiership, which, to many people's surprise,  Saburov accepted. According to him, Crimea's love of Russia and  rejection of Ukraine has more economic than political reasons.    The economic situation in Crimea "is catastrophic," Saburov  asserts, and Ukraine's current "communist leaders" are to blame.  However, he denies that Crimea wishes to become independent and  that it is demanding a revision of borders. "That entails the  danger of bloodshed," he says. "What we do want is economic  autonomy." Despite the tensions existing between Kiev and  Simferopol, Saburov does not believe that the political  situation could deteriorate to the extent of exploding into an  armed conflict, as has happened elsewhere in the former USSR.    "The possibility of armed confrontations is slight, although  it cannot be guaranteed that they will not occur, since, as  recent history shows, man has something irrational in his  behavior. But Crimea is not the Caucasus. The Crimeans have  their eyes set on Europe, and they wish only to have a good  living standard," he explains. More than tomorrow's elections  to the local parliament and referendum, the important thing is  the elections to the Ukrainian parliament -- also tomorrow --  believes Saburov, who also hopes that "the population will vote  against the Communists."  <H5>  Agreement Impossible </H5>   "The current Ukrainian Government is acting very nervously,  does not know what it wants, and tensions arise for ridiculous  reasons," he complains. "It is completely impossible to reach  an agreement with Kiev, because it does not then carry out what  was agreed," said Saburov, who complains that Ukraine refuses to  see "the hand which Meshkov has extended to it."    The Crimeans are extremely dissatisfied with Kiev's policy,  since they see it as the cause of their problems. "The Crimean  population's living standard is very low, but the peninsula's  potential is very great. We must therefore conclude that  somebody is to blame for the current situation. The problem is  that Crimea's economy is bound to Russia. This is an objective  fact: The sales market for Crimea's output -- goods and services  -- is Russia," Saburov asserts. In the meantime, Kiev, through  tariff barriers and a shortsighted taxation policy, has cut  Crimea off from this market where it used to sell its grain, its  vegetables, its wine.... The consumers of tourist services were  also the Russians. "The whole of northern Russia used to spend  its summer vacation in Crimea."    "Therefore, Crimea's orientation toward Russia is not a  political but an economic matter," he states.    Another accusation leveled by the Crimeans against the  Ukrainian leaders is that they "are still Communists and in fact  are carrying out no reform," "Now it is usually said that  wherever the democrats have come to power, the living standard  is falling. But Ukraine's example shows that the fall in the  living standard is not a result of the democrats' actions: The  Ukrainian Government is not democratic and has carried out no  reforms, but the fall in the living standard has been  incomparably greater than in Russia," he declares.</p>

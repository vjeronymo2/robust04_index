			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: An emotive topic for international regulators - The development of capital rules for securities traders FOR an esoteric subject, the development of capital rules for securities traders raises surprisingly strong emotions. According to one investment banker in London, the international regulators who have been tackling this difficult question in recent days 'are living in cloud cuckoo land - they have no philosophical background for their ideas and no experience of running these businesses.' Another comments: 'It would simply be a disaster if they do what they are planning to do.' These bankers, who refused to be named, were reacting to the outline for a common international standard for assessing the minimum capital backing needed by securities firms, which emerged from a meeting of regulators in Switzerland this week. Though an international affair, between the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco) and the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, the meeting had a distinctly US feel. Both agencies were led by US chairmen, respectively Mr Richard Breeden, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Though little detail of the regulators' conclusions has been revealed, it is possible to piece together the two main conclusions. They apply both to banks which carry on securities business on their own balance sheets and to non-bank securities firms. The first would force many securities businesses - particularly those in the UK - to have more capital to support their equity exposures. Although no figures were published after the meeting, it is understood the banking and securities regulators reached broad agreement that securities traders should have capital equal to 8 per cent of their net positions, with a further 4 per cent of their gross positions. It is the 4 per cent requirement that raises the greatest passions in the UK, which had held out for a 2 per cent rule. Securities companies claim it fails to recognise the merits of diversification in their portfolios: they would have to provide large amounts of capital, even though modern portfolio theory suggests that is unnecessary. Little theoretical justification has been advanced to support the 8 + 4 proposal - indeed, the precise numbers adopted are likely to be more the result of what the market will bear rather than any idealised numbers. This mirrors the discussions between banking regulators which led to the 8 per cent ratio adopted in the Basle accord of 1988. The second significant conclusion from this week's meeting, concerns the ratio of subordinated debt to other capital that can be counted for regulatory purposes. Broad agreement fixed on a ratio of 2.5:1. That will help to appease securities firms, but has antagonised banking regulators: the protracted talks that brought about the earlier Basle accord had debated this issue, before finally alighting on a ratio of 1:1. Preliminary agreement on these two contentious points merely scratches the surface of what has become a deeply involved negotiation, aimed at reaching a compromise between the different interests of banks and securities companies. The list of complaints from each side is still long enough to suggest that considerable work lies ahead: Securities firms point out that the broad rules being proposed make no distinction between the different risks of different types of security. Illiquid securities, for instance, are more difficult to sell and therefore inherently riskier than liquid ones. That would make the rules a blunt instrument to apply - just as the internationally agreed rules on credit risk make little distinction between different types of loans banks take on. An international accord would not be able to allow for the many sophisticated hedging techniques used to limit market risk. These techniques are too complex, and are developed too fast, for international regulators to keep pace. For banks, the rules would relate only to trading books, not other parts of the business. The result: an in-built difference in the capital treatment of different types of lending done in the same institution. This would raise difficult questions about what should or should not be carried in a trading book. It could also lead to greater securitisation of banks' assets, as lending is switched into the trading book to take account of the more favourable capital regime. This week's agreement marked the beginning of a long process of negotiation. The immediate result will be a consultative paper on the issue. This will be the subject of intense negotiation, as each side attempts to tilt the overall impact of the proposed capital regime in its favour. These thoughts will then need to be linked to a parallel discussion underway in Brussels, aimed at producing a Capital Adequacy Directive. Pressure to reach a conclusion within the EC has eased somewhat, due to the failure to reach agreement on a 'single passport' which would have allowed investment firms to operate through branches throughout the EC. However, other planned developments in the EC will prevent the capital directive from falling off the agenda altogether: the development of a consolidated supervision directive, for instance, which would bring together the prudential regulation of all aspects of a diversified financial group's business.</p>

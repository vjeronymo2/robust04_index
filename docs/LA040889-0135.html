			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROUGHING IT;  </P> <P> BUT SUBURBIA IS SPRAWLING TO WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE  </P> <P> "Getting away from it all" is the battle cry of campers everywhere, but escape  is not always easy at some of Orange County's more popular camping areas, where  the trappings of suburbia can prove hard to shake.  </P> <P> At O'Neill Regional Park, once an isolated slice of backcountry, the view from  sites in the upper Mesa Campground now includes the suburban back yards of the  Rancho Santa Margarita development. Campers pitch tents and build fires within  a stone's throw of $300,000 homes on the other side of a chain-link fence that  is topped by strands of barbed wire.  </P> <P> Featherly Regional Park along the county's last "wild" stretch of the Santa Ana  River has been cut in half by construction of a mammoth freeway overpass, while  campers at San Clemente State Beach are more likely to be lulled to sleep by  the roar of Interstate 5 than by crashing waves.  </P> <P> But even if these parks do not provide a pure wilderness experience, they do  offer some measure of escape. More than 378,000 people camped at the county's  state parks and beaches last year (with another 117,000 at San Onofre State  Beach, just south of the San Diego County line); more than 159,000 campers used  facilities at the county's regional parks.  </P> <P> "We do provide a needed service for a lot of people here in Orange County,"  said Richard Dyer, O'Neill's supervising ranger. "There are an awful lot of  working people who can't get in the car for 4 or 5 days" to camp in such  outdoor meccas as Sequoia and Yosemite national parks.  </P> <P> "Within an hour or less, they have a camping experience," Dyer said. "They cook  outdoors; they sleep in a tent; they go for hikes."  </P> <P> The camping experience at O'Neill, however, is being diluted by the county's  continuing growth. There is no buffer between the park and new residential  development near its upper section, leading increasingly to conflicts. The park  receives complaints almost daily from neighbors over noise, smoke from  campfires and aesthetics.  </P> <P> Some residents in expensive neighborhoods simply don't like living close enough  to see people camping, Dyer said.  </P> <P> While some campers still enjoy camping on the ridge because of the sweeping  views that remain to the north and east, others increasingly object to pitching  their tents in view of the tract homes. "I don't blame them," Dyer said. "I  don't camp in areas like this."  </P> <P> Complaints from neighbors have already forced the closing of 40 sites in Mesa  Campground. Dyer fears that all camping in the upper park may have to end.  </P> <P> Below the ridgeline, the homes in Rancho Santa Margarita are out of sight, so  the park remains much as it has for years. Oaks and sycamores still spread  their leaves over campsites, hiking trails and picnic grounds, while Saddleback  towers in the distance. The Trabuco Creek Trail, which winds through the lush  vegetation on the hillside above Trabuco Creek, remains one of the best short  nature walks in the county.  </P> <P> Featherly Regional Park, likewise, has retained much of its charm in the face  of less-than-ideal conditions. But these days, fewer visitors are enjoying the  camping-only park's stands of cottonwood and sycamore, which make up a rich  riparian habitat that has dwindled to almost nothing elsewhere in the county.  </P> <P> The culprit at Featherly is a towering freeway overpass, being built to help  ease congestion on the nightmarish Riverside Freeway through Santa Ana Canyon.  The work is expected to continue through the rest of the year.  </P> <P> Many park regulars think the park is closed because of the construction. "It's  not true; we're here," said Linda McKelvie, the park's secretary. "We have a  very nice camping park."  </P> <P> Featherly Park has lost just two campsites to the project, but daytime noise  has increased somewhat, in addition to noise already generated by the nearby  freeway. But McKelvie said the park is still "a nice place to camp" and has  many new facilities.  </P> <P> The third county regional park that offers camping has problems of a different  nature. The threat of cougar attacks -- two have occurred in recent years --  has led the county to make camping at Caspers Regional Park off limits to  minors. Visitors must be 18 or older to enjoy the park's campgrounds and  wilderness trails.  </P> <P> While that is bad news for families, the wilderness preserve's 7,600 acres  offer an excellent camping opportunity for adults, with drive-in and equestrian  camping available.  </P> <P> So far, development has not encroached on the area, although there was  controversy recently over construction of a medical research facility on county  land surrounded by the park. (Despite opposition from environmentalists, a  ruling last October finally cleared the way for construction of the Nichols  Institute Reference Laboratory, a 100-acre biomedical research facility, at  this site.)  </P> <P> Elsewhere in the county backcountry, opportunities for camping at some of the  lesser-known parks have increased. Just last month, Crystal Cove State Park  north of Laguna Beach opened three new off-road environmental campgrounds, two  for hikers and one for equestrians. Chemical toilets are the only amenities at  the primitive site; users must even pack their own water. Reservations are  available through the state's Mistix reservation number: (800) 444-7275.  </P> <P> Chino Hills State Park, opened in 1984, preserves more than 10,000 acres of  hill country, encompassing parts of four counties. Chino Hills offers  opportunities for car and equestrian camping, although the sites are not within  the county. The park's main entrance is in Riverside County, from Pomona Rincon  Road off the Corona Expressway. For information, call (714) 780-6222.  </P> <P> The National Forest Service operates two of the county's most remote camping  areas in Cleveland National Forest. Bluejay, 3 miles north of Ortega Highway  near the Riverside County border, is at 3,400 feet in the chaparral country of  the Santa Ana Mountains. The nearby Falcon Group Camp has three sites. Both  seasonal campgrounds will be open May 20 through Labor Day this year.  </P> <P> This year for the first time, half of the campsites at Bluejay and all of the  Falcon sites may be reserved through the Mistix system. The rest of Bluejay's  sites will be on a first-come, first-served basis.  </P> <P> The county's state beach campgrounds are the most popular of local camping  areas and are often sold out weeks in advance in spring and summer. The nearest  beach camping facilities to the north are at Leo Carrillo State Beach south of  Oxnard.  </P> <P> Sand and sun -- not solitude -- are the big attractions at these parks, which,  in addition to local beach-lovers, draw many campers from out of town.  </P> <P> Huntington and Bolsa Chica state beaches offer "en route" camping. En route  campsites are day-use parking areas that can be used by self-contained  trailers, campers or motor homes on an overnight basis. The campsites must be  vacated by 9 a.m. after a night's stay.  </P> <P> Long-term beach camping is available at Doheny, San Clemente and San Onofre  state beaches, all of which offer tent sites and hookup sites for trailers,  campers and motor homes. Walk-in sites were eliminated this year at Doheny and  San Onofre.  </P> <P> San Clemente State Beach's bluff-top camping area has been taken off the  state's reservation system, pending a major rehabilitation of the park, with  work scheduled to begin Tuesday. The park will be open during the yearlong  project on a first-come, first-served basis, although some campsites will be  closed at various times during construction.  </P> <P> Doheny State Beach is also scheduled for rehabilitation, but a date has not yet  been set, so the park remains on the state's Mistix reservation system for the  time being. Camping at San Onofre is also on the Mistix system.  </P> <P> Campsites can be reserved up to 8 weeks in advance. Weekend dates often sell  out within a few days after availability. The competition for campsites is  expected to increase because of San Clemente's removal from the reservation  system. Camping is in designated campsites only -- no camping is allowed on the  sand.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BLUE JAY  </P> <P> Next to Long Canyon Road and 3 miles north of Ortega Highway. 51 sites,  </P> <P> seasonal, no reservations.

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Seat earnings improve 34.7% SEAT, the Spanish car manufacturer owned by Volkswagen, raised its 1991 post-tax profits by 34.7 per cent to Pta6.7bn (Dollars 65m), thanks largely to the increased export market provided by German reunification. Sales to Germany, which replaced Italy as Seat's main foreign client, rose from 57,000 units in 1990 to 105,000 last year. 'Seat successfully saw the opportunity of the new unified Germany,' said Mr Eberhard Muller, the group's finance director. Later this year, Volkswagen will switch all manufacturing of its Polo car to Seat's plant in Pamplona, where production will be increased to 1,200 units a day, double the number at the beginning of last year. Exports overall were up by 18.8 per cent to 438,000 units against an 8.4 per cent drop to 178,000 units in the domestic market. Income from sales increased by 16.8 per cent to Pta587.7bn and for the first time in Seat's history income from exports overtook the revenue earned in Spain. The Seat group doubled its investment last year to Pta120bn, Pta69bn of which was spent on a new plant near Barcelona which will enter full production, building Seat's new Toledo model, early next year.</p>

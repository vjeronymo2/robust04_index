			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Gilbert Eliott closes UK equity business Girozentrale Gilbert Eliott, the UK stockbroker owned by Girocredit Bank of Austria, yesterday bowed to the overcapacity in the London stock market and closed down its UK equity business with the loss of 25 jobs. The firm, bought by the Austrian bank in 1986, had already disposed of its fixed income business to Hoare Govett last year, though it will continue to be active in Austrian shares in London. Mr Julian Knight, managing director and one of those being made redundant, blamed the firm's demise partly on the concentration of equity business in the hands of a small group of market makers. That, and the growth of so-called 'soft commission' business, which allows investors to receive broking services at cut-price rates, meant that there was too little commission business left to make it worthwhile continuing as an agency broker, he said.</p>

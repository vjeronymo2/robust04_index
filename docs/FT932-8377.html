			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Allied-Lyons The new management installed at Allied-Lyons after its foreign exchange losses in 1991 has had plenty of time to become established, so the company should by now be starting to see the benefit in its results. But despite heavy expenditure on restructuring, trading profit remains down in every division except spirits and wine; even that has grown by a mere 2.4 per cent despite sterling's devaluation. The charitable explanation is that the recession is to blame. The nagging worry is that the revitalisation of the company is not yet complete. Retailing will not this year have to contend with the disposal of 550 pubs, while the brewing side has yet to feel the benefits of the Carlsberg-Tetley alliance. But food margins are down, and if the lack of news on Chateau Latour is anything to go by, disposals are not yielding as much as they might. Success on that front would create room for manoeuvre. Gearing at 66 per cent is not uncomfortable, but it is a constraint. Allied's assertion that it would only launch a rights issue if it had a significant acquisition in mind is also an admission that it could not easily expand without one.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Congressional Joint Committee approved the  provisional measure for the economic plan. An index to calculate  inflation in the new currency, the real, also was created. The  rapporteur read his report, the government agreed with it, and  the opposition protested.    The final report suggests 59 changes to the economic  stabilization plan but it did not touch the essential: The  minimum salary will stay as it is for the time being. In 30  days, the government will send Congress a proposal to gradually  increase the minimum salary. Salaries in URV's [real value  units] also will stay as they are for the time being. If after  four months of conversion, that is; in July, workers conclude  that they would have earned more under the former salary policy,  the government will pay for the salary losses on the base date  of collective labor contracts.    When the new currency is put into circulation, salaries will  have additional protection. The Congressional Joint Committee  report creates an index to calculate inflation in the real  currency: The IPCR [Consumer Price Index in Real]. If this index  indicates inflation in the new currency, it will be incorporated  into salaries on the base date of each labor category.    The report was approved eight votes against one, despite the  harsh reaction of the only congressman who voted against it. The  provisional measure nonetheless still must be voted on by the  Congress plenary before 28 April.    [Begin Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero recording] We  believe  this demonstrates very well that it is being understood that the  stabilization is for the benefit of the country and all the  Brazilian people.

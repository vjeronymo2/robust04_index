			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Chancellor confident of sustained recovery: Early tax cuts ruled out Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday held out the prospect of continuing economic recovery, with low inflation, falling unemployment and rising prosperity for several years ahead. Unveiling the government's latest economic forecast, which predicts slightly stronger growth and lower inflation this year and next, the chancellor said Britain faced 'quite the best combination of circumstances, pointing to sustained growth and low inflation', that he could remember 'for a very, very long time'. He told a news conference that Britain still had 'quite a bit of spare capacity' and could therefore stand a few years of growth above trend. The chancellor was careful, however, to damp any expectations of early tax cuts. Yesterday's Treasury forecast included lower-than-expected reductions in the public sector deficits envisaged by the government for the current financial year and 1995-96. In addition, Mr Clarke insisted that his priority was to deliver economic recovery and that he would only cut taxes when the public finances were under control. The half-yearly forecast was published yesterday rather than in March following discontinuation of the traditional spring revenue-raising Budget. It upgraded the government's prediction for economic growth this year to 2.75 per cent from 2.5 per cent at the time of Mr Clarke's first Budget in November. Presenting the first official view of 1995, the Treasury forecast that growth would continue at 2.75 per cent next year. At the same time, the government trimmed its forecast of underlying inflation, as measured by the retail prices index excluding mortgage interest payments, to 2.5 per cent at the end of this year from 3.25 per cent previously, and forecast inflation of 2.75 per cent by the end of 1995. The Treasury's growth forecasts were slightly more cautious than the 2.8 per cent growth for 1994 and 1995 suggested by the most recent consensus of independent forecasters. But the government was more optimistic about inflation than private sector economists. The City consensus is for underlying inflation to average 2.7 per cent at the end of this year and 3.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of next year. The City also found itself at odds with the government's cautious downward revisions of Pounds 2bn in its forecasts for the public sector borrowing requirement in the current financial year and 1995-96. Gilts ended lower, with the September long gilt future losing about a third of a point, after the Treasury forecast a 1994-95 PSBR of Pounds 36bn against Pounds 38bn previously and trimmed its projection of the 1995-96 PSBR by Pounds 2bn to Pounds 28bn. Mr Clarke said the forecasts were a policy guide and that he had 'no intention of being dominated by them . . . I do not believe we should look at them as if every figure is bound to be accurate and a spot forecast of where we will be in 12 months' time'. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, accused Mr Clarke of being complacent about both the short-term and long-term future of the UK. The FT-SE 100 Index reacted positively to the Treasury forecasts but finished the day just 9.1 points up at 2,909.

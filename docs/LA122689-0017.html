			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TRANSIT UPDATE;  </P> <P> DECISION TIME: THE FATE AND SCOPE OF A RAIL LINE IN THE VALLEY PROBABLY WILL BE  DECIDED IN MARCH.  </P> <P> After more than three years of seemingly endless debate over where and what  kind of mass transit line to build in the San Fernando Valley, the time for  decision is almost at hand.  </P> <P> Recently, the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission released a  voluminous report on alternative rail systems for the Valley.  </P> <P> The commission, which is building a regional network of rail lines using the  extra half-cent sales tax that voters approved in 1980, plans to use a  $2.1-million Environmental Impact Report as the basis for selecting a route,  probably in March.  </P> <P> Throughout the long-running debate, business leaders have argued that an  east-west line is essential to keep the Valley from bogging down in congestion  as the Ventura Freeway and other cross-Valley arteries stagger under  ever-increasing traffic.  </P> <P> Well-organized homeowner group leaders agree that congestion relief is needed,  but they contend that no rail line can be allowed to disturb the Valley's many  single-family neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Most homeowner group leaders want a cross-Valley subway with no stations in  residential areas.  </P> <P> Business leaders contend that such a system would be too costly and that  insisting on a subway at all costs would jettison the Valley's chances for  getting any rail line.  </P> <P> Last summer, the fighting ebbed dramatically with the emergence of a plan to  put aside for now any hope of a cross-Valley line.  </P> <P> Instead, available funds would be used to extend the downtown to North  Hollywood Metro Rail subway west to the Sepulveda Basin. From there, commuters  bound for the West Valley would transfer to express buses.  </P> <P> The plan, drafted by state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) and Los Angeles City  Councilman Marvin Braude, has drawn widespread support and is expected to be  given strong consideration by the commission. It also was examined in the  recently released report.  </P> <P> * The Basics: Some questions and answers on rail systems.  </P> <P> Q. What San Fernando Valley routes were studied?  </P> <P> A. The report examined 10 variations on two basic routes. They are the Southern  Pacific railroad freight right-of-way that crosses the Valley from North  Hollywood to Warner Center parallel to Chandler and Victory boulevards, and the  Ventura Freeway shoulder from Universal City to Warner Center. Along both  routes, the commission studied the possibility of stopping the line for now in  the Sepulveda Basin.  </P> <P> Q. Besides selecting a route, will the commission make any other decisions  affecting the Valley?  </P> <P> A. Commissioners also will have to decide if the line should be a subway, in a  shallow or deep trench, at ground level or elevated. Since tunneling costs more  than $100 million per mile, the answer to that question will go a long way to  determining the cost of the Valley system. The commission also will decide if  the line should use light-rail technology similar to that used in the nearly  completed Long Beach-Los Angeles line or heavy rail equipment like that of the  under-construction Metro Rail subway.  </P> <P> Q. What is the difference between heavy and light rail?  </P> <P> A. Both use the same size track, but heavy-rail systems, such as Metro Rail,  use trains of six to nine cars, while light-rail trains seldom exceed three  cars. Heavy rail's greater length sharply increases its carrying capacity. But  it also means that heavy-rail stations must be correspondingly long and  expensive. In addition, heavy-rail systems get their power from an electrified  third rail, which means they must be completely separated from pedestrians and  vehicles. Most light-rail lines get their power from an overhead electric line,  which means they are cheaper to build and can travel on city streets. Rail  experts say that the type of equipment is less important in terms of cost than  is the question of whether the line is tunneled or ground level.  </P> <P> Q. Is the Valley guaranteed a rail line?  </P> <P> A. Not at all. The County Transportation Commission, which has the final say on  which routes get built, has two other proposed lines studied and ready to go  and is scheduled to decide in March which to build. Rival routes are from  downtown Los Angeles to Pasadena and from El Segundo north past Los Angeles  International Airport to Marina del Rey. The Westside line would be an  extension of the Century Freeway light-rail line that eventually will be  extended north to Sylmar along the San Diego Freeway corridor. Commissioners  acknowledge privately, however, that the Valley has the political clout to get  the next rail line provided there is a consensus among local leaders on a  preferred route.  </P> <P> Q. Is there enough money available right now to build a Valley rail line?  </P> <P> A. Not to build the kind of system that would avoid vocal opposition. The  commission found that the cost for the 10 Valley rail alternatives ranged from  $500 million for a ground-level light-rail line between North Hollywood and the  Sepulveda Basin to $3.5 billion for a subway from Universal City to Warner  Center. The Robbins-Braude plan would cost $1.3 billion, according to the  commission's report. The commission, which has not projected spending beyond  2000, expects to have between $600 million and $800 million available during  the 1990s that is not already committed to the three lines under construction  -- Metro Rail and the Long Beach and Century Freeway light-rail lines. Thus,  almost any Valley rail alternative is not likely to be completed until well  after 2000.  </P> <P> Q. Is there a possibility of more rail-building money in the 1990s?  </P> <P> A. Yes. County transit officials might place another half-cent sales tax before  the voters. If passed by a majority of those voting, such a measure could  double or even quadruple -- to possibly $500 million a year -- the money  available to build rail lines. Bond measures also have been proposed as a means  of generating more rail-building funds.  </P> <P> Q. What role does the Los Angeles City Council play in route selection?  </P> <P> A. Officially, it has no role. But transit planners say that they would be  loath to approve any project that is opposed by the council. One year ago, the  council endorsed both routes that were studied in the newly released  Environmental Impact Report, leaving it up to the commission to make the final  selection.  </P> <P> Q. Why has the Southern Pacific Coast Line been dropped from consideration?  </P> <P> A. The coast line, which crosses the Valley diagonally from Burbank Airport to  Chatsworth, seemed to be everyone's second choice for a cross-Valley mass  transit route, but it had no strong proponents. Eventually, it was dropped when  rail planners determined that it would be a good candidate for a commuter rail  line. It is under study for such a line.  </P> <P> Q. What is commuter rail?  </P> <P> A. Unlike heavy- and light-rail lines, which require their own tracks, commuter  lines are merely traditional-style passenger cars pulled by a traditional  railroad engine. Because commuter trains are relatively slow and stations  usually are far apart, carrying capacity is much less than heavy- and  light-rail lines. On the other hand, the cost of starting up a commuter rail  line is a fraction of light rail's cost. Commuter rail is being studied between  Oxnard and downtown Los Angeles along the coastline, which would make at least  four stops in the Valley in addition to Simi Valley, Moorpark and Camarillo.  </P></p>

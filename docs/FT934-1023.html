			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (17): Strong domestic base - Pharmaceuticals Sweden's cluster of large pharmaceutical companies remains one of the most promising of its industrial sectors for future expansion on global markets. The country's advanced technology base of research and development with an emphasis on high quality and ethical standards provides a strong domestic base for growth. Astra and the 'new' Pharmacia are the country's two most highly regarded pharmaceutical companies and with their differing interests and strategies they look likely to thrive during the 1990s. Astra has enjoyed almost unbroken success in recent years and there is no good reason to believe its fortunes are about to wane. Through the prolonged Nordic gloom of the current recession, the company has often been the toast of both the stock market and its own shareholders. Mr Hakan Mogren, the company's president, told a meeting of London analysts last month that although this year's sales figures would be affected by the weakened Swedish krona, the company was expecting a 20 per cent growth in real terms. 'We continue to rank among the fastest-growing pharmaceutical companies in the world market', he added. In the first nine months of the year, Astra enjoyed a 43 per cent increase in sales - up to SKr16.07bn from SKr11.21bn for the same period of 1992. Its net earnings shot up by 86 per cent to SKr4.1bn from SKr2.24bn while earnings per share grew by a similar per cent to Skr6.79 from Skr3.66. Unlike many of its global competitors, Mr Mogren claimed, Astra is going to be able to avoid cuts in personnel and downward pressure on its prices. 'We have good prospects for attaining strong volume growth based on innovative products and continuing geographical extension of our operations', he said. The company's success is based on its three core product areas - gastrointestinal, respiratory and cardiovascular. A third of Astra's sales in the first nine months of this year came from the success of Losec, its anti-peptic ulcer agent, which enjoyed total sales amounting to SKr9.1bn. The drug was launched only two years ago but it has made impressive strides on world markets, particularly in Europe where it accounts for a third of sales. The company's anti-asthma agent Pulmicort increased its sales by 54 per cent in the first nine months to SKr2.08bn, mainly due to a favourable growth in sales of its Turbohaler, especially in Spain, France and Italy. Sales of both Plendil, an anti-hypertensive agent, and Seloken, a beta blocker, have also proved satisfactory. Astra hopes to see substantial future growth in the all-important Japanese and US markets for its core products. By contrast, the 'new' Pharmacia - which hopes to emerge from state ownership next spring into a fully-fledged private pharmaceutical and biotechnology company with Volvo as its largest shareholder - has gone through a confusing period of corporate restructuring over the past three years. Over the first nine months of this year the company - as part of Procordia - made a profit, after financial items, of SKr2.475bn. It ranks among Europe's top 10 pharmaceutical concerns, with 20,000 employees. Pharmacia is now Italy's second-largest company in pharmaceuticals since its Dollars 1.5bn acquisition earlier this year of Erbamont, the Montedison health care subsidiary of the Italian Feruzzi group with 4 per cent of the market. Pharmacia's wider range of products are focused on niches across global health care markets which include growth hormone treatment, ophthalmic surgery, nutrition and drug delivery, allergy diagnostics, anti-smoking drugs, prevention and treatment of blood clots and drugs to prevent diseases of the central nervous system. 'We are striving now for stability despite the uncertainties about the market,' says Mr Gilles Pajot, head of the company's corporate business management. 'Not only are we one of the leading European companies in hospital care products but we have a strong base in bio-technology know-how.' Pharmacia's short-term strategy is to defend its existing market positions, grow more in selective areas and rationalise its portfolio. 'After 1996, we have to grow at least as fast as the market', he adds. 'But we are laying the foundations for the future.'</p>

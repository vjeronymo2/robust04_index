			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / A third of employers 'insist on overtime' ONE THIRD of companies insist employees work overtime, according to a survey published by Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay research company. But more than half the companies in the study said they had recently introduced measures to restrict overtime, including shift work, extra staff and tighter management control. Only five of the 65 companies in the survey, however, set limits on the amount of overtime worked by an employee. According to the survey, St Regis Paper said it restricted overtime in one week to 28 hours, while Scottish Amicable Life Assurance said its limit was 24 hours an employee per month. Five out of six companies reported levels of overtime 'currently the same or lower than last year'. The survey found the median overtime worked was four hours a week. Few companies have altered their methods of calculating overtime pay in the past five years. The most common rate for overtime pay is time and a half on weekdays and Saturday, double time on Sunday and double time plus time off on public holidays. The rate is calculated as a fraction of a worker's normal hourly rate and then added to the hourly rate. Overtime pay remains predominantly a blue-collar worker phenomenon. A third of respondents said overtime entitlements stopped at supervisory level. London Underground, Woolwich building society and John Brown Engineering said overtime working extended to some of their middle management.

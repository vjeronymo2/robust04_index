			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: AIDS-LIKE VIRUS FOUND IN CHIMPS  </P> <P> Scientists have found two chimpanzees infected with a virus very similar to the  human AIDS virus, providing the most valuable clue yet in the search for the  mysterious origin of the deadly disease. French researchers said they detected  a virus resembling the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV in two wild, baby  chimpanzees captured in Gabon, an African nation that straddles the Equator.  </P> <P> Since the AIDS epidemic first surfaced in 1981, scientists have been puzzled by  the origin of the deadly AIDS viruses. The new virus may prove to be a "missing  link" between AIDS-like primate viruses and those that infect humans, a U.S.  researcher said.  </P> <P> The virus found in the Gabon chimps, which researchers suggest naming  chimpanzee immunodeficiency virus or CIV, varies too much to simply be  considered a strain of HIV-1, Simon Wain-Hobson of the Pasteur Institute and  his colleagues reported in the journal Nature.  </P></p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Lasmo hits out at Enterprise accounting The battle for control of Lasmo shifted gear yesterday as the UK oil explorer accused its rival and predator, Enterprise Oil, of flattering profits with unacceptable accounting practices. Mr Rudolf Agnew, Lasmo chairman, alleged in a letter to shareholders that Enterprise Oil had breached UK accounting practices in its treatment of acquisitions. He claimed earnings would benefit by Pounds 650m. He questioned the value of Enterprise's Pounds 1.4bn all-paper bid in light of the accounting practices. Lasmo's document alleges that Enterprise's accounting methods are out of step with the oil and gas industry and cast doubt on the viability of the dividend. It states that Enterprise's practice of writing off substantial sums on acquisitions results in a lower depreciation charge and thus higher profits. The write-offs cannot be attributable to goodwill, since this does not arise on oil and gas assets. 'Both UK and US accounting standards require asset purchases of this type to be recorded at the prices paid,' the company said. Yet the adjustments were revealed only in US documents reconciling UK to US earnings. 'They have attacked us for openly and publicly writing off Pounds 500m whereas they have secretly written off Pounds 600m,' Mr Agnew said. Enterprise counter-attacked by noting that Lasmo had been one of its shareholders at the time of two deals. Mr Julian West, head of corporate development, said they had discussed the accounting treatment and 'they were happy to book the Enterprise profits'. Mr West accused Lasmo of pursuing 'an Arabian nights defence of a succession of tall stories'. Enterprise also rejected Lasmo's charge that it was over-distributing uncovered dividends. 'We have never borrowed to pay the dividend, exploration or overheads,' he said. Analysts said the attack on the profit and loss account had been over-played. 'It is really the balance sheet and cash flow which are important to exploration and production companies,' said Mr Howard Cattermole, of Strauss Turnbull. None believed that Enterprise or accountants KPMG Peat Marwick would deliberately breach accounting standards. Accounting issues, Page 29</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LAUGHING THROUGH THE PAIN OF AIDS  </P> <P> When Susan Oglesby learned that her husband, Steven, had AIDS, she found  herself dealing with the trauma through humor. She'd laugh at the doctors and  the government and the stupid things people said to Steven.  </P> <P> So when AIDS Project Los Angeles offered a stand-up comedy workshop, Oglesby  decided to attend. She and Steven worked on material together at home.  </P> <P> "For my act, I didn't have to make things up," Oglesby said. "I just talked  about things that happened."  </P> <P> In class, speaking to the microphone stand as if it were her thin and ailing  husband, she did an impression of visiting friends: "Oh, you look so-o-o  great."  </P> <P> On Monday night, Oglesby and 15 other new-found comedians will take the stage  at L.A. Cabaret Comedy Club in Encino. All of the stand-up students performing  in this showcase have been affected by AIDS: they are people with the disease,  friends, family or APLA staff and volunteers.  </P> <P> "It's a terrific mixture of comedy and poignancy," said Judy Carter, a  professional comedian who taught the workshop. "These people are getting their  revenge through humor."  </P> <P> One student, who is blind and Jewish, begins his monologue: "I know what you're  thinking . . . another blind Orthodox Jewish gay with AIDS comic."  </P> <P> Another recounts visiting his mother at Christmas and revealing that he is gay  and has AIDS. The next thing, he tells the audience, she has wrapped everything  in the house in vinyl. Friends come over to admire his gifts and inquire about  his will.  </P> <P> "It's all about their lives," Carter said.  </P> <P> Carter agreed to teach the seven-week class at the suggestion of a friend who  is an APLA volunteer. The comedian -- who works the stand-up circuit and has  opened for such rock 'n' roll acts as Kenny Loggins and Prince -- has been  teaching comedy for years, but approached this workshop as an entirely new  experience.  </P> <P> "I was absolutely petrified because one of the rules of comedy is, 'Don't talk  about cancer and don't talk about AIDS,' " she said. "I thought, 'How can we  take one of the biggest tragedies of the 20th Century and convert it to humor?'  "  </P> <P> The students, too, were shy about the subject matter.  </P> <P> "At first they were doing stuff about being tall or shopping at K mart," Carter  said. "After the third week, I got mad and told them 'You've got to talk about  AIDS.' "  </P> <P> The result was a comedy-writing support group. There were tears mixed with  laughs, jokes with words of sympathy.  </P> <P> "In clinical terms, we would call it a cathartic experience," said Carl Lukes,  who is APLA's community mental health specialist. "If we really sat down and  thought about the horror of AIDS, it would be too much for most of us to deal  with. You need an outlet. . . . Comedy or creative avenues are a good way to  deal with the emotions."  </P> <P> In class, the students ran through exercises: Carter would ask them to recite  lists of things they liked or hated. She'd give them a topic and have them  stand in front of class and talk, ramble.  </P> <P> From such train of thought and free association, jokes were born.  </P> <P> "I thought, 'Oh, it's going to be fun,' " said a student with AIDS who asked  not to be identified. "But I wrestled with it. Judy teaches you to draw on the  difficulty and pain in your life."  </P> <P> So he told jokes about the endless doctors appointments and medical tests: "I  don't have time to have a life-threatening illness." He talked about  co-workers: "All the ladies in my office think it's so wonderful that I can eat  so much and stay so thin."  </P> <P> Amid the laughter, though, a harsh reality hit home several weeks ago when  Steven Oglesby died.  </P> <P> "I kept on going to class," Susan Oglesby said. "It was a place where I was  understood."  </P> <P> Other class members offered support and said they took inspiration from  Oglesby. She turned her routine into a tribute.  </P> <P> "Now half of my act is about the cremation process," she said, "which is not a  knee-slapper, but there are some things about it that were so ridiculous that  you have to laugh."  </P> <P> She is looking forward to Monday night's performance, the proceeds from which  will benefit APLA.  </P> <P> "If you don't find the humor in these things," she said, "you go insane."  </P> <P>  LA Cabaret Comedy Club is at 17271 Ventura Blvd., Encino. The show begins at 8  p.m. Admission is $10 with a two-drink minimum. For information, call 501-3737.  </P> <P> </P></p>

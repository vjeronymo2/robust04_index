			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Historically, the Nile crocodile ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Crocodylus niloticus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) was widespread throughout Africa and Middle East as far north as Syria. Presently, it is confined chiefly to the upstream regions of the Nile River, tropical and southern Africa, and Madagascar. The Nile crocodile was listed as endangered in 1970 (35 FR 8495) and on Appendix I of the CITES in 1975 (when CITES came into force) because of the widespread decline of the species. Since that time, a number of African countries have recognized the value of the Nile crocodile for its ecological role and as a source of sustainable economic benefit under proper management, especially through ranching for a controlled harvest of skins. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the countries that have started ranching operations, Zimbabwe appears to have the best information on wild crocodile populations. Improvements in the status of Nile crocodile populations and their management have prompted the CITES Parties to transfer 11 national populations to Appendix II, allowing commercial trade either under provisions of the ranching resolutions Conf. 3.15 and 8.22 or subject to export quotas established by agreement of the Parties as per resolutions Conf. 5.21, 6.17, and 7.14. Populations in Botswana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe have been transferred to Appendix II based on ranching provisions, while populations in Madagascar, South Africa, and Uganda are permitted under CITES approved export quotas. However, commercial trade is not allowed from the remaining Nile crocodile range countries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the August 3, 1992,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 34095), the Service proposed reclassifying the Nile crocodile from endangered to threatened status with a special rule allowing for commercial importation of skins and finished products thereof. Two organizations, the IUCN Crocodile Specialist Group, and SAVE African Endangered Wildlife Foundation supported the reclassification of the Nile crocodile from endangered to threatened. The ANPWS, the Crocodile Farmers Association of Zimbabwe (CFAZ) and TRAFFIC USA also supported the reclassification but expressed concern about a provision of the proposed special rule. Therefore, the Service proceeded to downlist the Nile crocodile to threatened status on September 23, 1993, (58 FR 49870) but without any change in the special rule, which presently applies only to Zimbabwe. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. Comments Received on Proposed Special Rule With Nile Crocodile Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ANPWS, CFAZ, and TRAFFIC USA especially objected to the proposed paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C) of &sect;17.42 that would require crocodile skin products to either be tagged or to be accompanied by CITES documents containing the same information as is on the tags for the crocodiles from which the manufactured products were obtained. ANPWS stated that the control of skins removes the need to require every manufactured product to be marked, and also indicated that since Australian skins used in product production in Australia are not tagged it would not be possible to record the tag numbers of these products on the CITES permits. CFAZ raised the same concerns as ANPWS. It also expressed the concern that the requirements of this paragraph were unenforceable and urged that it be deleted. TRAFFIC USA also supported the reclassification but expressed the belief that proposed paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C) is impractical and unenforceable. It noted that ``because of the complexities of the crocodilian product manufacturing industry, and the regular movement of skins, skin parts, and product parts between manufacturers, this requirement. .&blank;.&blank;. will be impossible to meet.'' Furthermore, TRAFFIC USA expressed support for establishing ``a water-tight system of controlling trade in the raw material.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service recognizes the concerns presented by ANPWS, CFAZ, and TRAFFIC USA, and agrees with TRAFFIC USA in seeking to strengthen the control in the trade in whole and partial skins. Therefore, the Service is proposing in this notice a revised special rule that would replace the present &sect;17.42(c) and that is significantly different from the proposed special rule accompanying the proposed rule to reclassify the Nile crocodile. The presently proposed special rule removes the requirement to keep track of each CITES crocodilian skin tag number through the product manufacturing process and to record the CITES tag numbers on the export permits issued for crocodilian products, but adds provisions designed to supplement the provisions of the universal tagging system being implemented by the CITES Parties. A discussion of the special rule and of the CITES tagging resolution is presented in a later paragraph on ``Description of Proposed Special Rule.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> C. Available Conservation Measures for Nile and Saltwater Crocodiles <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation measures provided to foreign species listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA include recognition, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices. Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by governments, private agencies and groups, and individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7(a) of the ESA, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions that are to be conducted within the United States or on the high seas, with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the ESA are codified at 50 CFR part 402. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

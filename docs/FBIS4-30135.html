			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "No Need to Overreact to Dollar Depreciation"] </F>   [Text] The yen exchange rate made a dramatic drop to below  100 yen to a dollar for a time. However, what is happening now  is an overall drop in the value of the dollar against all major  currencies, rather than an appreciation of the yen.    Compared to 4 May, when more than 10 central banks of the  advanced nations engaged in coordinated intervention in the  foreign exchange market, the situation is somewhat different.    First, the monetary authorities of the major powers did not  engage in coordinated intervention in the exchange market on 21  June. The fact that the Bank of Japan [BOJ] went into vigorous  dollar buying in the Tokyo market the next day, 22 June,  indicates that Japan apparently wants to have coordinated  intevention.    The reason why this did not materialize could be either  problems about the effectiveness or technicalities of  intervention, or the monetary authorities of the United States  and Europe could not reach a consensus.    Second, the economic condition in Europe has improved  considerably, and Japan is seeing signs of an economic recovery.  Such circumstances may have affected policy coordination among  Japan, the United States, and Europe.    What triggered off the Black Monday (stock prices crash) in  October 1987 was the conflict of interests between the monetary  authorities of the United States and (then) West Germany.  Coordination among the advanced nations is indispensable for the  stability of the currencies. This historical lesson should be  recalled at this time.    On the contrary, it is possible that the U.S. monetary  authorities may ask Japan to lower its official discount rate in  the name of policy coordination to defend the dollar and stop  yen appreciation.    Behind the massive selling of the dollar are apprehensions  about inflation, as well as the relatively low interest rates in  the United States. There is a strong possibility that the U.S.  Federal Reserve Board (FRB) may raise the official discount rate  to defend the dollar, and Japan will be called upon to cut  interest rates together with the United States. This would be a  pattern identical to that during the coordinated lowering of  interest rates in March 1986.    What we want the Ministry of Finance and the BOJ to do is to  be very careful about coordinated lowering of interest rates.  We must not allow a repeat of the bubble economy. A mistaken  policy option in the name of coordination with the United States  is unacceptable.    In that sense, there is no need to overly fear the  depreciation of the dollar and appreciation of the yen. There  has been a sharp rise [as published] in crude oil prices, which  are quoted in dollars, as a result of dollar depreciation.  Concerns about imported inflation in the future cannot be  totally discounted.    In such a case, yen appreciation serves to shut off imported  inflation. There should be further efforts to narrow the gap  between domestic and overseas prices to pursue benefits arising  from yen appreciation.    On the other hand, there is an opinion that since the real  interest rates in Japan are still relatively high, there is  still room for further lowering of the official discount rate.    In the decisionmaking process, the most important thing is  to  accurately gauge the economic conditions in Japan and the United  States. Compared to last year, when Japan was weakened by the  damage of yen appreciation, present Japanese economic condition  has more vitality. However, in terms of the prevailing economic  conditions, it is too early to lower the official discount rate.    Is the U.S. economic condition really sturdy? We see partly  cloudy skies. If the perception of the Japanese and U.S.  economies changes, there will be correponding changes in the  exchange rates.    Exchange rates will probably be a major issue at the Naples  summit (meeting of leaders of advanced nations) to be held in  Italy in July. Along with efforts to reduce current accounts  surplus by expanding domestic demand and opening up the market,  Japan may be asked to lower interest rates.    The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks have resumed, but it  remains uncertain whether an acceptable conclusion can be  reached before the summit. The United States remains  discontented with Japan's tax reform. However, monetary policy  should never be used as a tool of compromise.</p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Trump Deadline Passes: Donald Trump's Thursday midnight deadline to make a  $47.3-million interest payment passed with no word on whether he was able to  work out a deal with bondholders who invested in his Taj Mahal casino.  </P> <P> Bondholders' representatives have threatened a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing for  Atlantic City's biggest casino as early as today. At press time, there were no  signs whether the developer and the holders of $675 million in junk bonds were  near an agreement to restructure the debt. The Trump Organization was saying  very little. Telephones at Trump's New York headquarters went unanswered late  Thursday.  </P></p>

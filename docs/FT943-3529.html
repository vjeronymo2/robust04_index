			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Iliescu calls for consensus President Ion Iliescu of Romania yesterday urged the government and opposition to co-operate more closely and form a consensus on key areas of economic reform such as privatisation. In a state of the nation speech to parliament, the president said Romania's international standing had improved markedly in the past two years but parliament needed to become more efficient and to provide foreign investors with further legal guarantees. Several laws necessary for Romania's successful transition to a market economy, such as bankruptcy and competition laws, are held up in a backlog of legislation at the country's hung parliament, which is dominated by nationalist and ex-communist parties supporting the president. Mr Iliescu said the opposition, which controls 47 per cent of parliament, also bore responsibility for leading the country forward. However, chances of an agreement between the left-wing government and centre-right opposition parties lessened last month following the inclusion of the country's leading ultra-nationalist party in the cabinet.</p>

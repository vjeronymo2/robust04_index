			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The U.S. Border Patrol on Tuesday seized 1,100 pounds of marijuana that had  apparently been backpacked into San Diego from Mexico in 10 large duffel bags  that were found stashed in heavy brush, authorities said.  </P> <P> It is the second seizure of a so-called "mule train" load of marijuana  recently.  </P> <P> U.S. immigration officials say the practice of ferrying in loads of illicit  substances via the many border paths is on the increase.  </P> <P> On May 28, agents discovered 1,310 pounds of marijuana in the bed of a pickup  abandoned near Monument Road, in a thinly populated area to the west of the  port of entry at San Ysidro. Tuesday's seizure took place in about the same  area, which has long been a favored route for border-jumpers and is  crisscrossed with their trails.  </P> <P> At about noon Tuesday, a Border Patrol agent approached two people on a trail  commonly used by undocumented immigrants, according to the agency. One of the  two drew a revolver from his waistband and both fled into the heavy brush near  the Tijuana River, authorities said. Neither was apprehended. No shots were  fired.  </P> <P> The agent followed the two and discovered 10 large duffel bags concealed in the  brush, authorities said. The bags held smaller, marijuana-filled containers  similar to those seized on May 28, authorities said. Authorities said they  suspect that the substances were to be picked up by a smuggling vehicle.  </P></p>

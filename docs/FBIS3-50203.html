The agreement was signed  by Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Kocarnik (chairman of the  tripartite), Vaclav Vanek, deputy chairman of the Czech and  Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions (CMKOS), Jan Fencl,  representative of employers, and Antonin Foldyna, chairman of  the Confederation of Arts and Culture. Kocarnik called the  General Agreement balanced and a good basis for further work of  the tripartite. He said that it slightly differed from that  signed for last year which was caused by a certain shift of the  tripartite towards general activities. The essential aims of  the agreement remained preserved, Kocarnik stated.    The agreement aims at preserving social peace in the period  of transition from the central-command economy to a market  system. Vanek said that no agreement can substitute for the  will to observe it. He noted that the current general agreement  was the fourth signed since the fall of the communist regime in  Czechoslovakia in late 1989. Fencl said the signing of the  agreement sealed the fact that all the three partners would stay  behind the negotiating table in 1994 and would jointly search  for settling problems in the economic and social spheres.    The signing was preceded by a series of talks. The Thursday  talks resolved the last disputed point which concerned the  extension of the collective agreements of higher degree. It was  established that these agreements would be discussed by the  tripartite commission to which the trade unions and employees  would be able to turn. All the three parties to the general  agreement confirmed that the employers' possible disagreement  with the extension of the agreement would not be sufficient to  prevent it from being extended.</p>

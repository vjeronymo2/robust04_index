			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRANIAN PURCHASES OF CHEMICALS FOR POISON GAS TOLD  </P> <P> Iran stockpiled chemicals used to make poison gas through secret purchases from  West German, Greek, U.S. and Singapore firms, the New York Times, quoting U.S.  officials and court records, reported in today's editions.  </P> <P> The illegal purchases began during the last months of the Iran-Iraq War,  according to the newspaper, and continued despite the cease-fire agreed to last  August.  </P> <P> Although U.S. officials said Washington is concerned by Iran's production of  poison gas, the Reagan Administration was more vocal in its criticism of Libya,  which it said has established a chemical weapons plant with the aid of West  German companies.  </P> <P> "The Libyan program got attention because it was new and because it involved  (Libyan leader Moammar) Kadafi," the Times quoted a senior U.S. official as  saying.  </P> <P> "Iran's program has been going on for quite some time, and we're trying to slow  it down by putting pressure, behind the scenes, on suppliers of chemicals."  </P> <P> Iran's secret purchases were channeled through its Bonn embassy, the report  said, and came to light through a U.S. Customs Service investigation of an  Iranian diplomat in West Germany.  </P></p>

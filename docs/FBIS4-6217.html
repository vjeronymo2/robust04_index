			<p>BFN     [Text] Army Commander-in-Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit was  guarded yesterday in his reaction to Phnom Penh's warning it  would attack Khmer Rouge tanks found on Thai soil, saying only  that the military was responsible for safety and security along  the border.    Wimon refused to make any comment about exactly how the Army  would respond to any possible encroachment on Thai territory by  Phnom Penh forces.    He repeated Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri's comment on  Friday that the allegations by Cambodian leaders that the Khmer  Rouge was operating from Thai soil were groundless.    Cambodian Co-Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh last  week alleged Khmer Rouge tanks had fired from inside Thailand at  Phnom Penh government forces in Pailin.    On Thursday the Prince warned that his forces might attack  the Khmer Rouge tanks even if they were on Thai territory and  that he was losing patience over what he called Thailand's  continued failure to crack down on Khmer Rouge forces.    "If you say they are not on your territory, please don't  make  any protest if we violate your territory. We don't intend to do  that," he reportedly said.    The Khmer Rouge are universally held responsible for the  deaths of more than one million Cambodians during the Pol Pot  reign of terror from 1974 to 1979.    Wimon on Friday met Foreign Minister Prasong, Interior  Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut, Defence Minister Wichit  Sukmak and senior military officials to discuss the charges.    Meanwhile, Army spokesman Col Phalangkun Klahan insisted  that  Thailand has never allowed any foreign troops onto its territory  and that Prince Norodom's allegation was unfounded and unfair to  Thailand.    He also said the Army has not been involved in Cambodia's  internal affairs or provided assistance to the Maoist faction  since the signing of the Paris Peace Accord in August 1991.    "Cambodia should think of its relationship with Thailand  before making accusations of this sort," he said.    Phalangkun also said the Army would give an abrupt and harsh  response if Cambodian forces are found on Thai soil.</p>

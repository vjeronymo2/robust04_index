			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ingersoll-Rand in German buy INGERSOLL-RAND, the US industrial and construction equipment group, is to expand its European interests with the purchase of a bearings business from Germany's struggling FAG Kugelfischer group. The Torrington Company, I-R's wholly-owned bearings unit, is to buy Kugelfischer's needle and cylindrical bearing business, based at Kunsebeck in Germany. Terms were not disclosed, but Mr J. Frank Travis, I-R vice-president and president of Torrington, said the purchase 'greatly expands our presence in the European bearing market.' The Kunsebeck factory employs 1,200 and sells its needle bearings principally in Germany and western Europe. Mr Travis said that its products would complement Torrington's existing bearing lines, and add significantly to its metric production capability. Torrington already has plants in the UK and Spain, and joint ventures in France and Italy. Mr Travis said the purchase would enhance its capability as a supplier to European carmakers and other customers in the European Community. In January, Kugelfischer announced a restructuring plan to cut costs following heavy losses last year. Tougher measures were later announced, and Kugelfischer is planning to close or sell more than half its 17 factories. Last month, it announced it was putting Deutsche Kugellagerfabriken Leipzig, a lossmaking eastern German subsidiary, into liquidation.</p>

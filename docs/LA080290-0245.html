			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: ITALY WOWED BY PRINCE'S SECURITY, NOT HIS SHOW  </P> <P> MADONNA, THAT ambitious blonde, isn't the only rock star touring Europe who  didn't bowl over Italy. Prince, who is hoping to wow the world with his new  "Graffiti Bridge" album and film, did not exactly set Rome on fire, either.  There were plenty of empty seats at his concert, but that's not what had the  cognoscenti buzzing.  </P> <P> No, what really amused the Italians was that Prince was surrounded by more  security than anyone in Italy has ever seen. The hotel where Prince reigned was  literally an armed camp of security men and bodyguards. What they were  protecting Prince from was something of a mystery since there was not a single  fan waiting for him outside the hotel.  </P> <P> So what is it with all these bodyguards? Are stars really so afraid of being  molested by their fans -- or those who are not their fans -- or is this simply  part of the show, a necessary adjunct of being a superstar?  </P> <P> Madonna's muscular security guys, who double as her jogging partners, were not  favorites of the British recently, as they shoved reporters and photographers  aside to make a path for the fanatically athletic star.  </P> <P> But it is Eddie Murphy who most likely gets top honors in the bodyguard  sweepstakes. At the opening of Spike Lee's "Mo' Better Blues" the other night,  Murphy, whose appeal to moviegoers seems a bit on the wane, appeared with five  times the security the mayor of New York had.  </P> <P> TINA TURNER'S "Foreign Affair" concert tour of Europe has been extended for 10  more weeks. Tina, who has more energy, stamina and sex appeal than women half  her age, has been absolutely killing them on the Continent. She has probably  played to the largest crowds, in the biggest arenas, in more cities than any  other female performer.  </P> <P> Just before Tina went on before 65,000 screaming fans at Woburn Abbey outside  London last week, she was visited backstage by one very special fan -- a  charmingly dressed down Princess Diana. Afterward, the Princess of Wales and  her party stayed for the entire two-hour performance, watching from the  lighting platform in the middle -- and above -- the crowd.  </P> <P> BARBRA STREISAND is a woman who knows what she likes, and she wants what she  likes right away. Just ask the delighted proprietors of the Rhett Gallery in  Beaufort, S.C., where La Streisand is in the midst of her "Prince of Tides"  film.  </P> <P> The star, who has a fine eye for art, intended only a brief drop-in at the  gallery. It turned into a two-hour visit. Barbra purchased at least 14 works  that will eventually find their way to the actress's East and West Coast  residences.  </P></p>

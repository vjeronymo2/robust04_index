			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / International Company News: John Fairfax raises forecast JOHN FAIRFAX Holdings, the Australian newspaper group, which is 15 per cent-owned by Mr Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph group, expects pre-tax profits of ADollars 105m (USDollars 72.4m) in the year to June, compared to earlier forecasts of ADollars 94m. Share option prospectuses lodged with the Australian Securities Commission, said revenue was expected to be 3 per cent lower than the earlier forecast of ADollars 782m because of slow economic growth. Fairfax said the forecast improvement in profit reflected reduced costs and lower interest charges. The Daily Telegraph, meanwhile, is seeking government approval to lift its stake in Fairfax to 25 per cent.</p>

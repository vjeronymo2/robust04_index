In this paper, the impact of CFD validation with wind tunnel is  discussed. That is going to bring the needs for high accuracy of  test data, and that will finally lead to more accurate new test  technique, e.g., magnetic suspension, free from the mount  interference of high RN low speed wind tunnel, actually very  useful for the low risk aircraft development.    Also, wind tunnel facilities in FHI aerospace division are  introduced. With CFD technology and test technology, FHI has the  capability of wide range class airframe development; from low  speed small target plane to space-vehicle.    As CFD becomes more and more powerful, we now must  re-examine  the role of wind tunnel testing and perform revalidations and  re-evaluations. In this article we introduce the reader to some  viewpoints of airframe manufacturers to wind tunnel tests and  CFD. We hope this will enable the reader to better understand  how CFD research is progressing, in connection with wind tunnel  testing. We omit here in detailed discussion of CFD development  and implementation as that was covered in the previous  symposium.[.sup]1[/]  <H5>  1. Problems Surrounding Wind Tunnel Tests and CFD </H5>   The questions most frequently encountered in connection with  CFD and wind tunnel testing are the following two.        -  Do CFD and wind tunnel testing agree?    -  Will wind tunnels  be replaced by CFD? (That is, if CFD gets a lot better, will we  cease building wind tunnels?)       The answer to the first question is clear, namely that CFD  which does not agree at all (i.e. does not coincide in physical  terms) has no technological value, nor is there a method for  completely computing the motions of air molecules. In other  words, the issue is the degree to which they agree. In answer to  the second question, if CFD were "almighty" we would not need  wind tunnels, but such a state of affairs is still far in the  future. (Landahl, for example, says that, in terms of the  calculations for reproducing turbulence movements in their  entirety, where R[.sup]N[/] = 10[.sup]4[/] it would take a  year or so, and where R[.sup]N[/] = 10[.sup]6[/] it would  take about 100 years.[.sup]2[/]) We think that wind tunnels  will be used for some time to come, at least in design  verification. CFD currently is being used in design work within  a framework of "agreeing" fairly well (i.e. with its  effectiveness demonstrated), with wind tunnels still used in  final verifications. However, there has at least to be some kind  of continuity between the results of wind-tunnel tests, on the  one hand, and CFD, on the other. So we wind up doing  verification checks on CFD with the wind tunnel.  <H5>  2. Verification Checks </H5>   While it is undisputed that wind tunnel tests are physical  phenomena, CFD is from start to finish a simulation of physical  phenomena. Accordingly, CFD is always compared to and verified  by wind tunnel tests, which are physical phenomena. Basically,  when CFD is set up, specific verification checks are done due to  so-called standard problems, but when the continuity with the  design is considered, one ends up carrying on verification  checks with wind tunnels that are nearby. We cannot have the  answers agreeing with only one wind tunnel, so we wind up doing  verification checks using data from a number of wind tunnels.  This, of necessity, involves us in verifying one wind tunnel  against another, and, furthermore, fully verified CFD takes on  the property of being usable in verifying the accuracy of wind  tunnels in a certain range. Conversely, wind tunnel test  precision is improved during the course of CFD verification, in  which sense we can hope that the broad-based combination of CFD  and wind tunnel testing will result in advances in aerodynamic  design technology.  <H5>  3. Wind Tunnel Test Reliability </H5>   In Table 1 we represent categorical reasons for attributing  reliability to wind tunnel test data. We think that the concept  of "seeming to be reliable" probably comes from the "fact that  many tests are conducted," which is listed last. We get a sense  of all being well that does not necessarily agree with the  physical exactitude because of a number of things, such as that  we are somehow or other able to design aircraft after conducting  many tests, that we can appreciate the continuities with other  wind tunnels and understand the comparisons with various and  sundry derived values, and that we obtain data which can be  physically interpreted, etc. However, when it comes to  comparison/verification checks on CFD data, physical exactitude  is in fact demanded, and we come face to face with the problems  which wind tunnels naturally have. Typical problems are  illustrated in Figure 1, for none of which have we found  determinative solutions with Japanese wind tunnels. We cannot  disregard these problems when we come to consider CFD  verification checking. We will now discuss each one briefly.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

Wind Tunnel Problems </FIG>    i) Wind Tunnel Wall Interference    This is particularly pronounced in two-dimensional wind  tunnels. In Figure 2 we illustrate a practical wall-interference  compensation (angle-of-attack compensation) which we use. Using  the relationship whereby the change in angle of attack  _D__a_ is  directly proportional to C[.sup]l[/], we obtain  the compensation value by comparing the change in pressure  integral drag to C[.sup]l[/] with the change in  the wake survey values. If the ratio between chord and wind  tunnel wall height is made small, the interference amount can be  reduced, but we need a correction in the angle of attack of  something like 0.6 with C[.sup]l[/] = 1 even  when the ratio is 1:10, which is not a quantity which can be  disregarded. There is also the effect of the side-wall boundary  layer, and we have to incorporate computations which include the  wall model when conducting exact verifications.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-31A>           Figure 2. Wall Interference in Two-Dimensional Wind-Tunnel Tests </FIG>     ii) Support Interference    Whenever wind tunnel tests are planned, one must always face  the issue of how to support the model. Taking the case of a  space shuttle vehicle, diagrammed in Figure 3, the drag of the  base has a strong effect on the total aircraft lift/drag ratio.  However, since the base pressure (base drag) is very different  depending on whether a top support or back support is used, it  is important to conduct final free-flight verifications. In  research on aft fuselage flows, the method of supporting both  main wingtips is sometimes employed (Figure 4), that does not  mean that it is possible to eliminate the interference which  develops between the main wing and the walls at both tips.  Expectations are high for magnetic suspension technology in wind  tunnels, but it will no doubt require computations with models  which include supporting members in conducting the comparisons  of exacting wind tunnel tests and computations before that  technology becomes widely used.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-31B>           Figure 3. Support Interference Effects on Base Support </FIG>      <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-32A>           Figure 4. Measuring Aft Flows, Example of Results </FIG>      The RN effect, as is well known, is particularly pronounced  in flows which include subsonic C[.sup]Lmax[/]  separation, etc., and the impact on airline design is great. In  ordinary wind tunnels, however, due to inadequate RN, it is not  possible to determine the stall characteristics and  C[.sup]Lmax[/] well, which brings an element of  risk into the flight tests. In order to verify the effectiveness  of CFD in aircraft design, it will probably be necessary to  verify the continuity between actual flight level RN and  ordinary wind tunnel level RN, but we have no wind tunnels in  Japan with such high RN. From the perspective of the  manufacturer, who must fly the actual aircraft, innovative  experimental techniques are employed to make up for this RN  insufficiency. Here at FHI, since the development of the T-1, we  employ a turbulence grid which artificially increases turbulence  and simulates separation conditions at high RN (cf. Figure 5).  As shown in Figure 6, in the case of a straight wing aircraft,  the lateral instability at stall demonstrated without the  turbulence grid disappears when the turbulence grid is attached,  so that we can predict low risk during flight tests. However,  with a swept-wing craft, the lateral instability at stall does  not disappear even when the turbulence grid is used, and we find  out that some kind of device like a fence is necessary.  Nevertheless, this kind of technique is an expedient, and in the  future we will need to have high-RN low-speed wind tunnels for  higher-precision development. Also, we do not believe that CFD  can adequately function in this area at present, and we must  await further research.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-33A>           Figure 5. High-RN Simulation Using Turbulence Grid </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-33B>           Figure 6. RN Effect and Leading-Edge Device </FIG>     We can summarize much of what was said above on CFD  verification as in Table 2. The strict comparison of  two-dimensional chords and two-dimensional wind tunnel tests  contains nonsensical elements somewhere, but "two dimension" is  useful taking design concepts from two dimensions to three  dimensions, and we believe the verification is meaningful in  terms of grasping the correlation between 2D CFD and wind tunnel  tests and determining the scope of effectiveness.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

Wind Tunnel Tests at FHI </H5>   The current status of CFD was treated in the previous  symposium,[.sup]1[/] but we now discuss briefly the wind  tunnel testing capabilities of Fuji Heavy Industries. We hope  that this, and the previous treatment, will give a better  understanding of "wind tunnels and CFD at FHI."    FHI currently operates six types of wind tunnel and water  tank facilities with which we can conduct various kinds of tests  from low speeds to Mach 4. We believe that we need, at minimum,  the equipment to allow us to perfect basic airframe designs in  house (cf. Table 3).    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-34A>           Table 3. FHI Wind Tunnels </FIG>    i) With the high-speed wind tunnel (Figure 7 [not  reproduced]) we can conduct tests from M = 0.2 to 4, with the  measurement section measuring 0.61 meters square. Full-craft  six-component tests and various other tests are performed (cf.  Figure 4). Since this is a suction type of wind tunnel, there is  little turbulence, maintenance is simple, and the operating rate  is high. Over an 11-year period we have conducted some 15,000  blows with this facility.    ii) The low-speed wind tunnel (Figure 8) measures 2 m x 2 m,  has a normal speed of 50 m/s and a maximum speed of  approximately 80 m/s. This facility is used in full-craft shape  force and pressure tests, flutter tests, object dropping tests,  ground effect tests, and rotor tests. This wind tunnel is very  compact for its capabilities.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-34B>           Figure 8. Exterior View of Low-Speed Wind Tunnel </FIG>    iii) The smoke wind tunnel (Figure 9) has a 0.2 m x 2 m  measurement section and uses smoke for flow-line observation. It  also features three-component, pressure measurements at wind  speeds up to 40 m/s, and is useful in the development of  airfoils for use at low RN.[.sup]3[/]   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-35A>           Figure 9. Exterior View of Smoke Wind Tunnel </FIG>    iv) The simplified wind tunnel (Figure 10) has a measurement  section that is 0.6 m x 0.6 m and is used in visual 3D tests at  wind speeds up to 15 m/s. It is useful in tests in which lasers  are used to make eddies visible.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-36A>           Figure 10. Exterior View of Simplified Wind Tunnel </FIG>    v) The shallow-bottom water tank (Figure 11) simulates flows  of up to M = 5 in a thin water tank. It is useful in  quantitative pressure measurements as well as in intuitively  understanding the behavior of supersonic and hypersonic  intakes.[.sup]4[/]   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-36B>           Figure 11. Exterior View of Shallow-Bottom Water Tank </FIG>    vi) The visualizing water tank (Figure 12) has a 0.4 m x 0.6  m measurement section and uses water flows of 50 cm to 50 cm/s  [sic]. It is useful in making the 3D eddy sites around the  object visible.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-37A>           Figure 12. Exterior View of Visualizing Water Tank </FIG>    Thus we have various kinds of wind tunnel facilities. As for  a large-scale wind tunnel such as is needed for highly precise  development work, however, we must look to the installation of  facilities such as the aforementioned high-RN low-speed wind  tunnel in public institutions.  <H5>  5.

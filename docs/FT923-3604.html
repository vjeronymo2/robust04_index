			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / US Senate report set to attack Bank A 600-PAGE US Senate report on the Bank of Credit and Commerce International affair is likely to be sharply critical of the role of the Bank of England and could embarrass the UK government, write Alan Friedman in New York and Robert Peston in London. The US report on the corrupt international bank is to be published on September 23, so is likely to pre-empt publication of a UK report on whether BCCI was supervised properly by the Bank of England and the UK government. The UK report - by Lord Bingham, recently appointed Master of the Rolls - is not due out until mid-October, according to a senior official. The Bingham report is also critical of the Bank of England. The US report is being prepared by Senator John Kerry who, since 1989, has spearheaded US Congressional investigations of BCCI. His 200,000-word report is likely to deal with relations between western intelligence services and BCCI; with the behaviour of US and British bank regulators in the period up to July 5 1991, when BCCI was shut down; and with the role of Price Waterhouse and other former BCCI auditors. A federal judge in Washington yesterday ruled that Mr Clark Clifford, the former US defence secretary facing criminal charges regarding the collapsed BCCI, should first stand trial in New York before facing a federal indictment in Washington. He has denied any wrongdoing. Judge Joyce Hens Green granted a prosecution request that the Washington trial of Mr Clifford be postponed until at least next March, so that he can first be tried on the more serious New York charges of accepting bribes, conspiracy to commit fraud and misleading bank regulators. The New York trial is expected to begin in early January. Justice Department officials have said the Washington case might then be dropped.</p>

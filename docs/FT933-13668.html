			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: Directors' transactions LOWNDES Lambert, the insurance broking group, came to the market two years ago, but its share price has proved volatile. Since last September, however, this has climbed steadily from just over 220p to the present level at which six board members have sold a total of 277,000. The largest was chairman Richard Shaw's disposal of 200,000 although he retains 1.34m. Announcing final results at the end of June, Shaw talked confidently about the profit outlook for this year - something borne out by brokers' forecasts which produce a consensus earnings figure of 31p. Kevin McDonald and Geoffrey Howison are regular sellers of shares in Polypipe. Against one of the most difficult trading backgrounds for many decades, it has proved it can generate consistent profit and earnings growth, and has been rewarded with a premium rating. McDonald sold 2m shares at the beginning of the year and Howison has just sold 1m at 135p. This sale was made just after the year-end and before the closed period which forbids directors from dealing. On forecast earnings for the year just finished, the gross yield is just over 2 per cent.

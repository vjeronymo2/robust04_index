			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERTUSSIS REACTIONS  </P> <P> Question: If a child has had a bad reaction to the pertussis vaccine, should he  not get any more shots? Or is it better to take the chance that the bad  reaction won't happen again?  </P> <P> Answer: For children who have had a bad reaction to the  diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine, a vaccine is available that does  not contain the pertussis portion.  </P> <P> Q: I can understand why aerobic exercises are supposed to be good for the heart  and the lungs. What do all these people who do anaerobic exercises get out of  them?  </P> <P> A: The main purpose of anaerobic exercise is to increase muscle strength. The  greatest benefits to overall health come from aerobic exercise.  </P> <P> For Mrs. D.S., Montpelier, Vt.: Women who have reduced iron reserves have less  energy and will tire faster during exercise.  </P></p>

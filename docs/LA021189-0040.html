			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER GUN CONTROL LAWS  </P> <P> Of course, I don't enjoy the perspective of Davis on the gun control issue, but  it does appear to me those favoring control have offered compromise over and  over again only to meet with adamant opposition from the gun lobby and its  friends in national and local legislatures.  </P> <P> The truth is the National Rifle Assn. has mounted effective campaigns at every  level to block attempts to regulate plastic guns, Teflon-coated ammunition,  Saturday night specials, etc.  </P> <P> Accusing anti-gun forces of "sitting like pigs in the middle of the road" is a  cop out. The pun is intentional.  </P> <P> LOUIS M. ST. MARTIN  </P> <P> Pomona  </P></p>

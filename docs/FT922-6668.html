			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Vienna (3): Luring the local saver - Financial Markets IN VIENNA, the stock market sometimes appears to be closer to the tourist scene than the banking industry. Austrians provide foreigners with a casual and colourful setting and expect them to supply the funds. Most of the locals, however, never set foot in the market. The bourse, located in an opulent 19th century building that was nearly gutted by a fire in the 1960s, was one of Europe's most sleepy backwaters until 1985, when Barron's Mr Jim Rogers recommended Austrian shares to his readers. A few foreign investors, bidding up an illiquid market, sparked a powerful boom, which fizzled out after a few exciting months. The cycle repeated itself after the barriers with the eastern bloc came down in 1989, when foreigners fell in love with Austrian shares and turned Vienna into Europe's best-performing market. But the addiction to orders from abroad left Vienna with a hangover when the euphoria faded. While the effects of the Gulf War no longer have an impact on other major markets, the war in Yugoslavia, which in its initial stage was also fought on the Austrian border, has kept the Vienna bourse in the doldrums for nearly two years. The major indices are now 40 per cent below their peak of March 1990, and only slightly above the bourse's 1991 lows. So the stock market scene has began to resemble Vienna's tourist highlights also with its nostalgic mood. Traders and syndicate managers love to sit around and talk about the good old days. The mood in the small trading room, where about 100 issues change hands for only two hours a day, is quite subdued these days. With only a handful of blue chip stocks, none of them with a free float of more than 50 per cent, the choice for investors is quite limited. Some of the big publicly traded companies are foreign-owned, and many more are majority-controlled by the federal government. While Austria has taken some steps toward privatisation of its large state-owned sector, the Social Democrats of Chancellor Franz Vranitzky still resist a cut of the state's stakes in the biggest banks and industrial companies below 50 per cent. Among the financial shares, the biggest single sector in the market, 30 per cent of Creditanstalt's stocks and only 6.5 per cent of Bank Austria are in public ownership. The big banks, in turn, hold major stakes in many other companies. The new issue market, which has remained dormant for more than a year, is unlikely to enlarge the range of choices much. There is a flurry of new stock offerings expected for the coming months, but most of them are small and medium-size companies with little appeal to international investors. Even the initial offering of Girozentrale, the country's third largest bank, is expected to be small, and the timing is still undecided. The long-awaited initial flotation of state-owned industrial giant Austrian Industries, originally scheduled for this year, had to be postponed until 1993 because of weak earnings at its steel and aluminium divisions, and most observers expect further delays. OMV, Austrian Industries' oil subsidiary with a 25 per cent free float, is one of the market's most attractive issues. But over the past few weeks it has seen a significant drop after reporting a loss for the first quarter. A major drawback for the Vienna bourse is the weak interest of domestic investors. 'Austria is a savers' nation, the savings rate is 14 per cent, but people don't invest in stocks. The interest paid on savings accounts at the end of the year can buy up the free float on the Vienna Stock Exchange,' says Mr Michael Lielacher, general manager of the Vindobona Privat-Bank in Vienna. Less than 4 per cent of the population own any equities, but bankers say this is nearly a four-fold increase over the early 1980s. Mr Peter Szobo, head of equity research at Girozentrale, says he expects a further doubling of ownership over the next five years. 'There is no base of institutional investors, but this is slowly getting better. Life insurance companies and pension funds are diversifying their portfolios. It is just not changing from one day to the next.' The limited ownership cannot be explained by a lack of efforts. Various privatisations in the past few years have been accompanied by a wave of advertising. And to the surprise of television viewers, the state-owned network ORF has begun to report trends on the Vienna and international stock markets in its evening news. Experts say a renewed bull market would do most to lure more domestic investors to the bourse. They regard the high level of German interest rates, which Austria is forced to match to keep the Schilling pegged to the D-Mark, as the main obstacle to an upturn. So analysts in Vienna are closely watching the trend in Austria's northern neighbour to forecast the fate of the local market. Mr Lielacher says he expects a rally in Austrian shares after German interest rate cuts in the middle of the year. Vienna could easily outperform Frankfurt 'because we don't have to pay for the takeover of a whole country,' he says. The market should also benefit from an economic recovery in neighbouring Hungary and Czechoslovakia, where Austrian companies have made large investments, he adds. One of the surprising success stories in Vienna is the fledgling futures and options market, OTOB, which started up last October. Using the Swedish OM system, OTOB has launched trading in stock options with few hitches and by February reached an average daily volume of 10,000 contracts in six stocks. Mr Christian Imo, who left the Frankfurt options exchange (DTB) to head OTOB, says the success reflects the need for a transparent and liquid investment vehicle in Vienna. The bearish and volatile mood on the spot market has also spurred demand for a good hedging instrument, he says. In the summer, OTOB is planning to launch an option on the ATX, the new real-time stock index which includes 18 blue chip shares. 'It will be the first product that is really competitive in the international market,' Mr Imo says. 'Investors will be able to buy the country risk without having to investigate the whole market.' The relationship between OTOB, which is jointly owned by Austria's banks, and the Vienna stock market is one of polite co-existence, not co-operation, observers say. Because the bourse insists on maintaining its official monopoly in Austria, OTOB is not allowed to call itself a bourse. The institution is registered as a bank.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India not yet ready for tea imports The Indian federal government has decided against allowing the import of bulk tea for re-export. At the same time, however, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, the commerce minister, has told local tea producers, who are against imports of any kind, that he finds no 'inherent contradiction in the simultaneous export and import of the same commodity'. 'It is very important', he says, 'that India retains the image of a sustainable steady supplier of commodities. In times of domestic shortages we may resort to import to maintain export. It is never easy to regain a lost market.' Mr Mukherjee thinks that the Indian Tea Board production target of 1bn kg of tea by the turn of the century is ambitious. Last year India's crop was a record 760m kg, against 704m kg in 1992 and 742m kg in 1991. The minister has expressed concern that 'with the domestic consumption of tea going up by 15m to 20m kg a year, there is a pressure on the exportable surplus.' Mr SM Dutta, chairman of Hindustan Lever, who is spearheading the tea import campaign has also cast doubt on India hitting its turn of the century production target. Those in favour of import point out that the rate of growth in domestic consumption of tea is higher than the production growth rate. They also contend that with annual consumption of tea in India being only 65kg a head, there is considerable scope for growth. This, however, is not possible without import, if Indian tea exports are not to be affected. Even then Mr HP Barooah, chairman of the Indian Tea Association, admits that 'one day, some countries may be in a position to offer good enough tea to the Indian consumer at a competitive price. If the price is attractive and the quality acceptable, the Indian consumer may not be willing to pay the extra high price for Indian tea, even though it may have an edge in quality'. The basic problem in India, Mr Barooah points out, is that because of the low productivity of workers (730kg per man-year) and of land (1,610kg a hectare in north India, where quality tea is grown), the country has become a high cost producer. The cost of production of north Indian tea is Dollars 1.60 a kilogram, compared with about Dollars 1 in Kenya. According to Mr Barooah him, the Indian tea industry cannot ask for protection when the country's business is being globalised. In the long run, the import of tea can be avoided only by making the domestic industry competitive in terms of quality and price, he warns.</p>

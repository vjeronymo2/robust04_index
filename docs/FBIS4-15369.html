			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Shakhray article: "Better Fewer but Better. Duma's </F> Time Limit Dictates That"]    [Text] Despite all the disappointments of the last few  years Russians still expect positive changes from new laws.  However, people should not harbor excessive illusions about  everything to do with the parliament's lawmaking activity.  Since such unwarranted expectations may subsequently form a  basis for confrontation between society and parliament and a  source of mutual recriminations between the executive and the  representative authorities.    The Constitution enshrines a complex system for lawmaking in  the Russian Federation. All draft laws are submitted to the  State Duma. After they are adopted they are sent to the  Federation Council for examination or "silent approval." Only a  few laws are liable to mandatory examination by the Federation  Council. The latter has the right to approve or reject a law.  The Duma can "overcome" such a rejection by a two-thirds vote  and then send the law to the president. The president is also  entitled to send the law back to the Duma for further  consideration and thus increase still further the time it takes  to examine and adopt the said law. Only after all these  procedures is the law signed by the president and comes into  force as soon as it is published.    Thus months may elapse between the time of the Duma vote and  the law's coming into force.    In view of all these factors let us take a look at the  Duma's  work "schedule." Its standing orders envisage that the Duma  takes a vacation twice a year -- in August-September and for a  fortnight during the winter. Deputies spend the last week of  each month working in their own districts. Thus three weeks in  every month are allocated for work in the Duma proper. In  December 1995 new members of the State Duma and the Federation  Council will be elected. Thus, the Duma, which meets for  plenary sessions twice a week, really has just 96 plenary  sessions left. That also means that it has time to subject to  qualified examination, adopt, and bring "to life" no more than  30 laws.    What is more, after the budget has been ratified all newly  adopted laws can only be enacted as of the new fiscal year,  1995. That is a reality with which one must come to terms.    On the one hand, this procedure guarantees society against  the adoption of rash and thoughtless decisions. The law is both  the result of the coordination of interests in the Duma and  consensus between this chamber, which represents the interests  of the whole state, and the interests of components of the  Russian Federation, whose representatives sit in the Federation  Council. This combination of statewide interests with the  interests of every component, enshrined in the actual lawmaking  procedure, is extremely essential.    But, on the other hand, this actual procedure imposes a  number of moral-political obligations on all parties to the  lawmaking process. In order to ensure that the legislative  process does not become a "bone of contention" between society  and parliament and also between the representative and executive  authorities, a complex system of conciliation procedures now has  to be thought out and "cranked" into action. Moreover, there  are problems which require laws to be adopted very rapidly.    I think that experts and deputies from both chambers of  parliament should begin working together at the stage where  draft laws are prepared by Duma committees and commissions. At  the same time government experts should be involved in the work  on the drafts since no law requiring financial outlay can be  adopted without a ruling from the government.    It is necessary to take a calm view of the situation that  has  developed in the "sphere of lawmaking," but in order to obtain  even a minimal result one should now ponder the optimum means of  organizing the lawmaking process. Therefore the main tasks today  are as follows.    First, it is necessary to precisely decide the list of 30-40  priority laws relating to the most urgent economic, political,  and social issues. This does not incidentally mean that the  Duma should stop the work it has begun in other areas. But  deputies and the public must realize at the same time that they  are working on legislative material for the next parliament.    Second, many deputies must abandon the illusion that they  have come to the Duma to write laws "themselves" rather than  organize this work like all developed countries do. Lawmaking  is just as complex a matter as any professional activity. The  legislative process is strictly subordinate to the laws of  formal logic. It must not allow the adoption of laws that are  not written in legal language or lack financial validation. The  laws must also be accompanied by packages of delegatory acts.  The world has rules whereby a law is simply not examined in the  absence of a package of delegatory acts and the requisite  instructions.    Third and last, the texts of draft laws should be produced  by  professionals and submitted to parliament in 99 percent of cases  by the government. Deputies should monitor this activity in the  right sense of the word and voice the group interests of the  voters. Their task is to "pass" the content of the draft law in  line with their professional experience and knowledge. They  have to check whether or not it reflects the urgent requirements  of society. And in this connection voters should not make  excessive demands on deputies either. They should not force  them to immediately "produce" a particular law. There are some  public illusions on this point too. The former Supreme Soviet  adopted hundreds of laws like this, whose implementation was  known in advance to be impossible. No good came of this. While  creating a semblance of concern for Russia's citizens, these  acts really deceived voters.    The Duma may "devise" the kind of voting machine that puts  law making on a mass footing. But no political structure in the  parliament today has an absolute majority and, to be honest,  that is a boon for Russia. At the moment laws can only appear  in our country as the result of sociopolitical compromise and  accord. And that is the best result in the current conditions.    Now a few words about the priority laws. In my view the  following should be part of the compulsory "30." In the  political sphere -- a law on political parties and laws on  elections of Russia's parliament and president. In the economic  sphere -- a new Civil Code, amendments to the legislation on  enterprises, on joint-stock companies, on the banking system,  and on taxation. In the social sphere -- a package of laws on  protection of impoverished groups, including new (or amendments  to) pension legislation. Lastly, it is very important to amend  criminal legislation and the legislation on criminal procedure.  A new Criminal Code and a package of laws on fighting crime are  needed.    That may be everything that the Duma realistically has time  for during this very short period.</p>

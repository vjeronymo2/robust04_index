			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Bank may have left SE in dark over Blue Arrow THE BANK of England may have withheld crucial information about County NatWest's role in the failed Blue Arrow rights issue from Stock Exchange officials in late 1987, according to Mr Robert Wilkinson, a former stock exchange director of surveillance. Mr Wilkinson's remarks, in a Channel Four programme by Fulcrum Productions, will fuel debate about the Bank's duel roles of promoting and policing the City. The programme, due to be screened on Thursday, suggests that the Bank left the Stock Exchange in the dark about County NatWest's holding of Blue Arrow shares after shareholders only took up their rights to 38 per cent of the shares on offer. Four City financial advisers were last month convicted of conspiracy to defraud over their handling of the Pounds 837m rights issue for the employment agency. After the offer closed County NatWest and other institutions bought extra shares to make it appear that the issue had been less undersubscribed. When the stock market crashed in 1987, Stock Exchange officials were aware that County had a large exposure to a big listed company. The Bank had already been told County was looking at a Pounds 43m loss on this interest. But the Bank would not reveal to Mr Wilkinson the identity of the company in which County had its large stake. This was, according to Mr Wilkinson, 'for reasons of banking secrecy'. County had told the Bank that it had taken on the unwanted Blue Arrow shares the day after the rights issue flopped on 28 September 1987, according to the programme. Conspiracy charges are outstanding against four other individuals involved in the rights issue. The SFO is expected to announce shortly whether it will proceed with a second Blue Arrow trial.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / International Company News: Delta to shed 4,500 more full-time jobs Delta Air Lines, the third biggest US airline, yesterday announced it was cutting 4,500 full-time jobs from its airport customer service division during the next 12 months. The cuts are part of a drastic restructuring, announced in April, under which Delta hopes to cut Dollars 2bn a year from operating costs in an attempt to overcome competition from low-cost US carriers, such as Southwest Airlines. Delta's airport customer service division is responsible for baggage and cargo handling, aircraft refuelling, customer service at the ticket counter and some administrative functions. It employs 21,000 worldwide. The airline aims to achieve a 20 per cent cut in the division's workforce by requiring staff to work more flexible hours, including split shifts; requiring them to do other people's jobs as well as their own when they are not busy; making more use of part-time workers; and sub-contracting work to outside companies. Delta said it hoped to achieve the job cuts through a combination of voluntary severance, leave of absence and early retirement. Compulsory redundancy would be used if necessary. The cuts follow Delta's announcement last month that it was to shed 2,500 jobs from its technical operations division, which is responsible for maintenance. Together, the announcements take the company half-way towards its targeted cut of between 12,000 and 15,000 jobs from the workforce of 73,000 in the next three years. Delta's goal is to reduce costs per available seat mile from 9.26 cents last year to 7.5 cents by 1997. That figure will be almost on a par with Southwest's 7.2 cents. Delta has already shed more than 7,400 jobs since June 1992, and last February it cut employees' pay by 5 per cent. Only its 8,500 pilots belong to a union, so it has largely avoided labour strife to date.</p>

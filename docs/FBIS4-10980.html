			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Division General Jesus Bermudez </F> Cutino, military chief of the Intelligence Directorate of the  Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba: "Numbers Don't Lie"]    [Text] In this article published by PRENSA LATINA, the  chief of military intelligence of the Revolutionary Armed Forces  (FAR) of Cuba analyzes U.S. military cuts and notes that they  are not commensurate with the dismantling of its Cold War  opponents.    The fall of the socialist bloc and the disintegration of the  USSR and the Warsaw Pact have enabled the United States and its  allies to act with impunity against their real adversaries and  those who have never been their adversaries but whom they "do  not like."    In order to do that, they have widely used international  organizations, particularly the UN Security Council. Within the  framework of that organization they are trying to materialize  their doctrines and strategies. There are no better means, as  actions are sanctified by making them legal.    We must listen to silly arguments, such as the  interpretation  given to "preventive diplomacy," a term they find attractive  (and which sometimes is a real "excuse") to prevent a conflict  the CIA previewed or simply to prevent one from worsening.    This can result in the use of force, especially by those who  are stronger.    Washington's "preventive diplomacy" is not new. It has its  roots in gunboat policy, in U.S. multiple military interventions  throughout the world, especially in Latin America. In Cuba we  were victims of that diplomacy on many occasions. In 1898 they  had to intervene to prevent "chaos and anarchy," after which  they imposed the Platt Amendment on us, which enabled them to  continue to intervene.    Under the excuse of preventing worse evils, they also  intervened in the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Panama, etc.    For many years, through our ancestors, we learned of the  peoples' struggle for sovereignty, for which men gave their  lives in many countries. For any dignified man, defending his  country's sovereignty was reason enough to make any sacrifice,  even offering their lives. With regard to our country,  Lieutenant General Antonio Maceo said that "whomever tries to  take over Cuba" will pick up its soil covered by blood, if he  does not die in the attempt." That was the concept of  sovereignty for the Titan of bronze: it was a matter of pride.  We could make an endless list of men who have maintained  similar positions with regard to the sovereignty of their native  land and others who as internationalists have fallen under other  skies defending the sovereignty of other countries.    During the 48th period of sessions of the UN General  Assembly  in 1993, however, a document was approved which states that  absolute and exclusive sovereignty is no longer valid and that  it has never had any legal basis. Following that logic, the UN  Security Council can decide to intervene in any country under  the pretext of maintaining peace, or simply to restore it, as  the case may be. Actions can also be preventive, in other words  to prevent a problem: covering the pimple with a bandage before  it bursts.    Although the road to hell is paved with good intentions,  there could be good intentions behind this, depending on how we  look at it. Applying "preventive diplomacy" could mean that the  UN Security Council could demand that the United States  unconditionally lift its blockade on Cuba to normalize the  situation in the Caribbean and put an end to the policy of  hostility toward Havana. That however, would be asking for the  impossible.    Although the document is not of a compulsory nature, its  application is considered legitimate.    Also making an appearance was the so-called "humanitarian  intervention," the one that links four bags of beans to  thousands of tons of bombs, and while a person is eating,  thousands others are dying. With this trend, phrases such as  "humanitarian bombings," "humanitarian artillery preparation,"  humanitarian surgical strikes," and "humanitarian raids"  [previous word in English], among others, will soon make an  appearance as well. For example:    It is a fact that worldwide strategic changes have forced  the  U.S. Department of Defense to cut its budget, and this is why a  quantitative reduction of the armed forces has been proposed,  but it is also true that the United States will not renounce its  international leadership, which allows it to stick its nose  wherever and whenever it pleases.    This is why quantitative reductions should not affect these  at all. The new strategy establishes four basic points:  strategic dissuasion, advanced presence, reaction to crisis,  and reorganization.    -- Strategic dissuasion: They maintain their defensive and  offensive strategic forces at levels above those of current  international reality. Moreover, they continue to prepare and  train the use of force despite changes that have taken place in  the world and agreements signed on this matter.    -- Advanced Presence: In areas near Cuba, to mention only  that which affects us most, they maintain about 10 vessels of  all kinds and a similar number of planes day after day under the  pretext of fighting against drug trafficking.    As part of their blockade against Haiti, the Navy and the  Coast Guard maintain no fewer than 10 vessels and several planes  only a few km off our coastline. They are joined by naval and  aerial units currently participating in the Fleetex Exercises  off the U.S. eastern coast and in the Caribbean, involving  thousands of soldiers, and with this, and Agile Provider '94,  they will keep us under the tension created by the "villains"  throughout April and May, and "God knows" what they are up to.    -- Reaction to Crisis: 79 percent of their ground forces are  kept in their territory and they are ready as the "firefighters"  of McNamara, and given that there is no longer an enemy in  Europe, it seems that the Pact of Varsovia died...? Who is this  package of forces in the West aimed at?    -- Reorganization: It is very easy to announce cuts and  maintain 89 divisions, 4,600 tactical fighters, and an  industrial plant [potential] that allows it to start producing  at full force in a relatively short period of time. For  example: In little more than 60 months, between July 1940 and  August 1945, they produced 86,000 tanks, 120,000 pieces of  artillery, 1,200 combat vessels, 82,000 landing craft, 96,000  bombers, 88,000 fighters, 23,000 transportation planes, among  others.    All basic elements of the U.S. military strategy are  intrinsically linked to a number of principles that foresee the  maintenance of a number of units with high-combat readiness,  represented by the contingency forces, which allow them on the  basis of technological superiority, to maintain the principle of  "decisive force," which means accumulating as much force as  needed to crush the adversary in a short time, even if this  involves killing a goat with a B-52 bomber loaded with 27 tons  of bombs.    Thus, as others in the world are truly disarming, the  "supermen" maintain the principle of force and are ready to  fight, are trying to avoid substantial cuts to not affect the  quality of personnel training and the superior technology of  their armament and equipment, and their industrial potential is  also ready. They will not get rid of this regardless of the  cost involved.    These figures, in the end, reflect no real cuts. They  rationalized intermediary, noncombative positions, closed  obsolete bases, and cut certain costs that had always been  superfluous and unnecessary, but these measures are not  commensurate with the true dismantling being carried out by the  alleged enemies they maintained throughout the "Cold War," whose  end is only theoretical.    In sum, "preventive diplomacy" needs these forces.</p>

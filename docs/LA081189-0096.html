			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Salvatore (Bill) Bonnano, who claimed three months ago to be too poor to pay  his lawyer, managed to come up with $72,500 last October to pay for his  daughter's wedding, according to court documents. Bonnano, the son of reputed  mobster Joseph (Joe Bananas) Bonnano, was sentenced in 1987 to four years in  prison after his conviction on charges of conspiracy to commit grand theft. He  has been free since then on $50,000 bail pending an appeal. Deputy California  Atty. Gen. Derald Grandberg, who has been fighting to put Salvatore Bonnano  behind bars, filed documents in Alameda County Superior Court indicating the  wedding featured a 14-piece orchestra and a menu that included shrimp and filet  mignon. Earlier this year, after pleading that he was indigent, Bonnano was  awarded $19,250 in public funds to pay his lawyer.  </P></p>

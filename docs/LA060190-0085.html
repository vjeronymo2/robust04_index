			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> CONCERT FEATURES COMPOSITIONS BY KEITH CLARK  </P> <P> In his 10 years as founding music director of the Pacific Symphony, Keith Clark  seldom took the opportunity to program his own music, though some people might  have wanted him to. So one approached the final concert in the "Keith Clark  &amp; Friends" chamber music series Wednesday at the Robert Mondavi Food and  Wine Center with special interest.  </P> <P> Two works by Clark, who left the Pacific in 1989, shared the bill with music by  Haydn, Schubert and contemporary American composer Jane Brockman.  </P> <P> Judgment about Clark's compositional talents will have to wait for more  substantial opportunities, however. His "Lost Children (Four Little Kids' Songs  After Blake)," composed in 1964, is a work by a serious, studious, capable  19-year-old who had soaked up academic and worthier influences without  responding to the great depths of the seminal Romantic poet's texts. But how  many composers have?  </P> <P> Clark's "L'Ocho Dodi," on the other hand, is an occasional piece, composed in  1989 to celebrate the wedding of a friend. The short work (less than five  minutes long) does exactly what it should: create an unabashedly lyric,  attractive aura around the bridal couple. (Incidentally, this was the only  piece on the program that Clark conducted.)  </P> <P> Vocal soloist in both pieces was soprano Maurita Phillips Thornburg, who  provided polished but also constricted vocalism not only here but also in  Schubert's "Der Hirt auf dem Felsen."  </P> <P> Clarinetist William Powell proved unsteady and erratic in Schubert's wondrous  work (Trina Dye provided discreet pianism), but managed the banal colorscapes  of Brockman's "Ningana" for clarinet, electronics and tape with more comfort  and authority.  </P> <P> The high point of the concert, however, was the stylish playing of cellist  Dennis Karmazyn in Haydn's early Concerto in C. Karmazyn produced robust but  also poised and aristocratic tone. He played his own cadenzas.  </P> <P> Surprisingly, the five-member supporting ensemble did not sound thin, thanks to  first violinist Barry Socher, who set lively, buoyant tempos, and  harpsichordist Thomas McFarland, who filled out the harmonies. The others were  violinist Juliann French, violist Ray Tanabe and cellist Geoff Shank.  </P></p>

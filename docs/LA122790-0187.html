Frank Semelsberger said.  </P> <P> The motorcyclist was believed based at the Tustin Marine Corps Helicopter Air  Station.  </P> <P> Details about the accident were sketchy, but Semelsberger said a preliminary  investigation indicated that the motorcyclist sped through a red light in the  southbound lanes of Red Hill Avenue.  </P> <P> "For whatever reason, the driver of the truck wasn't able to stop in time to  avoid hitting the motorcycle," he said.  </P> <P> The motorcyclist was wearing a helmet at the time, as well as a heavy jacket  and leather gloves. He was headed in the direction of the Tustin base, but it  was not immediately known whether he was scheduled to report for duty.  </P></p>

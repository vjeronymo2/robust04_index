Specialists called the  attention of ITAR-TASS to the main provisions of the treaty.  Specifically, it gives definition to the strategic nuclear  forces on the territory of Kazakhstan and stresses that a  decision of using nuclear weapons will be taken by the Russian  president with the agreement of the Kazakh president until their  complete elimination.    In the opinion of experts, the provision of the treaty  saying  that if the security of one of the states is threatened, the  other one will render the needed assistance to it, including  military assistance, is also very important.    The treaty envisages the division of movable and immovable  property on the territory of Kazakhstan between the two defence  ministries and defines the status of defence facilities. It  also includes provisions on the use of the naval forces of  Russia and Kazakhstan in the Caspian Sea in the interests of  both countries, on the production, repair and deliveries of  armaments and military hardware, etc.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian mint launches a one kilogram platinum coin AUSTRALIA IS attempting to breath some life back into the platinum investment market by launching three big legal tender coins, containing two troy ounces, 10 ounces and one kilogram of the precious metal. This follows the success it achieved with gold coins of the same sizes last year which helped Australia topple Canada's Maple Leaf gold bullion coin from market leadership, boosting market share from 15 per cent in 1990 to 35 per cent last year (see table). Mr Don Mackay-Coghill, managing director of GoldCorp Australia, operator of the Perth Mint which issues the coins by arrangement with the Australian government, said at the launch in London yesterday that he expected to lift Australia's platinum coin sales from about 65,000 ounces last year to 100,000 ounces. GoldCorp already has market leadership in platinum coins after launching smaller coins in November 1988. He claimed GoldCorp had a 60 per cent share of the market, the Royal Canadian Mint 30 per cent with the Isle of Man's Noble coin accounting for the rest. Mr Mackay-Coghill said the new large coins - each of 99.95 per cent pure platinum - should help to lift platinum coin sales in Japan. He said the new products would be the first platinum coins competitive in price with bullion bars while offering the security of what amounted to a government guarantee. They would be sold into the distribution network at premiums over the metal price of only 2.5 per cent for the two ounce coins, 2 per cent for the 10 ounce, and 1 per cent for the kilo coin.  ----------------------------------------              GOLD COINS 1991  ----------------------------------------                                Troy oz.  ---------------------------------------- Aus Kangaroo                    689,562 Can Maple Leaf                  412,743 US Eagle                        347,321 SA Krugerrand                   296,840 Austr.

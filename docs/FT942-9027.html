			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Broad welcome for Braer report The shipping industry gave a generally positive response to the findings of the Donaldson inquiry - which was prompted by the Braer tanker disaster - but questioned whether its recommendations would provide swift or easy answers to the problems of pollution and shipping safety. Numast, the shipmasters' and officers' union, said: 'There have been endless discussions and the International Maritime Organisation (a United Nations agency) does an awful lot but it can take three or four years to get an international convention agreed and years more to get it enforced.' Emphasis on port controls of substandard vessels to overcome the weakness of the system of 'flag state' control, was met with scepticism. 'Port inspection can only be an adjunct to flag state control,' said Capt Kenneth Long, assistant director of the International Association of Dry Cargo Shipowners. Some flag states have improved controls in recent years, although the only way to bring pressure is 'to keep telling them', he said. The Council of European and Japanese National Shipowners' Associations said a weakness of port controls was that the standards demanded could be inconsistent, both between countries and between ports in the same country. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's transport spokesman, disagreed and called for action by port states. 'With so many irresponsible shipowners and operators we cannot depend on the necessary action being taken by the states whose flags they fly.' Capt Long said the proposal to increase the number of tugs stationed on Britain's coastline could prove extremely costly for only a marginal improvement in safety. Increasing the amount of information in a traditionally secretive industry may also prove more difficult than envisaged by the Donaldson report. Some said that those who provide information could find themselves at a disadvantage against the 'cowboys' who keep quiet. Numast, which pointed to the 800 deaths of seafarers since the Braer disaster, said the inquiry report did not make enough concrete suggestions in the field of human resources. 'The report says it is idle to attempt to change human nature but this seems to us to duck the issue,' it said. Operating standards were crucial but there were no effective guidelines on working hours for ships' crews, it added.</p>

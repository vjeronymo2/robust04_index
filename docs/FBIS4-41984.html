			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by correspondents </F> Igor Porshnev, Yegeniy Terekhov, and others]    [Text] Moscow is convinced that the Russian peacekeepers  will give a strong impetus to the political settlement of the  Georgian- Abkhazian conflict and facilitate the return of the  refugees, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov told  Interfax on Wednesday.    He also said that had not initiated the peacekeeping  operation for the sake of some lofty but empty idea.  "Tranquility and peace in this region is tantamount to stability  in the Caucasus and the south of Russia, although, of course, we  are anxious about the Russian guys, who are in the zone of the  Abkhazian-Georgian conflict now," he said.    Pastukhov announced that "the Russian forces which  constitute  the nucleus of the CIS peacekeeping operation, have been  deployed on the basic positions." "They are equipping posts and  beginning to perform their functions," he said.    He said that the local population had given a warm welcome  to  the Russian units. "After the arrival of the peacekeeping  forces, the population's moods changed for the better. There is  more hope now that combat operations will not be resumed," he  said.    Pastukhov believes that the dramatic problems of the  refugees  are in the forefront now. "On the one hand, the return of the  refugees must not be spontaneous and unorganized. But on the  other, their comeback must not be delayed any longer," he said.    He refused to name the exact number of refugees. He said,  however, that according to Georgia, more than 250,000 people had  left Abkhazia. "I visited the Gali Region recently. It is  empty. The burnt and ruined houses amid the flourishing nature  of Kolchis make a shocking sight," said Pastukhov.</p>

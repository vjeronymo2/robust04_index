			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From 18 January RAHVA HAAL, p 1] </F>   [Text] Tuesday, January 18 -- Estonian-Russian dual  citizenship would present a major threat to Estonians national  security, Minister for Ethnic Affairs Peeter Olesk warned.    "The introduction of the dual citizenship is an element of  the Russian national policy that all the leading Russian  ideologists have been calling for. It would enable a hidden  restoration of the former Soviet Union," Olesk warned.    There are approximately 41,000 Russian citizens in Estonia,  but it is difficult to establish, whether they have dual  citizenship, since Russia is hiding the information, Olesk said.  If the Estonian authorities do not know who the Russian  citizens are, Russia can always consider any act directed  against such persons as a provocation, the minister warned.  These persons will be used as tools in case Russia needs to  prove violations of human rights in Estonia, Olesk predicted.</p>

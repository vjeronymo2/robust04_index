			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (April 22) TURAN -- Today the Milli Majlis of  Azerbaijan began discussions concerning the settlement plan of  Russia of the Azeri-Armenian conflict.    Rasul Guliyev, Speaker of the Azeri Parliament noted that  this plan was proposed in the Moscow CIS leaders Summit on April  14-15.    He also noted that he is due to leave for Moscow on April  25,  during which time the meeting with Armenian representatives will  discuss the abovementioned document.    Gasan Gasanov, the Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan made a  speech giving a summary of the settlement proposal. He noted  that should Azerbaijan sign this document according to the  version proposed by Moscow, Nagorno-Karabakh legally may leave  Azerbaijan.    Gasanov also noted that "acceptance of the plan will give  legitimacy to the ethnic cleansing of Karabakh and at the same  time the cleansing of all local residents from the regions  occupied by Armenians. The main fact is that the document does  not provide for the return of Azerbaijanis to Karabakh. And it  means that Azerbaijan will lose control of its vast territory"  said Gasanov.    After the Azeri Foreign Minister's speech, most deputies of  the Azeri Parliament called the plan "a cynical humiliation of  the national dignity of Azerbaijan. This plan means that  Azerbaijan will be one of humiliation before final capitulation."    The session of Milli Majlis will continue after the break.</p>

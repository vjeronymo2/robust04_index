			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Minister Yosi Sarid, a member of the Israeli team  negotiating with the PLO, said that it was the Palestinian  delegation's constant vacillation which precluded the reaching  of an agreement in Davos, and not disagreements between Prime  Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres.    Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that Sarid  denied allegations made by Nabil Sha'th, according to which  inflexible instructions from Rabin foiled agreement. Sarid  asserted that Sha'th had approved a document formulated by the  delegations and only retracted his agreement after 'Arafat  expressed dissatisfaction with the paper. Minister Sarid that  an exchange of accusations between the two delegations would  neither help nor promote the negotiations. Instead of  continuing to analyze what happened in Davos, Sarid said, we  must prepare for the meeting in Cairo in order to guarantee its  success.</p>

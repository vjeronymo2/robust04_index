			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Arts: Favart the forgotten - Opera-comique rediscoveries IN COMMON parlance the Theatre de l'Opera-Comique is known as the Salle Favart. The street running adjacent its one side is the Rue Favart. There is a Hotel Favart across the way from the front entrance. But otherwise Charles Simon Favart (1710-92), librettist and playwright, is a forgotten figure; the founding role he played in the development of the French popular operatic style will be unknown to all except the most assiduous of opera students. The programme of two small-scale operas on Favart librettos - 'Hommage a Favart' - that has been mounted at the Opera-Comique was no doubt devised with some such enlightening purpose in mind. Happily, it proves not at all dusty exercise in music-historical revival but one of the most delightful - and surprising - evenings of light entertainment I've spent in ages. This beloved small theatre, scene of many landmark events in French opera, has recently re-established a firm identity as the proper Paris stage for operas small, unpretentious, or off the beaten track. The double bill of La Fee Urgele (text by Favart, music by Duni) and La Repetition interrompue (text by Favart, songs from popular stock) made an unbeatable case for its continued existence: would that London possessed, and supported, a Salle Favart of its own] Favart's father, a pastrycook, was a devotee of those popular musical works, descended from the fairground entertainments of the 16th century, in which speech and song were the modes of delivery. His son was soon pouring out texts for various outlets; he was to enjoy a long and picaresque career whose unifying factor was a flair for the genre that was multifarious and forward-looking. It was Favart's driving force, his ability to learn good tricks from the rival Italian troupes who crossed his Paris paths, and his skill in finding new and enjoyable modes of expression for the perennial themes and characters of popular opera, that directly encouraged the development of opera-comique. From the 1750s onward, the use of traditional melodies gave way to that of newly composed airs, and then to the commissioning of properly-worked scores; Favart's close collaboration, in the later stages of his career, with such composers as Monsigny, Philidor and the Vienna-based Gluck indicates in itself the fascinating way opera-comique came in from the streets and the fairgrounds without losing its popular character. The Italian Egidio Duni (1708-75) was another of Favart's regular Paris collaborators; La Fee Urgele (1765) was one of their biggest successes. Favart based the libretto on a Voltaire tale: the testing in love of the knight Robert for Marton, who turns out to be the fairy Urgele, 'protectrice fidele des chevaliers'. Romantic-pastoral elements (a court of love presided over by Queen Berthe and her all-female judges) mingle with supernatural, comic episodes (Robert's unwilling amorous entanglement with an Old Woman, Marton's servant in disguise) with Rousseau-esque sentiment. In this first-rate performance, produced by Jean-Marie Villegier in the enchanting chinoiserie set of Carlo Tommasi, choreographed by Nathalie Van Parys, and with the orchestra of Les Arts Florissants conducted by Christophe Rousset, the surprise was the saltiness of the humour, the crispness of the unfolding, and the wonderfully natural movement between speech and song. Duni's charming overture, dance movements and succession of Italianate airs touch no great depths, undergo no Philidor-like adventures with form; but his melodic fluency and bold sense of colour are gifts by no means to be scorned, nor is the gentle lyricism which informs the later passages of Robert's 'trials'. If there was a fault in Villegier's production, it was perhaps a tendency to overweight with undue emphasis the sentimental aspects of the work: since there had already been a lengthy prologue to La Fee d'Urgele' in the form of the highly amusing Repetition interrompue, and since Act 4 was taken at a distinctly moderate pace, the sum total was a rather long sit. But the expertise of the participants was almost always compensation. On this evidence, the number of young French singers who can use their voices with sweetness and elegance, who can speak, move and dance with easy elegance and command of 18th-century deportment is now enviably large: the sopranos Miriam Ruggeri (a deliciously funny Old Woman) and Monique Zanetti, the tenor Pierre Catala (handsome, witty, and exceptionally musical) and the baritone Jean-Francois Gardeil were only the most prominent of an expert cast, which also included our own Jennifer Smith, that most multilingual of British singers, in sparkling form. This was one of those evenings when a whole neglected area of opera seemed to spring to new life: I hope there will be many more such opera-comique rediscoveries from Villegier and his Arts Florissants colleagues.</p>

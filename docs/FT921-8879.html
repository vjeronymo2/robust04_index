			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / UN likely to intervene in Yugoslavia THE FIRST United Nations peacekeeping operation in continental Europe could begin in a few weeks. The despatch of troops to Yugoslavia became highly likely after Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, announced last night that he would recommend such a move to the Security Council. The peacekeepers are expected to number at least 10,000 and the total deployed may reach 13,000, including civilians, according to UN officials. The first contingent could be in place within 15 days of the formal decision by the Council - which may be taken as soon as the end of next week. Mr Boutros Ghali's recommendation, after weeks of hesitation during which he repeatedly insisted the time was not ripe for UN military intervention, virtually assures Council agreement. He discussed the matter yesterday with representatives of the US, Britain, France, Russia and China, the Council's permanent members, before making the statement. The force, expected to be largely made up of European contingents, would be the largest such UN operation since the intervention in the Congo in the 1960s. It would probably cost Dollars 400m (Pounds 223m) for the first year of operations. In a statement issued last night, Mr Boutros Ghali mentioned 'a number of unanswered questions concerning this operation'. He said he felt strongly that its success was 'predicated upon the full co-operation and support of all the parties in Yugoslavia'. He agreed, however, with Mr Cyrus Vance, his special envoy, that the risks of not intervening were greater. A UN spokesman said: 'There is certainly concern about this operation but there is also the judgment that at this point a decision to deploy is the best possible decision in view of the dangers on the ground if that decision is not taken.' Only last week, Mr Boutros Ghali advised the Security Council that quick action was needed to prevent an unravelling of the truce. But at the time he said it still was not possible to recommend deployment of a large UN force. Mr Franjo Tudjman, president of Croatia, has subsequently assured Mr Vance that he 'fully accepts all the terms of reference of the peace plan' prepared by the secretary-general. Mr Milan Babic, head of the self-proclaimed Serb Republic of Krajina in south-ern Croatia, who earlier re-fused to permit the deployment of UN peacekeepers there, is said to have now been brought into line under pressure from other Serbian leaders. Under the UN plan the Serb-dominated Federal Army would be withdrawn from Croatian territory and all paramilitary forces, including Serbian units, would be disarmed. Mr Marrack Goulding, the UN undersecretary-general in charge of peacekeeping, last night met the ambassadors of some 30 countries that might contribute troops. Conflicting views, Page 2</p>

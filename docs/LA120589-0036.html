			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL OPENS IN EXTORTION MAIL SCHEME;  </P> <P> JUSTICE: PROSECUTORS SAY THEY WILL PROVE TWO MEN SENT THREATENING LETTERS TO  265 ANTELOPE VALLEY RESIDENTS EVEN THOUGH THE EVIDENCE IS CIRCUMSTANTIAL.  </P> <P> The trial of two former aerospace technicians accused of sending hundreds of  "pay-or-die" letters to prominent Antelope Valley residents opened Monday, with  a prosecutor saying he can convict the suspects despite a case based on  circumstantial evidence.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen L. Cooley acknowledged in San Fernando Superior  Court that no single witness or piece of evidence conclusively links Richard  Faroni, 27, and Roman (Moose) Makuch, 28, to the mailing of extortion letters  to about 265 prominent business people, doctors, lawyers and community leaders  in the Antelope Valley in November, 1988.  </P> <P> But Cooley said the evidence shows Makuch and Faroni had the capacity,  equipment and motive to collect information about the people and carry out a  "bizarre but feasible extortion scheme" in which hundreds of thousands of  dollars were demanded, but never collected.  </P> <P> "We have a wide variety of circumstantial evidence," Cooley said in an  interview. "No one piece provides a critical link. But the weight of the  evidence shows they were involved."  </P> <P> Makuch and Faroni pleaded innocent to charges of conspiracy and attempted  extortion and opted for a non-jury trial before Superior Court Judge Ronald S.  Coen. They have spent more than a year in custody and face up to eight years in  prison if convicted.  </P> <P> The letters threatened recipients and their families with grisly deaths and  included details that indicated the writers may have been keeping their  subjects under surveillance. The letters demanded that hundreds of thousands of  dollars be sent to other local residents, some of whom also had received  threatening letters, and it is not clear how the extortionists intended to  collect the money.  </P> <P> Acting on a tip that Makuch and Faroni had bragged of engineering the plot, Los  Angeles County Sheriff's detectives arrested the two on Thanksgiving Day, 1988,  in Las Vegas, where several victims had been instructed to drop off payments.  Detectives confiscated surveillance equipment and small two-way radios of the  type some people were told to bring to Las Vegas, as well as numerous lists,  some containing victims' names.  </P> <P> But the informant has never surfaced and the tip is hearsay, inadmissible as  evidence, Cooley said. Makuch and Faroni have alibis that they were in  Connecticut when the letters were mailed. And there is no physical evidence  directly connecting them to the crime, Cooley said.  </P> <P> Defense attorney William Clark said Monday: "There's a huge quantum leap  between potentiality and reality of accomplishment. I haven't seen anything  that bridges that gap yet. . . . It's distinctly possible they could have done  it. So could have half the people in Lancaster."  </P> <P> Monday's proceedings were dominated by the testimony of Lawrence Mock, who  worked with Makuch and Faroni at Rockwell International. Mock said the three  often discussed commission of the perfect crime, electronic surveillance  tactics and elaborate plots to take revenge on people using letters and  multiple mailings.  </P> <P> But defense attorneys said Mock's testimony is tainted because Cooley's office  charged him with perjury after learning that Mock lied when he said during the  preliminary hearing that he had been a Navy commando and a Los Angeles police  officer. Prosecutors agreed not to use Mock's testimony Monday against him in  the perjury case, in which a plea agreement is being negotiated.  </P></p>

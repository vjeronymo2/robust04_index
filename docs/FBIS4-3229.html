			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Wu Hao (0124 4110)] </F>   [Text] Lhasa, 18 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Tibetan Autonomous  Regional People's Congress Standing Committee recently adopted  "Procedures for Implementing the Law of People's Republic of  China on Compulsory Education." With this, Tibet has embarked  on the road of administering education according to law.    Tibet has made great strides in elementary education since  its peaceful liberation. The school-age children's enrollment  or attendance rate at the end of 1993 was 63.2 percent as  against 2 percent before liberation; the illiteracy rate among  young and middle-aged people dropped from 95 to 44 percent.  Tibet has 3,111 primary schools with a combined enrollment of  213,777 and 71 regular secondary schools with an enrollment of  25,365. As primary education develops, an educational  contingent composed mainly of Tibetan teachers has come into  being and is growing continually. The number of teachers and  other employees in Tibet's primary and secondary schools has  risen to 12,869. Some cities and towns have, for the most part,  attained the goal of universalizing primary education.    Tibet, which was backward to start with and was late in  starting to develop education, still lags behinds other  provinces and regions. To speed up educational development in  Tibet, the recently adopted "procedures for implementing the law  on compulsory education" sets forth the task of implementing  nine-year compulsory education in stages in a well-planned  manner. The "procedures" set the requirements, steps, and  measures for implementing compulsory education in Tibet and  provide guidelines regarding school age, school systems,  funding, teachers' qualifications, administration, evaluation,  and administrative and legal liabilities, thus making it  possible for Tibet's educational undertakings to develop under  legal protection.    Following the adoption of "procedures for implementing the  law on compulsory education" by the regional people's congress,  the regional people's government and educational administrative  departments have also stepped up efforts in formulating rules  and regulations for exercising macroadministration of education.  A number of supplementary rules and regulations, including  suggestions for implementing compulsory education in Tibet,  regulations on decentralized administration in regard to primary  education, regulations on the system of objective-based  management for school years, and standards for schools of all  categories at all levels will soon be promulgated for  implementation.</p>

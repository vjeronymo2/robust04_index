			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Liffe to launch new Eurolira futures contract THE London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) plans to introduce a futures contract on the three-month Eurolira interest rate on May 12. The step follows last week's decision by the Italian Ministry of Finance to drop the 30 per cent withholding tax on domestic interbank deposits. Dealers expect the move to boost activity in Italian money markets and lead to a convergence between the domestic interbank and London-based Eurolira deposit rates. The move was also prompted by 'the continuous increase in size of the Eurolira market (and) the high volatility of Eurolira interest rates,' Liffe said. The introduction of the contract will coincide with 'a change in the attitudes of bank treasurers to the interbank market' and 'a dramatic increase in the need to manage short-term interest rate risk', said Mr Eugenio Namor, a derivatives broker at SanPaolo Bank in London. Liffe had been planning to launch a Eurolira deposit contract for some time, but switched its attention to Italian government bond futures as expected abolition of the withholding tax languished. The bond future, launched in September, is well established, traded 142,000 contracts last month. Liffe trades three-month sterling, Eurodollar, Euromark, Ecu and Euroswiss interest rate future contracts. The contract size is L1bn, with a tick size of L25,000. Settlement will be based on British Bankers' Association rates for three-month Eurolira deposits on the last trading day.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: BPB setback News of the resignation of BPB's chief executive, Mr John Maxwell, after less than a year in office was badly received in the City and was followed by a steep decline in BPB shares. Dealers said Mr Maxwell's resignation, 'by mutual agreement', according to the company, had come as a bolt from the blue and had been interpreted as very bearish news by the market. 'It seems the company has lost direction,' said one leading building sector analyst. He added that Mr Maxwell was viewed by the big institutions as 'a breath of fresh air' at BPB, and much more concerned with making profits rather than opening new plants. 'There is a very real worry that BPB will embark on a campaign to increase market share, with all that entails,' he said. Mr Alan Turner, BPB's chairman, formerly chairman and chief executive until succeeded by Mr Maxwell last year, will reassume the joint role until a successor to Mr Maxwell is found. Analysts said it was likely that having unsuccessfully tried an external appointment to the chief executive post it was likely the position would be filled internally. BPB ended 16, or 6.5 per cent, down at 232p, after touching 229p. Earlier this month the shares reached their highest level, 252 1/2 p, since late-1989. Turnover was a heavy 4.8m.</p>

At a media conference at Lanseria airport  today the IEC announced that another aircraft will be dropping  voter information pamphlets over several areas of  Bophuthatswana. Two airplanes and four trips will ensure that a  quarter of a million leaflets are dropped to Bophuthatswana  citizens. After this trip to Mafikeng, two more flights today  and tomorrow will go to Garankuwa and Taung. The IEC has  already moved into Bophuthatswana.    [Begin IEC spokesman Pieter Cronje recording] We are setting  up offices in Bophuthatswana and distributing information on the  election to the voters of Bophuthatswana, offering them our  assistance to ensure that they have full participation in free  and fair elections. [end recording]    Ten IEC vehicles equipped with loud speakers will soon be  travelling through the streets of Bophuthatswana. They'll be  used to tell citizens what rights they have and how their safety  will be guaranteed.    [Begin Cronje recording] We'll be using all the means at our  disposal, including advertising campaigns, pamphlet campaigns,  the leaflet drops, and voter education programs on radio,  television, and in print.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Explanation of Proposed Amendments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One of the principal reasons the Board is proposing to amend Regulation C is the need to make HMDA data available to the public earlier than has been the case in the past. Statutory amendments to HMDA enacted in 1992 provide that starting with the HMDA reports for calendar year 1994, disclosure statements for individual lenders should be available to the public by July 1 of the following year, and that aggregate tables should be available at the central depositories by September 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To meet this timetable, it will be necessary for the agencies to begin processing the raw data earlier than March 1. Therefore, the proposed amendments include a change in the deadline for data submission, requiring lenders to submit their data by February 1 instead of March 1. Some of the other proposed amendments also are intended, in part, to facilitate earlier availability of the data (see discussion concerning the proposed change to &sect;203.5(a), below).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another important reason the Board is proposing amendments to Regulation C relates to the accuracy of the HMDA data. The accuracy of the HMDA reports produced under the new data collection system that was instituted in 1990 (following an expansion of the data collected under HMDA) has improved in each succeeding year, but concerns continue to exist about data quality. A major part of what is involved in ensuring data accuracy relates to matters that are in the control of reporting institutions; for example, lending institutions must devote adequate resources to the task of accurately compiling and checking data before reporting it. However, to the extent that any requirements of the regulation are unclear or complicated, consistent and accurate reporting is more difficult. Accordingly, some of the proposed amendments now being published are intended in whole or in part to make the reporting requirements clearer or simpler. In addition, another proposed amendment calls for reporting in machine-readable format; this change also should help improve data quality, as discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board solicits comment generally on other ways in which Regulation C might be changed to better address problems of accuracy of the HMDA data. For example, would allowing or requiring all home equity lines to be reported_rather than only the portion of a line the borrower intends to use for home improvement or home purchase_simplify reporting and bring about greater consistency? Would the same be true for other categories of loans? (On a similar point, refer to the discussion of possible changes in the types of refinancings that should be reported, in section (3), ``Other Matters on Which the Board Solicits Comment,'' below.) Are there areas in which explanations could be made simpler or clearer, thereby facilitating more accurate reporting?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board notes its intention to publish within the next several months a proposed staff commentary to Regulation C. The commentary will provide a vehicle for interpretations that would help lenders better understand and comply with the regulation's requirements. The commentary will supplement the detailed instructions provided in appendix A to Regulation C for completion of the HMDA-LAR and in the Guide to HMDA Reporting: Getting It Right, the brochure published by the FFIEC and distributed by the individual agencies. The Board is in the process of drafting the commentary, and solicits comment from lenders identifying specific areas that the commentary should address.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Set forth below is a section-by-section discussion of the proposed amendments to the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 203.2_Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (f)_Home Improvement Loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal would revise the regulation's definition of ``home improvement loan'' to facilitate compliance. The existing definition sets two conditions: first, that the loan applicant state, at the time of the application, that the loan is for the purpose of repairing, rehabilitating, or remodeling a dwelling; and second, that the loan be classified in the records of the financial institution as a home improvement loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One change proposed by the Board relates to the first part of the definition_that the loan be for the purpose of repairing, rehabilitating, or remodeling a dwelling. Questions have arisen about situations in which a loan is made for the purpose of making improvements to the borrower's residential property, but not, strictly speaking, to the ``dwelling'' as defined under Regulation C. The regulation defines dwelling as a residential structure, whether or not attached to real property. Thus, for example, a dwelling under Regulation C includes a house, apartment building, or mobile home, but not necessarily the land upon which the house or other structure is located. Some institutions have asked whether a loan for building or repairing things such as a detached garage, a driveway, a fence, or landscaping should qualify as a home improvement loan for HMDA purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To avoid technical distinctions based on whether a loan relates to the structure or to the land on which it is situated, the Board proposes to change the home improvement loan definition to focus primarily on the applicant's statement of purpose for the loan. Thus, a loan would qualify as a home improvement loan for HMDA purposes if the applicant states, at the time of the loan application, that the loan is for ``home improvement purposes.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Legal Review: A group of young reporters in Indianapolis scored a journalistic  coup by interviewing retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr.,  who told them he was unsure he could "fully agree" with the choice of his  successor, David H. Souter. Brennan retired in July under doctor's orders to  reduce his workload and decline all interviews.  </P> <P> Writers Wendy Potasnik, 17, Lisa Schubert, 10, Kia Woodson, 11, and Rob  Merrill, 15, peppered Brennan, 84, with questions on children's rights, drug  testing and the death penalty for minors.  </P> <P> Decent Pay: Ivana Trump's pay for running the Plaza Hotel has been increased  from $1 per year and all the dresses she can buy to an actual salary, says an  unidentified source quoted in New York magazine. But the magazine adds: "That  clearly won't be enough to let her continue to live like a Trump." A prenuptial  agreement with Donald Trump awards her $20 million if they are divorced.  </P> <P> Native Son: Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said he had to do a lot of cajoling,  but finally got native son and Nobel Prize-winning author Saul Bellow to attend  a 75th birthday bash with 220 friends during the weekend, albeit four months  late. Bellow's birthday is actually June 10.  </P> <P> Appointments: The Secret Service agent credited with saving former President  Ronald Reagan's life will head the agency's Chicago office. Timothy J. McCarthy  was wounded when he put himself between Reagan and gunman John Hinckley Jr. in  the 1981 assassination attempt . . . . Emory University in Atlanta has named  former first lady Rosalynn Carter a distinguished fellow in a new program named  for her which studies women in public policy.  </P></p>

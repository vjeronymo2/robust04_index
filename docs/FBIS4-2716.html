			<p>BFN     [Text] Provincial Party Committee Secretary Li Changchun  yesterday delivered at the provincial discipline inspection  commission sixth plenary session a speech in which he  emphatically called on the party committees and governments at  all levels in the province to acquire an in-depth understanding  of and push forward the ongoing anticorruption struggle in a  thorough and protracted manner.    Secretary Li Changchun stated in his speech at yesterday's  closing session: The ongoing anticorruption struggle is an  important strategic measure aimed at consolidating and enhancing  ties between the CPC and the masses in the new situation,  bolstering the CPC's ruling-party position, and enabling the CPC  to more successfully undertake the important historical mission  of guiding reform, opening up, and the socialist modernization  drive. The ongoing anticorruption struggle is at once the most  effective way to mobilize more than one billion Chinese people  to participate in reform, opening up, and the modernization  drive with burning enthusiasm and the prerequisite of reform,  development, and stability.    Secretary Li Changchun noted: In the next stage of the  anticorruption struggle, we will make continued efforts to  attain the three anticorruption goals put forward by the central  authorities, will conscientiously investigate and tackle local  and departmental problems, will implement to the letter the five  regulations on ensuring honest performance and discipline  observance among party and government cadres at the county or  provincial department section level, as mapped out in 1993 by  the central authorities, will conscientiously carry out the five  new regulations promulgated this year by the central authorities  of ensuring honest performance and discipline observance among  party and government cadres at the county or provincial  department section level, will make redoubled efforts to build  an anticorruption system on the basis of self-examination and  self-rectification among party and government cadres, and will  expedite the pace of investigating and handling major and  serious cases, especially those exposed this year.    Secretary Li Changchun maintained: The party committees and  governments at all levels throughout the province should  strengthen leadership over the investigations into and the  handling of each and every major and serious case, should  resolutely punish corrupt elements irrespective of their rank or  position, and should make continued and redoubled efforts to  straighten out professional malpractices and resolutely wipe out  unreasonable and indiscriminate charges.    Secretary Li Changchun emphatically noted: To successfully  further the ongoing anticorruption struggle, it is imperative to  combat corruption by looking into both the root causes and  symptoms of corrupt phenomena, fundamentally remove the soil  that breeds corruption, and work hard to build a restriction and  supervision mechanism capable of combating corruption and  ensuring a clean government. To this end, it is imperative to  strengthen education and guidance in this regard and step up  legal system building, thereby making it possible for people  from all walks of life in the society to supervise party and  government cadres.    Secretary Li Changchun asserted: The fundamental difference  between the CPC and other political parties lies in the fact  that the CPC has all along maintained close ties with the broad  masses of the people, this being one of the CPC's fine  traditions and styles. Carrying forward such a fine tradition  and fine style still has great significance in the new situation  of socialist market economic structural building. As long as we  continue to maintain close ties with the masses and resolutely  eradicate corrupt phenomena, the CPC and the broad masses of  cadres and people will be able to forge ahead with one heart and  one mind and maintain long-term political stability.    Secretary Li Changchun stressed: The on-going anticorruption  struggle is an important political task for the entire party.  Party committees and governments at all levels in the province  should attach utmost importance to, should earnestly strengthen  leadership over, and should protractedly further the struggle in  accordance with a series of principles and policies mapped out  by the central authorities. The principal party and government  leaders should take personal charge of and assume overall  responsibility for the ongoing anticorruption struggle and  should also study, coordinate, arrange for, and press ahead with  the on-going anticorruption struggle in a timely fashion.    Yesterday's closing session was attended by a number of  provincial party, government, and military leaders, including  Ren Keli, Song Zhaosu, Lin Yinghai, Wu Guangxian [provincial  military district political commissar], Zheng Zengmao  [provincial higher people's court president], Song Guochen,  Zhang Deguang, Zhang Wenbin, Liu Yujie.</p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / International Company News: Comalco studies sale of US unit Comalco, the Australian aluminium producer controlled by the CRA mining group, is considering selling a 100 per cent holding in Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation, its Kentucky-based aluminium products operation, through a public flotation in the US. The Australian company said yesterday it had filed a prospectus with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, although it stressed it would not make a final decision until February. In the prospectus, Comalco said it was looking at selling 10m shares, with underwriters' over-allotment options comprising a further 1.5m. The indicated price is USDollars 23.75. Although there is no guarantee that this will be the actual price at which the shares are sold, it indicates a potential stock market valuation for CAC of about Dollars 270m. Comalco acquired the US operations from Martin Marietta, the defence group, almost a decade ago. CAC, which takes in aluminium rolling and recycling facilities in Lewisport, Kentucky, has remained a separate entity within the Comalco group of operations. According to Comalco's last annual report, CAC made a small loss in 1993, in spite of record production and sales levels.</p>

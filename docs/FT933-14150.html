			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: First Chicago net up at Dollars 160m A RISE of 75 per cent in non-interest income at First Chicago, the thirteenth-largest bank in the US last year ranked by assets, pushed net income up to Dollars 169m, or Dollars 1.81 a share, from Dollars 35m, or 32 cents, a year earlier. Increased income from trading in financial markets and a further strong performance by the bank's venture capital investments largely accounted for the rise. Profits from trading short-term interest rate and bond derivatives, and from trading in emerging markets, lifted dealing profits to Dollars 92m. Meanwhile, venture capital holdings turned in earnings of Dollars 57m, or 67 cents, against a Dollars 21m loss a year earlier. Non-interest income was also boosted by a rise in credit-card fees during the quarter to Dollars 164.2m from Dollars 116.6m in the same period in 1992. Total non-interest income leapt to Dollars 540m from Dollars 288m. Net interest income edged ahead to Dollars 303m from Dollars 290m as First Chicago continued to shrink its loan assets. These fell to Dollars 22bn from Dollars 25bn, resulting from securitisation of Dollars 1bn of credit-card receivables and a continuation of the move away from lending to large companies. Lending to small and medium-sized companies in and around Chicago remained steady. Loan demand from this sector had begun to strengthen, though the bank had not relaxed its credit policies, said Mr John Ballantine, chief credit officer. The work-out of troubled real-estate loans continued, with the disposal of nearly Dollars 200m of assets to leave a portfolio of Dollars 402m. The gains during the quarter pushed the bank's return on capital to 21 per cent, and enabled it to raise key tier one capital ratio to a comfortable 8 per cent, from 6 per cent as recently as last September.</p>

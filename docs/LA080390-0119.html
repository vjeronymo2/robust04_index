			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. ARABS ANXIOUSLY AWAIT NEWS FROM HOME  </P> <P> A frantic Michael Marwan Sbaita waited anxiously by the telephone Thursday,  hoping for word that relatives stranded in Kuwait were safe from invading Iraqi  forces, and he spoke angrily of the U.S. government's and other Arab countries'  failure to intervene militarily.  </P> <P> "I am just devastated," said Sbaita, a 30-year-old international marketing  representative for a Tustin computer firm. "I cannot get over the fact that the  United States of America is doing nothing and other Arab nations are doing  nothing to help Kuwait."  </P> <P> Sbaita said he has been unable to contact his two brothers and a sister in the  suburbs of Kuwait City.  </P> <P> Relatives in Jordan, including Sbaita's parents who were on vacation from their  homeland, have gotten word from a cousin who has been stranded in her bank  office in downtown Kuwait because of the invading troops.  </P> <P> "Why is there American silence?" Sbaita asked in anguish. "I have no clue where  my family is right now. . . . I can't begin to explain what sort of agony I am  going through."  </P> <P> Sbaita, who was born in Kuwait to Palestinian parents, was one of a number of  Arabs living in Orange County who nervously watched developments in the  oil-rich Persian Gulf nation.  </P> <P> At a meeting Thursday night of the Arab-American Republican Party of Orange  County, members expressed concern and alarm about the volatile situation in the  Middle East.  </P> <P> "Something has got to be done to stop the killing," said George Hanna, 61, of  Santa Ana, whose parents are from Syria.  </P> <P> Most members of the Arab-American organization, a political action committee,  generally indicated they did not favor American intervention in the conflict  unless U.S. interests become threatened.  </P> <P> Elias Bordcosh, 43, of Fountain Valley, a Palestinian who grew up in Lebanon,  said he believes "not one American life" should be expended in trying to quell  the Iraqi invasion.  </P> <P> Another club member, Kamal Shublak, 43, of Westminster, also a Palestinian,  said he also opposes American intervention "for any political reasons," but he  said the United States may have to act in the conflict for economic reasons.  </P> <P> "I am very worried about another oil shortage like we had in 1973," said  Shublak. He added that if an oil shortage threatens the American economy, the  United States should become involved to protect its interests.  </P> <P> "I think this is something that the Arab League should deal with in a peaceful  manner," said Mounzer Chaarani, 48, of North Tustin. Chaarani, a native of  Lebanon, said he did not think the United States should become embroiled in the  conflict. "Non-Arab countries should be very careful about this situation," he  said.  </P> <P> Many of the several hundred Iraqis in Orange County expressed dismay that  Iraq's president, military strongman Saddam Hussein, decided to unleash tanks,  military aircraft and ground troops on its smaller neighbor.  </P> <P> "I'm very saddened by it, it's terrible," said one Iraqi living in Orange  County who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals against relatives  in Iraq and Kuwait. "I thought they would settle the dispute through  negotiation instead of using force."  </P> <P> He predicted that Kuwait would be only the first step in the Iraqi president's  march to bolster his own troubled economy after the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.  </P> <P> "First you go to Kuwait, then you go to Bahrain," he said of another oil-rich  Persian Gulf kingdom without a strong military force to defend itself against  invaders. "If Hussein takes Kuwait, it means millions (of dollars) a day in oil  revenue that would be Iraqi money. . . . It's the money, the oil and the  dollar, that's why Iraq and Iran went to war. And that's why Iraq invaded  Kuwait. It's the same story."  </P> <P> Tareef Nashashibi, 32, of Anaheim said he managed to get a telephone line at  1:30 a.m. Thursday to his brother-in-law, who lives near the Sha'ab Palace,  ministry building in the Kuwaiti capital that was reported in flames later in  the day.  </P> <P> "They have heard gunshots and planes, and my brother-in-law had to evacuate his  apartment at one point," said Nashashibi, a general contractor who has been  living in Orange County since 1988.  </P> <P> He said he also got a telephone call through to a cousin in Salwa, a suburb of  the capital, who said there were reports of fighting in the streets and the  sound of planes overhead.  </P> <P> "It's very sketchy right now, we're not sure what is going on," Nashashibi  said. "They can hear shooting, and they can hear some bombs, but nobody knows  exactly what the situation is.  </P> <P> "A lot of people in Kuwait didn't know about (the invasion) until they got  telephone calls from the U.S."  </P> <P> For now, Nashashibi said he was relieved that relatives appear to be unharmed  but was warily monitoring news reports and keeping in touch with a network of  friends and relatives throughout the Middle East, Europe and the United States.  </P> <P> "Since everybody's OK, it has calmed us down a little bit. But you get worried.  . . . It's a very volatile situation. Kuwait does not have a lot of guns and  ammunition," he said.  </P> <P> Several natives of Kuwait described Hussein as a madman, yet they said they  bear no ill will toward the Iraqi people.  </P> <P> "We cannot stereotype (the people) because of some political maneuvers on the  part of the government," Sbaita said.  </P> <P> But Nashashibi echoed the weariness of many Arabs at the relentless conflicts  in the Middle East.  </P> <P> "We have had enough bloodshed in the region," he said. "Enough of brother  shooting brother."  </P> <P> Times correspondent Tom McQueeney contributed to this story.  </P></p>

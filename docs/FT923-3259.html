			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Rabin's hint of land compromise angers Israeli right THE Israeli government faced a chorus of protest over the weekend over its willingness to exchange occupied territory on the Golan Heights for peace with Syria as its team of negotiators flew to Washington for the resumption today of Middle East peace talks. For the first time since it lost power to the Labour party and its left-liberal allies in the general election in June, right-wingers, led by the Likud party of former prime minister Yitzhak Shamir, mounted a high profile demonstration against the new government, massing thousands of protesters at Ben Gurion airport as the negotiating team departed. Mr Itamar Rabinovitch, Israel's chief negotiator with Syria, said he hoped progress would be made in Washington over the next 10 days on agreeing a 'joint document of principles' with Syria. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, said he wanted hitherto unscheduled further talks with Syria and the Palestinians, Jordan and Lebanon in October, instead of waiting until after the US elections in November. However, Mr Rabinovitch said progress in the talks was bound to be slow. 'Breakthroughs and also painful concessions are of a sort that they will come, if they will come, later and not at this point.' Israel yesterday issued a formal public protest against the decision by US President George Bush to sell up to 72 F-15 warplanes to Saudi Arabia, saying it would continue to make its view know 'to those in power and the public in the United States'.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Brussels scraps proposals for rules in 'house-clearing' THE European Commission is scrapping around 150 proposals for new EC legislation, a sign that its appetite for making new Community rules is waning. The rules cover transport, energy, science, telecommunications, consumer policy, financial affairs, the environment and agriculture. Many are out of date, while others have been incorporated in revised proposals. Some are 'no longer considered appropriate in current circumstances', according to a Commission spokesman. Among the most eye-catching are rules for harmonising national legislation covering noise emissions from rail vehicles; rules covering the EC's participation in an international conference in Geneva on the protection of vegetable extracts; and a resolution calling for action to encourage libraries in Europe to co-operate on the use of new information technologies. An EC official described the withdrawal of the 150 proposals as a routine 'house-cleaning exercise'. He said it was quite separate from the Commission's efforts to root out redundant proposals for legislation which EC leaders agreed at last December's EC summit in Edinburgh. This campaign is sensitive because it contains legislative proposals currently in train. Germany, France and the UK believe it could prove a true test of 'subsidiarity' - devolving power to the lowest appropriate national, regional or municipal level. Earlier this week, the UK and France agreed a list of 24 items of EC legislation which should be amended or withdrawn. These include EC directives on employment conditions for workers in privatised industries, on taxation of stock exchange transactions, and on water quality.</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Industrial earnings in China surge CHINESE industry more than doubled its earnings in the first five months of 1993, according to figures released yesterday, Reuter reports from Beijing. The State Statistics Bureau said the country's 357,000 industrial enterprises earned nearly Yn51.3bn (Pounds 5.9bn) from January to May, a 110 per cent increase over the same period last year, the official China Daily newspaper reported. Sales were up nearly 40 per cent to Yn1,104bn and pre-tax profits rose nearly 50 per cent to Yn129.6bn. 'The impressive gains concealed problems that, if not resolved in good time, might drain the economy and stifle market demand,' the bureau was quoted as saying. 'The speed-up in industrial production has been excessive and has created tension between sectors of the economy.' The official Xinhua news agency said efficiency at large and medium-size state enterprises was up 17 per cent. It attributed this to more autonomous management, growth of heavy industry and rising consumption in coastal provinces. Much of the earnings gain came from the enterprises.</p>

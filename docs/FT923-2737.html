			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Alchem and United Drug discuss merger MERGER TALKS are at an advanced stage between United Drug, the Dublin-based pharmaceutical distributor, and Alchem, the parent company of Sangers, Northern Ireland's largest pharmaceutical wholesaler. The combined group would have turnover in excess of IPounds 110m (Pounds 105m). In a statement United Drug said 'These discussions may lead to an amalgamation of the interest of the two companies and an announcement on the outcome will be made in due course.'

It distributes to 1,000 pharmacy outlets in the Irish Republic, a quarter of which hold 15 per cent of the company's shares. It also holds the Vantage franchise in Ireland, a retailing system developed by AAH Pharmaceuticals, one of the the UK's leading distribution companies. United Drug reported a 10 per cent increase in sales in 1991 to IPounds 63m, and a 13 per cent growth in pre-tax profits to IPounds 2.7m. The company obtained a full listing in London and Dublin in March this year. Its shares closed up 5p at 175p yesterday. Alchem is an unquoted company, but has more than a third of the retail pharmacists in Northern Ireland as shareholders. It reported turnover of Pounds 43m in its accounts to March 1991.</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KIDNAPERS DELAY RELEASE OF HOSTAGE, BLAME U.S.  </P> <P> Pro-Iranian kidnappers said today they have postponed the release of an  American hostage because the United States failed to meet their demand to send  a senior State Department official to Syria.  </P> <P> The announcement came in an Arabic-language statement delivered by Islamic  Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine to the independent Beirut newspaper An  Nahar and a Western news agency.  </P> <P> The handwritten statement was accompanied by an instant picture of Robert  Polhill, one of U.S. educators held by the group since Jan. 24, 1987.  </P> <P> The kidnapers said on Wednesday that they were freeing one of the three  American educators they are holding within 24 hours, or by Friday evening. The  other two are Jesse Turner and Alann Steen.  </P> <P> The group said at the time that it was acting in response to requests from Iran  and Syria, whose leaders have encouraged an end to the hostage crisis, and  implied that some sort of exchange was involved.  </P> <P> The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine had demanded that John Kelly,  U.S. assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, fly to Damascus "to  coordinate some final steps" leading to the release.  </P> <P> It did not specify what they expect of Kelly, the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon  from 1983 to 1988. He was in Bonn, West Germany, on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III cautiously welcomed the reports but said  Kelly had no plans to fly to the Middle East "at the present time."  </P> <P> "As for the release of the American hostage, arrangements had been under way on  a basis that they would be concluded and finalized. But Kelly's failure to  respond has so far frustrated the release, which made us postpone this  operation until the picture is cleared," today's statement said.  </P> <P> Earlier today, White House spoesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Administration  did not want to given any appearances of negotating with terrorists for a  hostage's freedom.  </P> <P> But the State Department today dispatched a reception team to Wiesbaden, West  Germany, "where they have the medical facilities to receive any hostage that  might be released," Fitzwater said.  </P></p>

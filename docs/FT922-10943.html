			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: Berliner Bank posts strong rise to DM56.4m BERLINER Bank yesterday announced strong profits, a higher dividend and plans for a capital increase. Earnings rose sharply by 37.5 per cent last year to DM56.4m (Dollars 34.3m) as the bank expanded strongly in east Berlin and eastern Germany. The dividend is raised from 10 to 12 per cent. Mr Wolfgang Steinriede, board spokesman, said the increase was a 'first step' towards attaining the level of other leading German banks. For the first three months of 1992 pre-tax profits rose 69 per cent to DM90m. Mr Steinriede said the earnings outlook for the remainder of the year was 'very promising'. The bank plans shortly to raise fresh capital of at least DM500m in two stages to cope with the expansion of business. Berliner Bank was still interested in merging with Landesbank Berlin, the former Sparkasse of Berlin, said Mr Steinriede. But the City of Berlin, which controls 56 per cent of Berliner Bank, had yet to give its approval. Some analysts feel that the increase in capital could be interpreted as meaning the bank was now less eager to acquire Landesbank. Berliner Bank benefited from the reduction in turnover tax and investment benefits granted to Berlin companies by the German government. In the past, export-oriented Berlin companies first delivered their goods to an affiliate in west Germany in order to get VAT reductions for the company and for the buyer. Only then were the products exported to third countries with the financing usually arranged by west German banks. This business was now being picked up directly in Berlin. Berliner Bank, which merged last year with Berliner Stadtbank in east Berlin, has 28 branches in east Berlin and eastern Germany where it has gained 120,000 new customers. It is looking further east and has established links with Wielkopolski Bank, one of the largest private Polish banks located in Poznan, western Poland.</p>

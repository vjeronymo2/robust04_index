			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Customary and correct to 'Du' Sir, Regarding the letter 'To 'Du' or not' (May 17), Peter Frankel may not be aware of it, but it is customary to use Du between elected parliamentarians. Consequently you would expect Chancellor Kohl to use that kind of term with his British colleague, Prime Minister John Major. Condescension does not enter into this.

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Ciba-Geigy sales slip 3.6% in third quarter CONSOLIDATED sales of Ciba-Geigy, the Basle-based chemical and pharmaceutical group, fell 3.6 per cent in the third quarter to SFr4.87bn (Dollars 3.75bn) due to the strengthening of the Swiss franc against other currencies and depressed conditions in some group businesses. However, the group said it expects for the full year 'an increase in profits thanks to good development of business in the healthcare and industry sectors and consistent cost management'. For the nine months, group sales rose 7 per cent to SFr17.13bn. There was no distortion from currency conversions. Sales of the pharmaceutical division, the largest in the group, rose 16 per cent to SFr4.7bn. The other health care businesses posted increases of between 9 and 14 per cent. Sales of the agriculture division division were flat at SFr4.1bn, with the plant protection business down 9 per cent to SFr3.5bn.</p>

			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RETRENCHMENT AT SECURITY PACIFIC;  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> BANK MADE PUSH INTO A FIELD NOW JUDGED TOO RISKY;  </P> <P> FINANCING: IT HOPED TO REAP LARGE FEES FROM THE TYPE OF MERCHANT BANKING  ACTIVITIES THAT BROKERAGES CARRY OUT. BUT THERE WERE TOO MANY PLAYERS.  </P> <P> Security Pacific's move to disband its merchant banking division threatens to  further remove grease from the wheels of corporate finance in California -- the  network of lenders that provides capital and financial advice to companies.  </P> <P> But if Security indeed exits completely from such fields as merger advisement  and leveraged-buyout lending, it won't leave much of a vacuum in the short run,  the bank's competitors say.  </P> <P> Most investment bankers admit that there are far too many deal makers vying for  a shrinking pie; in any case, they say, Security's corporate finance strategy  didn't seem well-focused.  </P> <P> Of greater concern to competitors and to corporate clients is whether  Security's troubles in merchant banking foretell greater financial problems for  the bank in the long run.  </P> <P> Security's announcement Monday that it will refocus on its traditional lending  businesses did not specify all of the merchant-banking businesses it will  depart. But it will shrink or shut down completely its corporate lending  activities in Europe and Australia, and overall about 4,000 jobs worldwide  could be cut as the bank exits other facets of merchant banking.  </P> <P> The broad umbrella of "merchant banking" encompasses a multitude of businesses  at Security, as at most of California's large commercial banks. Generally,  merchant banking involves those corporate finance activities beyond the scope  of straightforward lending to businesses: merger-deal financing, leveraged  buyout lending, underwriting of corporate bonds and, perhaps most important,  international lending.  </P> <P> What most merchant-banking businesses have in common is that they typically are  riskier than traditional banking.  </P> <P> Security's lunge into merchant banking in the 1980s was part of a dramatic  expansion by major American commercial banks into new fields. The wave was  partly designed to combat Wall Street brokerages' increasing pilferage of  banks' traditional corporate customers. Banks felt that they needed to offer  their business customers new financing options to keep up with brokerages.  </P> <P> Also, as takeover mania soared worldwide, banks saw merger-advisory and  financing as a great way to snare new fee income.  </P> <P> Security jumped into international merchant-banking in a big way in 1982, when  it bought 30% of London-based brokerage Hoare Govett. In 1987, Security took  over Hoare Govett completely and also bought 30% of Burns Fry Ltd., one of  Canada's major brokerages.  </P> <P> Further, the bank expanded its merger-advisory business in the United States  throughout the 1980s, often hiring star investment bankers away from Wall  Street brokerages at big salaries.  </P> <P> "The commercial banks in general came after Wall Street and busted the salary  scale," said one Los Angeles investment banker.  </P> <P> Security's aggressiveness also extended to the pricing of services, competitors  say. "They were willing to work on the cheap," one Los Angeles competitor said.  If a company wanted an estimate of what a division might fetch if sold,  Security might charge $50,000 for what a Wall Street brokerage would charge  $100,000, competitors say.  </P> <P> The goal, of course, was to build market share. Security also was able to use  its leverage with existing corporate customers to sell new corporate-finance  services, competitors say.  </P> <P> But many executives in the Los Angeles offices of Wall Street brokerages  maintain that Security tried to do too much under merchant-banking chief David  R. Lovejoy, and that its strategy wasn't clear. "They just never pulled it  off," said one executive at a regional brokerage. Lovejoy did not take phone  calls Monday.  </P> <P> Even in 1989, while the takeover business still flourished, profit at  Security's merchant-banking arm was disappointing. Its return on average  assets, a measure of earning power, was just 0.61% last year. In contrast, the  bank's retail-banking division earned 2.27% on assets.  </P> <P> Security's merchant-banking division has had some major successes, including a  money-management unit that invests $25 billion for clients, and the Sequor  Group, which handles clearing and settlement of securities. Competitors believe  that Security will keep both of those operations, melding them into other parts  of the bank.  </P> <P> But Security's investment in Hoare Govett soured as trading and financing in  Europe dried up after the 1987 stock market crash. "It became a sinkhole for  them," said one Los Angeles money-management professional. Also, Security now  is suffering major loan problems in Britain and Australia. In September, the  bank opted to get rid of 51% of its Hoare stake by selling it to the  brokerage's managers.  </P> <P> The final blow to Security, as to many other banks and brokerages in merchant  banking, was the plunge in merger and takeover activity worldwide this year.  Caught with a staff full of investment bankers and other professionals,  Security now is merely following the lead of its competitors, slashing payroll  and entire divisions.  </P> <P> Now, beyond the piecemeal decisions about what to keep and what to jettison  from merchant banking, Security also must show that the international loan  portfolio its investment bankers built up in the 1980s isn't full of more  disasters waiting to happen, competitors say.  </P> <P> MAIN STORY: A1  </P> <P> </P> <P> TRACKING SECURITY PACIFIC STOCK  </P> <P> The stock market applauded the bank's move to curtail risky investment banking  activities and lifted the price $1 a share.  </P> <P> Tuesday close: $23, up $1.  </P> <P> SECURITY: HOW THE PIECES FIT  </P> <P> Profits and losses of Security Pacific Corp.'s key divisions in 1989.  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.31IN:3.54IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Division  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989 profit (millions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Retail banking  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $344.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Financial services system  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 174.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Merchant Bank  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 145.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Business banking  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 139.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Interstate banking  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -59.0 (loss)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Other  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -4.6 (loss)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> TOTAL, SECURITY PAFICIC CORP.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $740.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> MERCHANT BANKING LAGGED  </P> <P> Security's Merchant Bank was one of the firm's least profitable divisions,  measured by return on average assets, a key measure of bank profitability.  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.87IN:3.98IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Division  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989 return on avg. assets  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Retail banking  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2.27%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Financial services system  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.29%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Business banking  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.16%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Merchant Bank  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.61%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Interstate banking  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -0.38% (loss)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: Security Pacific Corp.  </P></p>

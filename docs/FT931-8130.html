			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Late demand surge firms up markets Wall Street A DIFFICULT week ended with US markets in a calm, if still slightly nervous, mood, although the leading stock indices finished notably firmer due to a late surge of demand linked to options expirations, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 19.99 at 3,322.18, at its high for the day. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 also ended strongly, finishing up 2.30 at 434.20, while the Amex composite closed up 0.10 at 402.38, and the Nasdaq composite up 1.17 at 663.62. Trading volume on the NYSE was 309m shares, and rises outnumbered declines by 1,260 to 671. After the tribulations of Tuesday and Thursday, when share prices gyrated wildly and posted big losses following news of President Bill Clinton's first budget plans, share prices spent most of the morning session trading narrowly on either side of opening values. Underneath the a calm surface , however, there were various undercurrents, most of them created by trading related to the monthly expiration of stock-index options, an event which, despite threatening to create considerable volatility in the afternoon session, passed uneventfully. Some investors and analysts drew comfort from the market's ability to hold its own late on Thursday (when the Dow bounced back from a 44-point deficit to end just 10 points lower), and again yesterday, in the wake of the heavy selling earlier in the week. Among individual sectors, bank stocks roared ahead, buoyed by low interest rates, and comments from Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, who told Congress that, as the economic situation improved, banks and thrift companies were ready to meet increased loan demand. Citicorp rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 26 1/4 , BankAmerica added Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 52 1/8 , Chemical firmed Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 41, Banc One rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 51 7/8 , Wells Fargo jumped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 92 7/8 , and Chase Manhattan climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 30 3/4 . Drug stocks, however, once again tumbled, still troubled by fears that, as part of healthcare reforms, the president will impose restrictions on pharmaceuticals prices. Pfizer led the way lower, dropping Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 54 1/2 in volume of 3.7m shares, followed by Merck, which fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 36 7/8 in volume of 3.3m shares, Schering-Plough, down Dollars 3 at Dollars 53 3/4 , and Bristol-Myers Squibb, Dollars 1 1/2 weaker at Dollars 54 5/8 . Canada TORONTO closed higher in moderate trading, as a modest late-afternoon rally helped the market end the week on a strong note. The 300 composite index rose 16.89 points, or 0.50 per cent. to close at 3,426.31. On the week, the index fell about 19 points. All 14 sub-indices closed higher on the day, led by real estate, up 2.0 per cent on news that the last of Bramalea's creditor groups approved the company's restructuring plan. 'A' stock of Trizec, which owns 67 per cent of Bramalea, rose 0.20 to 2.65, while Trizec 'B' climbed 0.30 to 2.80.</p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Sport: In Jack's tracks - FT Ski Expedition Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are attempting to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition. They are currently in South America. During our first visit to Portillo, Chile, in June, we had gazed longingly at a run called Roca Jack but it had remained shut because of lack of snow. On this visit, we awoke to find it knee-deep in powder after a two-day storm. Jack was British. In spring, he used to climb up to a rock on a steep avalanche face, sit there, and marvel at the icy waters of the Laguna del Inca stretched out beneath him. Then, when the snow had softened in the afternoon sun, he would ski down. Jack's rock is now immortalised as Portillo's most exhilarating lift-served run. And what a lift. The extraordinary contraption was built specially to serve this steep, avalanche-prone chute: it comprises two sets of five Poma platters harnessed together, one at the bottom of the run, the other at the top, linked by cables suspended in mid-air and driven by an electric motor. The five skiers have to hold on tight as they are whisked almost half a mile up the mountainside at great speed. They come to a sudden halt at the top and must disengage themselves backwards (very awkward on a steep slope). On the way down, Jimmy Ackerson, the ski school director of both Portillo and Heavenly (California), had the treat of making the first tracks, snaking from top to bottom without stopping. Lucy and I floated, swam and finally sank after him with tracks far more erratic. But we arrived at the bottom elated. When the time came to leave, our borrowed vehicle needed to be thawed out, and, with dusk approaching, we set out on a spectacular drive across the Argentine border and down the other side of the Uspallata Pass: one of the most extraordinary journeys of our travels, through a vast landscape that could have been in remotest Arizona or even Afghanistan.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Roman Shpek, by Viktor Tkachuk for UPresA </F> [Ukrainian Press Agency]; place and date not given: "Roman  Shpek: 'There Are Two Mysteries That I Cannot Comprehend--The  Mystery of the Immaculate Conception and That of a Budget  Without a Deficit....'"]    [Text]    [UPresA] At a meeting with journalists, Yukhym Zvyahilskyy  talked about the decrease in the inflation rate. Just how was  this achieved?    [Shpek] By a restrictive credit policy on the part of the  National Bank and the government.    [UPresA] Do you mean the nonpayment of wages?    [Shpek] No, that is another factor entirely. Even those  credits that went to the producers were transferred to Special  Account 726, where they served the purpose of moving goods  through the system; but they could not be instantly transferred  to dispersal accounts and paid out as wages. The decrease in the  inflation rate is merely one of the factors attesting to the  state of our economy. We achieved it at a very dear price--by a  decline in production. Moreover, the decline in production was  influenced not only by the National Bank's restrictive policy,  but also by the reduction in demand for goods in the domestic  market. First and foremost, this refers to a decline in the  population's purchasing power and a reduction in the demand from  enterprises. But I am profoundly convinced that unless we  disconnect the state's finances from those of enterprises, we  will not be able to overcome our economic crisis. You must know  and understand that nowadays--for some reason--we are saying the  following: "Let the National Bank emit more money!" But now let  us thoroughly analyze the state of affairs in those enterprises  that are presently operating under the conditions of freedom  from the ministry's controls. One enterprise has turned out a  product and set a price on it, taking inflation into account,  and it wants to pay its people good wages. This enterprise "A"  has delivered its products to another enterprise "B," but the  latter has no money to pay for them, and the debts between them  increase. And this too is a modest-sized emission center. But  enterprises are really property owned by the state, and--if not  today, then tomorrow--the state will bear responsibility for  them.    [UPresA] Are you alluding to bankruptcy?    [Shpek] Unfortunately, yes. But bankruptcy is not the end of  the world; it is simply a matter of changing owners. If we  disconnect the finances of the state and those of enterprises,  then even under state ownership (a joint-stock company wherein  the controlling bloc of shares is possessed by the state), the  leading officials will think carefully about what expenditures  can be undertaken. And if the enterprise in question should burn  down, it could still settle its accounts by means of the  mortgage deposit or by that portion of the property that could  still be sold.    [UPresA] On 4 May, a government directive was issued on the  matter of preparing reforms in the tax system. What steps have  already been taken in this sector?    [Shpek] A discussion is now taking place with regard to  cutting the excise tax. Our tax policy must be such that  something flows into the budget, or else no revenues would be  formed for expenditures. But it must not strangle the producer.  Why is the excise tax being looked at hard for possible cuts?  Because the level of production in the alcoholic-beverage  industry fell by 63 percent during the first quarter. A group of  experts is working on a new concept for our tax policy.  Certainly the value-added tax will also be reviewed. In general,  we must determine and designate just what this value added shall  be. We must introduce taxes on land, on fixed capital, and on  the population's income. But we do not yet have a system for  tracking the population's income. And certainly wages are not a  complete measure of income. Nor should we consider that the  state simply wants to take things away from people. It is  possible that if people's incomes were sufficient, then we would  not have to give them reduced rates for electric power, free  textbooks, and so on.    [UPresA] But how is this tax review to be done in a  practical  sense? Because, of course, the revenues and expenditures have  already been approved; and the budget as a whole has been  approved without a deficit. The same VAT [value-added tax] that  you mentioned is the budget's largest revenue-producing item....    [Shpek] I have worked very hard to improve myself, but there  are still two things that I cannot comprehend--two mysteries  which are wrapped in an enigma. They are the mystery of the  Immaculate Conception and a budget without a deficit.    [UPresA] But why, then, was it accepted and approved this  time?    [Shpek] That is already another matter. The problem lies not  in the high inflation rate per se, but rather in the ability to  live under the conditions of a high inflation rate. People have  to calculate their earnings ahead of time, and enterprises must  learn how to take inflation into account. The same thing is true  at the state level. The situation certainly would not have been  so difficult if the prices on gas had been changed as soon as  they were changed in Russia. If the prices on coal in October  1993 had been changed by a factor of 2.3, then--beginning on 1  January 1994--they would have risen by a factor of only 5.7.    [UPresA] Why is it that certain signs of reform are  beginning  to appear at precisely this time? Is this a kind of tribute to  the political situation wherein the government may--possibly--be  changed or even replaced by the new parliament?    [Shpek] No, this is not the result of the pressure of  circumstances. It is simply that the government has returned to  a former proposal made by the Ministry of the Economy. We  introduced this proposal and such lessons when the draft of the  1994 Plan was already being worked out. But these ideas were  rejected at that time. Practical life, however, has demonstrated  the necessity of taking such steps. They will be taken not  because somebody wants to look good, but rather because this is  what the economy demands.    [UPresA] Thank you.</p>

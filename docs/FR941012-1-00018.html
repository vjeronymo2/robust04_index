			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The process described above led to the development of over 500 ``candidate'' alternative financial tests. These candidate financial tests were then evaluated in a similar manner against the samples of bankrupt and non-bankrupt firms to determine their ability to pass non-bankrupt firms capable of meeting their financial assurance obligations (availability or ``A'') and their ability to screen out bankrupt firms that would enter bankruptcy without the means to meet those obligations (misprediction or ``M''). From these candidates, ``dominant'' tests were selected, i.e., tests with the highest ability to pass non-bankrupt firms for given levels of bankruptcy misprediction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency then calculated the public and private cost of each ``dominant'' test. The Agency defined public costs as the costs to the public sector of paying for financial assurance obligations for firms that pass the test but later go bankrupt without funding their obligations, and private costs as the cost to viable firms of obtaining alternative financial assurance mechanisms when they cannot pass the test. The amount of public and private costs associated with a particular test depends on the test's performance in terms of its availability to viable firms and its ability to screen out bankrupt firms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Select a Financial Test for Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency then identified a set of low-cost tests, and selected a test from that group for proposal. The Agency based its selection on policy considerations as well as the total costs of the financial tests. The Agency took this approach, rather than select the lowest cost test, because several tests had very similar total costs but different balances between public and private costs. Using this modified cost-effectiveness approach, the Agency was able to consider the balance of public and private costs among tests of approximately equal total costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Exhibit 1 presents total public and private costs of the top two tests identified. Test 94 was the lowest-cost test analyzed, but the Agency proposed Test 902 in the July 1, 1991, rule for several reasons. First, Test 94 included a tax rate adjustment (FR) in the cash flow ratio which may change over time, thus making it a more difficult test to implement and verify. (The estimate shown in Exhibit 1 is that all firms are subject to a 34 percent corporate tax rate). In contrast, Test 902 required a cash flow ratio adjusted by a set value of $10 million, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  rather than by a tax adjusted cost estimate. Second, Test 902 required a net worth of $10 million plus the amount of the cost to be assured (an additive requirement), whereas Test 94 required that the net worth be at least $10 million and that it be at least the amount of the cost to be assured. The Agency believed that the net worth additive requirement of Test 902 would ensure that a firm has net worth sufficient to cover its financial assurance obligations and has an additional $10 million in net worth to cover other debts and obligations as necessary. Finally, Test 902 had a different balance of public and private costs than Test 94. Because it is less available to firms, it had higher private costs than Test 94. However, the substantial improvement in bankruptcy screening (lower misprediction, or ``M'') led to far lower public costs than Test 94, so that the total costs were close to the total costs of Test 94.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency analyzed many cash-flow ratios, some of which subtracted a constant amount (e.g., $5 million, $10 million, $15 million), others of which, like the ratio in Test 94, subtracted variable amounts. Of the ratios that subtracted a constant amount, this ratio, which subtracted $10 million, was the most effective in reducing public and private costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

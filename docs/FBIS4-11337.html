			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 22 Apr (PL) -- The Cuban Government has a  new structure by virtue of a decree-law published today that  calls for the elimination of several organizations of the  central government and their incorporation into various  ministries, including a few new ones such as the Ministries of  Economy, Foreign Investment, and Tourism.    Decree No. 147 of the Cuban Council of State approved the  creation of the Ministry of Economy and Planning, which will  takeover the duties of the Central Planning Board and  institutions such as the State Committee for Standardization,  State Committee for Material and Technical Supply, and the  Office of Industrial Design, among others.    It also created the Ministry for Foreign Investment and  Economic Cooperation to replace the state committee dedicated to  this sector. There is also the brand new Ministry of Tourism to  replace the institution that oversaw this area.    This reorganization also brought the Ministry of Finance and  Prices that is tasked with fulfilling the duties carried out up  till now by the State Committee for Statistics and the duties of  other institutions linked to the economic field.    According to the legislation, which was textually published  by GRANMA, the goal is to reduce the number of institutions and  adjust the duties of the government apparatus to the special  period during peace time (which is the name given here to the  program of special measures being implemented to face the crisis  created by the blockade and the disappearance of the former  socialist bloc).    The legislation also states that the purpose is to better  adapt the institutions to the exchanges and cooperation  activities carried out by the country under the current  international conditions.    The State Committee for Labor and Social Security is now a  ministry and the Science Academy was made the super Ministry of  Science, Technology, and the Environment.    The Ministry of Metallurgy and Electronics Industry replaced  the National Institute of Automated Systems and Computer  Technology (Insac) and the Combined Producer and Exporter of  Electronics Technology [Combinado Productor y Exportador de  Tecnica Electronica - Copextel].    The other ministries (16) and the Institutes of Civil  Aeronautics, Radio and Television, Sports, Physical Education  and Recreation, and Hydraulic Resources and State Reserves  remain intact, the decree stated. The implementation of this  decree should produce adjustments to rationalize the attribution  authority and duties of the organs and organizations that were  eliminated.    The Council of Ministers Executive Committee will create a  commission responsibility with the evaluation of adjustment  proposals within 90 days. [sentence as received]    In keeping with Decree-Law No. 147, the Cuban Council of  State appointed Rosa Elena Simeon Negrin as the minister of  science, technology, and the environment, and Osmany Cienfuegos  Gorriaran as minister of tourism.    Antonio Rodriguez Maurell is the new minister of economy and  planning; Jose Luis Rodriguez of finance and prices; Ignacio  Gonzalez Planas as minister of metallurgy and electronics  industry; Ernesto Melendez Bachs as minister of foreign  investment; and Francisco Linares Calvo as minister of labor and  social security.    The high-ranking state organ relieved Ramiro Valdes Menendez  and Joel Domenech Benitez from their duties and posts of vice  presidents of the Council of Ministers. It adds that the other  deputy ministers, who are not also serving as ministers, will  head programs and activities of various organizations or head  specific tasks that will be commissioned for their importance.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> ANJELICA HUSTON GAINS SPOTLIGHT  </P> <P> For 17 years Anjelica Huston lived in the limelight of her lover, Jack  Nicholson. But now, with Nicholson out of the picture, she is stepping into her  own spotlight.  </P> <P> Their erratic relationship came to an end last year when Nicholson had an  affair with a former waitress, Rebecca Broussard, who had Nicholson's baby in  April.  </P> <P> Huston, who won an Oscar for her role in "Prizzi's Honor," said her recent  screen work has mirrored and helped manage her life.  </P> <P> She appeared in "Crimes and Misdemeanors" as a woman rejected by her married  lover. When she finished "Enemies, A Love Story," in which she plays a woman  whose husband has a child by another woman, she went home to the harsh reality  of Nicholson's infidelity.  </P> <P> "That very much reflected what was to go on in my life directly after I came  back to Los Angeles after the movie. That was pretty close to the bone," she  said.  </P> <P> Huston said she doesn't know if she is ready to be part of a couple again.  </P> <P> "I'm selfish and opinionated," she said. "I think I follow less than I used to.  It's hard for me to sit and nod my head at repeated stories anymore."  </P></p>

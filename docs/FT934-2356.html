			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Smith New Court in Mid-250 move Smith New Court, the UK equities market-maker, has joined OMLX, the London Securities and Derivatives Exchange, with a view to becoming a market-maker in the exchange's planned FT-SE Mid-250 derivative contracts. The London Stock Exchange last month awarded licences to introduce derivatives on the index of medium-sized UK companies to both OMLX and the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe), which already lists futures and options on the FT-SE 100. Smith New Court already trades Mid-250 futures over-the-counter, according to Mr Lenny Barshack, its director of derivatives, who added that the firm was keen to support this and other contracts on sectors of the UK stock market. OMLX plans to launch the new derivative contracts in the first quarter of 1994, according to chief executive Mr Lynton Jones, and is considering appointing two tiers of market-makers, with different levels of obligations. This issue is currently being examined by the Mid-250 Steering Group, of which Smith New Court is a member. Liffe has not yet set a launch date for the new instruments.</p>

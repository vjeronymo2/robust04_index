They Will Reinforce the First Russian UN  Battalion of Peacemaking Forces"]    [Text] Colonel General Yevgeniy Podkolzin, commander of  the Airborne Forces, has said in conversation with KRASNAYA  ZVEZDA's correspondent that an additional Russian Army subunit  is being sent onto Yugoslav territory along with hardware and  armaments with the knowledge and consent of the UN Security  Council following a petition from British [as published] Gen.  Jean Cot, commander of the peacemaking forces in Yugoslavia. It  is made up of 305 servicemen -- officers, ensigns, sergeants,  and soldiers serving in the Airborne Forces. This composite  subunit is equipped with mortars, antitank weapons, and  antiaircraft weapons.    It should be pointed out, Col. Gen. Podkolzin emphasized,  that this additional contingent is joining the UN peacemaking  force not to fulfill any separate task on Yugoslav soil but  merely to reinforce the first Russian infantry battalion of  "blue helmets," which is presently commanded by Col. Sergey  Voznesenskiy. As is well known, our battalion has been there  since April 1992 and is fulfilling a difficult task on the  so-called demarcation line between opposing forces -- Serbian  and Croatian -- which passes through the border zone between  Serbian Krajina and Croatia. It extends for more than 100 km  along the front and approximately 30 km deep. There are 24  checkpoints in the zone of responsibility of the battalion,  which is in the "East" sector. Here the armistice is regularly  violated, and there is shooting from both the Croatian and the  Serbian side. Unfortunately, there have been casualties. To  date two men have died in the battalion, and 19 have received  injuries of varying degrees of severity. In short, Col. Gen.  Podkolzin said, it is becoming increasingly difficult to fulfill  the task in this region with the former forces, and our "blue  helmets," moreover, only have small arms. This is why the  decision has been made to reinforce the Russian UN battalion  with men and combat hardware. Its task is as before -- to bring  peace to the Balkans....</p>

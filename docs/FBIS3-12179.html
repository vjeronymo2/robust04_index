			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi </F> Beilin by unidentified reporter; place and date not given --  passages in Italics recorded in English]    [Text] [Announcer] The Israeli Government will meet  tomorrow. We imagine how important this meeting will be,  particularly since measures will be taken against the settlers,  or, at least, the extremist ones.    Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin supplied us with  important information. We asked him about the nature of the  measures the Rabin government could take tomorrow.    [Beilin] Well, I prefer to wait for tomorrow, because  decisions will be taken tomorrow. But, I can already say that,  for the first time, there was a curfew on an Israeli settlement  in the West Bank. It never happened in the past, and I think  that we should see whether there are some legal ways to outlaw  those very extreme organizations which went out saying that they  should act in a violent way against the peace process.    [Announcer] As for disarming the settlers, as Palestinians  are calling for, Yosi Beilin believes this demand is not  realistic.    [Beilin] I do not believe this demand is a realistic  one. After all, after so many years, we are going to have in  the territories, in Gaza and Jericho, a strong Palestinian  police. I do not think it is possible and reasonable, when this  police will be armed, to disarm the settlers after 26 years.  What is important is to prevent the dangerous among them to be  armed, and to go for a full solution, so that in the future,  something like that will not happen. I think that if any such  demand is becoming a condition, it will just delay the process  and will be the best prize for those who would not like to see a  peace process in our part of the world.    [Announcer] There is another Palestinian demand expressed by  Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] and Faruq Qaddumi in his interview  with our radio, that of sending international forces to protect  the Palestinians. Here too, the Israeli deputy foreign minister  does not believe this demand is a wise one.    [Beilin] I do not believe that now, on the verge of the  implementation of the Oslo agreement, it would be wise on both  sides to invite international forces. But, you have to take  into consideration that in Oslo, we agreed together that as part  of the implementation of the agreement, there would be an  international presence in the autonomy. So, I do not believe  that now speaking about something which is different from that  is a wise thing to do.</p>

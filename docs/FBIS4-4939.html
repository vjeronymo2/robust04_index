			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand's overall economic situation in 1993 was  better than previously estimated. The country's economic growth  rates increased from 7.6 percent in 1992 to 7.8 percent in 1993.  In 1994, there are several factors, both external and internal,  indicating that the Thai economic growth rate will exceed 8  percent, but it may result in a more severe inflation rate above  4.2 percent.    Aphisit Wetchachiwa, spokesman of the Prime Minister's  Office, gave a briefing on the outcome of yesterday's cabinet  meeting and said that the cabinet acknowledged the  above-mentioned report presented by the governor of the Bank of  Thailand. According to the report, the International Monetary  Fund [IMF] has estimated that Thailand's total export value this  year will possibly increase by more than 15 percent because the  economies of its trading partners, especially the United States,  are improving. Besides, there has also been greater demand for  Thai goods in Japan and Europe.    Thailand, however, is expected to suffer a greater trade  deficit than originally estimated due to the increased import of  goods for use in expanding export-oriented production.  Regarding competition in goods exports, there will be new  competitors -- China and Vietnam. Due to greater export  expansion in 1994, possible shortages of labor and raw materials  are predicted. Thailand will not be faced with a capital  shortage as has happened in the past because investors consider  Thailand to still have good basic factors for investment. The  influx of foreign capital contributes to better financial  liquidity. The expansion of loans is expected to reach 22  percent -- a considerably high rate when compared to that of 20  percent in 1993. To maintain economic stability in Thailand,  IMF representatives advised the Thai Government to establish a  highly efficient savings system and at the same time cut down  expenses.</p>

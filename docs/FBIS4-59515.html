			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sanaa, May 14 (AFP) -- Southern troops suffered  "heavy losses" when northern forces recaptured the town of  Musaymir, northwest of Aden, a spokesman for the Defense  Ministry announced overnight Friday.    The report came as northern leaders rejected as "nothing  new"  a seven-point ceasefire plan put forward by their southern  counterparts.    Northern troops advanced in the town of al-Dali', 90  kilometers (55 miles) north of Aden, which controls one of the  main routes to the former southern capital, SABA' news agency  quoted him as saying.    Reports on the developments at al-Dali' were contradictory  Friday, with each camp claiming control of the area.    The spokesman said southern forces also suffered heavy  losses  at Abyan where large amounts of weapons and ammunition,  including 18 tanks and four armored vehicles, were seized.  [passage omitted]    Arab League delegates carrying a message from the  organization's Secretary General 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid calling  for an immediate halt to the civil war were due to meet with  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on Saturday.    Friday's peace plan, proposed by the southern Yemen  Socialist  Party (YSP), called for an immediate end to the nine-day war and  the creation of a national unity government.    But northern leaders repeated demands made at the beginning  of the conflict for southern leaders to surrender.</p>

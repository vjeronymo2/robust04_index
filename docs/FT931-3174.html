			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Mortgage lenders' fears dispelled - Housing THE CHANCELLOR'S limitation of mortgage interest tax relief to 20 per cent from next year, and his attempt to stimulate house sales by doubling the threshold for stamp duty, are unlikely to have a dramatic effect on the housing market. There had been some fear among mortgage lenders that Mr Lamont would try to enhance his reputation as a tax-reforming chancellor by taking more decisive steps to end the subsidy to homeowners represented by mortgage tax relief. They feared that would stifle the nascent slight recovery in the housing market, expected by analysts in the coming year. The number of house price transactions is only expected to rise about 20 per cent from 1992. Building societies were relieved that Mr Lamont made a relatively cautious adjustment to mortgage tax relief, and tried to balance it in the short-term with a measure to stimulate activity among first-time buyers. The chancellor will raise Pounds 900m in 1994-95 by restricting the interest relief to 20 per cent. Individual borrowers will face a relatively slight increase in payments. Those with loans above Pounds 30,000 will pay about Pounds 10 more tax a month. Some lenders believe that, combined with the end of tax relief at higher rates in the last budget, represents a signal that mortgage tax relief will eventually be phased out. The length of time that would take has reassured some. The stamp duty adjustment was trickier measure about which to convince borrowers and lenders. That is because the temporary abolition of stamp duty on properties worth up to Pounds 250,000 at the end of 1991 was judged a failure. It did little to stimulate the housing market until close to the deadline last year, and then the fall in transactions following the deadline was greater than the stimulus before, causing much discontent among lenders. Mr Lamont avoided the trap of another temporary adjustment. Instead he tried to concentrate stamp duty reform on first-time buyers, doubling the threshold to Pounds 60,000. That is intended to provide a steadier stimulus to the market. He also implemented a solution to the 'negative equity' problem affecting people who own properties worth less than the purchase price. They will now be able to transfer tax relief to a new property on the old loan. Mr John Wriglesworth, analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the net effect of the measures would be 'nothing'. He believed the measures would not affect the likely small upward movement in house transactions this year.</p>

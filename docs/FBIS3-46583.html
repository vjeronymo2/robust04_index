Kajima Chairman  Rokuro Ishikawa, 68, Vice Chairman Shoichi Kajima, 63, and  President Akira Miyazaki, 70, approved the plan to provide the  unreported "donations," the sources said. At the time, Kajima  was president and Miyazaki a vice president.    Twice annually -- during the summer and year-end gift-giving  seasons -- 5 million yen was "donated" to Watanabe through the  Liberal Democratic Party's fund-raising body, Kokumin Seiji  Kyokai. Altogether, Watanabe received 40 million yen from  August 1988 through December 1991 in this manner, the sources  said.    The Tokyo district public prosecutors office is probing into  the matter, sources close to the investigation said.    Nippon Television City Corp., a company that owns and leases  Tokyo Tower's communications facilities to various television  and radio stations, planned in 1987 to build a high-rise hotel  project on land lying within Tokyo's Shiba Park. It awarded the  contract to build the computerized "intelligent building" to  Kajima.    The project was initially regarded as difficult because the  land lay within the park, where commercial construction is  severely restricted by the Tokyo metropolitan government to  protect and preserve urban greenery.    However, the Tokyo government issued permission in October  1988, a few months after the summer of that year when Watanabe  asked metropolitan authorities to grant a waiver exempting the  project from the building restrictions.    Just prior to that, Watanabe, now 59, had held the post of  deputy chief cabinet secretary to the Cabinet of then Prime  Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone from July 1986 to November 1987.    Watanabe assumed the post of "advisor" to Nippon Television  City Corp. in May, 1988, five months before the Tokyo government  approved the Shiba Park high-rise development.    Afterwards Watanabe held the position of posts and  telecommunications minister from November 1991 to December 1992  under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.    Watanabe, a six-term member of the Diet's House of  Representatives, lost his seat in last July's general election.    Payment of the unreported "donations" were suspended when  the  project was aborted following the breakdown of contract talks  between Nippon Television City and a foreign hotel operator that  had planned to use the building as its Tokyo branch, the sources  added.    Former Kajima Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama and other top  Kajima executives were arrested last year over the giving of  bribes to then Sendai Mayor Toru Ishii and Ibaraki Gov. Fujio  Takeuchi.    Ishikawa headed the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry  and the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry from December  1987 until his resignation last August.    Kajima Corp., one of Japan's three largest general  contractors, was also implicated in a bid-rigging scandal  involving public projects in Saitama Prefecture. In May 1992,  the Fair Trade Commission ordered the company to stop its  alleged unfair business practices.</p>

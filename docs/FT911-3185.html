			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: PM braces himself for a year of living dangerously - Political Notebook IT is not hard to see why John Major wants to avoid postponing the general election until 1992. The charge of ditherer might stick. The winter and spring would be dominated by messy legislation to introduce the council tax. Europe could yet re-emerge as a dangerously divisive issue. Then, of course, there is the unpredictable. So the emerging consensus in the cabinet is that Mr Major will seek his mandate in the Autumn. Some ministers are convinced there is a chance still of a late June election. With the poll tax cauterised, they argue, the Tories might yet do well in the May 2 local elections. If they then held Monmouth in the by-election two weeks later, the stage could be set to secure a 50-seat Westminster majority before the voters departed for the Costa del Sol. For most though, October or November looks by far the stronger bet. The Treasury judgment is that the promise of better times ahead is not enough. The electorate needs to feel the benefit of lower inflation and mortgage rates for a few months before they will forgive the government its past economic sins. Unemployment will get a lot worse before it even starts to get better. Many C2 voters whose mood will determine the election have already decided that this year they will have to forsake Benidorm for Bognor. There is still a lobby in Great George Street for 1992. That said, the mood in the Cabinet is remarkably buoyant  - at times almost complacent. It is partly because his colleagues like Mr Major's style. To some, cabinet government may look like dithering; to insiders it is what one likes to refer to as a 'gale of fresh air.' If polls are a guide, the voters agree. Ministers believe the government has absorbed not only everything it has thrown at itself but also the best Labour can muster. The parties are neck and neck now, but every extra point off mortgage rates should put two or three points on the Tories' rating. There is another reason why the prime minister will want to avoid soldiering on until the bitter end. It is invariably overlooked. The approaching public spending round is about to provide the first real test of 'Majorism'. It will tell us whether he can, as promised, be tougher than Mrs Thatcher on inflation, still deliver tax cuts, and yet give the public sector enough money to provide a decent standard of services. He could not have chosen a tougher year to try to square the circle. The detailed figures, as always, are obscure, the more so because the switch from local taxation to VAT has distorted the Treasury's cash planning totals. But the bottom line could not be more painfully clear. The rising unemployment which comes with economic recession alongside public sector wage deals reflecting last year's rather than this year's inflation rates have wiped out most of the real growth built into the 1990 public spending settlement. The latest spending round  - its start has just been signalled by a lengthy and gloomy Treasury sent to all the main spending departments - will be even tougher than the last. Public sector pay settlements averaging 8 per cent have bitten deeply into the Treasury's contingency reserve for the current financial year. So too has the sharp rise in unemployment, the Budget concession on child benefit and a commitment to spend more on training. Inflation in 1992 will be lower, but every extra pound spent this year raises the base lines on which spending ministers predicate their bids for extra cash in 1992/93. At the department of health Mr William Waldegrave, can argue that his cash allocation for next year implies at best a freeze and at worst a real cut in NHS spending. With the NHS reforms likely to make cash shortages more transparent, we can expect him to bid for an extra Pounds 2bn or so. Mr Kenneth Clarke, never shy about asking for an extra several billion will make a similar case at education. Mr Major has promised after all to raise the status (that means pay) of career teachers. On the most optimistic assumptions Mr Michael Heseltine will need Pounds 1.5bn to prevent the final year of the poll tax from turning 1992 into the final year of the government. It is not difficult to double that. Back at the Treasury Mr Norman Lamont is looking at a forecast Pounds 8bn budget deficit which already looks optimistic. And he would, as he reminded us the ther day, at least make a start on cutting taxes. It is the sort of circle that Mr Major would do best to try squaring after and not before a general election.</p>

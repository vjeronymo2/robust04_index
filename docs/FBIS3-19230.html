This was stated by EU Foreign  Affairs Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek during the EU-Cyprus  joint parliamentary committee meeting in Brussels.    [Begin recording] [unidentified correspondent] Speaking  during the committee's meeting, EU Commissioner Van Den Broek  said that the European Union supports the confidence-building  measures and in the fourth financial protocol it is preparing  for Cyprus, it is providing a special chapter on their  implementation. Van Den Broek said that he will visit Cyprus on  24 March. The Dutch commissioner said that it is uncertain if a  solution could be found quickly. The EU Council of Ministers,  he added, should evaluate the stance of the interested parties  at the beginning of January 1995 and based on this evaluation  should evaluate Cyprus' application for accession. The EU  Council of Ministers' decision, he said, will be based on the EU  observer's report irrespective of whether or not the UN  secretary general assigns blame to the interested parties.    Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis stressed that it is  very  clear that the Turkish side is looking for ways to abandon the  process or, at least through time-consuming discussions, make  the process ineffective.    [Mikhailidhis] Despite all this, our side will continue full  cooperation with the UN secretary general and his  representatives. We are ready to discuss in a constructive way,  with goodwill, and within the assigned timeframe in hope that  such an agreement will be possible with the European Union's  precious support.

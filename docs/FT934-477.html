			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Favourable data give Dow only brief boost Wall Street In the last session before the long Christmas weekend, US blue chip stocks finished on a downbeat note in spite of a fresh batch of strong economic news, writes Frank McGurty in New York. By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.47 at 3,757.72, after flirting with a new record high for most of the session. But the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 inched 0.06 ahead to 467.38. The American SE composite added 2.49 at 465.32 and the Nasdaq composite 2.63 at 758.70. Before adjourning for the three-day holiday, the market had been facing the release of some important economic data. In the event, the numbers were favourable, though mostly in line with expectations. In response, equities climbed 12 Dow points at one stage. Reinforcing the impression that the economy was in a period of sustained expansion, November factory orders for durable goods were 2 per cent above the October level. On the consumer side, the University of Michigan's index of sentiment jumped to 88.2 in December, from 81.2 last month. The growth of confidence was underlined by November's figures on personal income, up 0.6 per cent from October's after seasonal adjustments, and personal consumption, up 0.4 per cent. With price pressures remaining tame, the bond market was able to weather the bullish economic news with barely a ripple. Such resilience encouraged interest in blue chips by traders seeking to square their year-end positions. But the market reversed course in mid-afternoon in very thin trading, and the session ended with the bellwether index in negative territory. Among the Dow components, 3M shed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 108 3/4 , IBM Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 58 5/8 and McDonald's Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 56 7/8. General Electric gained Dollars 5/8 at Dollars 106 on reports that CSX, the largest US railway operator, was close to placing an order for 300 GE locomotives. Walt Disney was Dollars 3/8 ahead at Dollars 44 3/4 after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock. In the pharmaceutical sector, Schering Plough climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 67 3/8 . Elsewhere in healthcare, Baxter International dipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 23. Owens &amp; Minor, its rival in the hospital supply business, moved ahead Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 22 1/4 on news that it would double its size with the acquisition of Stuart Medical. On the Nasdaq, Apple Computer was marked down Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 27 1/4 after Merrill Lynch lowered its rating on the stock. Canada Toronto stocks received a lift from firmness in Canada's currency and bond markets as foreign investors responded to the federal government's commitment on Wednesday to inflation reduction targets. The TSE 300 index finished 19.5 up at 4,246.4 and rises led falls by 541 to 223 after volume of 59.9m shares. The energy group put on 1.37 per cent and financial services 0.94 per cent.</p>

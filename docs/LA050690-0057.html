			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: TOGETHER AGAIN  </P> <P> Playwright/filmmaker David Mamet is reteaming with his favorite leading man,  Joe Mantegna, for the contemporary New York police drama, "Homicide."  </P> <P> To shoot in August on a $6-million-plus budget, it's about a Jewish homicide  detective (Mantegna) whose investigation of a case leads to self-discovery.  Mamet will adapt -- "loosely," we're told -- from the William Caunitz novel,  "Suspects." Ed Pressman co-produces.  </P> <P> "Look for a very David Mamet movie: very New York, with tough cops and tough  talk," says a source close to the project, adding that the supporting cast will  include "the Mamet stock company."  </P> <P> Mamet and Mantegna have teamed previously in films ("House of Games," "Things  Change") and plays ("Glengarry Glen Ross," "Speed-the-Plow"). From Pat H.  Broeske  </P></p>

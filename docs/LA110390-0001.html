			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> "The ultimate freeway experience" is how City Councilwoman Joy Picus terms it.  </P> <P> On a morning when all traffic on the Hollywood Freeway had been reduced to a  still-life, a woman driver in a neighboring lane began signaling to get the  attention of Picus and her aide, Mark Newell.  </P> <P> "I rolled down my window," Picus said. "It was so unexpected that at first I  couldn't understand what she was saying. She said, 'Would you mind calling my  office and telling them I'm going to be late for the deposition? My name is  Sharon.' She gave us the number -- and we phoned for her."  </P> <P> Gives new meaning to the phrase, "Reach out and touch someone."  </P> <P> Always willing to do our bit for tourism, Only in L.A. offers a guide for  visiting Imelda Marcos, former Philippine First Lady and all-time shopper  extraordinaire.  </P> <P> Call it: A Map to the Shoes.  </P> <P> No charge for the service. We'll foot the bill.  </P> <P> Azusa Mayor Eugene Moses had an exciting Halloween Eve. He found a tarantula in  his bedroom.  </P> <P> The mayor trapped the hairy intruder in a bottle and summoned police, who made  the pinch. Moses, who has feuded with other city officials, expressed some  suspicions about the timing of the incident.  </P> <P> But Azusa Lt. Felix Noriega -- "that's Felix, not Manuel; and lieutenant, not  general," the officer emphasized -- pointed out that His Honor lives "at the  base of the foothills," where such critters reside.  </P> <P> With no real basis for holding the tarantula, police released it -- in a nearby  canyon.  </P> <P> We Brake for Needles:  </P> <P> The Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center is offering free, drive-through flu  shots from 9 a.m. to noon on Nov. 10. No rolling stops, please.  </P> <P> Colorful Venice activist Jerry Rubin, who has a knack for getting his name in  the newspapers, phoned The Times Friday to report that he had embarked on a  hunger strike aimed at achieving peace in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> He seemed to be panting between phrases. "In the past," he said (pant), "when  I've gone on hunger strikes (pant), I've had juice and vitamins (pant). This  time, I'm only having water (pant)."  </P> <P> "How long have you been on the hunger strike?" Rubin was asked.  </P> <P> "Half an hour," he responded.  </P> <P> </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> The Century City North office building is believed to have been the first to  offer parking on levels named after movies ("Gone With the Wind," "Star Wars,"  "The Wizard of Oz"). On each level, the public address system plays theme music  for the appropriate movie.  </P> <P> Our map for Imelda -- who is currently jobless -- includes price ranges to fit  any budget.  </P></p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: US subsidiary of Daiwa in SEC settlement talks THE US subsidiary of Daiwa Securities, the Japanese broking house, confirmed yesterday that it was negotiating a settlement with US government regulators investigating the firm's role in attempts by Salomon Brothers to rig Treasury bond auctions between 1989 and 1991. Daiwa revealed that it was co-operating with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the securities industry watchdog, in a separate investigation into whether US subsidiaries of Japanese broking houses were involved in reimbursing favoured customers for trading losses. Last year, regulators in Japan temporarily suspended Daiwa for its loss reimbursement practices. The talks between the SEC and Daiwa revolve around the Japanese firm's involvement in helping Salomon exceed government limits in a 1989 auction of Treasury bills. The complaint against Salomon filed by the SEC earlier this year described how a dealer at another firm - now known to be Daiwa - handed over to Salomon Dollars 3bn in Treasury bills that he had secretly bought at the request of the US firm's chief bond trader.</p>

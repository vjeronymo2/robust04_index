			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Fimbra entrants will face exam FINANCIAL advisers seeking to become members of Fimbra, the regulatory body for independent advisers, will face a compulsory examination from September. The move comes after criticism that some Fimbra members have provided below-standard service to investors. Last year some payouts to investors in collapsed companies were delayed after the investors' compensation scheme, which was set up to protect investors against bad advice, ran into funding difficulties because of the number of claims against Fimbra members. The examination announcement yesterday is part of a scheme designed to raise the standards of both new and existing members of the watchdog organisation. At present, financial advisers hoping to become members of Fimbra must have had two years' relevant experience before they join, and do not have to take an examination. Last year the organisation introduced a voluntary entrance examination, which will become compulsory in September for new entrants. Mr Godfrey Jillings, chief executive of Fimbra, acknowledged yesterday that 'the standard (of the examination) is below the minimum standard we believe necessary'. He said that efforts were being made to upgrade it 'in due course'. Under the new scheme, members will draw up a personal programme to include a mixture of training, updating of knowledge, and study for qualifications in different areas of financial advice. The scheme is due to come into effect next year, and a pilot study is being launched between July and December this year into its feasibility. Mr Brian Cochrane, a Fimbra council member, said the aim was to educate Fimbra members in order to benefit the consumer. Fimbra has been criticised for laxity in regulating its members, but Mr Jillings said that it was unrealistic to expect high standards overnight. In a related move, the Securities and Investments Board the City's chief investment watchdog, said yesterday that it had set up a panel to advise the board on the training and competence plans for self-regulatory organisations such as Fimbra and recognised professional bodies. The panel will be chaired by Mr Leonard Warwick, a member of SIB's board and a former president of the Life Insurance Association. The new training and competence procedures are a result of proposals made nearly two years ago by Ms Oonagh McDonald, former Labour MP, in a report for SIB.</p>

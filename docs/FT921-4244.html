			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Brazil steps up war on cartels THE Brazilian government's continuing war against cartels and oligopolies intensified yesterday with the summoning of representatives from various industries including steel and paper to explain 'abusive price rises'. Some 90 legal suits have been started against various companies, mainly in areas of pharmaceutical products and household cleaning items, for raising prices by as much as 90 per cent above inflation this year, to compensate for falling sales. The decision came amid predictions that last month's inflation figure (due to be released today) would reach 24 per cent. Although lower than January, it is higher than the government had been hoping; the index for Rio, published yesterday, was still above 25 per cent. Economy ministry officials said they remained sure the downward trend would speed up, and are working on the basis of 21.2 per cent for March. They blame the continued high index on the behaviour of cartels and oligopolies. One sector especially under fire is the car industry. Many car dealers have been refusing to buy vehicles because of frequent price rises. Yesterday, the Car Dealers Association said they would begin legal proceedings against manufacturers for 'abuse of prices'. The government is expected to threaten accelerated reduction of import tariffs on products where increases have outstripped inflation. Other ideas include reimposition of price controls.</p>

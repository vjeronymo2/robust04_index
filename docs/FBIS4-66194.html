			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dai Yumin (2071 5940 3046): "What Careers Youth </F> Are Keen On"]    [Text] The China Youth Research Center in  cooperation with the Heilongjiang Youth Research Center, the  Liaoning Youth Research Center, and the Beijing Youth Research  Center, conducted a survey from October 1992 to December 1993 on  the employment situation for seven provinces and cities, in all  issuing 5600 questionnaires, and received 4760 responses. An  analysis of the survey results is presented below.    1. The overlapping nature and lack of choice in the career  aspirations of youth.    In the course of investigating the satisfaction of youth  towards their own current occupations, the survey answer  "satisfied" constituted 39.4 percent, "not too satisfied" has  43.2 percent, "very satisfied" and "very dissatisfied" were 7.0  percent and 10.4 percent respectively. The overall percentage of  youth who were not satisfied with their present occupation was  53.6 percent.    Among young workers, the higher the level of education, the  more numerous the number of those dissatisfied with their  occupation, while among workers with a high school education,  the total percentage of those dissatisfied was 53.1 percent,  while for polytechnic school technicians the figure was 54.1  percent, and for those with a university or higher education the  total reached 64.4 percent.    2. Youth generally hope to change their occupation but  movement on this front is sluggish.    When the survey asked whether the person was planning to  change occupations, those expressing a strong desire amounted to  11.8 percent, those who would move under the right conditions  were 62.2 percent; these two answers accounted for 74 percent,  while 13.7 percent had no plans either way, hence only 12.2  percent said they did not plan to change occupations.    Using these percentages to make calculations, is it possible  to say whether or not China will be facing the problem of having  millions of youth on the job be on the move? The survey makes  clear that since reform and opening 70 percent of youth have not  once yet changed their occupation. When this is put up against  the numbers hoping to change, an extreme contrast emerges. The  greatest area is hope of change, and there is only an extremely  small area of real change, indicating that one outstanding  phenomenon among currently employed youth is the conceptual  thinking is leading action and real movement is sluggish.    3. High income has become the major criterion in choosing an  occupation, and the ability to handle risks is generally  comparatively weak.    When asked "if you were allowed freedom to change  occupation,  in when direction would you development," 47.7 percent of the  people chose "high income units," 40.7 percent chose "have a  change to fully develop individual ability and worth." When  these two are compared, the trend towards high income answer  clearly has the advantage, being chosen by close to half the  respondents; some 10.9 percent of the people chose "superior  working conditions, big reputation," while only 5 percent of the  respondents chose "pursue an official career." In addition to  the economic requirement of high income, the other three items  directly part of the requirements of society, totalled 52.3  percent, and it can be seen that today, when high income is  taken as the guiding thinking on choice of occupation, the  various social requirements of youth are still powerful and  prospering.    Though at present there is a general concentration on  economic income, even more people who have for many years  cultivated old habits still cant bear to part from comfortable,  stable and secure occupations, and would rather have a small  income, and also not willing to shoulder the hardships and the  risks. For example: 50.1 percent chose Party and government  organs and state-owned enterprises with their stability,  comfortable working conditions, and very small risk. Clearly,  the economic income of these two careers will not be very high;  In addition, some 1/3 of the people those three capital  enterprises [all foreign capital, partnership of Chinese and  foreign capital, cooperatively managed], which give  consideration to both high income and social dignity, and  provide good material benefits. The individual household and  private enterprises, which make really big money but also demand  the shouldering of very difficult work, were chosen by 20  percent, and other individual households constituted 8.8 percent.    On the survey item "what is your greatest worry about  engaging in an individual business career," 12.3 indicated it  was fear of losing the iron rice bowl, while "fear of insecurity  resulting from policy changes" totalled 34 percent.    4. Youth occupational mobility, initiative, the goal of  mobility and the multifaceted directions of this mobility.    For persons employed in China's traditional system, in  addition to having work transfers arranged and carried out by  higher levels, very few have the initiate to engage in mobility,  or movement will come as a surprising and major event, and are  worked out out of absolute necessity, and common aspirations do  not receive sufficient time and are lightly brushed off without  transfers being carried out. Since reform and opening, there has  been a change in the situation in which traditionally one worked  for decades in a position without change, to a situation of  mobility with following of an individual's inclinations, and the  resolutely resolving of the various requirements of the  individual. In discovering the survey mobility factors, 38  percent said they wanted to change because income was too low,  while 15.3 percent said it was because of labor conditions. In  addition, 5.6 percent wanted to move because of interpersonal  relations were strained, 8 percent because of they worked too  far from home, 13 percent did not have a residence, 2 percent  found their strong points were not being given full play, while  18 percent said their units were in a slump.    5. Youth are counting on a second occupation in seeking to  get rich, but the number of people participating is gradually  getting smaller.    When asked about the goal of engaging in a second  occupation,  31.6 percent of the respondents indicated they did this in order  to "give full play to untapped ability, enliven the economy, and  benefit the country and the people"; 48.9 percent of the people  indicated they did it in order to increase their individual  income; 20.6 percent of the people said "in order to know and  understand society"; finally, 4.9 percent did it "to avoid  falling behind the times."    6. Youth have hopes and worries when it comes to reform of  the employment system.    When asked about "confronting the continuous reform of the  working situation," 32.1 percent of the young people believed  that "reform was better than no reform," while 24.8 percent felt  that "it gives people even more excitement," and 27.7 percent of  the young people demanded "an accelerated pace"; those who felt  that "they were more and more disheartened" amounted to only 5.2  percent, while those youth who "were resigned to their fate"  totalled 12.6 percent. The above described statistics indicate  that more than 87.6 percent of youth approve of and welcome  enterprise reform, an overwhelming majority of young people.    At the same time, there is also quite a lot of concern:    1) Hope that it will be possible to give full play to  individual ability and potential, worry that some people will  lose their jobs, were respectively expressed by 64.7 percent and  29 percent of the youth; 2) Hope that it would be possible  through elimination of equalitarianism, and the big rice bowl ,  to reward diligence and punish laziness, and worry that things  wont go as well as with previous loosening. 65.9 percent  expressed the former, while 6.5 did the latter. Some 23.8  percent indicated hope that since the big rice bowl had already  been destroyed, it would also be necessary to address people  with a human touch. 3) 32.6 percent indicated hope that through  the factory director (manager) responsibility system it will be  possible to achieve improved management, and develop production  targets; 12.9 percent worried that the factory directors  (managers) hoodwinked the people, had disadvantages and were of  no benefit; 4) A majority of young people hoped that things such  as the special economic zones would completely sweep away  employment limitations; youth in this category totalled 6.6  percent, while 13.3 percent advocated maintaining the original  planned employment system.    When asked "in the wake of the accelerated reform of the  employment allocation system, how has your live changed?" 35.9  percent of the youth felt that "it was getting better and  better"; 7.5 percent felt that "it was getting harder and  harder," while another 29 percent felt that "it was the same as  before, with not much difference" and 28.3 percent felt "unsure  of the situation."    When asked "in an association improving to a state of  excellence, if you were to be classified as an outsider to the  group, what attitude would you take," 42.3 percent said that  they would prepare to "enhance their quality, and struggle to  early on return to the team"; 32.1 percent of the people would  decide to "temporarily feel wronged for having perfection  demanded, while at the same time planning to leave"; 22.7  percent of the people felt that "it would fit in exactly with  their wishes, in achieving their own development." Only 4.3  percent would feel indignation and worry, and wait for a chance  to retaliate and vent hatred.    Towards the phenomenon of unemployment in the society, 34.8  percent of the youth believed that "this makes employed peopled  cherish their own employment opportunities even more," 21.4  percent felt that unemployment would make a person "frequently  changing work is beneficial to the development of a person's  individual character"; 19.9 percent believed that "it was  beneficial to enterprise management and picking out talent";  31.0 percent felt that "it was not beneficial to the interests  of staff and workers, and created instability in the society."    7. Rural youth provincialism was being shaken, the rate of  incidence of leaving the soil is rising.    When rural youth were asked to answer the questions "How do  you think peasants should pass their days?," only 9.7 percent  maintained "looking after their own house and land," while 20  percent felt that "farming all one's whole life does not make  sense, going forth and planning to leave are good"; 43 percent  of the people agreed that "using the land to produce more cash  crops" was good; 27.3 percent of the people thought that  "properly tilling the soil will allow it to produce more of  those other incomes."    In the survey it was discovered that of the current rural  youth, 21.6 percent basically worked on the outside; 20.9  percent of the people during the course of a year spent roughly  half the year on the outside working; 20 percent of the people  worked outside for roughly 3 months of the year; only 37.6  percent did not go outside.    When asked "if there was an even larger surplus in the labor  force in your village, under what circumstances would you be  prepare to leave," 27.6 percent chose "to join a township  enterprise"; 47.9 percent would plan to "work at a small  business"; 2.6 percent would be prepared to "go outside the  village to do odd jobs": 16.7 percent "wanted to go to a city to  do work": and 5.7 percent did not have any sense of what they  were prepared to do, and answered "don't know."    8. Rural youth employment concepts are changing fast, and  forms of employment constantly expanding.    When asked "in agricultural manual labor, what are you most  willing to engage in," only 13.7 percent chose "grain  production," while 43.9 percent chose "various breeding  activities," 25.6 percent chose doing "nonagricultural planting,  such as forestry, planting fruit trees, and other case crops,  etc.; 17.3 percent chose "other."    When asked their views on the current phenomenon in rural  areas of hiring people to come and plant contract land, 67  percent of the youth believed that they could accept this, and  that in this manner it would be possible to leave one's work and  make big money; 16.1 percent felt that they were unable to  determine whether this was in accord with policy; 6.9 percent  thought that they could do this type of work, but were afraid  that it smacked of "exploitation"; 10.3 percent believed that  this went against the society's socialist orientation.    The new style of peasant slack season living also has  changed  very much since previous times, and how each time a slack season  comes, 38.2 percent of the people go out to work in businesses,  and make money; 39.8 percent of the people study agricultural  scientific know-how; 12.9 percent "work when they encounter a  money making activity"; and only 10.1 percent "play mahjongg,  idle around, and make merry."</p>

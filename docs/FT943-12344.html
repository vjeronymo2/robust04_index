			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Rover hints at expanding production capacity Rover Group said yesterday that it may need to review its carmaking capacity next year if the company's upturn in worldwide sales is sustained this year and then strengthened - as expected - by new models to be introduced early next year. Rover, which was bought early this year by BMW, the German carmaker, for Pounds 800m plus debt assumptions, yesterday reported a rise of 16 per cent in worldwide sales in the first half of this year. The increase, to 234,600 from 202,100 in the same period last year, took sales to their highest level for four years. Production rose even more sharply, to 251,900 from 206,500 - up 22 per cent to a five-year high. Within these totals the biggest increases were accounted for by the Land Rover four-wheel-drive subsidiary. Its Discovery model has proved one of Rover's biggest successes and it has just announced a Pounds 68m investment to expand total Land Rover capacity. First-half production of Rover cars was 19 per cent higher, at 208,300. The group's rising car sales worldwide, particularly in export markets - many of which are still in recession - indicate that Rover is steadily taking market share from its rivals. Total export sales in the six months rose 29 per cent to more than 106,000, accounting for 45 per cent of Rover's total. The indication that Rover may have to consider expanding capacity came from Mr John Towers, Rover chief executive. In recent years Rover has presented itself as having the goal of becoming a profitable 'niche' producer of about 500,000 vehicles a year, each targeted at the premium end of its market. Mr Towers said yesterday he expected sales to continue to strengthen in the second half of the year, lifting total sales to about the 500,000 mark. However, he said Rover could be 'comfortable' with demand-driven expansion to 650,000. He added: 'It is possible that by the back end of 1995 we will be reviewing how that situation can be accommodated.' Mr Towers said that the gains made this year did not yet reflect any of the product expansion and global marketing advantages Rover expected to gain from the relationship with its new parent company. While Mr Towers said that no significant new projects were at present under discussion with Honda, its former partner, further collaboration with the Japanese carmaker beyond present commitments should not be ruled out. Although Rover this year is only returning to production levels reached five years ago, the background against which it is producing vehicles is more favourable than in the past. Production then was declining, while Rover is now encountering production constraints with its new 600 model. Early next year it will launch successors to its biggest-selling 200 and 400 models, as well as new 'niche' products such as a small MG sports car.</p>

Bimolecular lipid membranes with incorporated fusion peptides  are best suited for such study. The researchers here chose to  use a synthetic polypeptide that consisted of 23 amino acid  residues structurally similar to the Lassa arenavirus fusion  peptide and that induced the fusion of small single-layer  liposomes in a study of the features of the interaction of that  peptide and bilayer lipid membranes consisting of dioleoyl  phosphatidylcholine; they demonstrated the ability of the  peptide to form single cation-selective channels with varying  conductance levels. The amplitude histogram of the single  channels contained four components with average values of 4.5,  8.2, 10.1, and 12.4 pSi for bilayers in 0.1 M solutions of KCl,  pH 7.4, at 21C and peptide concentrations of 2 x  10[.sup]-9[/] M. Peak number and position was a function of  peptide concentration in the aqueous solution, their ion  composition, pH value, and temperature. The heterogeneity of  levels of conductance was attributed to the presence of various  aggregates of fusion peptide molecules. Figures 5, references  20: 2 Russian, 18 Western.</p>

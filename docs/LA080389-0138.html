			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE'S INITIAL RULING FAVORS IRVINE FIRM OVER COLDWELL BANKER  </P> <P> A small, Irvine-based commercial real estate firm has won a preliminary victory  in an effort to obtain a commission of more than $400,000 from Coldwell Banker  Commercial Real Estate Services, one of the nation's largest real estate  concerns.  </P> <P> In a tentative decision Monday, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lester  E. Olson ruled that Lee &amp; Associates was due half of a $600,000 commission  that was paid to Coldwell Banker in 1983 and 1984, plus interest. The total  exceeds $400,000.  </P> <P> The disputed commission was paid to Coldwell on a 10-year, $15-million lease  that Hughes Aircraft Co. signed in 1982 for research and development space at  the Canyon Corporate Center in Anaheim. The complex is owned by the Macklin  Co., a Newport Beach-based developer.  </P> <P> The court is expected to issue a final judgment this fall. Coldwell has  objected to the court findings, claiming that many of Judge Olson's findings in  the case are ambiguous or wrong. Coldwell attorney Wallace Rosvall refused  comment.  </P> <P> Lee &amp; Associates sued Coldwell in 1984, claiming that the giant real estate  firm had unfairly taken all of the commission after Hughes rented the  365,000-square-foot space from Macklin.  </P> <P> According to court documents, Macklin hired Coldwell to peddle the property in  1982. Coldwell then sent out descriptions to other area brokers to find out  whether they had any prospective tenants.  </P> <P> Several weeks later, Lee &amp; Associates broker Thomas Casey mentioned to a  Coldwell broker at an open house that Hughes might have some interest in the  Anaheim property. Then, through a series of telephone calls and meetings, Casey  helped Coldwell arrange a negotiating session with Hughes representatives that  eventually turned into a deal, the judge found.  </P> <P> In similar cases in Orange County, the commission is usually split in half, but  Coldwell illegally refused to pay, Judge Olson ruled. Hughes has a rule that  requires its representatives to deal only with the principal broker, which in  this case was Coldwell.  </P> <P> Though Coldwell offered to pay Lee &amp; Associates a referral fee, the company  turned it down, saying that half the commission was owed. The firm also turned  down a proposed $30,000 settlement in 1988, said Ed Broffman, an attorney who  represented Lee.  </P></p>

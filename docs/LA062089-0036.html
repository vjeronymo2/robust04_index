			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TAKING GASLAMP DESIGN TO NEW HEIGHTS? SOME HOPE NOT  </P> <P> A dispute between city planners and Gaslamp Quarter property owners over height  limits in the historic downtown district is fast approaching a City Council  showdown, with the character of the zone's future development very much in the  balance.  </P> <P> The crux of the issue lies in the 60-foot height limit -- with an extra 15 feet  allowable under certain conditions -- that the city wants to keep in place for  the 16 1/2-block district that straddles 5th Avenue from Broadway to Harbor  Drive. Backers say the height limit is essential to preserve the character of  the Gaslamp, where 81 of 90 buildings are 60 feet high or shorter.  </P> <P> The Centre City Development Corp., the city's redevelopment agency; the city  Planning Department, and the Historical Site Board, a citizens advisory group  on matters of historic preservation, all back the 60-foot limit.  </P> <P> "The issue is whether or not we are going to respect the historic character of  the district and live up to our own policy direction," said senior city Planner  Ron Buckley.  </P> <P> On the opposing side is the Gaslamp Quarter Council, a group that includes 200  business and property owners. The group has proposed an amendment to the  ordinance that would allow certain projects to include "tower elements" of  heights up to 125 feet, set back from the street to accommodate hotel,  apartment or condominium development, said Craig Lee, executive director of the  council.  </P> <P> Under terms of the Gaslamp Quarter Council proposal, the 60-foot limit would be  observed in all new Gaslamp development except in projects south of Island  Street and on parcels of half a block or more in size.  </P> <P> Lee said that taller heights are appropriate on 5th Avenue south of Island  because the area contains few buildings of historical significance.  </P> <P> Hotels and residential towers would generate more foot traffic in the quarter,  he added, bringing more business to Gaslamp shop owners while discouraging  panhandlers and homeless people from congregating.  </P> <P> "We need flexibility to bring special projects into the quarter," Lee said.  </P> <P> The City Council is expected to vote next month on the proposed ordinance  amendment. The opposing sides concede that some kind of amendment is needed  because the existing law allows the city planning director to grant exemptions  to the height limitations at his discretion, without specifying how much and  under what circumstances.  </P> <P> The City Council's vote will directly affect three proposed projects that would  exceed existing height limits. The farthest down the planning pipeline is the  Brunswig Square Project, planned for the full block bounded by 5th and 6th  avenues and J and K streets. Principals Ed Murphy, Michael Farres and architect  Bruce Dammann hope to build a 300-room, 13-story hotel on the property.  </P> <P> The taller height is necessary, Dammann said, so the $28-million hotel project  can compete in the "view-oriented" hotel market.  </P> <P> Another project, a 200-foot-high condominium tower, is being developed by Neil  Senturia for property bounded by 4th and 5th avenues, the Santa Fe Railroad  tracks and K Street. Senturia is also developing the twin-tower One Harbor  Drive condo project for a site nearby.  </P> <P> Louis Wolfsheimer, a San Diego attorney who represents Senturia, said the  Gaslamp area may die economically "unless we do something to attract more  people to the quarter. . . . This property, located just across Harbor Drive  from the 120-foot San Diego Convention Center (now under construction) needs  some height to attract people to live down there. We think it might be the  catalyst to get Gaslamp moving."  </P> <P> The owners of the 12-story Horton Park Plaza hotel on 5th Avenue at E Street, a  75-year-old building formerly known as the Jewelers' Exchange, have proposed  building a second tower of equal height on an adjacent lot.  </P> <P> Lee argues that judicious exceptions to the height limit should be allowed if  for no other reason than the fact that a handful of the historic buildings in  the area, such as the Horton Park Plaza and the St. James Hotel, already exceed  the cap.  </P> <P> Planner Buckley disagreed, saying the tall buildings in the Gaslamp are  "historical aberrations" and should not be used to justify new construction of  tall buildings.  </P> <P> "The district was created to preserve the unique character and scale of  Gaslamp, and if you start making exceptions, you jeopardize that," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Moscow reports denied President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman yesterday described as a 'fabrication and a lie' press reports that the Russian leader might sack prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin, who is recovering from a kidney complaint. Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper yesterday quoted 'informed sources' as saying that Mr Yeltsin wanted to replace him with Mr Yuri Skokov (pictured left), a presidential crony with links to the defence industry and hardline Russian politics. This is the latest report to surface in a time-honoured method of spreading rumours to fight political battles in Russia - and may well reflect genuine anger by the defence lobby at the government and lower chamber of parliament's refusal to grant it extra spending in the 1994 budget. The reports have been aggravated by a military adviser to the Russian prime minister who was quoted as saying that Mr Chernomyrdin might resign if extra defence spending was pushed through by the upper chamber of parliament and the defence lobby.</p>

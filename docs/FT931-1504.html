			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Nestle raises its stake in San Pellegrino to 25% NESTLE, the Swiss foods group which controls Perrier, has tightened links with Italy's leading mineral water brand, San Pellegrino, by lifting its stake from 20 per cent to 25 per cent, writes Haig Simonian. The stake is being acquired for an undisclosed sum from the Mentasti family, which controls two-thirds of the capital. The purchase has been accompanied by an agreement for Nestle to distribute San Pellegrino products to bars and restaurants in France and Belgium. Links between Perrier, which Nestle bought last year after a battle with the Agnelli family, and San Pellegrino stretch back some time. Perrier bought 35 per cent of the Italian brand in 1972 and disposed of 15 per cent last year shortly before coming under the control of Nestle. San Pellegrino, based near Bergamo in northern Italy, raised its turnover by 15 per cent to L429bn (Dollars 271m) last year, with foreign sales surging by over more than 40 per cent. The closer alliance with San Pellegrino will allow Nestle to distribute a broader mix of mineral waters. While Perrier is the world leader and the Vittel brand, which is also controlled by Nestle, is a leading still water, San Pellegrino claims that it is the most popular water ordered with meals, as opposed to being drunk independently.</p>

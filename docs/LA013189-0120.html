			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAISING THEIR VOICES TO AID ARMENIAN ORPHANS  </P> <P> More than 100 show business celebrities -- from Charles Aznavour to Pia Zadora  -- gathered in a Hollywood recording studio Sunday to do for the victims of  last month's devasting earthquake in Soviet Armenia what pop music stars have  done for starving Ethiopians, bankrupt American farmers and AIDS patients.  </P> <P> Although names such as Liza Minnelli, Ben Vereen, Steve Lawrence, Dionne  Warwick and others who met to record "For You, Armenia," may be more identified  with Las Vegas showrooms than rock 'n' roll arenas, they sang and spoke of  their cause with equal passion.  </P> <P> And passion was the principal commodity among the group -- officially dubbed  Friend to Friend -- for their efforts to raise money and send supplies to the  quake region are still in their earliest stages.  </P> <P> A related European effort to send help is already under way, but the Americans  have no distributor for the record cut on Sunday and no network or syndicator  has agreed to broadcast a special based on the session.  </P> <P> But the group does have Aznavour, the noted French composer whose parents were  from Armenia. He spearheaded Sunday's effort and co-wrote the song the  celebrities recorded.  </P> <P> "I was moved by what happened and I wanted to do it for the children, so many  of whom are now orphans," said Aznavour. "I hope to raise enough money,  minimum, to support the thousands of homeless children."  </P> <P> Aznavour's efforts began shortly after the Dec. 7 quake. He and George  Garvarentz composed a version of the song in French and recorded it a few weeks  ago with a collection of European celebrities. Sales of that record raised  enough for the relief group to send 40 tons of supplies and 10 dialysis  machines to Armenia, Aznavour said.  </P> <P> The people who gathered to make the U.S. version of the record are hoping to  create a constant pipeline of supplies to help the quake victims.  </P> <P> The artists, some of whom brought their families, began arriving around noon  and were herded into a Paramount Pictures sound stage. Many hugged and kissed  each other and some spoke with newspaper and TV reporters on hand.  </P> <P> "This is the day of the Lord, and what better way to let people know I care?"  said Vereen. "We are forgetting about differences of color, language, political  ideology, and planting a seed as brothers and sisters for a greater force.  We're not sending bombs, but coming together through music."  </P> <P> "When you have a God-given talent, you help," said Minnelli. "I'm speaking more  in a spiritual sense than in a religious sense. When I saw the disaster in  Armenia, I thought I was going to die. Besides, when Charles Aznavour calls and  says you can help, you go."  </P> <P> "When I think of the schoolchildren I met over in the Soviet Union and the  devastation that's going on there now, it's such a tragedy," said "Head of the  Class" actress Khrystyne Haje, who traveled to Moscow last year to shoot an  episode of the ABC situation comedy.  </P> <P> Joining the Hollywood celebrities was Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica),  husband of absent Jane Fonda who didn't go to the session.  </P> <P> "I have been involved with a lot of things in the Legislature for Armenia  previous to this effort, and now, with this, I think you find a solidarity  among the people that shows we cannot forget those around us," Hayden said.  </P> <P> "I think it's great that the government gets involved," said comedian Wil  Shriner, "but really, everything starts with the people."  </P> <P> After about 90 minutes of meeting and talking, record producer Michael Masser  led the celebrities to the nearby studio to begin rehearsals of the song.  </P> <P> As the group began recording, director Peter Bogdanovich was weaving his  cameras in and out of the studio. He was shooting the planned video and TV  special.  </P> <P> Within an hour, the singers were hitting their stride, belting out the  anthem-like lyrics of the tune:  </P> <P>  Your children will  </P> <P>  Rebuild for you ...  </P> <P>  For you Armenia  </P> <P>  The world is by your side  </P> <P>  We know you will survive  </P> <P>  We've opened our arms  </P> <P>  You've opened up our hearts.  </P> <P> </P></p>

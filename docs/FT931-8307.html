			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mongstad faces tough targets NORWAY'S Mongstad oil refinery may have to be wound down or sold if it fails to improve profitability over the next two years and become as competitive as the best of continental Europe's refineries. Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, Mongstad's operator, has implemented a draconian programme to improve the return on its NKr12bn (Dollars 1.73bn)investment made in the mid-1980s to upgrade and expand the facility. Mongstad has an annual refining capacity of 6.5m tonnes. The upgraded facility came on stream at the end of 1989 at a cost overrun of NKr7bn, creating what is widely considered to be one of Norway's biggest ever industrial scandals. The event forced the resignation of Mr Arve Johnsen, chief executive, followed by a reshuffle of the group's executive management. Statoil said yesterday that it had postponed an estimated NKr600m investment programme for Mongstad meant to enable it to meet European Community targets for gas/oil desulphurisation set for 1996. Part of the plan to improve profitability calls for a 20 per cent reduction in Mongstad's estimated 950 full-time and temporary employees by the end of 1994. Mongstad's refining margins sank to just under Dollars 3 a barrel last year from just more than Dollars 5 a barrel in 1991. The facility's amortisation and finance costs have remained a drain on Statoil's cashflow since it was commissioned. Last year Mongstad suffered a NKr710m operating loss, including finance costs, versus a NKr797m loss in 1991. Before finance costs, operating losses rose to NKr224m last year from a loss of NKr132m in 1991. Statoil aims to improve Mongstad's 'cash' operating profits 'amenable to in-house action' by between NKr350m and NKr400m annually - before finance costs and depreciation write-offs - during 1992. Of the total improvements, two-thirds will come from operations and the rest from cost reduction measures. The relentless problems at Mongstad are a combination of irregular operations and high maintenance costs. Statoil refused yesterday to speculate on specific future options for the refinery. Mrs Berit Oeyen, a Statoil spokeswoman, said the company would be forced to rethink Mongstad's future if big improvements to profitability are not made by the end of next year.</p>

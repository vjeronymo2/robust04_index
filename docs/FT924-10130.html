			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Letter: Not the Dan Quayle version of competitiveness Your story on George Fisher ('Voice of high-tech challenge', Monday Interview, October 26) identifies him with Vice-President Dan Quayle's Council on Competitiveness. Unfortunately, we in the US have competing competitiveness councils of the same name, so the error in the article is quite understandable. Mr Fisher is actually chairman of the private-sector Council on Competitiveness, a non-profit, non-partisan organisation of chief executives from business, higher education and organised labour working to improve the ability of American companies and workers to compete internationally. The council focuses on competitiveness issues in areas such as science and technology, investment, international economics and trade, and human resources. Your article presents an excellent summary of the council's - and Mr Fisher's - position on these issues. Mr Quayle's council appears to be concerned primarily with the effects of government regulation. For further information, you might check with the vice-president. We have also heard of a third organisation dedicated to the elimination of five-syllable words, but as far as we know, that group hasn't come up with a name.

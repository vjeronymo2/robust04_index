			<p>Reevaluated  <H4>    Justice Minister, Police Official on `Reprioritizing' </H4> Resources   <F P=102> 94WD0269G Copenhagen BERLINGSKE TIDENDE in Danish 1 Mar 94 p  1 </F>  <F P=103> 94WD0269G </F> <F P=104>  Copenhagen BERLINGSKE TIDENDE </F> <F P=105>  Danish </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lotte Mejlhede and Mikkel Thrane: ``Narcotics </F> Police To Be Reinforced'']    [Text] ``You can take a dart and throw it at a map of the  country. Wherever it happens to land, you could open a drug  case.''    Per Kanding, chief of the national police force's mobile  squad, believes that too little is being done to counter the  growing drug problem.    ``Many small police districts are not doing enough in drug  cases. They do not have the resources. After all, the drug trade  is not a crime that is reported and, as a result, drug cases are  often put on the back burner in favor of crimes that are  reported,'' Kanding said.    He believes there must be a reprioritizing of police  resources if we are really interested in doing something in this  area. He is supported in this by Justice Minister Erling Olsen  (Social Democrat).    ``The police will not get more resources, but those we have  must be used differently. I would like to see the effort against  organized crime--including drug crimes--be strengthened.  Consequently, some policemen must accept being shifted to other  duties.'' He did not wish to reveal what jobs the police would  no longer do, but he was certain enough police could be  transferred.    Yesterday the United Nations published its annual report for  1993. It revealed that the global drug trade was becoming more  extensive and more aggressive. In particular, Denmark must  protect itself from drugs being brought in by way of the chaotic  countries of East Europe.</p>

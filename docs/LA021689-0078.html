			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK / SAM FARMER;  </P> <P> ST. FRANCIS TAKES OFF AFTER HUMBLING LOSS  </P> <P> The St. Francis High soccer team finished the regular season with a 16-1-1  record -- including a 16-match winning streak that ended last week in a 3-3  tie. That's a far cry from the school's previous record for consecutive wins  which, according to Coach Cherif Zein, was three games.  </P> <P> The Golden Knights got off to a rather inauspicious start, however, losing  their season opener, 1-0, to Nogales.  </P> <P> "It was a shocker. A real blow," said Zein, whose team missed two penalty kicks  and outshot the Nobles, 32-4. "I disappeared from town. I drove up to the back  of places. I wouldn't even go in the post office."  </P> <P> Even crisp new uniforms couldn't help the Knights.  </P> <P> "We looked sharp in our brand-new uniforms," Zein said. "But we played like  maids of honor."  </P> <P> Since then, St. Francis has broken in the uniforms and worn out most of its  opponents. The Del Rey League champions are the No. 4 seed in the Southern  Section 3-A Division playoffs and will open the playoffs against Lynnwood today  at 3 p.m. at St. Francis.  </P> <P> Walk this way: To the pitching staff of the Occidental College baseball team,  the strike zone appears to be a shade larger than a postage stamp.  </P> <P> In their first two games last weekend, the Tigers were outscored, 23-3, and  walked 21 batters in a pair of losses.  </P> <P> "It's not the record that upsets me, it's the walks," said Coach Jeff  Henderson, whose team returns just three starters and includes nine first-year  players. "We're young, but I didn't expect us not to throw a strike."  </P> <P> And even though the Tigers are issuing free passes, the coach isn't planning to  hand out walking papers.  </P> <P> "By no means are we in a panic," he said. "We're remaining positive because we  have the makings of a good ballclub. We're starting to jell a little bit and  that's a continuing process -- it's not going to happen overnight."  </P> <P> Qualifying exam: Occidental runner Michelle Trimble didn't wait long to qualify  for the Division III track and field nationals for the third time in as many  years.  </P> <P> Trimble, a three-time cross country and two-time track All-American, ran the  5,000 meters in 17:31.2, shattering the school record by more than 28 seconds.  </P> <P> But there's a catch: Trimble doesn't plan to run the race in nationals.  </P> <P> "I'm going to run it once more just to lower the school record even more," said  Trimble, who missed the record by a second the previous time she ran the 5,000.  "If I feel like it's my race, then I'll run it."  </P> <P> Trimble hopes to qualify for the 1,500 and 3,000 meters and run those races in  nationals, which is held May 24-27 in Naperville, Ill. She will get a chance to  qualify at Occidental on Saturday when the Tigers play host to UC Riverside and  Fresno.  </P> <P> Ineligible: Crescenta Valley point guard Raffie Eskandarian, who averaged a  team-high 20 points and 5.6 assists a game, was ruled academically ineligible  last week.  </P> <P> According to Crescenta Valley Coach John Goffredo, Eskandarian has been under  duress all season because of an illness in the family.  </P> <P> Add Falcons: To compensate for the loss of Eskandarian, Goffredo brought junior  Lamar Breeding up from the junior varsity to play against Arcadia last Friday.  </P> <P> Breeding says he was calm on the bench but when the coach gave him the nod, he  felt a twinge of anxiety.  </P> <P> "I really didn't expect to play that much," he said. "The crowd was up and  yelling and I said, 'Oh no. I hope I don't mess up.' "  </P> <P> Breeding took team-high honors in the loss with 19 points.  </P> <P> Goffredo was taken aback by Breeding's offensive output.  </P> <P> "I was looking in the score book after the game and thinking, 19?" Goffredo  said. "His play wasn't a surprise, the points were."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Nikolayev under the rubric "Persecution": </F> "An Attempt To Expel the Chairman of the Free Trade Unions  Central Committee From Russia: Vladimir Klebanov Escapes  Detention"]    [Text] Russian trade unions have issued an appeal to Moscow  Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov and Vladimir Yerin, Russian Federation  minister of internal affairs, expressing "serious concern  regarding the arbitrariness" of actions with respect to Vladimir  Klebanov, chairman of one of the largest trade union  associations--which has grassroots organizations in all sectors  of national economy--the Central Committee of Free Trade Unions,  and member of the Constitutional Conference. As follows from the  appeal, on 10 January Vladimir Klebanov was detained by officers  of the 58th militia precinct in the apartment where he lived  (which also houses the Central Committee of Free Trade Unions  headquarters) for violating the capital city mayor's directive  on visa regulations: Klebanov did not have a residence permit.    According to eyewitness Tatyana Sevryukova, the arrest was  conducted rudely. Vladimir Klebanov was yelled at and not  permitted to use the telephone; after being brought to the  precinct he was put in a preliminary detention cell along with  criminals. Tatyana Sevryukova also reported that currently  Vladimir Klebanov is not in possession of his passport, since  back in August officers of the same precinct confiscated this  document for living in the city without a residence permit and  still have not returned it. Therefore the trade union leader,  much as he would not want to, could not avoid violating the visa  regulations.    Nikolay Klimov, passport desk chief at the 58th militia  precinct, confirmed that the trade union leader "was kept for  some time in the preliminary detention cell," from where he was  sent to the city reception center. "I do not know what happened  to him after that," said Mr. Klimov. As it turned out, the staff  at the reception center also remembers Vladimir Klebanov. "The  point is that Mr. Klebanov, member of the Constitutional  Conference and chairman of the Central Committee of Free Trade  Unions, does not have a job, is not engaged in socially useful  activities, does not have a passport in his possession, and  therefore is no different from any vagrant. And since he was not  born in Russia, the decision was made to expel him from the  country," said a ranking staff member at the reception center.  True, in the process, in his words, "the expulsion instruction  was not carried out exactly." Instead of delivering Mr. Klebanov  to Belarus, where he was born (although he does not have either  citizenship or a residence permit there), he was sent to  Ukraine. Whether he was actually delivered there, the reception  center staff does not know.    According to Free Trade Unions, however, Vladimir Klebanov  "escaped his escort during deportation." According to the  statement of Eduard Baykov, member of the Central Committee of  Free Trade Unions, Vladimir Klebanov, a noted human rights  activist and former prisoner of the Soviet GULAG, experienced in  underground work, was able to outwit his escort and once again  set himself free. The trade union leader is currently living  covertly in Moscow. It is not safe for him, however. At any time  there may be another attempt to grab Vladimir Klebanov and try  to deport him again.    In this connection a number of Russian trade unions issued  an  official statement that Vladimir Klebanov is a noted human  rights activist of the "stagnation" era and the organizer of the  first free and completely independent trade union structures in  the USSR, for which he was persecuted at the time. He has now  been completely exonerated. Persecution, however, continues, as  we can all see. This fact, the statement emphasizes, is not only  alarming but also an outrage. Especially considering that the  recently adopted Constitution proclaims broader than ever human  rights.    Russian trade unions demand that Vladimir Klebanov be  granted  "the legitimate right to carry out his public duties." Trade  union leaders expect the mayoralty and the Russian Ministry of  Internal Affairs to conduct a principled appraisal of the  incident. And at the same time guarantee to Mr. Klebanov, who  has been elected to his position by members of Free Trade  Unions, complete safety from a repetition of such arbitrariness  and finally resolve the issue of his residence permit.</p>

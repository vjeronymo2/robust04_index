			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: WHO'S HE THINK HE IS, MANOS DE HUEVOS?  </P> <P> It may be a long time before boxer Roberto Duran is invited back to Corpus  Christi, Tex., where he spoke at a recent luncheon.  </P> <P> According to Newsday's Wallace Matthews, Duran arrived in ragged jeans and a  T-shirt that barely covered his burgeoning belly, which has expanded by about  20 pounds since he defeated Iran Barkley for the World Boxing Council  middleweight title last month.  </P> <P> When the luncheon was delayed, Duran took a side trip to the hotel coffee shop.  He ignored the line of people waiting to be seated and brushed past the hostess  at the door. With a spring rarely seen in his legs nowadays, he headed straight  for the buffet table, where lunch was being served out of aluminum steam  tables. There, he dug his legendary "Hands of Stone" into the food, even into  the scrambled eggs, rarely considered finger-food.  </P> <P> His manager, Lou Duva, a witness to it all, stood back and laughed.  </P> <P> "That Duran," he said. "The guy hasn't changed a bit in the 20 years I know  him."  </P> <P> Jumping the gun: With the New York Yankees losing seven of their first nine  games, a radio station in Geneva, N.Y., has started a contest to guess the date  when Manager Dallas Green will be fired.  </P> <P> The winner will receive two season tickets to watch the Geneva Cubs, a minor  league team.  </P> <P> The Adams family: The first time Margo Adams accompanied Wade Boggs on a Boston  Red Sox trip, the team went to Kansas City.  </P> <P> When Boggs returned there recently, he saw Margo Adams every time he looked  into the stands.  </P> <P> A local radio station distributed Margo Adams masks to fans as they drove into  the parking lot at Royals Stadium.  </P> <P> The fans held them up and chanted, "Mar-go, Mar-go," whenever Boggs batted.  </P> <P> A novel idea, for sure, but not the best shot yet taken at Boggs. Last season  at Anaheim Stadium, home park for Adams, who is from Costa Mesa, the organist  played the theme from "The Addams Family" when Boggs batted. Boggs later  complained loudly enough that the organist ceased.  </P> <P> Hail to the victors: President George Bush, who played baseball at Yale, isn't  a bad basketball player, either.  </P> <P> When Michigan visited the White House after winning the National Collegiate  Athletic Assn. basketball title, Bush shot free throws with Rumeal Robinson,  who made the game-winning free throws in the championship game against Seton  Hall.  </P> <P> After Robinson sank a free throw on a portable hoop set up in the Rose Garden,  Bush made his free throw on the first try.  </P> <P> Pieces of a puzzle: The Utah Jazz has come up with a unique way to promote its  candidates for National Basketball Assn. postseason awards.  </P> <P> A box arrived in the mail with the following label: "Are You Puzzled About Who  to Vote for for the NBA Postseason Awards?"  </P> <P> Inside was a jigsaw puzzle picturing the Jazz candidates: Karl Malone and John  Stockton for most valuable player, Mark Eaton for defensive player of the year  and Thurl Bailey for best sixth man.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Scott Norton, U.S. Olympic trials freestyle wrestling champion in  1980, explaining that he is several years past his prime: "Wrestling is what I  did when I was skinny and athletic and could see my feet."  </P></p>

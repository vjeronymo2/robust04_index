			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Although some ships fly the Honduran flag, this  does not necessarily mean they are Honduran, President Carlos  Roberto Reina said yesterday in reference to the report that  Honduran-flagged ships have violated the embargo against Haiti.    He considered it distressing and unfortunate that the United  States and the inter-American system are about to adopt more  drastic measures to reestablish democracy in Haiti. He also  announced this topic will be addressed at the summit in  Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. [passage omitted]</p>

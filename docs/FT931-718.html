			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Singapore (6): Island of integrity - The financial centre has an enviable reputation FOR foreign bankers, brokers or fund managers, life in Singapore can be frustrating. They see the local economy continuing to grow at a cracking pace, and grumble about the relative lack of opportunities to invest in it. They covet the huge pool of official reserves and other funds under the government's control, knowing that there is little chance for outsiders to profit from helping to manage them, and envy Singapore's own cash-rich but highly conservative banks. And they chafe under the rule of the country's monetary authority, whose regulatory regime must outrank in severity that in any other of the world's money centres. Some gaze wistfully towards Hong Kong, and moan at Singapore's apparent failure to make the most of opportunities in its own hinterland. Their gripes are understandable but exaggerated. Finanzplatz Singapore may be a lot less exciting than its free-wheeling rival to the north. But with characteristic deliberation and single-mindedness it has carved for itself an important niche in handling the exploding flows of money around the region. Moreover, its reputation for boring integrity as opposed to speculative excess means it is in no danger of losing that niche, and may be well-placed to build on it - the more so if Hong Kong takes fright with the approach of the handback to China in 1997. As far as the banking sector is concerned, the numbers speak for themselves. Singapore is currently home or host to 135 banks, all but 13 of them foreign. Most are highly profitable: according to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), total profits for foreign banks in the country remained buoyant last year after a 36 per cent rise in 1990 and 41 per cent growth, to SDollars 1.84 bn, in 1991. Local banks' profits were also continuing to grow at a steady clip of 12-plus per cent. At a time when financial institutions in many parts of the world are struggling simply to stay in the black, Singapore must be doing something right. The activity increasingly at the heart of international banks' operations in the city state is foreign exchange trading. Figures from the Bank for International Settlements show that Singapore is now the world's fourth biggest forex trading centre, with an average daily trading volume of USDollars 74bn last year - still a long way behind London, New York and Tokyo but for the first time ahead of Zurich. Signs are that this growth will continue. More and more banks are making Singapore, with its world-class infrastructure and telecommunications, the centre for their Asian currency and interest rate business, trading a widening range of financial instruments: the biggest local forex operator, Union Bank of Switzerland, has expanded into a full-scale treasury operation and others are following. The authorities hope that the presence of so many integrated trading rooms in Singapore will act as an additional lure for multinational companies pondering whether to use the island as their Asia headquarters. They are also discreetly wooing other regional central banks. Brunei already manages its sizeable official reserves through Singapore, and the Bank of China is said to be on the point of establishing a branch there. The particular advantage of Singapore as a forex centre, say MAS officials, is its international character. Unlike Tokyo, which is dominated by dollar-yen trading, business in Singapore is spread more evenly between dollar-yen, dollar-D-mark and other trades, and smaller regional currencies are also playing a growing role. 'We have a much more diversified market with more depth and breadth than Tokyo,' said one official. 'Banks find it convenient to come here because you can trade a whole range of currencies.' Another increasingly important string to Singapore's trading bow is Simex, the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, which after years spent on the margins of the financial futures business now claims to be the fastest growing futures market in the world. Total turnover roughly doubled last year to 12m lots as Simex grabbed an increasing share of trading in contracts based on Tokyo's Nikkei stock index and Euroyen interest rates. The exchange plans to build on this success with the imminent launch of a Hong Kong stock index contract, and by expanding links with growing centres such as Taipei, with a view to becoming Asia's financial futures capital. Singapore-based banks are benefiting in part from the difficulties being experienced in many other financial centres around the world. Although the interbank Asian dollar market is scarcely growing at present, and has actually shrunk from its peak in 1990, it has become significantly more profitable. Competition from Japanese banks, in particular, has become less intense as they struggle to comply with BIS capital ratios; as a result, interest margins have improved. Similarly healthy profits are being recorded in the domestic credit market: domestic loans and advances rose by 8 per cent in 1992 as banks cashed in on the local construction boomlet and the general pickup in economic growth towards the end of the year. Singapore-based banks are grabbing an increasing slice of lucrative regional loan syndication business, too, and are major issuers of Asian dollar bonds. It is when you consider the broader picture, however, that Singapore's current limitations as a financial centre begin to become clear. Active currency and futures businesses are useful tools for a country seeking to maintain and enhance its entrepot status. But they do not quite constitute a capital market with real depth and diversity; nor, given the vast resources at its disposal, do they measure up to Singapore's true potential as a financial power. Indeed, there are a number of specific domains in which foreign bankers and brokers argue that Singapore risks being overshadowed by regional rivals in the next few years. The stock market is one. The Singapore Stock Exchange, once the leading market in South-east Asia, has long been dwarfed by its counterparts in Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur - now in competition with Singapore although some Malaysian stocks are still listed there. Buying shares in an economy growing at 6 per cent or more a year should be an enticing prospect, and did entice seven foreign brokers to take seats on the exchange two years ago. But the buying opportunities are sparse. With much of the economy under the control of the government or of multinational investors, only a narrow range of Singaporean companies is listed. In all but a tiny number of stocks, trading is thin and illiquid, overall volume is not rising, and price/earnings ratios compare unfavourably with those on offer elsewhere in the region - albeit in markets where the risks are much higher. Brokers complain of onerous tax arrangements, and of cumbersome and intrusive market regulation. As a result, Singapore has had fewer new companies seeking listings than some of its peers, and the market has been slow to develop. 'Five years ago as a foreign investor you had a choice of Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore/Malaysia,' said one broker. 'Now there's a lot of choices. Thailand is a much bigger market. You don't have to be here if you don't want to be.' Some relief may be at hand, however, in the form of long-awaited privatisations. Later this year, the government plans to float a stake - probably 25 per cent, with a tranche offered to foreign investors - in Singapore Telecom, its highly profitable telephone monopoly. The multi-billion dollar issue, which is expected to be heavily subscribed, will immediately add volume and breadth to the market. It is also being seen as the harbinger of further partial privatisations - notably involving the port authority and other utilities. The authorities are also anxious to develop stock options and other derivatives on the exchange, which may further enliven proceedings in due course. Singapore's banks, too, face a daunting regional challenge. By tradition they are staid, unadventurous institutions, preferring to focus their attention on the domestic market rather than expanding aggressively into the riskier world outside. Their rewards have been strong and reliable profits and a capital base that most international banks can only dream of (most have capital ratios well in excess of the ultra-conservative 12 per cent standard set by the MAS). The authorities - proud of a record untainted by bank failures or scandals - have long encouraged the banks in their caution, both through their 'safety first' approach to regulation and through their restrictions on the international use of the Singapore dollar. Now, however, they are exhorting the banks, like other Singaporean companies, to work harder on building a regional presence, which means building overseas branch networks and deposit bases. It is far from clear that the bosses of the big four banks are equipped, by temperament or experience, for the task - although some local bankers and financiers are already dipping a toe in the water by establishing venture capital funds for investment in other Asian countries. Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's senior minister, has endorsed this trend, saying: 'Overseas development funds are an important segment of our capital market which we must develop.' There is one other big impediment to the rapid development of Singapore as a diversified regional capital market and fund management centre: the government's restrictive approach to information, underlined last year by a crackdown on journalists and brokers after the leaking to the Business Times of an official estimate for growth. The foreign financial community remains bewildered about this affair. But perhaps the authorities - mindful of the dangers of loosening control - are happy with the financial industry just as it is.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL AFTER TAX PROFITS OF LOCAL &amp; FOREIGN BANKS IN SINGAPORE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 1989     1990    1991   1st 1/2 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The local Big 4 (Dollars m)    765.8    822.5    923.4         499.6 % rise on previous period       29.9      7.4     12.3          12.9 All foreign banks (Dollars m)  955.5  1,301.5  1,836.8            na % rise on previous period        8.9     36.2     41.1            na  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BAKERSFIELD FOILS PIERCE UPSET BID IN 38-35 WIN  </P> <P> In Bob Enger's final game as the Pierce College football coach, he came within  a second of a masterminding a stunning upset of Bakersfield, the No. 1 team in  the country.  </P> <P> Bakersfield turned back the Brahmas, 38-35, on a 47-yard field goal by Jon  Baker with one second left Friday night at Pierce.  </P> <P> A 42-yard field-goal attempt by Pierce's Steve Szekely fell far short with 25  seconds left. Bakersfield then drove 45 yards in the next 24 seconds to set up  the winning field goal in the Western State Conference finale.  </P> <P> "This was our best offensive effort, and I thought it was a courageous  defensive effort," Enger said. "I just was real proud of my kids."  </P> <P> Pierce pulled ahead, 35-28, with 6:38 left when D. J. Vlaming plunged in from a  yard for a touchdown.  </P> <P> David Dunn returned the ensuing kickoff 61 yards and Bakersfield tied the score  on a one-yard run by Nathan Dupree slightly more than two minutes later.  </P> <P> Pierce quarterback Jamie Grossman kept Bakersfield defenders on their heels,  completing 19 of 30 passes for 288 yards and three touchdowns.  </P> <P> Grossman's favorite targets were Carlton Bowen, who had six catches for 70  yards, and Jay Rich, who caught seven for 123.  </P> <P> LaShante Parker added 115 yards and a touchdown in 19 carries for Pierce.  </P> <P> Bakersfield was led by the running tandem of Dupree and Shon Ellerbe. Dupree  finished with 196 yards in 27 carries and Ellerbe had 111 in 18. Both finished  with more than 1,000 rushing yards on the season.  </P> <P> Each scored a touchdown within the first seven minutes of the second half to  put Bakersfield ahead, 21-14, but Pierce refused to fold.  </P> <P> "We did get down for a little bit," Enger said. "We talked about how this could  go to 90 (Bakersfield points) or we could suck it up."  </P> <P> Bakersfield improved to 10-0 overall, 9-0 in conference play and 5-0 in  division play. Pierce is 4-6, 4-5, 2-3.  </P> <P> Pierce led, 14-7, at the half, the first time this season the Renegades have  trailed at halftime.  </P> <P> Pierce jumped to a 7-0 lead on its first possession and Bakersfield found  itself trailing for only the third time this season.  </P> <P> Pierce marched 76 yards for its first touchdown and Grossman capped the drive  when he rolled right on a play-action pass and hit Arie McQuaig for a five-yard  touchdown at the 7:23 mark.  </P></p>

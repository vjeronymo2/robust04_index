			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Campaign to fight VAT on papers A CAMPAIGN against taxes on the sales of books and newspapers was launched yesterday by the newspaper and publishing industry. The move comes amid indications that one of the Budget options being considered by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is imposition of either the full 17.5 per cent level of value added tax or a reduced rate of 5 per cent on books, newspapers and periodicals. These, together with other items such as food and childrens' clothes, are currently exempt from VAT. The organisers of the Hands Off Reading Campaign warned that a fifth of local newspapers would be forced to close with the loss of 2,500 jobs if VAT was imposed, citing figures from a recent Price Waterhouse study. They warn that at least two national newspapers could be forced to shut. About 1,700 magazines - a third of the total - would be forced to close, a similar study by BDO Binder Hamlym warns. The figures are calculated assuming a VAT rate of 17.5 per cent. But Price Waterhouse stresses that even the imposition of a reduced rate of tax on the industry would have devastating effects. Government statistics show that VAT on newspapers, magazines and books would raise about Pounds 1bn, about half of which would come from newspapers. In spite of figures earlier this week showing that book sales are rising, campaign organisers insist that costlier publications will mean fewer readers. According to the campaign's opinion poll a third of people questioned claimed they would buy fewer newspapers if they were taxed.</p>

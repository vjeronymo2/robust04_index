			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / German motorway charge drives into trouble THE German government's plan to impose a new road tax on autobahn users ran into a barrage of abuse yesterday, mostly from motorists. As Germans woke up to the fact that their favourite weekend pastime - alternately dicing with death at unlimited speeds, and sitting in autobahn traffic jams - was going to cost them up to DM400 (Pounds 166) a year, the flak started flying. Mr Otto Flimm, president of ADAC, the motorists' club, said his members already paid petrol taxes and it was unreasonable to make them pay twice. He suggested a special tax on lorries. Mr Ekkehard Gries, transport spokesman of the Free Democrats (FDP), the crusading free marketeers in the ruling coalition, called the plan 'nothing more than money-skimming'. Even the left wing, anti-motor lobby was critical. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of the engineering union, IG Metall, called it 'an act of monumental dim-wittedness'. The Greens said making motorists pay to drive on motorways would only encourage them to use them more, in order to get value for their money. According to an instant opinion poll by the Forsa research institute, 46 per cent of Germans will stop using the autobahns if the charge is introduced. Some 12 per cent said they would take to public transport, and 37 per cent will carry on regardless. The final blow came from Mr Klaus Steffenhagen, chairman of the police trade union in North Rhine-Westphalia, where a web of autobahns covers the industrial heartland. He said his members were already overworked and underpaid, and would not enforce the new system. 'We will fight this one all the way,' he said, 'to make sure our members don't have to turn into tax inspectors.' The extraordinary backlash took Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his colleagues by surprise. The transport ministry hastily explained that the tax was only a first step, to an electronic toll system which would charge motorists by the mile. Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, said no date for its introduction, nor any figure for the motorway charge, had been agreed.</p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Tax on interest I GET a company pension paid monthly into my bank account and taxed under the PAYE regulations. In addition, I receive gross interest payments from government stocks purchased on the National Savings stock register. In the past, such interest payments were the subject of a separate assessment payable on January 1. In recent years, though, the estimated interest for the current tax year has been included in my PAYE coding notice so that I am paying tax, via my pension payments, on such estimated interest before I receive it. Does the Inland Revenue have the right to exercise this method of securing payment of the tax due, or could I insist on the interest payments being the subject of a separate assessment? Many (perhaps most) people seem to prefer to have their untaxed interest taken into account in their PAYE coding in order to spread the tax burden evenly over the year. So, your tax inspector acted reasonably in assuming you had no objection to his proposal since you apparently did not object when you got the first coding notice advising you of the proposed change a few years ago. If you have received a coding notice for 1993-94 (which is unlikely), you should write to the inspector giving notice of objection to the proposed code number, in accordance with regulation 10 (1) of the Income tax (Employments) Regulations 1973: 'If the employee is aggrieved by the inspector's determination, he may give notice of objection to the inspector, stating the grounds of his objection.' If, on the other hand, no coding notice has yet been sent to you for 1993-94, you should simply write to the tax office and tell them that you want all your allowances to be taken into account in your PAYE coding, and that no allowances should be set against your Schedule D (III/VI) assessments for 1993-94 and subsequently. Incidentally, if you have not already seen one, you might like to ask your tax office for a copy of the free pamphlet IR68 (accrued-income scheme: taxing securities on transfer). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in thses columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Removing lead from the recipe Ingredients usually found in indigestion tablets have helped Cookson Group, the international materials company, to launch an advanced range of unleaded glazes and colours specifically aimed at the tableware industry. In California every piece of crockery made with traditional lead glazes and colours has to carry a health warning. 'What we have done is to find a substitute for lead and therefore secure the market for the future,' said Cecil Hancock, managing director of Cookson Ceramics. The new glazes and colours, devised by a team of ceramists, chemists and physicists, are based on bismuth and alkaline borosillicates. They come in either liquid or powder form and look identical to their leaded counterparts. Cookson Ceramics: UK, 0782 599111.</p>

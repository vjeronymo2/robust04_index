			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 16 May (INA) -- Yemeni Army units yesterday  advanced 30 km into Haraz region, around 65 km west of Aden,  which they had captured last Thursday [12 May].    The commander of the Khalid Bin-al-Walid Camp, operating  with  the Yemeni Command, told an INA correspondent in Sanaa -- who  was with a press mission on a visit to the region organized by  the Yemeni Information Ministry -- that the Khalid Bin-al-Walid  and 'Urubah Brigades had inflicted huge losses on the  secessionist troops, forcing them to retreat and surrender.    The commander said the 25th Mechanized Brigade, one of the  strongest units of the secessionists, 50 km west of Aden, was  among the secessionist troops that surrendered to the forces of  legitimacy in the battles that erupted on 12 May.    Several Yemeni military commanders have asserted that a  large  number of citizens were supporting the forces of legitimacy  against the remnants of the secessionists.    The Yemeni government's forces of legitimacy are advancing  toward Aden, the secessionists' key stronghold, from the  following axes: the Abyan-al-'Anad axis, from Abyan, al-Hawtah,  and al-'Alam, 12-15 km east of Aden; from the northern axis,  around 80 km from the al- 'Anad Base, which is around 60 km  north of Aden; and from the west in the direction of the Aden  garrison (Salah-al-Din Camp), which is around 15-50 km north and  west of Aden in the direction of Bab el Mandeb.    Military sources say the fall of the al-'Anad Base will  signal the collapse of the secessionists' main point of strength.    The forces of legitimacy are currently in control of regions  4 km away from the al-'Anad Base, which is expected to fall  within the next 24 hours, according to official Yemeni military  sources.</p>

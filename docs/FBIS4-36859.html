			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Ehud Ya'ari] </F>   [Text] Sources in Tunis told us this evening that there is  a delay and that Yasir 'Arafat will not arrive in the autonomous  areas before the end of the month, perhaps not until mid-July.    'Arafat will not come alone. It now appears that two weeks  ago the PLO submitted to Israel a list of 600 senior PLO  activists, officials, and officers from Tunis in order to obtain  approval for their arrival in Gaza and Jericho. Another list of  600 names is on its way. Altogether some 1,200 men and their  families will arrive. Contrary to 'Arafat's original plan, his  new move calls for moving most of the PLO bodies from Tunis to  the territories. Only the foreign relations offices of Faruq  Qaddumi and Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] will remain in Tunis along  with several other branches. These offices will constitute a  powerful rear headquarters. 'Arafat will also keep his  residence in (Yugorta) Street.    The practical meaning of 'Arafat's move is the elimination  --  at least on the face of it -- of PLO-Tunis and replanting it  among the higher echelons of the PLO in the territories.  'Arafat has apparently decided not to keep too many  institutions in Tunis over and above the autonomy institutions.  One of the reasons for this is that he has received hints from  the Tunisian president that it is time for a parting of the ways.    Some of the candidates for return have decided to  temporarily  leave their families in Amman. Most of them want to live in the  West Bank rather than in Gaza and Jericho, in which only a  handful of them can be housed. Israel has not given its  approval yet, but most of the requests will be approved.    The lists include some important surprises. Several Fatah  officials who were known for their opposition to the Oslo  agreement want to come with 'Arafat.    Others, such as 'Abbas Zaki and Hani al-Hasan, are still  undecided. In the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine  and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine there  are signs of a split. Some 40 activists from the organization  of George Habash -- a firm opponent of the agreement -- want to  arrive with 'Arafat. Among them are (Abu-Nidal Musalmah), a  veteran official in charge of secret activities in the  territories, and 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, a member of the PLO  Executive Committee. One of the two may join the Palestinian  Authority. A similar phenomenon can be noticed in Nayif  Hawatimah's organization, where some 20 activists are included  in the lists of those wanting to return, among them Taysir  Khalid, a member of the PLO Executive Committee. At the present  time all of the above will apparently be allowed to return for  only a visit.    The list, which is on its way to Israel, includes  approximately 300 Fatah fighters from Tyre and Sidon who are  awaiting the order to leave Lebanon and come to Gaza.</p>

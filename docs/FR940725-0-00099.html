			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Coordinated Services Between Maternal and Child Health Programs and Home and Community-Based Service Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 9502(h) of COBRA added a new section 1915(c)(8) to the Act. This section allows the State agency that administers the Medicaid plan to make cooperative arrangements, whenever appropriate, with the State agency that administers the program for children with special health care needs under the Maternal and Child Health Program (Title V of the Act), to improve access to coordinated services to meet the children's needs. The amendment made by section 9502(h) was effective April 7, 1986.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed rule, we redesignated the existing &sect;441.306 as &sect;441.308 and added a new &sect;441.306 to incorporate the provisions of section 1915(c)(8) of the Act, as added by section 9502(h) of COBRA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We did not receive any public comments on this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Provisions of the Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are adopting the proposed regulations, without modification, as final rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Limitation on Participants in Waiver Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 9502(i) of COBRA added a new section 1915(c)(9) to the Act. This addition provides that when a waiver contains a limit on the number of individuals who can receive home and community-based services, the State may substitute additional individuals to replace any recipients who die or become ineligible for Medicaid services under the State plan. This provision was effective on April 7, 1986.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed rule, we redesignated existing &sect;441.305 as &sect;441.307 and added a new &sect;441.305 to provide that a State may substitute additional individuals to replace those under a home and community-based services waiver who die or become ineligible for waiver services, when the waiver contains a federally imposed limit on the number of individuals receiving waiver services, as specified in section 1915(c)(9) of the Act, as added by section 9502(i) of COBRA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4118(b) (entitled ``Increase in Number of Individuals Who May Be Served Under Model Home and Community-Based Services Waiver) of OBRA '87 amended section 1915(c) of the Act by adding a new paragraph (10) that states that ``No waiver under this subsection shall limit by an amount less than 200 the number of individuals in the State who may receive home and community-based services under such waiver.'' We interpreted this provision as restricting the Secretary's ability to limit the number of recipients a State could serve in a model waiver program. That is, the Secretary may not place a limit below 200 on the number of persons a State may serve. While the provision could, arguably, be read to limit the actual number of individuals who may receive model waiver services to no less than 200, based on the legislative history, and the history of the section 1915(c) program, we believe that this reading is unsupportable. First, model waiver programs have historically had a Federally established limit of 50 individuals who could receive services. Second, the limited size of the program is specifically noted in the OBRA '87 Conference Report (H. Rept. No. 495, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 755 (1987)), in the section describing the current state of the law. Finally, section 4118 of MCCA is entitled ``Increase in Number of Individuals Who May Be Served Under Model Home and Community-Based Services Waiver.'' On these bases, we believe that the Congress intended to enable States to serve a greater number of persons while maintaining the Secretary's authority to impose a limit on programs which she believes are of excessive size.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 411(k)(10)(A) of MCCA further amended section 1915(c)(10) of the Act in an attempt to clarify the language in section 4118(b) of OBRA '87, and confirmed our interpretation of the Congress' intent in enacting that provision. This amendment restricts the Secretary's power to limit the number of persons who can receive home and community-based waivers to no lower than 200. Again, in light of the history of the waiver program and the legislative history of this provision, we interpret this amendment to restrict the Secretary's power to limit the number of participants in the model waiver program only. Historically, there has been no limit on the number of participants in the regular home and community-based waiver programs, whereas there has been a 50-person Federally imposed limit on the number of persons who can participate in a model waiver. Also, section 411(k)(10)(A) was specifically enacted to remedy the ambiguity in section 4118(b), which itself was aimed only at model waivers. We believe, therefore, that this provision enables the Secretary to limit the number of participants in a model home and community-based program to 200 persons, or any amount above 200. Through these regulations, the Secretary has opted to impose a maximum limit of 200 persons for any State waiver program. On an individual State basis, an approved State plan may contain a maximum limit that is lower than 200. Thus, no State may serve any more than 200 persons, but any State may be limited to a lower number as approved in its waiver program. There is no comparable limit on regular waiver programs. Thus, the 200-person limit represents the maximum number of individuals that a State may serve under a ``model'' home and community-based services waiver at any one time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

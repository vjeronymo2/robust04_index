A statement  issued by the NDG's Information Committee said that the Sudanese  regime has not been content with imposing high taxes on the  people to overcome its acute economic crisis. It has started to  sell the Sudanese people's remaining vital utilities, such as  the government's tannery and Sudanese Airways.    The statement denounced the government's intention to sell  the prisons in Omdurman, Kabar, and Port Sudan to complement its  previous plans. The statement stressed that these utilities are  public properties that should not be disposed of without the  consent of the freely elected representatives of the people.  The statement warned everyone against submitting tenders to buy  these properties, stressing that the sale contracts would be  null and void and that the ownership of these properties would  revert to the Sudanese people once the regime is toppled.</p>

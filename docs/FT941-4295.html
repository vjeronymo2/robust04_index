			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Kymmene cuts loss to FM256m Losses fell sharply at Kymmene, the Finnish forestry group, last year as the group reaped the benefits of cost-cutting and a weaker Finnish markka. The deficit after financial items was FM256m (Dollars 46.5m), compared with FM1.36bn a year earlier and a FM1.30bn loss in 1991. In spite of the result, the company restored its dividend, paying FM1 per share, as it predicted a generally improved market environment for this year. In the final four months of 1993 the group showed a FM81m profit, its first profit since 1990. 'The European market for forest products remained weak and prices for pulp and paper plunged to unprecedented levels,' the group said. However, it said its volumes rose because of increased exports to markets outside Europe and reduced imports into Europe. This helped sales to rise to FM16.3bn from FM13.6bn, although the weaker markka was the main reason for the increase. All the group's divisions improved their performance, except chemical pulp, helping operating profit to rise to FM1.59bn from FM394m. However, losses from foreign subsidiaries, especially in France and Germany (both strong currency countries), depressed the group's result, keeping it in the red at a time when domestic rivals Metsa-Serla, Repola and Enso-Gutzeit have returned to profit.</p>

			<p>SUMMARY                                    Japanese media reporting suggests that the Japanese Government is  prepared to make some modest concessions on selected U.S.-Japan  trade framework issues, most notably those involving the  automobile and auto parts sector and government procurement.  The  pressure to make such concessions appears to be coming from parts  of the government, mainly within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  (MOFA), that are reportedly increasingly concerned about the  consequences of the hard line Tokyo has been taking in the  framework talks.  At the same time, however, Tokyo appears to  remain united in its opposition to any concessions on the issue  of setting objective criteria to measure Japan's trade  performance, suggesting concessions are unlikely in this area.                                 END SUMMARY      The Japanese Government appears to be searching for ways to  resolve the impasse in the Japan-U.S. framework negotiations and  avert the failure of the 11 February summit between President  Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa by making some  modest concessions in key areas, judging from Japanese press  reporting.  In the automobile and auto parts sectors, for  example, the government has begun to signal that it is prepared  to work with the Japanese auto industry to devise a plan to  increase Japanese purchases of U.S.-made autos and auto parts.      -- According to a 28 January Kyodo report, Sozaburo Okamatsu,  Vice Minister of International Trade and Industry for  International Affairs, told a press conference on 28 January that  his ministry was urging the Japanese auto industry to take a  "cooperative approach" to increasing imports of U.S.-made cars  and auto parts.  Okamatsu reportedly stated that this approach,  designed to dispel "mutual distrust" between Tokyo and  Washington, would involve each automaker setting criteria, such  as specifying the number of Japanese dealerships selling U.S.-  made cars and the number of firms cooperating with U.S. auto  parts makers to design parts for use in Japanese-made cars.  Okamatsu reportedly added that these criteria would then be used  to evaluate Japanese firms' import performance twice a year and  to decide whether additional steps to increase imports were  necessary.      -- In addition, the 24 January Mainichi Shimbun reported that the  Japanese Government was broaching such a voluntary import plan  with the Japanese auto industry, focusing particularly on the  development of joint U.S.-Japan ventures to help U.S. firms  design auto parts for use in Japanese-made cars.      The details of the Japanese Government's plans appear to still be  under consideration.  While Okamatsu reportedly stated that the  criteria he mentioned might be used to evaluate the performance  of Japanese companies twice a year, the 2 February Nihon Keizai  Shimbun reported the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI) is broaching with Japanese automakers a plan under which  each automaker would issue a yearly projection of the volume of  specific U.S.-made items it would purchase.  This plan also  reportedly involves reciprocal actions on the part of U.S. auto  makers, including the submission of yearly projections of exports  to Japan.      Another proposal under consideration appears to be the  establishment of a third-party organ to assess the degree of  foreign participation in the Japanese auto market.  According to  the 2 February Nihon Keizai Shimbun, this proposal will be  presented to U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor during his  current visit to Tokyo.  The paper stated that MITI envisions  that the panel will be composed of scholars and the  representatives of private companies and will assess both  Japanese import performance and U.S. export efforts based on such  criteria as the volume of Japanese automobile and auto parts  imports and the number of sales outlets selling imported cars.  According to Nihon Keizai Shimbun, MITI wants the criteria used  by the panel to include the number of cars made by U.S.  automakers--such as right-hand drive vehicles--tailored to the  demands of the Japanese market.      Government Procurement      A second area where the government appears to be prepared to make  concessions is government procurement.  According to the 28  January Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Tokyo is drafting a new action  program designed to make government procurement more open not  only for public works projects but also for such areas as  communications and medical equipment.  The paper reported that  the draft program will expand the principle of open competitive  bidding to all projects of more that 500,000 Special Drawing  Rights (SDR) (down from the current 1 million SDRs).  The program  will also introduce a comprehensive evaluation system that will  take into consideration not only the price of items to be  procured, but also such factors as performance, particularly for  supercomputers; and will establish a neutral review board to  arbitrate complaints related to government procurement.  Nihon  Keizai Shimbun reported, however, that the review board will not  have jurisdiction over some areas, most notably supercomputers.      In a further effort to signal its readiness to make government  procurement more open, Tokyo reportedly plans to inaugurate a new  government publication to announce upcoming projects.  According  to the 1 February Nihon Keizai Shimbun, this publication has been  tentatively named the Government Procurement Gazette and will be  included in the action program for opening the government  procurement market.  The gazette will reportedly consolidate  information currently published in a number of different  government publications and will be issued in both Japanese and  English editions.      Pressure from MOFA      Some of these concessions may be the result of pressure from  elements within the Foreign Ministry.  Japanese press reporting  has suggested that key officials in MOFA are increasingly  concerned about the impact that the impasse in the talks may have  on the upcoming summit between President Clinton and Prime  Minister Hosokawa, and more broadly, on relations between Japan  and the United States in general.  According to the 26 January  Sankei Shimbun, some MOFA officials increasingly believe that  Japanese negotiators have become so involved in rebutting  specific U.S. arguments that they have lost sight of the broad  issues involved in the talks.  Sankei Shimbun reported that these  officials believe that the broad U.S. argument--that the Japanese  government procurement, automobile, auto parts and insurance  markets are less open than U.S. and European markets and that  intra-industry trade in underdeveloped--is "essentially correct."  They reportedly are arguing that it is counterproductive for  Japanese negotiators to keep insisting that the United States  take steps to increase U.S. exports to Japan because this stance  runs the risk of making Washington think that "Japan is trying to  avoid the real issues."  According to Sankei Shimbun, some of the  MOFA officials who support this line of argument have been  pushing for Japan to make concessions in the automobile and auto  parts sectors, suggesting that the Japanese auto industry could  take steps to increase imports.      Recent statements by, or attributed to, MOFA officials tend to  support the conclusion that some MOFA officials are pushing for a  more flexible Japanese approach to the framework talks.  The 26  January Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted Japanese Ambassador to the  United States Takakazu Kuriyama as stating during a 25 January  news conference in Washington that "Tokyo and Washington earlier  agreed during construction talks to set criteria to assess the  openness of the Japanese construction market.  This will serve as  a precedent and will be good for reference."  The 2 February  edition of the same paper reported that Kuriyama told Prime  Minister Hosokawa on 1 February that the United States was taking  "a tough approach to the framework talks" and that he hoped that  Hosokawa would "exercise leadership to conclude the talks."  The  1 February Asahi Shimbun cited an unnamed senior MOFA official as  expressing concern that the framework negotiations might fail if  the impasse is not resolved.      United Front Against Objective Criteria      Despite the signs of modest concessions and the divisions within  the government over Tokyo's hardline stance in the framework  talks, Tokyo appears to remain united in its opposition to  setting objective criteria to measure Japan's trade performance.      -- During his news conference after the passage of the political  reform bills on 29 January, Prime Minister Hosokawa said that  although he had instructed Japanese officials to search for  compromises in the framework talks, he believed that Japan should  "clearly insist on our stance" (NHK Television, 29 January).      -- According to the 1 February Asahi Shimbun, Hosokawa and MITI  head Hiroshi Kumagai during a 29 January meeting reconfirmed  Japan's stance on the issue of objective criteria, stating that  "matters to be discussed at the Japan-U.S. economic framework  talks should be confined to what the government can do using its  authority, and Japan will not set any numerical targets."      -- During a 1 February news conference, Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata reportedly stated that Japan would never accept the setting  of numerical targets, asserting that "such criteria run counter  to Japanese Government efforts to promote deregulation" (Kyodo, 1  February).      -- During a 27 January news conference, MITI Administrative Vice  Minister Hideaki Kumano reportedly rejected a U.S. call for  setting targets for the import of U.S. cars into Japan, calling  it "out of the question" and "inconceivable" and arguing that  "the Japanese Government cannot commit itself to goods that  Japanese consumers buy" (Mainichi Shimbun, 28 January).      -- According to the 26 January Yomiuri Shimbun, Ambassador  Kuriyama stated during a 25 January news conference that the  United States "has been overly hasty in seeking trade results  from the [framework] talks."      The Japanese Government appears to remain under considerable  political pressure to maintain this stance.  Business leaders,  who will provide critical financial support in future elections  even under the new political reform legislation, have continued  to press the government to oppose objective criteria.  According  to the 31 January Mainichi Shimbun, a group of Japanese business  leaders, including Takeshi Nagano, the President of the Japan  Federation of Employers Associations and Shoichiro Toyoda, the  Chairman of Toyota Motor Corporation, met with Prime Minister  Hosokawa on 30 January to urge him to continue to oppose the  setting of objective criteria to measure Japan's import  performance.      The Japanese media, possibly with the encouragement of the  Japanese Government, also appears to have fostered a climate of  public opinion highly critical of the concept of objective  criteria.  In addition to reporting the numerous statements of  Japanese officials arguing against the concept of targets, the  media has featured a variety of reports discrediting that  concept.  For example, on 28 January, Nihon Keizai Shimbun,  Japan's leading economic newspaper, reported that a group called  the "Scholars Against Managed Trade," consisting of 154 Japanese  and foreign economists and political scientists and headed by  Kazuo Ueda, an economics professor at Tokyo University--which has  close ties with the government--issued a "policy proposal"  criticizing objective criteria as "something that promotes  government-led managed trade."  According to Nihon Keizai  Shimbun, the policy paper argued that if the Japanese Government  accepted objective criteria, Japan would "face unreasonable trade  demands from the United States" and be hit with U.S. sanctions if  it failed to meet the criteria.  In addition, Japanese editorial  opinion has continued to oppose numerical targets.  An editorial  in the 31 January Asahi Shimbun, for example, described Japan's  rejection of objective criteria as "reasonable" and warned that  "setting target figures in individual trade fields is undesirable  since it is what we call managed trade."      Outlook      As the 11 February summit approaches, Tokyo will probably make  further modest, selected concessions on framework issues to avert  failure of the summit and to avoid increased friction with the  United States.  In order to maintain its argument that the  Japanese Government cannot interfere with the private sector,  Tokyo is likely to attempt to cloak these concessions as  agreements between the private sectors in the United States and  Japan.  However, the unanimity of opposition to the setting of  objective criteria to measure Japan's trade performance--cutting  across all the main political forces in Japan, including leading  politicians, the bureaucracy, the business sector, and the media-  -suggests that the Japanese Government will be reluctant, if not  unable, to make any concessions in this area.

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Arts: Mellowed up for kicks - Television Last week's viewing taught me another use of the word 'mellow'. On Teenage Kicks (BBC2, 8.00), young teenagers explained that 'mellowing up' is one of the agreeable states of mind they achieve from doing drugs. 'Mellowing up' also perfectly captures the goal sought by millions of adults at least once a day as that first icy campari or warm claret courses down their gullets. The much-publicised statistic was that 50 per cent of teenagers have experimented with an illicit drug. It came from an unpublished Manchester University survey of 750 teenagers in the north-west of England, starting-point for the documentary. But is this figure really so alarming? As a pleasant-sounding young lass of around 15 told the interviewer, 'Everyone's tried everything'. Her ambition was to go into the police force. What is youth if not the time to experiment? Clearly, more youngsters today do drugs than in my generation, and unlike us they have access to a veritable cocktail-cabinet of the stuff at very cheap prices; Pounds 2.50 for a tab of LSD, cannabis for two nights for Pounds 1 a head. What one really needs to assess is how serious are the possible consequences. Kids interviewed on the programme were adamant that they would not be graduating to 'dirty', addictive drugs. They take pleasure from feeling that they are in control of potentially hazardous substances which they pick and mix with a sophistication not so far removed from a wine-connoisseur planning what will be served at dinner. One of the film's themes was that drugs have always elicited a hysterical response from the older generation. These days, politicians find the demonic image of the drugs is particularly welcome since it is more convenient to blame rising crime on drugs than to fend off the suggestion that high youth unemployment is the key factor in increased burglaries and muggings. If it is true that 50 per cent of young people take drugs 'as casually as their parents drink or smoke', does it matter? Reading this column will be bankers, publishers, doctors, and barristers, people who themselves were once teenage drug-takers. It is interesting to reflect how different things might have been if they had they been caught. Nowadays, the police let off many people caught with drugs; in 1991, 50 per cent of drug offences were dealt with by cautions. One of the many unsatisfactory aspects of the current situation is that it gives the police too much leeway to discriminate over which kid with cannabis they prosecute  -Wykehamist or Walthamstow black. The only reference to class background and drugs was an academic's vague observation that 'people from middle-class homes turn up in the statistics'. The real risk to teenagers' health was another topic skirted round rather than addressed. We heard that 'every weekend' sees drug tragedies at a Manchester hospital; how many are teenagers and what have they taken? Similarly, how real a risk is dehydration for the frenzied dancers at all-night parties, swallowing 'uppers' and Ecstasy at Pounds 15 a go? Even so, this was a strong programme which will surely have nudged some viewers nearer the notion that government needs to engage with the question of liberaling drugs. As another good documentary, BBC 2's Assignment: The War on Drugs recently showed, it is an opinion increasingly common in Europe and the US, and argued by some policemen here. At the very least, Teenage Kicks showed that for adults to base their views about drugs on complacency, double-think and ignorance is no use as a response to teenagers' natural desire to mellow up of an evening. For a lesson in how not to edit a documentary you needed to watch two documentaries on Thursday; the week's instalment of The Dog's Tale (BBC2, Thursday) and C4's Critical Eye: Proud Arabs and Texas Oilmen. Both programmes were quite extraordinarily disjointed, leaping from subject to subject and, in the case of the latter, chucking images together in an infuriating way. This was a pity because both had interesting material. The Dog's Tale investigated the spiritual significance of the dog across cultures. A Siberian tribe merited only a brief appearance because of their interesting but unphotogenic custom of sacrificing huskies. The Dalai Lama was interviewed in a humorous mood, wondering whether because one of his dogs has no sex drive it suggested that it was a reincarnated monk. The programme continually veered between two fascinating films, one of which was the opposing attitudes to the dog held by Zoroastrians and Moslems in Bombay and the other dog-fighting in Japan. One moment we were watching a Zoroastrian boy being ritually washed in bull's urine. The next we were with Nobaharu Hamono, godfather to a clan of Yakuza, Mafia-style mobsters, watching Tosa dogs fighting in a forest near Tokyo. Tosa dogs were an unexpected result of contact between western missionaries and the Japanese in the last century. In the second world war, Tosa fights entertained troops at the front line. Now Tosas amuse Yakuza bosses, who will spend as much as Pounds 1 million each on holding a tournament. Rules are strict and dogs lose if they make as if to copulate - another clue, perhaps, to the past life of the Dalai Lama's dog? 'The last people to deal properly with proud Arabs are Texan oilmen like Bush and Baker, impatient men', ruminated Lord Healey in the C4 documentary about the Gulf War and the effect on Iraq of sanctions. Lord Healey cast doubt on the US official figure of the casualties as being between 75,000 and 120,000, quoting instead a figure of 75,000 just for civilian casualties. Lady Olga Maitland stoutly maintained that the war was 'a job well done'. The film's thesis was that the US bullied, bribed, and ignored the UN, and that there was no moral justification for the war. Oddly, it overlooked the claim for Iraq's nuclear capability and it also left Israel quite out of the picture. However, its principal weakness was in a bombardment of images which were often dubiously relevant and hackneyed to boot. The narrator had an exceedingly boring voice. From almost the first line spoken in Mark Lawson's play, The Vision Thing (BBC 2, 925), I thought we were in for a bad do. As the Tory prime minister (competently acted by Richard Wilson) walked to the podium to address the party conference, his party chairman (hammed up by Derek Jacobi) muttered: 'Let's hope he gets their clitoris.' And Lawson thinks that is funny? It might sound like an obvious recipe for success; Lawson, a journalist, writes a satirical play about politics. Think of Swift, one of the greatest satirists in English literature, who laboured for years as a parliamentary sketch writer. Aha, but Tale of A Tub or Gulliver's Travels were fantastical and wildly inventive. Lawson's play was simply a rehash of all the Tory party's scandals and mishaps of recent years, material well and truly done to death by every comedian and punning headline-writer. After a brief flash of passable invention - the PM hearing the voice of God  -the play reversed into a sputtering imitation of the bonfire of the vanities. Its structure was incoherent. Press secretary Mark Fisher (Nathaniel Parker) starts out as narrator of the God-plot, but then becomes just another character in the second story of how as a young foreign secretary he is brought down by newspaper revelations of his extra-marital affair. Jokes about relations between the Tories and the Press had a deadly knowingness. Next time Mr Lawson writes a play, the vehicle for his satire should preferably be something he knows nothing about. Might I suggest Tosa fighting?</p>

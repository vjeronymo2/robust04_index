			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- Japanese companies have  reached the point where they can no longer sustain employment  simply by replacing workers within their own business groups and  must consider sending them to other firms, including ones  overseas, a governmental panel said in a report Monday [2 May].    The report, on the issue of boosting employment,  particularly  for middle-aged white collar workers, was compiled by the  advisory panel to the Labor Ministry's Employment Security  Bureau chief.    It said middle-aged workers should accept being transferred  outside of their company group in order to remain in employment,  and that such transfers should be allowed to be permanent if  those workers agree.    Also, companies should consider sending "excess" workers  overseas to Southeast Asia or Eastern Europe where Japanese  business know-how is welcomed, the report said.    According to a recent survey by the Management and  Coordination Agency, the population of white collar workers aged  over 45 swelled to 12.18 million in 1993, 18.8 percent of the  entire workforce, from 6.07 million or 11.5 percent in 1973.    The increase is partly because there are now more older  people than younger ones in Japan.    Many Japanese companies making streamlining efforts to cope  with the current recession have "excess" workforce, particularly  among their middle-aged, white collar workers.</p>

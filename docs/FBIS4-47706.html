			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria May 1 SAPA -- The leader of the National  Party [NP], State President F. W. de Klerk, on Sunday [1 May]  evening said he was optimistic the NP would do better than had  been indicated by the polls so far. At an impromptu press  conference outside the NP federal offices in Pretoria, President  de Klerk told reporters it was clear at this stage there would  be two parties to qualify for deputy presidencies -- the NP and  the African National Congress.    But, said Mr de Klerk, there had been many complaints about  irregularities and according to the NP these had been  widespread. This was a matter of great concern and would be  taken up with the Independent Electoral Commission and the  various political parties, Mr de Klerk said. "I'm as anxious  and frustrated as the public to see things come to a  conclusion," he added.</p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> In a group of recent pieces called "Parables: Rings/Spheres," Los Angeles  sculptor Michael Davis offers imagery associated with astronomy. Most are wall  pieces in which small metal circular elements are poised on arcs and circles  fitted into a large ring shape. Pleasing arrangements of formal elements, they  are crafted from domesticated industrial materials (copper, steel, cement),  plus gold-leaf. Sometimes, Davis slides into a tidiness that seems too  decoratively ingratiating. But the larger problem is that his obvious love of  materials and craft tends to trivialize the symbolic qualities he claims for  these pieces. How, one wonders, could such a pretty face have anything to say?  </P> <P> The most ambitious work on view is a three-part installation, "Parables." One  part consists of a black globe suspended in a large vat of rusty liquid.  Chalked on the globe -- and revised daily -- are headlines from the morning  paper. Another portion is a big copper arc curving around a corner at chin  level and balancing variously sized metal and glass balls spaced at intervals,  like planets. The third element is a gold sphere placed at the center of a huge  steel ring hanging on the wall. A light source on the opposite wall makes the  sphere appear to cast a bright crescent of light on the cloudy darkness of the  wall.  </P> <P> This piece seems to embody references to pollution (the water) and other  earthly screw-ups that have consequences for the biosphere and beyond. Perhaps  some of the glass planet-spheres have rolled out of their proper alignment. But  we are straining to find particles of meaning here. A disproportionate amount  of content is coming from the newspaper headlines, and not enough from the  work's formal elements.  </P> <P> Several models and drawings showing Davis's conceptions for large public  projects -- among them, "Grand Promenade" for Grand Street adjacent to the  Museum of Contemporary Art and again demonstrate his finesse in coming up with  elegant conjunctions of silhouettes and materials. But the metaphorical  content, when it exists, generally sounds flat and unconvincing. (Karl  Bornstein Gallery, 1658 1/2 10th St., to July 1.) CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

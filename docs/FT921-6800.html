			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum price see-saws amid catalyst confusion PLATINUM'S PRICE plunged and then bounced back again yesterday as confusion reigned in the market about an announcement by Corning, the US group, that it had developed an automotive catalyst that could meet the tough 1997 emissions standards fixed by California. Corning said its catalyst used extruded powdered aluminium and ceramics. As more than 41 per cent of total platinum demand comes from automotive catalysts, there was some panic selling of the metal in London and on the New York Commodity Exchange. This caused platinum to drop by nearly Dollars 4 a troy ounce to Dollars 354 in London at one stage. However, after Corning clarified its announcement and pointed out that its technology would be added to catalysts using platinum, the price rebounded to close in London at Dollars 359.50, up Dollars 1.75 from Monday's close. Corning's catalyst 'is not a problem for the market,' said Mr Jeremy Coombes, analyst at Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group. 'This technology will enable platinum catalysts to meet the demanding Californian regulations.' Analysts in New York suggested platinum there also felt the impact of an announcement by the Conference Board, an independent economic research group, showing its US consumer confidence index at the lowest point for 17 years. 'The (US) economy is not expanding and that is what's hurting platinum, said Mr William O'Neill, senior futures strategist with Merrill Lynch.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Boeing takes tougher line in Airbus subsidy row MR Frank Shrontz, chairman of US aircraft manufacturer Boeing, yesterday launched his most comprehensive attack yet on alleged government subsidies to Europe's Airbus Industrie, and warned that American rival McDonnell Douglas must not become an 'Asian Airbus', subsidised by Taiwan. 'Airbus and the European Community should understand our position', he said in a speech in New York. 'Twenty-one years of subsidy is far too much. Enough is enough.' He repeated a threat of retaliatory action under US law as a 'last resort' if the issue could not be resolved through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). The broadside follows five years of slow movement in two cases brought by the US under the Gatt, seeking to prevent EC members from subsidising Airbus  -which has overtaken McDonnell Douglas to become the world's second largest civil aircraft manufacturer. The US claims the subsidies total about Dollars 8m (Pounds 4.4m) for every aircraft Airbus has sold. Mr Shrontz dismissed as a 'distraction' recent allegations by Airbus that Boeing and other US aerospace groups get indirect subsidies from the US in the form of military and other contracts. Mr Shrontz said this ignored the fact that British, French, German and Spanish companies had received more than twice as much business from their governments as had Boeing. He also expressed concern over the recently announced plan for Taiwan Aerospace, a government-backed business, to take a 40 per cent equity stake in McDonnell Douglas's civil aircraft business. He said the new entity might become 'another subsidised competitor, shielded from market reality'. If development funds for McDonnell Douglas were provided by Taiwan, he said, it would be creating ' an Asian Airbus where, once again, deep government pockets eliminate the need for disciplined business decisions'.</p>

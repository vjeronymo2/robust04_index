			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Restructuring contributes to first loss at AJ Archer AJ Archer, the listed agency on the Lloyd's of London insurance market, yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 816,000 in the year to September 30. The deficit, which the company said was the first in its history, compared with a restated profit of Pounds 1.16m in the previous 12 months. Mr Ralph Sharp, group managing director, said he was confident about the future and attributed the losses partly to the restructuring of the company during the year. Turnover was Pounds 8.17m (Pounds 7.94m) and losses per share emerged at 1.9p (earnings 1.8p). The final dividend is 0.5p, giving a total of 1p (4.4p). AJ Archer acquired Kellett (Holdings) in November 1992 and Castle Underwriting Holdings in July this year. The purchases have led to substantial restructuring. Mr Sharp said there had already been a number of redundancies and staff taking early retirement, and he expected further falls in the payroll. He also expressed confidence in the level of capacity for the 1994 underwriting year, which he projected would be up 40 per cent on this year to Pounds 550m. He said the agency had already received commitments of more than Pounds 100m from the new corporate capital vehicles and was still waiting for final confirmation from Names.</p>

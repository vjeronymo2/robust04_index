			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- The Food Agency announced  Tuesday [29 March] that Japan will import another 150,000 tons  of rice from the United States, Australia and China by the end  of August, to bring the total amount of emergency imports of the  grain to 2.65 million tons this year.    The emergency step is aimed at making a sufficient supply of  rice available to consumers in the preharvest period, agency  officials said. Japan suffered the worst rice harvest in  postwar days last year, necessitating the emergency imports.    The officials said blended rice will be sold at a ratio of  70  percent domestic rice to 30 percent imported rice from  September, with domestic rice taking a dominant share compared  with the 30-70 percent ratio expected in April through July.    From October, consumers are expected to buy domestic brands  almost entirely, they said.</p>

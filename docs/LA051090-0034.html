			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: SMOKING TROUT IN A BACK YARD COOKER  </P> <P> Ray Cooper is a "good ol' boy." I've known him for years. We've gone quail  hunting in Arkansas, steelhead fishing on the Rogue River in southern Oregon  and we've fished the Florida Keys.  </P> <P> You may know him too. He does a fishing program called "Crooked Creek" Saturday  mornings on ESPN. He does a little cooking on the show from time to time, and  he's a pretty good cook.  </P> <P> For a while, Cooper was head of the National Trout Farmers Assn. He knows a  good bit about farm-raised trout. Now he's into smoking them. He has an  operation called White River Foods Inc. on the White River in northern  Arkansas, where he smokes farm-raised trout over applewood. It's delicious.  </P> <P> I visited Cooper in Arkansas not long ago, and we tasted smoked trout in a  variety of ways. He even taught me how to smoke my own in my covered cooker in  the back yard.  </P> <P> SMOKED TROUT  </P> <P> 1 1/4 cups salt  </P> <P> 1 1/2 gallons water  </P> <P> 5 pounds trout fillets  </P> <P> 1 pound wood chips -- hickory, apple, oak, etc.  </P> <P> Dissolve salt in 1 gallon water. Place fish in salt water and marinate in  refrigerator 1 hour.  </P> <P> Remove trout, rinse and dry thoroughly. Soak wood chips in remaining 1/2 gallon  fresh water several hours or overnight. Refrigerate fish while soaking chips.  </P> <P> Bring covered grill (charcoal, gas or electric) to low heat. Cover heated coals  with 1/3 hickory chips.  </P> <P> Place fish, skin-side down, on well-greased grill about 4 to 6 inches from  coals. Close grill hood and open vent to circulate smoke. Add additional wood  chips as necessary.  </P> <P> Smoke trout at 105 to 175 degrees approximately 1 hour or at 200 degrees 30 to  40 minutes. Trout is done when cut surface is golden brown and flakes easily  with fork. Makes 6 servings.  </P> <P> SMOKE TROUT PATE  </P> <P> 1/2 pound smoked trout fillets  </P> <P> 1/2 pound cream cheese, softened  </P> <P> 1 clove garlic, crushed  </P> <P> Juice of 1 lemon  </P> <P> Pepper  </P> <P> 1/4 cup butter, softened  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons red wine  </P> <P> Lettuce leaves  </P> <P> Thin lemon slices  </P> <P> Crisp toast  </P> <P> Flake smoked trout finely with fork. Combine with cream cheese, garlic, lemon  juice, pepper to taste, butter and wine, blending well. Pack into individual  buttered molds and chill.  </P> <P> Turn out on lettuce leaves, garnish with thin lemon slices and serve with crisp  toast. Makes 6 servings.  </P> <P> CASSEROLE OF SMOKED TROUT  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups cooked spinach  </P> <P> Butter  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons chopped onion  </P> <P> 1 clove garlic, finely chopped  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons flour  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon oil  </P> <P> 1 1/4 cups fish stock or milk  </P> <P> 1 pound hot smoked trout  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons Sherry  </P> <P> 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese  </P> <P> Hard-cooked egg, sliced  </P> <P> Watercress or parsley  </P> <P> Chop spinach and place in bottom of greased baking dish. Season with 1  tablespoon melted butter, pepper and nutmeg.  </P> <P> Cook onion and garlic in 2 tablespoons butter until tender. Blend in flour and  oil. Add stock and cook until thick, stirring constantly.  </P> <P> Break up and mash smoked trout. Add along with Sherry to sauce and blend with  electric mixer or blender.  </P> <P> Pour sauce over spinach. Sprinkle with grated cheese and bake at 350 degrees 20  to 25 minutes. Garnish with egg slices and watercress. Makes 6 servings.  </P></p>

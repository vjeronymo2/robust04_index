			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Travel: How to cope with India's railways - Practical Traveller  Where, when, how much. David Pilling opens a series of travel advisories INDIAN Railways has enough track to wrap twice around the Earth and enough red tape to entangle a considerably larger planet. However, it remains an extraordinary way to explore the subcontinent - warts, beauty spots and all. There are several options for the rail enthusiast. The first is simply to turn up in Delhi or Bombay and book each leg of your journey as the fancy takes you. This provides maximum flexibility but will thrust you into the heart of railway bureaucracy. You will need a timetable (Trains at a Glance, available all over India) and the patience of Mother Teresa. Securing a reservation is always a problem. Try to go to the station at least a few days in advance; if nothing is available, ask if there is a tourist/VIP quota, or speak to the station superintendent. As a last resort, buy an unreserved ticket for any class, get on the train and ask the conductor about unclaimed reservations. The hierarchy of carriage-classes is matched only by that of India's stratified social structure. With few exceptions, what you want are first class air-con or ordinary first class tickets for mail or express trains. Anything else is likely to be very cheap, very slow and very uncomfortable. Sleeper carriages are more spartan than in Europe; bedding is available but you will need to ask for it. Better still, take a sheet sleeping bag. An alternative to tackling this railway obstacle course unaided is to seek the advice of Dr Swaminath Dandipani, who runs S D Enterprises (tel: 081-903-3411) from a small office in Wembley, west London. Dr Dandipani is the sole UK agent for Indrail passes which facilitate unlimited nationwide travel, including sleepers. A seven-day first class pass costs a humble Pounds 77; 15 days is Pounds 94; 90 days: Pounds 274. Dr Dandipani, who claims to have memorised the entire Indian rail timetable, will sort out an itinerary with you. All reservations are telexed through from London and neatly laid out on a computer printout. By all accounts the system is remarkably efficient. Dr Dandipani's service includes a list of 20 or 30 practical tips, including a reminder to take your own toilet paper and to drink 20 glasses of purified water a day. The third option is to book a complete tour. Butterfield's Railway Tours (0262-470-230) has operated for 17 years, using its own refurbished carriage which is attached to local trains. The carriage, which accommodates up to 26 people, comprises two sitting rooms, a dining room, kitchen, washrooms and lavatories. There is even a library. Roy Butterfield, who runs the Yorkshire office, describes it as a 'home from home', but insists his company provides a true picture of the subcontinent, shunning the more westernised version favoured by some operators. Butterfield's runs two itineraries: the Great Indian Railway Tour, which covers, in a breathless 21 days, the 3,000 miles between Delhi and Cochin via Agra (for the Taj Mahal), Lucknow, Hyderabad, Bangalore, and a host of other cities and costs Pounds 775, flights not included; and, more leisurely and luxurious, the South India Tour from Madras to Bombay, which works out at Pounds 1,750 all inclusive. More upmarket still are tours offered by Cox &amp; Kings (071-931-9106). The Palace on Wheels, a sort of rolling re-enactment of the Raj, is run by Indian Railways and takes in the justly-famous sights of Rajasthan. The one-week schedule, which allows little time for exploration, costs Pounds 595, flights not included. Cox &amp; Kings runs its own trip from Delhi to Calcutta on express trains, with stops including Agra, Gwalior, and Varanasi, the holy city on the Ganges. All-inclusive price: Pounds 1,455. Cox &amp; Kings and other operators, such as Abercrombie &amp; Kent (071-730-7795), will organise bespoke tours incorporating train journeys. You might consider routes such as Quilon to Madurai, which starts on the humid Kerelan coast before climbing into the cool Cardamom hills; the toy train up to Ooty hill station (where snooker was invented), or the narrow-gauge Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. The latter is especially unreliable, but then that is half the fun.</p>

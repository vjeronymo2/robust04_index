			<p>Combat   Drug Trafficking   <F P=102> PY2104032894 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1443 GMT 20 Apr 94 </F> <F P=103> PY2104032894 </F> <F P=104>  Madrid EFE </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] Vienna, 20 Apr (EFE) -- A high-ranking Bolivian  government official stated that Bolivia needs at least $25  million per year to be able to implement a sustainable  development program, "which is the only way to defeat drug  trafficking and extreme poverty."    This week Mario Soliz Valenzuela, national social defense  secretary of the Bolivian Government Ministry, said: "As the  world community knows, the Bolivian Government does not have  those resources; this is why we appeal to the international  community for cooperation if there is a true desire to do  something concrete."    He added: "The Bolivian Government alone cannot wage, under  such unfair circumstances" a war "against foreign drug  traffickers, their technology to produce and export, their  safety measures, and their flow of money and power, which is  what makes international cooperation a must."    In his address to the 37th session of the UN Commission on  Narcotic Drugs, headquartered in Vienna, that will end on 22  April, Soliz said the drug problem will still be "long and  bloody."    Bolivia is the world's second-largest producer of coca  leaves, after Peru, and the second-largest cocaine exporter,  after Colombia.    Soliz called upon "friendly governments, international  organizations, and financial enterprises such as the World Bank  and the IDB [Inter-American Development Bank] to help the  Bolivian Government use its potential to eradicate surplus coca  plantations by 1997."    The Bolivian Government plans to open a land register for  the  Chapare region, which will help obtain foreign financial aid "to  start alternative development programs in the coca production  region and, for the first time, give peasants there access to a  market economy, free of any suspicion."    The mere possibility of obtaining a legal deed as a result  of  the census "increases the property value nine-fold with the  advantage of being able to obtain direct financial aid,"  asserted the Bolivian Government representative.    Soliz added: "Many things are changing in Bolivia lately,  such as the broader approach to the longstanding problems we  have endured."    One of the goals established by President Gonzalo Sanchez de  Lozada's government is to give priority treatment to the problem  of illegal drug trafficking and consumption, "which we combat in  a resolute, frank, and decided manner."    Currently, the fight against drug trafficking in Bolivia is  centered on alternative development and police and legal  interdiction of drug organizations, as well as prevention,  stated Soliz.    The UN International Drug Control Board, in its 1993 report  disclosed in February, urges Bolivia to modify its law regarding  consumption of coca tea and the chewing of coca leaves "unless  it believes that the reasons for including this product on the  list of the 1961 Convention are no longer valid," and, if so, it  would have to propose that it be eliminated from the list.    In this regard, Soliz said that in Bolivia the Law of  Special  Regulations on Coca and Controlled Substances, Law No. 1008,  "allows the legal use of this product, such as in the coca tea  industry, the chewing of coca leaves, and its use for rituals,  and establishes that Yungas is the traditional coca production  zone," where the replacement of coca plantations must be  "voluntary and compensated, and bans coca plantations throughout  the rest of the country."    Soliz explained that Bolivia has reached an agreement with  the United States to eradicate 5,000 of the 8,000 hectares of  coca planted per year in exchange for financial aid for the  Bolivian balance of payments.    Soliz admitted, however, that although a plan for an  alternative development has been implemented, "it still has not  reached a degree that will allow a reduction of the production  of coca and cocaine that reaches the consumer countries."    Therefore, if productive activities that might absorb labor  and generate political and social stability are not promoted,  "one cannot dream of a voluntary reduction of surplus coca  plantations," that is, those prohibited by Law No. 1008.    Substitution "must entail products that will have a foreign  market; if not, alternative development is unfeasible," asserted  the Bolivia social defense secretary.</p>

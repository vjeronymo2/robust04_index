			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Sun Yong (1327 0516) and Zhu Dongju (2612 0392 </F> 5468)]    [Text] Beijing, 2 Mar (XINHUA) -- The fifth meeting of the  Eighth Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference  [CPPCC] National Committee Standing Committee held a plenary  session at the CPPCC auditorium this morning. The session  decided to elect Wang Chengxi and 29 others as additional  members of the CPPCC National Committee.    Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee,  attended the session, which was chaired by Vice Chairman Yang  Rudai.    According to a briefing, of the additional members, 16 are  CPC and 14 are non-CPC members. They include three women, three  ethnic minorities, three members of the democratic parties; and  one representative from non-publicly owned economic sectors.  After the addition, the CPPCC National Committee has a total of  2,097 members. Of them, 834 are CPC and 1,263 are non-CPC  members, accounting for 39.75 percent and 60.25 percent of the  total, respectively.    The additional members are small in number, but they reflect  the policy of "overall consideration and all-round arrangement"  and are closely related with the current practical needs.  Intellectuals account for a fairly large portion of the new  members. Among them are academicians, professors, experts, and  scholars, embodying the concept of respecting knowledge and  talented people. There is also a fairly large number of  celebrities from Hong Kong; they, a total of seven, are mostly  people who have invested in the mainland and contributed to the  country's opening up and economic construction. Paying attention  to the arrangement of minority nationalities is a tradition of  the CPPCC and a major component of the CPC's nationality policy.  The three newly elected ethnic members are personages yielding  some influence and having a high status in their respective  localities and nationalities. A representative from non-  publicly owned economic sectors, who is patriotic, respects his  profession, and abides by the law, has also been elected.    At the plenary session today, Wang Zhaoguo explained a  proposed namelist (draft) of additional vice chairmen and  Standing Committee members and election of a new secretary  general of the Second Session of the Eighth CPPCC National  Committee.    At the session, Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Central  Discipline Inspection Commission, delivered a report on progress  in the ongoing anticorruption drive. The report consists of  three parts: Basic Assessment of the Nationwide Anticorruption  Drive Since Last August; Experiences and Practices of the  Anticorruption Drive in the Previous Stage; and Anticorruption  Tasks in 1994.    Noting that the CPPCC National Committee has all along paid  close attention to and supported the anticorruption drive, Wei  Jianxing urged all CPPCC National Committee members to, as  always, care for and support the anticorruption drive by making  suggestions, airing views, taking part in work inspections, and  providing important clues to help investigate violations of law  and discipline. According to him, this year CPPCC National  Committee members will be invited to join supervisions and  inspections organized by the Central Investigation Groups so  that the anticorruption drive can be carried out in a  thoroughgoing, sustained, and more effective manner.    Vice Chairmen Ye Xuanping, Wu Xueqian, Wang Zhaoguo, Ngapoi  Ngawang Jigme, Hong Xuezhi, Zhao Puchu, Qian Weichang, Hu Sheng,  Qian Zhengying, Su Buqing, Ding Guangxun, Dong Yinchu, Sun  Fuling, and Ann Tse-kai attended the session.</p>

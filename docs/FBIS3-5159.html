			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] According to sources in Tokyo, in a message sent  from Beijing, His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk says that he  will return to Phnom Penh on 8 April, six days before Cambodia's  traditional new year, although he has to continue his medical  treatment. After his arrival in Phnom Penh the king will  organize a ceremony to mark the 90th anniversary of his late  mother, Queen Sisowath Kosomak, to be held in the royal palace  one day after his arrival.    In this message the king says that he plans to meet with  Cambodian Government leaders and the Throne Council. Apart from  this, the king will remain in Cambodia in order to receive  credentials from various ambassadors, who were recently  appointed, such as the envoy from Great Britain.    The king will also stay on to take part in the new year  celebrations, a tradition of the Cambodian nation. Apart from  this, the prince father will also receive an important guest.  This is the state visit by the prime minister of Malaysia, who  will shortly visit Cambodia. [passage omitted]    Before returning to Phnom Penh in early April, the king will  leave Beijing for Pyongyang, North Korea, for a three- or  four-day visit and then leave from there for Phnom Penh.    The king, however, says that Chinese doctors have asked him  to return to Beijing in June to continue his medical treatment.  The king notes that: "I am a lot better from the cancer in the  bone marrow in my back." I am far from being cured as concerns  the cancerous marrow bone in my back. [preceding sentence in  English]    King Norodom Sihanouk specifies that he can no longer  continue his writing or his other literary activities because "I  have become an old man who is sick, weak, and very fragile." It  is to be noted that King Norodom Sihanouk underlines the words  very fragile [preceding two words in English].    The essence of this message was excerpted and printed in the  CAMBODIA DAILY BULLETIN published in Phnom Penh in three  languages. This bulletin also reveals that a palace official in  Phnom Penh affirmed on 28 February that the king plans to return  to Phnom Penh on 8 April. This official, however, did not give  a schedule of King Norodom Sihanouk's visit to Pyongyang. He  only said that "it is a tradition for the king to travel to  Pyongyang close to 15 April, a date which coincides with the  birthday of Kim Il-song."</p>

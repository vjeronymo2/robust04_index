			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A BBC correspondent in the  capital, Kigali, says the rebels' demands are almost certain to  be rejected by the Army. There has been more fighting in the  capital today. The road between Kigali and the town of  (Kitarama), southwest of the capital, is choked by more than  5,000 refugees. A BBC correspondent who has driven through the  area said that at several checkpoints he saw the corpses of  refugees apparently killed by local militia on suspicion of  being Tutsis or sympathizers with the rebels. He said lorries  and convicts from Kigali prison are being used to remove the  bodies. At the border between Rwanda and Burundi, the United  Nations is now dealing with more than 3,000 Burundians who had  previously fled ethnic killing in their own country last year  and now want to go back to Burundi. A UN spokesman says Rwanda  has closed its border with Zaire, halting the flow of refugees.</p>

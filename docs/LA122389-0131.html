			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> CHILLING PROSPECTS: WALRUSES' OCEAN DIP  </P> <P> The sign for the fourth annual Walrus Run early Friday read "no sissies  please."  </P> <P> After a quick Walrus bark, 75 participants began the annual mile-and-a-half  dash at daybreak from the Newport Beach Athletic Club to Corona del Mar beach  for a dip in the chilly 62-degree surf. The teeth-chattering tradition "started  as a lark with seven or eight of us and just caught on," explained Rudy Svrcek,  one of the coordinators.  </P> <P> "It's a lot of fun and this is a great bunch of guys to help bring the  Christmas spirit," said first-year Walrus, Steve Bukich, 33. Second-year runner  Tom Vanover, 40, likened the dip to jumping into the snow after a soak in a hot  tub and a long day of skiing. "It's fun, everybody does it."  </P> <P> This year's run included a record 10 brave women. "My husband does it every  year and I got conned into it," said Terri Gomez, 30. After the quick dip in  the ocean, Gomez said the Pacific wasn't as cold as she thought it would be and  she plans to be back next year.  </P> <P> "The run was easy, the water was great," said Bill White, 35. "I'm going to do  this every day."  </P> <P> "Last year was a lot colder," added veteran Walrus Rick John, 32.  </P> <P> Rookie Chuck Hardy, 52, didn't seem to mind the cold water. "I think it's  fantastic. It's not as painful as I thought it would be."  </P> <P> "The real walruses are going to jog back," said Svrcek.  </P> <P> For those runners who returned to the club, hot beverages, croissants and warm  Jacuzzis were waiting, along with commemorative T-shirts.

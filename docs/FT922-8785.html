			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Business in the Community (8): An embarrassment of help - A check list of useful contacts REQUEST the considered opinion of five economists, it is said, and you will get at least five answers. Think of any one community issue in which business might want to become involved and, by the same token, you will get at least a dozen organisations soliciting for help. If the 1980s saw the dawn of corporate responsibility, the 1990s may well see something of its shake-out. The number of organisations and initiatives in every conceivable field has swelled demand beyond belief. At the same time, the supply of potential sponsors has been growing. 'In the past, company policy was largely determined by ad hoc charitable links,' says Mr Adrian Hodges, director of communications for Business in the Community. 'Now more and more companies are recognising the business case for involvement.' Companies are trying to improve the quality of their involvement in the community and manage it like any other part of their business, he argues. Equally, the nature of corporate decision-making has changed. Companies have been switching over the last two decades to far greater employee participation in how corporate resources should be invested in the community, away from the so-called 'chairman's wife syndrome'. All these pressures of increased selectivity, swelling demand and burgeoning supply have generated the need for assistance through the maze. The wide range of choices now presenting themselves to companies is bewildering and even intimidating. It may also be off-putting, as busy decision-makers seek a simple way to invest their energies without wading through enormous documents to decide on the most worthy cause. 'Companies often quote the difficulty in knowing where to go, and who the right organisations to work with are,' says Hodges. 'Duplication of effort is something which concerns them. We try to help identify their business needs, and signpost them in the right direction.' He says the organisation prides itself on 'the two telephone test'. Companies interested in any issue should be able to make no more than two phone calls - the first to BIC - in order to gather information or reach the organisation they want to support. While there may be dangers of turning to a single organisation for help, BIC does have one clear advantage: its 'signposting' advice comes free of charge. 'We're here to help encourage community involvement,' says Hodges. None the less, he points out that BIC does need subscriptions to survive, which it derives from subscribing companies, of which there are currently about 500. For these members, it will help develop community involvement programmes in much greater detail. For those companies which want a second opinion even on which organisation should receive their first phone call, other options are available. They may have to do some research, but there are a number of private consultancy organisations and other non-profit groups which can help. Two of the best sources for news about organisations, issues and general developments in corporate community involvement are the monthly publication Sponsorship News and the bi-monthly newsletter Community Affairs Briefing. There are also a wide range of organisations, some of which are listed below.

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Hawtal Whiting shares plunge Shares of Hawtal Whiting Holdings yesterday plunged from 62p to 37p, as the automotive design engineer warned that its 1992 results might be affected by higher bad debts. It had, however, returned to an underlying profit in the second half after a first-half loss of Pounds 1.38m. The failure of Leyland-DAF leaves the group unpaid for Pounds 1.1m of engineering work on the Excel range of vans. It is 'vigorously' pursuing its claim with Renault, who were in the joint-venture with Leyland-DAF. This year's performance would not be significantly affected by Leyland-DAF's failure as Excel accounted for about 5 per cent of the budgeted turnover.</p>

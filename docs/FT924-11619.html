			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Insurers sceptical on control proposals THE INSURANCE industry is playing down the importance of regulatory changes proposed yesterday by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in the wake of the Bingham report. Mr Lamont proposed that the auditors of insurance companies and building societies, as well as banks, should face a new statutory duty to report any suspected fraud directly to regulators. The change, though, is unlikely to have much practical impact. Auditors have enjoyed the right to report any suspected fraud to the regulator, even if that breaches client confidentiality, since implementation of the 1986 Financial Services Act. Moreover, guidance notes for members produced by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales convert the right into a professional duty. 'Any accountant who ignored this advice would be foolhardy and would be likely to face disciplinary proceedings,' said Mr Roger Hewel, chairman of the institute's insurance committee. Mr Keith Loney of the Association of British Insurers, the industry trade association, said the proposals would be welcomed. 'We would not raise any objections,' he said. Mr Loney added that in the past the proposals might have been opposed. But although insurers were still keen to protect client confidential-ity 'thinking had moved on'.</p>

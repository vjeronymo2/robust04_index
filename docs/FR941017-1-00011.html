			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Criteria not associated with site suitability or establishment of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion (SSE) have been placed into 10 CFR part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 50. This action is consistent with the location of other design requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 10 CFR part 50. Because the revised criteria presented in the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation will not be applied to existing plants, the licensing basis for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing nuclear power plants must remain part of the regulations. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria on seismic and geologic siting would be designated as a new &sect;100.23 to subpart B in 10 CFR part 100. Criteria on earthquake engineering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be designated as a new Appendix S, ``Earthquake Engineering Criteria for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nuclear Power Plants,'' to 10 CFR part 50.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Remove Detailed Guidance From the Regulation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current regulation contains both requirements and guidance on how to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfy the requirements. For example, Section IV, ``Required Investigations,'' of Appendix A, states that investigations are required for vibratory ground motion, surface faulting, and seismically induced floods and water waves. Appendix A then provides detailed guidance on what constitutes an acceptable investigation. A similar situation exists in Section V, ``Seismic and Geologic Design Bases,'' of Appendix A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Geoscience assessments require considerable latitude in judgment. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> latitude in judgment is needed because of limitations in data and the state-of-the-art of geologic and seismic analyses and because of the rapid evolution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taking place in the geosciences in terms of accumulating knowledge and in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifying concepts. This need appears to have been recognized when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing regulation was developed. The existing regulation states that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on limited geophysical and geological information and will be revised as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary when more complete information becomes available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, having geoscience assessments detailed and cast in a regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has created difficulty for applicants and the staff in terms of inhibiting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of needed latitude in judgment. Also, it has inhibited flexibility in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying basic principles to new situations and the use of evolving methods of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses (for instance, probabilistic) in the licensing process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulation would be streamlined, becoming a new section in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart B to 10 CFR part 100 rather than a new appendix to part 100. Also,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the level of detail presented in the proposed regulation would be reduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerably. This approach reflects the philosophy of the first proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revision that the regulation only contains the basic requirements and that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detailed guidance, which is contained in the current regulation, Appendix A to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 CFR part 100, be removed to guidance documents. Thus, the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation contains: (a) Required definitions, (b) A requirement to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the geological, seismological, and engineering characteristics of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site, and (c) A requirement to determine the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Motion (SSE) and its uncertainty, to determine the potential for surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deformation, and to determine the design bases for seismically induced floods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and water waves. The guidance documents describe how to carry out these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required determinations. The key elements of the balanced approach to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the SSE are presented in the following section. The elements are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the guidance that will be fully described in the guidance documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulation is a new section in part 100 rather than an appendix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to Part 100. The proposed regulation would identify and establish basic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. Detailed guidance, that is, the procedures acceptable to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC for meeting the requirements, would be contained in a draft regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guide to be issued for public comment as Draft Regulatory Guide, DG&hyph;1032,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Identification and Characterization of Seismic Sources and Determination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motions.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Uncertainties and Probabilistic Methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The existing approach for determining a Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Motion (SSE) for a nuclear reactor site, embodied in appendix A to 10 CFR part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 100, relies on a ``deterministic'' approach. Using this deterministic approach, an applicant develops a single set of earthquake sources, develops for each source a postulated earthquake to be used as the source of ground motion that can affect the site, locates the postulated earthquake according to prescribed rules, and then calculates ground motions at the site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although this approach has worked reasonably well for the past two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decades, in the sense that SSEs for plants sited with this approach are judged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be suitably conservative, the approach has not explicitly recognized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncertainties in geosciences parameters. Because so little is known about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earthquake phenomena (especially in the eastern United States), there have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> often been differences of opinion and differing interpretations among experts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as to the largest earthquakes to be considered and ground-motion models to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used, thus often making the licensing process relatively unstable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over the past decade, analysis methods for incorporating these different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpretations have been developed and used. These ``probabilistic'' methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been designed to allow explicit incorporation of different models for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zonation, earthquake size, ground motion, and other parameters. The advantage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of using these probabilistic methods is their ability to not only incorporate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different models and different data sets, but also to weight them using judgments as to the validity of the different models and data sets, and thereby providing an explicit expression for the uncertainty in the ground motion estimates and a means of assessing sensitivity to various input parameters. Another advantage of the probabilistic method is the target exceedance probability is set by examining the design bases of more recently licensed nuclear power plants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed revision to the regulation now explicitly recognizes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there are inherent uncertainties in establishing the seismic and geologic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design parameters and allows for the option of using a probabilistic seismic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazard methodology capable of propagating uncertainties as a means to address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these uncertainties. The rule further recognizes that the nature of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncertainty and the appropriate approach to account for it depend greatly on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the tectonic regime and parameters, such as, the knowledge of seismic sources,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the existence of historical and recorded data, and the understanding of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tectonics. Therefore, methods other than the probabilistic methods, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sensitivity analyses, may be adequate for some sites to account for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncertainties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff has achieved an appropriate balance between deterministic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and probabilistic seismic hazard evaluations to be used in the revision of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seismic and geologic siting criteria for nuclear power plants. The key  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elements of this balanced approach are: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Conduct site-specific and regional geoscience investigations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Arts: The Alchemist/Macbeth - Theatre The alchemy works. The Royal Shakespeare Company's production of the The Alchemist, which was made of pretty good metal in the first place, has been transformed into gold by the move to the big stage at the Barbican. Here it is now in its full glory, one of the best English comedies of all time. Sam Mendes's direction at the Swan in Stratford last August was pleasing, but cramped. It looked micro, whereas The Alchemist is a macro-play. Consider the range of characters for a start. The villains, Face, Subtle and Doll Common, succeed not only in duping Sir Epicure Mammon, a knight, but also Dapper, the sort of clerk who might nowadays be quite high up in the Bank of England, and Drugger, the tobacconist. Already we have been through quite a swathe of society. But it does not stop there. The villains expose the gullibility and double standards of the puritans of the Dutch church. Up to a point, they deceive Kastril, the angry boy who arrives in London full of sound and fury and with a rich widowed sister to be disposed of. Between times, Face, Subtle and Doll have quarrels of their own. It takes a deus ex machina in the shape of Lovewit, the master of the house, to come back and restore order in the most genial way. Lovewit gets the widow and the left-over booty as well. If you think that is not enough in the way of variety, look at the crowd scene towards the end where the neighbours tell stories of all the visits to the house, then doubt their own word when their accounts are denied by Face. Shakespeare in the Roman plays sometimes handled the populace with a similar teasing restraint. The neighbours in The Alchemist are lightly mocked: it is a tiny scene, but it is a gem in its own right. Not least there is Ben Jonson's verse. Two of the speeches by Sir Epicure Mammon are up with the best of Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. When he talks of having his beds 'blown up, not stuffed' and enjoying 'a perpetuity of life and lust', he is using the language of greater heroes. It is the same sort of ambition as expressed by Tamburlaine. Jonson shows that it can also be used in a London town house. One point may surprise. This is an exceptionally good-natured production. Perhaps it is a trend of the times: one noticed at the Royal National Theatre's production of The Recruiting Officer last month how pleasant all the characters had become and certainly The Alchemist could be more darkly done. Nobody really gets hurt. The villains could more accurately be described as rogues. The satire is gently administered, but is no less satire for that. What you see is the extent to which virtually everyone is gullible. Jonathan Hyde and David Bradley are respectively Face and Subtle, the alchemist. By now they are playing so well together that they could just as easily reverse roles. The entire production has become even more of a team performance than it was in the early Stratford days, but there is one part that must be singled out. That is Guy Henry as Ananias, a deacon of Amsterdam. Henry's long face, longer hair and total earnestness make you watch him whenever he appears. Again it is a small part, but another reminder of how much there is in the play. * * * The RSC and RNT are not alone, however, in producing stunning versions of the classics. The English Shakespeare Company has been chosen to open the International Theatre Festival in Chicago next month and last week showed its new Macbeth to the national press at the New Theatre, Cardiff. The production is directed by Michael Bogdanov and Macbeth is played by Michael Pennington, the ESC's other co-founder. I was reminded how accurate Shakespeare's titles are. Just as the two parts of King Henry IV are ultimately a play about Henry IV and not the surrounding characters, so this production is about Macbeth and not his wife. Pennington dominates throughout; there is never much suggestion of his being 'too full of the milk of human kindness'. Occasionally he flinches and Lady Macbeth (Jenny Quayle) urges him on, but from the start this is a man who knows what he is doing. At the end he wants to die. It means the diminishing of Lady Macbeth's role in the play, but as an interpretation one can hardly quarrel with it. The ESC has a habit of picking up contemporary events to make its productions seem more lively. This time it is the huge rocket launcher commands the stage at the beginning, and the battle with which the play opens has a touch of modern desert war about it. Later there is the sound of Malcolm arriving for the final push in a helicopter. Yet the rocket launcher is variously used. At times it is the steps that ascend to the throne. Memorably Banquo appears at the very top of it in the banquet scene. If you think that the ESC takes liberties in these matters, you have not seen what the Schiller Theatre in Berlin does with the same play. By contrast, Bogdanov and Pennington are quite conventional. Derek Smith's Duncan, for instance, is simply an ageing king, who would not think of commanding Lady Macbeth to his bed as happens in the Schiller version. The witches are not all that way-out either, though their cauldron is a huge vessel associated with waste disposal and into which they descend. No great point is made, but nothing distracts from Pennington's overwhelming Macbeth. The Alchemist is in repertory at the Barbican (071) 638 8891. Macbeth, sponsored by IBM, is touring.</p>

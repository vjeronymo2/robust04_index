			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Tietmeyer defends high interest rates THE GERMAN Bundesbank was acting in the best interests of Europe by keeping borrowing rates high, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the bank's deputy governor, said last night. He told the London School of Economics the stance was aimed at bringing down German inflation, and that this would ultimately help price stability in the rest of Europe. He also hinted strongly that the future European Central Bank (ECB) should be located in Frankfurt, and repeated recent Bundesbank warnings about the progress to European economic and monetary union around the end of the century. A union - featuring a single European currency supervised by the ECB - would make 'no sense' unless the economic performance of individual countries grew closer. Mr Tietmeyer acknowledged that the Bundesbank's action in December in increasing German rates by  1/2 percentage point had caused concern in other countries in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM). The highest German rates since the 1930s have inhibited these nations from cutting their borrowing rates. However, he said the action, by damping German inflation triggered by unification, was essential to secure sound-money principles for the whole of Europe. In moving towards Emu, Mr Tietmeyer said in a passage likely to appeal to the UK government, that Europe should rely on market forces to bring about the desired economic convergence in areas such as interest rates and inflation. In what appeared to be a reference to France, he expressed disapproval of the approach favoured by some in Europe of overt government intervention in areas such as industry. 'Vigilance. . . . is essential if the emergence of dirigiste policies is to be countered,' he said. He also urged the UK government to accelerate any moves to give the Bank of England independence from the Treasury over setting British interest rates. Such a move would be necessary if Britain were to decide to join Emu and 'it would be desirable for such a step to be taken at as early a stage as possible'.</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Derelict pit site to generate 800 jobs More than 800 jobs are to be created on the site of the last deep coal mine in the Lancashire coalfield, which employed 760 miners before closing last year. Morrisons, the Bradford-based supermarket group, yesterday announced plans for a warehouse and national distribution centre on about half of the 140 acres once occupied by Parkside colliery, near Newton-le-Willows, St Helens. The site, close to the intersection of the M62 and M6, is near the 'time centre' of Britain - the point at which the business centres of Scotland and London are equidistant for HGV travel. The location puts all of Morrisons' 55 supermarkets within a few hours' driving. The West Coast main railway line also runs alongside it. Although in the Lancashire coalfield, the site is also within the Merseyside county boundary, meaning that some of the costs of dereliction clearance, laying services and motorway linkage will probably qualify for Merseyside's special European Union funding. Morrisons originally wanted to build the distribution centre about 17 miles to the south, near Northwich, but was refused planning consent on environmental grounds. The company yesterday announced a development deal with British Coal Property and applied for planning consent. This is unlikely to be refused, as indicated by the enthusiastic presence of St Helens Borough Council leaders and Mr John Evans, Labour MP for the area, at the announcement. Work is scheduled to start in spring, with the first phase bringing 350 jobs. Completion in 1996 will bring about 450 more jobs. The closure of Parkside's modern pit last year provoked angry confrontation with the NUM mining union. In one protest Mrs Anne Scargill, wife of Mr Arthur Scargill, the union's president, led three other women in an underground sit-in. They entered the mine by tagging on to a party of schoolteachers on an organised visit. Any lingering hopes of saving the mine through a sale to a private operator were dashed in October. After no acceptable offers, the twin 200 ft winding towers were demolished. Some coalfield campaigners deplored yesterday's development, saying the planned jobs might not be 'proper' ones. However most are expected to require physical skills. Ms Carole Hudson, chief executive of St Helens council, said many other jobs would be created in transport, freight, local supplies and maintenance.</p>

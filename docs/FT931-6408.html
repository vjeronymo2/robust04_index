			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Leyland Daf truck plant nears supply deal THERE was new hope yesterday for the 1,346 workers at the threatened Leyland Daf truck plant in Lancashire after an agreement was reached in principle for Leyland to supply trucks to Daf Trucks NV, the Dutch company created on Friday. The agreement, which the administrative receivers of Leyland Daf said yesterday 'still needs a lot of 'i's dotting and 't's crossed', was reached after a week of talks in Eindhoven in the Netherlands. They took place between Mr John Gilchrist, the Leyland truck plant's managing director, and the management of the Dutch company created by receivers in the Netherlands with aid from the Dutch and Belgian governments. As a result, and provided that a detailed agreement is reached, the Leyland plant could soon step up production substantially. It is now making about 50 trucks a week to fulfil its outstanding orders. Mr Gilchrist, who is leading a planned management buy-out of the Lancashire truck operations, was negotiating the agreement on behalf of the receivers, Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop of the accountancy firm Arthur Andersen. One reason for the protracted length of the talks is understood to have been the need to establish how readily the supply agreement could be transferred to any new owner of the Leyland facilities. The receivers refused to speculate on when a final agreement would be reached. Factors still to be settled include the volume of trucks and the precise financial terms under which the vehicles would be supplied. However, all sides indicated yesterday that they were treating the issue as a matter of urgency and seeking a conclusion within days rather than weeks. The boost to the truck factory's prospects came as a separate management team at the Leyland Daf van plant in Birmingham, led by managing director Mr Allan Amey, met the receivers to present its own formal proposals for a management buy-out. The Birmingham plant, which still employs 1,200 people, has resumed building vans at a rate of 250 a week. Both buy-outs are being advised by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm.</p>

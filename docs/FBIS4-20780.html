			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "CPI Meet To Check Further Defections"] </F>   [Text] Lucknow, March 7. The Communist Party of India  [CPI], shocked by the defection of two of its four legislators  in Uttar Pradesh on Friday last, has initiated a new political  exercise to protect the party from any further damage. Last  week's developments were indicative of the uneasiness prevailing  in Communist circles for quite some time over their political  alliance in U.P. [Uttar Pradesh]. While the national party  leadership sided with the Janata Dal in the last elections the  state CPI leaders felt a better choice would have been the  Samajwadi Party of Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav, who had shown  "greater stamina to fight the fascist forces represented by the  BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party)." The party State executive which  is meeting here on Wednesday to take a fresh look at the latest  developments is likely to discuss the issue in detail.    Some senior CPI leaders have even questioned the bonafides  of  the Janata Dal leader, Mr. V.P. Singh, as a person wedded to the  ideal of secularism. It was Mr. Singh himself who had allowed  the BJP president, Mr. Lal Krishna Advania, to take out his  `Rathyatra'in 1989 that ultimately resulted in spreading  communalism to a number of States. As against this Mr. Mulayam  Singh Yadav had stood firm and ordered firing on `kar sewaks'  when they tried to storm the disputed structure at Ayodhya on  October 31 and November 2, 1989.    The State unit of the party is expected to drive home its  point more effectively on this political question and also to  convince the national leadership of the efficacy of their line.    However, the recent organisational demoralisation in the CPI  does not seem to be influenced by ideological factors. The  emergence of the Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party combine in  the last elections, mainly because of voting patterns influenced  by caste lines, unnerved even hardened workers as caste loyalty  proved stronger than ideological considerations. Extending  support to the Samajwadi Party may thus become crucial for the  CPI, otherwise its influence might be further eroded in pockets  where it had succeeded in making some base during the past  several decades.    The veteran Communist leader, Dr. Z.A. Ahmed, has meanwhile  denied that he had resigned from the CPI and joined the  Samajwadi Party. His name was among the five U.P. CPI leaders  mentioned in a press release distributed by Mr. Mitrasen Yadav,  MLA [member of Legistaive Assembly], which informed that they  had deserted the communist organisation. Dr. Ahmed has, however,  added that Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav, was the best person to lead  the fight against fascist forces in U.P. He pleaded for a  broader base of secular forces to continue this fight against  fascism.    The CPI MLA, Mr. Udal, said the decisions taken by Mr.  Mitrasen Yadav and Mr. Ramchandra Bux Singh to resign from the  CPI and join the Samajwadi Party were their individual decisions  and these would not affect the affairs in the organisations.  Desertions by the two legislators were their individual attempts  for adjustments with power and had no ideological basis, he  added.</p>

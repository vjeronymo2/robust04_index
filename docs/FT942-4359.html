			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Home Office accused of detention centre cover-up The Home Office was accused yesterday of covering up injuries sustained by detainees during the riot at Campsfield House detention centre near Oxford last Sunday night. The Oxford-based Campaign to Close Campsfield said it had eyewitness and film evidence to show that 'at least eight people' - all in Britain seeking political asylum - were removed in four ambulances while an 'unknown number' were removed in three more. The Home Office has said only four people were injured. The campaign also cited eyewitness accounts stating that 'a detainee jumped head-first off the roof in protest, and that he had clearly sustained serious injuries to his head'. Mr Bill MacKeith, president of Oxford Trade Union Council, said the riot had been provoked by 'the removal, without warning or justification' of an Algerian citizen for summary deportation the next day from Gatwick. After the riot, however, the government said the trouble had been stirred up by demonstrators outside the fence. On Monday Mr Charles Wardle, the junior Home Office minister, said the student who had been deported had gone to Algeria voluntarily on September 2 but had then returned two months later using a forged passport.</p>

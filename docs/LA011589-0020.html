			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: MISSING IN ACTION  </P> <P> A hot screen debut in "Bad Boys." Oscar-talk for "La Bamba." So whatever  happened to Esai Morales?  </P> <P> Well, we would have seen him in Robert Towne's "Tequila Sunrise" -- but his  scenes were axed.  </P> <P> "That's moviemaking," said a philosophical Morales. He told us it was a small  role, a couple days' work playing the drug-dealing son of drug dealer Raul  Julia (Gibson portrays a cocaine dealer trying to go straight). "I did it to  work with Mel and Robert Towne -- two people I really admire."  </P> <P> He laughed as he added, "I also did it with a Raul Julia-type accent. That was  the real kick!"  </P> <P> Morales' scenes with Gibson underscored the latter's desire to leave the world  of drug dealing -- interesting, considering that some critics complained that  the motivation for Gibson's newfound honesty wasn't terribly clear.  </P> <P> The decision to cut Morales came during filming. It was based on feelings that  the scenes just didn't work: "It was extremely difficult for Robert Towne to  tell me they weren't going to use me. I guess that, classically, so many actors  are afraid of losing work."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Morales is in the yet-unreleased "Bloodhounds of Broadway," also  starring Madonna and Matt Dillon. And he's been active as a spokesman, doing  spots for El Rescate, which provides legal/social services to Central American  refugees in the L.A. area. Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

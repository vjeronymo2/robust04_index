			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Accusations fly after Philippines poll THE PAINFUL slowness of vote-counting following this week's Philippine elections prompted a flurry of accusations of cheating yesterday from politicians who appeared to be losing. Police defused three bombs aimed at disrupting electricity supplies around the capital Manila and which may have been intended to disrupt the counting of ballots from the elections on Monday. Earlier, bombs had caused slight damage to electricity installations on Monday night. Right-wing military rebels of the Reformed the Armed Forces Movement (RAM) issued a statement to the media accusing the incumbent administration of President Corazon Aquino of organising the bombs to manipulate election results in favour of her preferred candidate, Mr Fidel Ramos, former defence chief. 'Let this serve as a warning that our forces beginning at 6pm today will be in a state of readiness to move against the Aquino government should it persist to manipulate election results by any means,' said the RAM statement, which was dated May 13. Mr Ramos stood by Mrs Aquino through six coup attempts. Three were led by RAM, including one in December 1989 which frightened potential foreign investors and nearly toppled the government. Unofficial counts last night of a fraction of the 27m votes cast gave the lead in the presidential race to Mrs Miriam Defensor Santiago, a sharp-tongued lawyer who has campaigned against corruption. Close behind were Mr Ramos and Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, Mrs Aquino's estranged cousin and a wealthy associate of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Mrs Imelda Marcos, widow of Ferdinand and herself a candidate, asked for a halt to unofficial vote-counting after it became clear she was trailing in the presidential race and said it was possible the media were being 'used' by 'dubious elements'. Some officials have expressed fears that a wave of protests from losing candidates could create a crisis akin to that in 1986, when Mrs Aquino ousted Mr Marcos in an uprising sparked by protests against massive election fraud. Mrs Santiago said yesterday that she was jubilant at her early lead. If she won, she said, it would deal a blow to the Philippines' oligarchic political system based on influential families.</p>

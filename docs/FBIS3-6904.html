He said each country had to set its own priorities when  confronted with a multitude of challenges and opportunities.    Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said that as the  economy  was becoming increasingly globalised and confronted with the  reality of multiculturalism, its growth was inextricably linked  to factors beyond economics.    Anwar told this to Finance Ministers of the Asia Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) which met here yesterday. He was  speaking on Malaysia's economic growth strategies.    Anwar, however, told the meeting: "Trade must not infringe  on the rights of peoples and nations towards their own values  and cultures. If we want the pursuit of growth to be a vehicle  to spread out prosperity, rather than becoming an agent for  domination, it has to be conducted with the full cognizance of  the diversity of our world.    "The quest for stability is not an excuse for suppression  and  injustices."    Anwar said the implementation and the continuity of  pro-growth policies and market-friendly institutional reforms  were only possible within a stable political environment.    He pointed out that diligence, discipline, and a hardworking  labour force -- qualities which had contributed to East Asia's  prosperity and improved living standards -- had earned the  contempt of some in the West, especially among labour unions.    "Some have gone as far as to conjure the absurd nightmare of  Western civilisation being threatened by low wage economies. I  must say that no Government with a modicum of sense and  responsibility would like to see its own people languishing in  sweatshops," Anwar said.    He added that for a country with full employment like  Malaysia, no measures to suppress wages would be successful.  The challenge was to remain competitive and to ensure that wage  increases did not outstrip gains in productivity.    "For us in Asia, growth through productivity and  competitiveness is the only path to achieve prosperity. It has  liberated millions from the scourge of poverty and destitution.  It will liberate millions more in future," he added.    In Malaysia's case, the high growth had resulted in the  incidence of poverty declining from nearly 50 percent in 1970 to  14 percent today and per capita incomes increased significantly  from a mere U.S.$250 in 1957 to more than U.S.$3,000 by 1993.    He told the other 17 Finance Ministers that economic growth  had enabled the people in East Asia to enjoy freedom and decent  living conditions -- an indigenously-generated vision of  opportunity and betterment that compared favourably with the  promised idylls of the divergent package deals offered by  various political persuasions.    Malaysia's view, Anwar said, was that growth could not and  must not be separated from the overall societal objectives.  "However widely crafted and market-friendly these policies may  be, consideration of the issues of distributive justice and  fairness will, eventually, play their part in contributing to  growth."    Malaysia's success in economic development, with six  consecutive years of growth exceeding eight percent, underscored  the importance of political stability, sound macro-economic  management and an open, market-based economy that was largely  private sector driven.    Anwar explained that the Government's multi-year structural  adjustment programme in the 1980s down-sized the role of the  public sector and promoted private initiative as the main engine  of growth.    On Malaysia's economic performance in 1994, he said  indications were that the economy would strengthen further with  growth exceeding eight percent "making this the most buoyant and  longest economic expansion in Malaysia's history."    Both the Government's financial and balance of payments  position were looking very healthy. Inflation was low and price  stability was expected to continue, he said.    Prospects for the medium term were equally good and the  growth target of eight percent for the Sixth Malaysia Plan  (1991-1995) would most probably be surpassed. Nevertheless,  there was a need to continuously focus on relieving  infrastructural bottlenecks and shortage of skilled labour to  enhance competitiveness.    Even though East Asia had been insulated from the recession  in the industrialised countries, it was not oblivious to the  fact that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD) countries were and would remain a major  contributor to the global economy.    Developing countries would benefit from a "rejuvenation of  growth in older industralised economies.    "If we can free ourselves of protectionism and reverse the  movement towards the formation of new trading blocs, we can  develop a new partnership, one which can operate to disperse  growth and prosperity around the globe.    "There is no miracle agent or quick-fix for growth, it is  the  outcome of hard work and diligence, continuous investment in  human and physical capital and policies that promote  entrepreneurship."    Anwar said this had been Malaysia's experience and that  there  was a need to be "wary of the residual mentality of the Cold War  era and outlook that seeks to exaggerate security issues and  provoke tensions, thus once again diverting our energies from  development."    He told the Ministers that ASEAN's experience had taught  that  regional stability and productive relations must be earned  through good neighbourliness and mutual trust.</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Arts: Perception is the name of the game - Television About two years ago at the Edinburgh Festival, Channel 4 was under its annual, critical attack for abandoning its remit to provide innovative and minority interest programmes. After a lively session in which I was called on to defend our programming policy, I overheard two producers discussing the issue. 'The trouble is,' said one, 'you can't argue with Grade because all he does is quote programmes at you.' As with politics and business, the arts and sport, perception is everything and television is no exception. An idea, usually negative, gains currency and there is no way to shift that perception. All you can do is ride the waves of criticism and hope the 'perceptionists' move on to find a new target. Not even Sir Tim Bell and the expensive spin doctors can turn the tide of generalisation and prejudice once it starts to roll. Evidence is irrelevant. Facts are selected to suit the general perception and whenever television is discussed, convenient examples are easy to come by. Each of the four terrestrial channels transmits an incredible range of good, bad and indifferent programmes each week. By a process of careful selection, anyone can make a case for or against any of the TV channels. Let me demonstrate: it could be argued that BBC 2 is no longer the cultural force that it was. It is failing to maintain its own standards of originality and innovation. It is a channel of endless snooker, tired American reruns (MASH and Star Trek); safe old formats (Top Gear, Dr. Who and Gardeners' World); and a string of talent and ideas pinched from Channel 4 (Harry Enfield, Clive James, Ben Elton, Ruby Wax, Vic Reeves, archive nights and Valentine's Day seasons, etc etc). This judgment of BBC 2 is, of course, a travesty - just a highly distorted perception. A few weeks ago Christopher Dunkley used this column to write an open letter to Michael Jackson, the new Controller of BBC 2. Dunkley made it clear that he regards BBC 2 as the best and the most precious of all our channels. It was an encomium about the channel and a thinly veiled warning to Jackson not to muck it up. Fair enough. There is nothing so scarce in the media these days as praise (ask Martyn Lewis). Dunkley cares about BBC 2 and is not afraid to use his regular Wednesday column to say so. He is a critic whose opinion counts for something after all these years of box watching for the Financial Times. I, too, value BBC 2, both as a licence payer and a competitor. But, but, but . . . his perception of BBC 2's rival, Channel 4, was, well, simply perception and every bit as false as my cheap characterisation of BBC 2 earlier. Dunkley wrote: 'Now, as one of the last gasps of full-blown Thatcherism, Channel 4 has been driven into the market place and obliged to compete for its own slice of advertising cake. As you might expect with Michael Grade in charge, it is proving a pretty effective competitor and is regularly achieving an audience share of around 12 per cent instead of the 9 to 10 per cent that it used to get. Whatever the people at Channel 4 may bravely proclaim about sticking to the famous 'remit' to 'be different' and 'cater' for 'minorities', I think we must expect that Channel 4, at least in peak viewing time, will continue to look more and more like any other conventional commercial channel, with game shows (The Crystal Maze); soap opera (Brookside); and the largest proportion of American imports in British terrestrial television (The Wonder Years, Mork and Mindy, The Golden Girls, and soon The Golden Palace).' Well, I have read some tosh in my time but this really is the 'tosh-est'. Mr Dunkley has a nasty case of 'perception-itis'. Facts first: Crystal Maze is in its fourth year and Brookside is in its eleventh, hardly evidence of a sudden shift of policy in response to our new competitive status. Of the American imports he cites, neither Mork and Mindy nor Wonder Years plays in peak time, which he says is where the danger lies. He makes no mention of Cheers and Roseanne, two of the freshest comedy shows available anywhere, more witty and consistently funny than anything to be found on British television. Why should we apologise for spotting them and bringing them to Britain? The best American comedies have graced the channel from the beginning. And so to ratings - he cites Channel 4's current surge in popularity as evidence of a decline in standards. But what is BBC 2's audience share? In the last full calendar year (the only meaningful measure) Channel 4 and BBC 2 were neck and neck at just over 10 per cent. So Channel 4 has, after 10 years, caught up with BBC 2 (and we have abandoned snooker). In Mr Dunkley's world, why is it OK for BBC 2 to have ten per cent, but not Channel 4? Dunkley's 'law' suggests that we should not have taken on the recent season of peak time documentaries, drama and features about the homeless because it contributed to a record week of ratings for the Channel. I might understand his concern if Channel 4's share had leapt past BBC 2 to, say, 20 per cent. Another flaw in his perception, or rather lack of it, is his belief that in peak time Channel 4 will have to become like the other main commercial channels. But, Mr Dunkley, if our ratings are growing (which they have been for two years) why on earth would we want to change? It would be commercial suicide for Channel 4 to try to copy the other big channels. We would get crushed. Our commercial success depends on offering both the audience and advertisers something different. This is the policy of the Board of Channel 4 and on the evidence of the first few months of competitive selling, it is working a treat. And so, without apology, to programmes. Here are some facts about the all important peak time: we run 50 minutes of the nightly Channel 4 News, and factual programmes dominate between 8.00 and 10.00pm; we run arts programmes (Without Walls and Rear Window); we run current affairs (Dispatches, Black Bag, A Week in Politics, The World This Week, etc); we run documentaries (Cutting Edge, Short Stories, True Stories, Critical Eye, Secret History, etc, etc); we run our own entertainment (Drop The Dead Donkey, Whose Line Is It Anyway, Clive Anderson Talks Back, Paul Merton, etc, etc); we run education (Pulse, Eat Your Greens and Grow Your Greens, Our Back Yard, etc); we run drama (GBH, Big Battalions, Camomile Lawn, Lipstick On Your Collar - plus short films by new writers and Film On Four, without which there would he even less of a British film industry). Not to mention special seasons, like the recent Gimme Shelter on the homeless - which, of course, Mr Dunkley did not. Religion, British animation, opinions, foreign films, operas old and new - I could go on and on. I do go on and on, but then programmes are the only worthwhile evidence. In the calendar year 1992, Channel 4's top 20 programmes included only three American comedies (at numbers 13, 16 and 17). The top five programmes were three home produced documentaries, a drama series and an ITV repeat. So, there goes the 'Channel 4 is all quiz games and imports' theory. Oscars and Emmies from the US, BAFTA awards and pots galore from all over the world count for nothing. Mr Dunkley chose to ignore all the above evidence. It just did not meet his perception and to him perceiving is believing. He is, nevertheless, a splendid commentator on the affairs of British television. But that is just my perception. Christopher Dunkley is on holiday. Michael Grade is chief executive of Channel 4</p>

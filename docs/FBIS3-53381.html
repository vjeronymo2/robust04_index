The president addressed the audience and welcomed the  representatives of the Hajjah gathering and expressed  appreciation for their national sentiments and response to the  events taking place in the homeland, and the current crisis. He  also expressed appreciation for their concern about the great  achievement, unity. He said: Your arrival in Ta'izz today  confirms your faithfulness to unity and democracy. This is not  strange for the struggler sons of Hajjah, who had the honor to  defend the revolution and the republic, and who were among the  vanguards who struggled for the sake of unity. Today, they are  leading this march to meet with their brothers in the rest of  the governorates in order to tell the truth and charge the  leadership with the responsibility of safeguarding unity.    The brother president added: We bless all that you have  reached in terms of resolutions and recommendations. We promise  you that we will be as you think well of us. We will not go  back on your demands which are in harmony with all the demands  of the Republic's governorates; Hadramawt, Ta'izz, Ibb,  al-Mahwit, and al-Hudaydah. Such gatherings are also being held  in all the Republic's governorates.    The brother president said: For the sake of the higher  national interests, I call for holding a conference to safeguard  unity and democracy, to include the leaderships of all these  gatherings in the Republic's governorates, whether those that  have already been held or those which will be held. The  president highly appreciated the ulema gathering which was  concluded at the Mu'adh Bin-Jabal Mosque in the al-Janad area in  Ta'izz today. He said: We hoped for our colleagues' response  in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], headed by 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, to the call made by the ulema in Yemen to meet and to  give predominance to Yemen's interests over any other parochial  party and personal interests. He said: We are fully aware of  the people's suffering. We will not be like the ostrich which  buries its head in the sand. We will spare no effort to make  all the concessions that are dictated by the homeland's greater  interests in order to safeguard unity. I hope that the  conference I am calling to be held for the leaderships of the  expanded gatherings in the Republic's governorates will mark the  beginning of a peaceful national march from Ta'izz to the  economic and commercial capital, Aden, and to be called the  march of peace, security, stability, and Yemeni unity. Unity is  for all the masses of the people. It is for all the honest  people of farmers, peasants, intellectuals, politicians, and  every citizen. It is not for one person or a group of persons  in the Presidential Council.    The brother president addressed the conferees, saying: You  will find all of us within the political leadership speaking  frankly and clearly on all national issues, be they issues that  emerged before the inception of unity, during the transitional  period, or during the regrettable crisis experienced by the  homeland for the past five months--the worst crisis experienced  by the homeland since the start of the fragmentation period.  For, it never dawned upon us that national unity could  experience such a fragmentation, or that such erroneous  propaganda campaigns could be directed at the masses.    The conferees have issued a statement, affirming that the  Yemeni individual is the most precious asset. Hence, the  legitimacy of any regime is contingent upon its ability to  provide the population with a decent living and with the  components of such a living; upon its ability to care for them;  upon its ability to provide them with security, justice, and a  prosperous life; and also upon its ability to treat them as  equals without any discrimination. Within this context, the  conferees urge all competent state organs to perform their basic  duties, particularly the following:    --Hastening the efforts to rid the homeland of the stifling  political and economic crisis plaguing it, which has left  adverse repercussions affecting citizens' lives.    --Hastening the referral of all defendants charged with  assassinations, explosions, and all other criminal acts of  violence, sabotage, plunder, riots, thefts, and kidnappings,  regardless of the motives, to public trials, and exposing  culprits, as well as their masterminds.    --Achieving the independence of the judiciary, and cleansing  judicial authorities and the Public Prosecution of the negative  aspects which could undermine their competence, such as bribery,  favoritism, negligence, and procrastination. These organs must  be reorganized and rehabilitated.    --Taking firm measures to remove all objectionable  manifestations and corruption at government organs, as well as  public and mixed sector organizations.    The statement urged the House of Representatives to carry  out  its monitoring prerogatives on the executive authority, be they  the Presidential Council or the Council of Ministers.    The conferees commended the role of the Yemeni Armed Forces,  and urged them to always remain the homeland's protective shield  and a symbol of national unity. It recommended that they be  rebuilt and rehabilitated, and that they be redirected so they  may occupy their proper positions outside cities and major  residential neighborhoods, and so they may play their role in  defending the homeland, its independence, and its territorial  integrity. The conferees condemned the use of firearms,  violence, intimidation, and acts of sabotage to resolve  disputes; settle intellectual, political, social, or personal  differences; or achieve a unilateral control of authority. The  conferees warned all individuals, parties, and factions,  regardless of whether or not they are members of the coalition  government, against the consequences of any attempt to secure  such a unilateral control of authority. The conferees also  warned them against any efforts to tamper with the people's  gains and resources.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / The Property Market: Comeback kid against the wall - Developer William Stern was once the UK's biggest bankrupt. He has bounced back but today his companies are again under pressure Mr William Stern, the property dealer who shot to fame in the 1970s as Britain's biggest bankrupt, is on the ropes again. Having clawed his way back from his record Pounds 118m bankruptcy in 1978, the Hungarian emigre has, once more, been trying to fend off his company's creditors. Two subsidiaries of Dollar Land Holdings (DLH), the property company managed by Mr Stern, have gone into liquidation, the most recent in February. And Customs &amp; Excise, which earlier threatened nine DLH subsidiaries with winding up orders, has given DLH until the end of June to pay its value added tax arrears. Despite this Mr Stern is sanguine about his business prospects. The most remarkable aspect of his company, he says, is its resilience. He believes it made a profit in 1992 and maintained its net asset value of Pounds 24.4m recorded at end-1991. The UK interest rate cuts since last autumn have eased DLH's cash-flow problems of the past two years. Rents now cover interest costs, leaving trading profits to pay the Pounds 5m backlog of debts, he says. Mr Stern blames the fate of Dollar Land Management (DLM), a subsidiary which went into liquidation last month, on 'unthinking action by Customs &amp; Excise'. Although the parent company subsequently reached agreement with Customs &amp; Excise about the payment of DLM's debts to the tax authorities, for legal reasons the parent was prevented from continuing to support its subsidiary after the publication of the winding-up petition. Today, it seems that Mr Stern is less concerned about the failure of Dollar Land Management (DLM) than about some inaccurate press reports claiming that DLM's liquidator was investigating wrongful trading and the misappropriation of funds owed to the tax authorities. The liquidator, Mr Jonathan Schapira of Leonard Curtis, has indeed been asked by creditors to examine the possibility of wrongful trading, but he views this as a standard procedure in cases like these. 'I have been terribly careful to keep on the right side of the law,' says Mr Stern. 'I have had an up and down business career but one thing I pride myself on is that never has a question had to be asked by an official body.' That was not for want of scrutiny. In 1977, a government inquiry into the Pounds 200m property losses of the Crown Agents, to which he owed Pounds 40m, took an interest in Mr Stern's deals. And when, in 1983, he applied to have his bankruptcy discharged, his lavish lifestyle, business conduct and commercial morality all underwent close examination by the courts, the press and creditors. In particular, his creditors were incensed that Mr Stern sold his house and its contents to his father Edmund in 1974, putting it beyond the reach of his creditors when he was declared bankrupt. After his bankruptcy, Mr Stern moved to the US to work as a consultant, leaving behind what he believes is the widespread British social stigma that attaches to bankrupts. However, when his bankruptcy was annulled in 1985, family ties drew him back to the UK. Then, as now, Mr Stern appeared undaunted by his business failure. He claims he was a victim of circumstances when his property empire collapsed in 1974, a crash he views as far deeper than the current downturn. 'It was totally unavoidable,' he said. 'You couldn't give away property for love or money.' Mr Stern was, certainly, not unusual in succumbing to the economic malaise that engulfed the UK in the mid-1970s. 'It is, in fact, a very ordinary bankruptcy but with noughts on the rent,' the Official Receiver said at the time of the crash of the Wilstar Group, Mr Stern's company. For all that, Wilstar's collapse can clearly be blamed on its financial strategy. It was an exponent of deficit financing: it bought property that did not yield enough rent to service the loan raised on it, in the belief that values would continue to rise. The risks of this approach were laid bare when interest rates rose in November 1973 and the market nose-dived. Mr Stern says he has learned from the mistakes of the early 1970s. 'Since I suffered heavily in the 1974 financial crash, I decided to build Dollar Land on a non-speculative basis,' he says. In practice that meant avoiding residential and development property that dominated his ill-starred portfolio of the early 1970s. Instead he concentrated on high-yielding buildings with strong tenants, generally outside the south of England; a quarter of the assets are in Belgium, France, Portugal and Holland. 'It is a very risk-adverse portfolio,' he says. This assessment is questionable. The group's borrowings of Pounds 167.5m, which corresponded to a gearing of 84 per cent at end-1991, were not fixed, leaving it vulnerable to rising interest rates. The group was dependent on trading profits to cover its costs. At end-1991, rents of Pounds 13.5m compared with financing charges of Pounds 23.7m. But Mr Stern argues that high borrowings were inevitable if the group was to build itself up from its near-standing start in 1985. He began with Pounds 5m of equity in 1985 from his US backers. Despite having a 24.5 per cent share in the business, he is not a director of Dollar Land Holdings, which, in turn, is a subsidiary of the Panamanian-based Keristal Investment and Trading. 'Because I had a problematic background they (the backers) did not want me on the main board,' he says. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Mr Stern's comeback was his ability to raise new loans. He has borrowed from a dozen banks and building societies, principally GE Capital which has lent the business Pounds 70m. Mr Stern attributes his ability to borrow to his contacts dating back to the early 1970s. 'Notwithstanding the insolvency, I had forged a number of relationships with bankers who knew my word was my bond and who valued my know-how.' He maintains, surprisingly, that his bankers valued his commitment to repaying his loans and his unwillingness to abandon a project. 'I have always looked a storm in the eye.' This attitude sits oddly with the events of the early-1970s when the Pounds 80m of personal guarantees he gave proved to be valueless. Sir Kenneth Cork, who liquidated Mr Stern's empire in the mid-1970s, maintained that the developer 'was convinced he was a genius whose flair for finance would never let him down. Moreover he successfully convinced others to share that opinion.' After Mr Stern's latest come-back, that assessment still seems valid today.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CHANGES IN PROPERTY VALUES (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Retail                 Office                       Year to     Mth of     Year to     Mth of                        Feb 93     Feb 93      Feb 93     Feb 93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rental growth            -3.6       -0.5       -17.3       -1.6 Capital growth           -3.3       -0.3       -14.2       -1.2 Total return              4.4        0.4        -5.8       -0.3 Current yield levels      9.0                   10.5  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Industrial                 All                       Year to     Mth of     Year to     Mth of                        Feb 93     Feb 93      Feb 93     Feb 93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rental growth            -9.9       -1.0       -10.0       -1.0 Capital growth           -8.9       -0.5        -8.4       -0.6 Total return              0.5        0.3        -0.1        0.1 Current yield levels     11.4                   10.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IPD monthly index, Investment Property Databank  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Papua New Guinea's [PNG] minister for finance and  planning, Masket Iangalio, has painted a gloomy picture of the  country's economy and says government revenue is well below  expectations.    In an interview with the Port Moresby newspaper, THE  NATIONAL, Mr. Iangalio said that although export prices for oil  and other commodities were rising and PNG was experiencing a  high level of economic growth, the government budget deficit was  unacceptably high, and foreign reserves were falling to crisis  level. He blamed Papua New Guinea's financial troubles in part  on the closure of the Bougainville copper mine, over optimistic  estimates of government income and success of budget, and  uncontrolled spending by the public sector over a number of  years.</p>

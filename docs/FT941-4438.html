			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / London council tax to fall by 3.9% Twenty-one of the 32 boroughs in London are to cut their council tax next month, only a few weeks before local elections. The reduction on a property in band D will average 3.9 per cent. The 21 include Conservative and Labour-dominated councils. Eight councils are to raise their tax while three, including Lambeth, will leave it unchanged. The sharpest reductions, announced by the Association of London Authorities, were achieved by Labour-controlled Greenwich, down Pounds 151.12 to Pounds 632, and Conservative-controlled Brent, which fell by Pounds 112.50 to Pounds 485.10. Eleven other boroughs - Bromley, Camden, Ealing, Hackney, Hammersmith, Haringey, Hounslow, Islington, Southwark, Wandsworth and Westminster - delivered above-average reductions. Boroughs which had low levels of the former poll tax, such as Westminster and Wandsworth, will benefit further from government transitional relief grants, designed to ensure that households do not suffer sharp increases from one year to the next. Liberal Democrat-controlled Richmond registered the highest increase, raising its council tax by Pounds 53.21 to Pounds 594 for band D, which covers properties valued between Pounds 68,000 and Pounds 88,000. Council-tax cuts in Greater London contrast with an average rise across the country of 2.1 per cent, according to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. The Department of the Environment had predicted an average rise of more than 7 per cent when it unveiled local-authority grants for England for 1994-95 at the end of last year. Cipfa said a sharp increase in the tax base had helped London councils because residents who had avoided poll tax found it more difficult to avoid paying council tax. Many councils collected far more tax than they had expected. Some boroughs were also helped by the new formula which re-allocated local-government grants. Most authorities claim to have avoided cuts in services. Hounslow has abandoned the planned 2 per cent cut in its primary school budget announced before last year's government grant announcement.</p>

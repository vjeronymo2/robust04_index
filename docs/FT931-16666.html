			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Bleak midwinter The first snow of the winter in the Yorkshire coalfields covers the stockpiles at Sharlston Colliery, near Wakefield, one of the pits threatened with closure. Opposition to the pit closure programme will be stepped up tomorrow when mining unions meet the TUC to plan the next stage in their campaign. The National Union of Mineworkers, the pit deputies' union Nacods and the British Association of Colliery Management will hold talks with the emergency committee set up by the TUC to campaign for jobs and economic recovery. The mining unions will later meet rail unions to 'discuss developments' since they last met in October, just after British Coal announced its plan to close 31 pits with the loss of 30,000 jobs. The unions want to keep pressure on the government after the pre-Christmas High Court ruling that the closure programme was unlawful. The talks at the TUC will be followed by a meeting of the TUC public-services committee to discuss opposition to the government's 1.5 per cent ceiling on public-sector pay rises this year.</p>

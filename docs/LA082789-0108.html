			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TALK OF THE IRISH;  </P> <P> HARP BY JOHN GREGORY DUNNE (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $18.95; 235 PP.;  0-671-68852-9)  </P> <P> Harp? Try knell. Though this Irish-American memoir includes a trip to Ireland,  John Gregory Dunne has less unfinished business with the Emerald Isle than he  does with the Grim Reaper. But then: Don't we all? And what of it? You can't  talk of the Irish anyway without talking, soon enough, of the dead.  </P> <P> "I call myself a harp," Dunne writes, "because I like the sound of the word --  it is short, sharp and abusive." I could call myself a harp too; but if I did,  it would be because I find the word short, sharp and roughly affectionate. It's  a good one-word title for Dunne's book, all right, but not if you hear it his  way, only if you hear it mine. Harp Lager doesn't owe its name to an ethnic  slur.  </P> <P> "Harp" is rather like the life story of an Irish writer as you might hear it in  a single long night in a bar, especially if you were Irish too, and the writer  could take the corresponding liberties. In Irish company, it is never bad form  to bring up your "people." In fact, if too much time passes and you have failed  to do so, you may receive a gentle invitation.  </P> <P> And when you accept, a certain disarming readiness in your companion -- a sense  that for him, the family question is not an idle one -- will mix with the drink  and loosen your tongue. And in short order you'll be telling about your poor  younger brother, the sweetest, dearest one of the lot of you, and to end that  way. And then there was your niece, her that was killed, and what you hope  happens to her murderer there in prison when his fellow convicts get their  hands on him. (I spare you the details, but in a bar I might not; and in  "Harp," Dunne doesn't.)  </P> <P> It's not against the rules to talk even of old nuns and elderly maiden aunts  (not that these categories are mutually exclusive), though you'll most likely  be doing that in connection with a story about the wake and funeral of one of  them, and maybe the reading of a will. And then what does that kind of talk  lead up to but the fate that awaits us all? And then invariably the talk gets  warmer and better, and the company dearer, as Death -- banished but remembered  -- waits outside in the dark lane, and the waning of the night is like the  waning of life itself.  </P> <P> Death is only the penultimate Irish topic, however. The ultimate topic is  regret. Lost loves. Ruinous mistakes. Vanished youth. Squandered fortunes.  Broken promises. And for these, you must remain through the last round.  </P> <P> "Harp" declines the last round. It stands in the door with its cap in its hand,  willing its eyes dry, holding its tongue, because that kind of talk, you know,  with the tears and all, what good does it do you? Well, the Irish know what  kind of good it does them; but since "Harp" has held up its end of the  conversation so well for so long, no one will mind, much, if it leaves a little  early.  </P> <P> John Gregory Dunne was born in Hartford, Conn., the son of a physician wealthy  enough to have servants and a six-car garage, the grandson -- on his mother's  side -- of a banker, in fact, a bank-founder. His irritation with  </P> <P> the Yankee establishment of the Northeast is not the kind felt by the  </P> <P> Irish who didn't make it but the special kind felt by the Irish who did. For  them, after the fading of the gross differences of wealth and education between  the Irish and the English in America, what remained was a residual difference  of style, a difference whose meaning to the Irish Dunne catches brilliantly as  follows:  </P> <P> "My parents' house . . . looked out on the house of that quintessential Yank  Thomas Norval Hepburn, a urologist and pioneer in social medicine, but best  known as the father of Katharine Hepburn; our summer house in Saybrook was only  a hop, skip and jump from the Hepburns' house in Fenwick. I must confess here a  certain lack of enthusiasm for the public and cinematic persona of Katharine  Hepburn -- the feisty lady of quality, a tad feistier and with a tad more  quality than anyone else within range. She has always seemed to me all  cheekbones and opinions, and none of the opinions has ever struck me as  terribly original or terribly interesting, dependent as they are on a rather  parochial Hartford definition of quality, as reinterpreted by five decades'  worth of Studio unit publicists. This obiter dictum is, I admit, not a majority  view."  </P> <P> Dunne's attitude toward Hepburn is, broadly, the attitude of the American Irish  -- at least of his generation -- toward the Yankees. Yankee "quality" has  always seemed to them to be a distinction without a difference, a glance  downward from the Olympian flats. Books like Robert C. Christopher's recent  "Crashing the Gates: The De-WASPing of America's Power Elite" (Simon &amp;  Schuster) may be right to claim that the fire is mostly gone out of this old  fight. The erstwhile aristocracy has become, at best, a "class act," like the  Hepburn act; at worst, a set of mannerisms and commodities packaged -- as in  Ralph Lauren's "Polo" line of costumery -- for anyone who, God save us, wants  to look that way. And yet "Harp," running atavistically athwart such claims,  isn't entirely wrong either. If John Dunne wears his slightly bruised Celtic  heart on his sleeve, a similar bruise may be found darkening other, less  prominently displayed hearts, not all of them, by any means, Irish.  </P> <P> Slightly bruised, I said, and I used the adverb advisedly. By the time Dunne  had graduated from Princeton (yes, not B.C. or the Cross) and done his stint in  the U.S. Army in Germany (a full chapter on that time), a difference had taken  hold of him that would dwarf all merely ethnic differences; namely, the  difference between the writer and the rest of mankind. There is in this book --  curiously, perhaps, though I can't say I much miss it -- nothing of the usual  making-of-the-writer sort: no first jobs, mentors, breakthroughs, crucial  lessons, etc. The writer in this book is the writer Dunne has become, not the  writer he was at any point along the way.  </P> <P> Beginning with the suicide of his younger brother, Stephen, and ending with his  own heart attack in Central Park, "Harp" is, en route, a mix of dead Dunne  relatives (and one friend) remembered and the live novelist/journalist at work.  The tone in the author-at-work sections wavers between oblique vaunt -- "This  is what I do!" -- and equally oblique dread -- "Is this what I do?"  </P> <P> Thus, early in the book, Dunne writes: "(Writing) is the only job I have. I do  not teach, I rarely lecture. I occasionally do screenplays, but the operative  word is 'do'; doing screenplays does for me what doing screenplays did for  Faulkner: it buys time."  </P> <P> Near the end of the book, however, after the heart attack, he writes:  </P> <P> " 'I think I know how to end this book now,' I said to my wife on the walk home  from (the doctor's). I knew I did not have to spell it out to her.  </P> <P> " 'Terrific,' she said, the novelist in her taking precedence over the wife who  knew her husband too well ever to express the concern she felt, the husband who  was so volatile except in times of crisis.  </P> <P> " 'It's a hell of an ending,' I said, and what I meant was that a writer's life  is his only real capital, his and his alone to invest, and to imagine, and to  reimagine, even unto this.  </P> <P> "Well, hell, yes, it's what I do."  </P> <P> What do you do? -- the great American question. And as the writer's life draws  nearer its close, the great American follow-up question: What have I done? I  find it utterly Irish of Dunne to manage his answer in asides during a long  night of talk about death in the family. And for once the Irish way seems a  reasonable way. The question What have I done? is a beast best taken from the  flank. One senses that Dunne does indeed have a few regrets, or at least a few  longstanding worries that may someday mature and blossom as regrets. But this  is just a hunch, one reader's extrapolation. The writer himself says little.  </P> <P> "Harp" is, I would note before closing, Irish in one other particular. When I  come home from an evening out with my oldest Irish friend, my wife always asks  about his wife. And I never have anything to report. I always feel a little  sheepish saying, "Well, she didn't come up. I mean, she did, of course, several  times, but we didn't talk about her." Joan Didion appears at several crucial  moments in "Harp," including the one just noted (it is indeed a hell of an  ending, by the way); she is not, however, among her husband's public subjects.  </P> <P> Not yet.  </P> <P> Winsome, accommodating beyond the usual measure, and unpredictably,  truculently, cripplingly touchy: That's how the Irish seem to me. Dunne is  Irish in all these ways: thin-skinned and easily aggrieved; engaging,  invincibly gregarious; and, depending on your cause, combatively at your  service as scarcely another writer of his prominence in the nation. "Harp" is  just the kind of book that such a man would write, a book that welcomes you in,  talks to you wonderfully for a while, takes you into its confidence, then backs  off just a bit abruptly ("Was it something I said?" you wonder) and takes its  leave. If you know someone like that, and if you find him, on balance, worth  the trouble, then you may find "Harp" worth the trouble too.  </P></p>

			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Barclays Life rebuked over sales operation Barclays Bank's life insurance and pensions subsidiary has been publicly censured by the Securities and Investments Board, the chief City watchdog, for shortcomings in the training and management of its 1,100 sales force. The criticism was followed yesterday by the resignation of Mr Ken Bignall, chairman of Barclays Life, from the board of the Personal Investment Authority, the new regulator to protect the private investor, which began operation this week. Mr Bignall said the PIA, which Barclays Life yesterday applied to join, needed 'to have the reputation of being administered by people who are beyond reproach'. Barclays Life is only the second organisation to receive such a rebuke from the SIB, which does not have the power to impose fines on the 70-plus bodies it regulates. Yesterday's reprimand came a day after Nationwide Building Society announced it was temporarily withdrawing its financial services sales force for re-training, after a regulatory visit. The SIB said Barclays Life's failures to comply with its requirements took place from September 1991 - when it made an inspection visit - until June 1993, when a further routine visit occurred. Since last summer, Barclays Life has been implementing measures intended to do more than just remedy the supervisory and other defects the SIB identified. They include a move to give sales agents a basic salary as well as commission and bonuses, instead of paying them on a commission-only basis. The switch in remuneration is likely to take place by next year. Barclays Life has already introduced additional training for its entire sales force, it has extended the initial training programme for new sales agents from three to eight weeks and it has expanded the central checking unit from 31 to 100 staff. The company said the changes had cost several millions of pounds. Mr Bignall said, while there was no evidence that Barclays Life customers had been disadvantaged, the company was reviewing a sample of past business to reassure itself that this was the case. It has also set up a help-line (0800 494949) for customers to contact if they are concerned. Mr Bignall's resignation from the PIA may spark a renewed debate about the position of Mr Joe Palmer, the former chief executive of Legal &amp; General, who is chairman of the PIA. Earlier this year, L&amp;G was fined a then-record amount of Pounds 180,000 by Lautro, the life industry's current regulator, for a failure to meet regulators' requirements over a period which included some of Mr Palmer's time in charge.</p>

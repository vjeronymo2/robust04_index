			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bureaucrats Make No Mistakes"; part </F> three of the ongoing series entitled "The Beleaguered Myth of  the Bureaucracy"]    [Excerpts] On 2 March, four lawyers, including Makoto  Toyoda of the "National Liaison Council of Minamata Disease  [industrial pollution-induced mercury poisoning in the 1950's]  Victims and Their Lawyers"--which is composed of plaintiffs  involving Minamata disease lawsuits--called on Environment  Agency [EA] Director General Wakako Hironaka at her office.  With a Fukuoka high court ruling on the Minamata lawsuits close  at hand, they intended to urge EA Director General Hironaka  again to "settle the litigation prior to the ruling" because she  was trying to break the deadlocked situation. For example, she  has indicated an idea within the government of providing "money  as a token of the government's sympathy" to Minamata disease  victims.    Because Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, during his  governorship of Kumamoto Prefecture, had asked the central  government to conclude an amicable settlement, the plaintiffs  expressed great hopes that the central government would change  its policy on Minamata disease lawsuits. However, EA Director  General Hironaka just repeated: "Now that I have joined the  government, it is difficult for me to have things my own way. I  am sorry."    Throughout court trials, the government has maintained that  there were no legal grounds at that time for the government's  possessing the authority to control industrial water, and that  hence it has no responsibility to compensate the plaintiffs for  the failure to prevent the emergence and spread of Minamata  disease. The plaintiffs have maintained that the government  should be held liable for this. Later, EA Director General  Hironaka explained why "she cannot have her own way in dealing  with the issue." She said: "While the Ministry of Finance  [MOF], which has authority over financial affairs, does not  intend to agree on [compensation], the Ministry of Justice,  which is in charge of lawsuits, is not saying `yes.' Because  the administrative organizations are united, I cannot make a  move unless the administration as a whole says `yes.'"  <H5>  Senior Officials Opposed a Proposal Made by a Minister </H5>   "We should tackle the Nagara River project." It was summer  of 1990 when EA Director General Ishimatsu Kitagawa of the  second Kaifu cabinet made that proposal during a meeting with  senior EA officials, including (then) Administrative Vice  Minister Tadashi Yasuhara. [passage omitted on review of the  Nagara Dam construction project and residents' opposition to the  project]    (Then) EA Chief Kitagawa was ready to use the "EA director  general's right to issue recommendations" based on the law  establishing the EA in a bid to suspend the dam's construction.  Senior EA officials, however, unanimously opposed him, saying:  "Minister, please set aside your plan." Kitagawa stood isolated  and had no choice but to give up his intention. [passage  omitted on comment by unidentified official]    Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi put his signature to a  document opposing the dam's construction three years ago when he  was an opposition party member and was regarded as a "dissenter"  against the project. When he met with Prime Minister Hosokawa  prior to his inspection of the Nagara River at the end of last  year, Construction Minister Igarashi made a proposal that an  organization be set up within the government to review  large-scale public works projects formulated under the Liberal  Democratic Party administration. This is as far as he can go.  However, the Construction Ministry and the EA "have done  nothing" about the proposal since then (as stated by a senior  Construction Ministry official).    The Government "Delayed in Dealing With" Comfort  Women Issue    An MOF division chief stated: "If we do not do our best, the  ideal picture of the state cannot be maintained." However, it  may be said that such a self-conceit has led to bureaucrats'  having the following view: "There are no mistakes in our work."  And, as a result of being hung up about the practice of making  no mistakes, bureaucrats may see their greatest value as  "maintaining order" by adjusting their policies to past policies  and existing laws.    Their obstinacy sometimes delays a political decision and  this aggravates the situation.    In December 1991, former Korean comfort women [who were  forced to serve as prostitutes during World War II] filed  lawsuits against the Japanese Government for compensation. This  resulted in a major issue pending between Japan and South Korea  of how far the former Japanese Imperial Army was involved in  collecting and controlling comfort women. The issue concerns  Japan's shameful acts. Originally, the government stated that it  was unable to "confirm the incident" under the pretext that  there were no documents which would provide evidence.  Nevertheless, "documents" were found one after another by  researchers. [passage omitted on statements by former chief  cabinet secretaries on the comfort women issue]    Before the Japanese Government admitted the fact that the  Japanese Imperial Army forced Korean women to serve as  prostitutes, the government gave the impression that it was  compelled to make efforts to deal with the issue under pressure.  [passage omitted on a statement by a South Korean Foreign  Ministry spokesman and an editorial on Korean paper TONG-A ILBO]  <H5>  "Bureaucrats Are of Good Quality But Take a Narrow View of </H5> Things    "Is the Diet the supreme organization of state power?" Mr.  Masaharu Gotoda, who became a politician after serving as  commissioner-general for the National Police Agency and deputy  chief cabinet secretary, is now writing a book on the theme of  "politics and bureaucrats." Mr. Gotoda intends to put the above  question, which concerns Article 41 of the Constitution, in the  introduction of his book, and intends to discuss how relations  between politicians and bureaucrats ought to be.    He said: "It goes without saying that government officials  are well-intentioned people and are of good quality. However,  they see the world only from the viewpoint of a government  office. It is politics that makes the final decision. If  government officials take an attitude of sticking to one  direction, they go to extremes."</p>

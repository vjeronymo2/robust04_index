			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Harmony forms links with the Sangster and Slater families HARMONY Leisure, the loss-making pubs and restaurants group, yesterday announced an unexpected link-up with two of the City's best known families - the Sangsters, former owners of Vernon Pools, and the Slaters, whose Slater Walker merchant bank collapsed in the 1970s. Mr Jim Slater, the one time stock market guru and entrepreneur, has agreed together with shareholders representing the Sangsters to sell Arion, their jointly-owned Edinburgh property company, to Harmony. As part of an all-paper transaction, the two families will receive 12.3m new Harmony shares at 5p, valuing Arion at Pounds 800,000. Mr Guy Sangster, whose father Robert was chairman of Vernon Pools until its acquisition by Thomson T-Line in 1988, is to become a non-executive director of Harmony once the transaction has been approved by the Stock Exchange. Mr Christopher Slater, whose father Jim became a share tipster after his business empire failed, will remain as managing director of Arion. The move marks Harmony's first sizeable acquisition since the board announced a Pounds 1.8m rights issue earlier this year to fund the creation of a property investment division. Harmony said it would be seeking other all-paper acquisitions to build up its asset base.</p>

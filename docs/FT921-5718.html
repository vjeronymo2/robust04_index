			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Arts: English influences on Van Gogh - Exhibition at the Barbican In the July of 1890, at Auvers, a little to the north of Paris, Vincent van Gogh died at the age of 37, art's most poignant suicide. The circumstances of his death has been well rehearsed in the several splendid exhibitions that marked the centenary - most notably the full retrospectives of the drawings and paintings at Otterlo and Amsterdam. But they were concentrated upon the working life, that last extraordinary decade from 1880, when Vincent discovered his true vocation as an artist and began to draw in earnest. The seeds of that vocation, however, had been sown several years before. The earnest young man in his twenties may have been uncertain in his ambitions, yet he had already found in art a vehicle for a volatile temperament that was a mixture of religious feeling and enthusiasm, a transcendental love of nature, and a missionary zeal. In this early period he was already drawing occasionally, and within these tentative beginnings the familiar insistent vision is already evident. But it was through looking at art, old masters and contemporary alike, that his feelings first began to resolve themselves. What gives this preliminary phase its peculiar interest for us is that so important a part of it was passed in London, and that it should be the English painting and literature of the time that impressed him so profoundly. It is these English circumstances and context that the current exhibition at the Barbican Art Gallery addresses. Van Gogh in England: portrait of the artist as a young man (until May 4: sponsored by Akzo) is by no means exhaustive, but it gives us in detail, in letters and archive material, the successive shifts and developments in Vincent's early career, his responses to the places he visited, the experiences he had had and the things he had seen. In May 1873, the 20-year-old Vincent started work at the London gallery of Goupil's, the picture dealers of Brussels and the Hague. Early in 1876 he turned to teaching, taking up a job at Ramsgate in April. In July he moved on to a school at Isleworth in Middlesex, run by a Congregational minister, the Rev Thomas Slade-Jones. Through that late summer and autumn his religious interests intensified and he began to speak and preach at various non-conformist churches in the neighbourhood - not altogether surprisingly, for he was the son of a pastor in the Dutch Reformed Church. It was to be the eventual failure of this vocation for the ministry that lead to his first breakdown, and so to his becoming an artist. At the end of 1876 he and his sister Anna, who had also been teaching in England, went home to Holland for Christmas. The family persuaded him not to return. Against the backdrop of this human story, the attention of the exhibition rests upon Vincent's interest in the academic social realism current in England at the time, commanding the summer show at the Royal Academy each year and more widely disseminated in the popular illustrated magazines such as The Graphic and the Illustrated London News. The reproductions of the work of Herkomer, Holl and Fildes, and illustrators of Dickens such as Mahoney, he cut out and kept. The direct borrowings he are convincingly demonstrated: poses noticed in an anonymous Graphic illustration of 1874, of Russian sledge-drivers in a tea-house, serve some 11 years later for the principal figures of his great polemical composition, 'The Potato Eaters'. Luke Fildes' Graphic drawing of 1870, of Charles Dickens' chair left empty at his death, is clearly now the model for the two empty chairs of 1888: his own, and that which Gauguin had but lately left. If for too long it was the received wisdom to dismiss as marginal Vincent's interest even in the French symbolists, Millet and Puvis de Chavannes - or his compatriots of the Hague School, such as Jacob Maris, Josef Israels or his own cousin-by-marriage, Anton Mauve - by how much more of the same token does that English influence remain problematical. Those Dutch and French influences have now been sanctioned by more recent study and critical revision, and their effect upon Vincent at least admitted; the English work, by contrast, is allowed the justification of its narrative and content only in the context of socio-political analysis. To admit as art what is routinely dismissed, as I read only last week in the matter of some of the Tate's rehung Victorians, as work of mind-numbing awfulness, is quite another matter. Yet Vincent loved it, and continued to respond to it throughout his life. He greatly admired Millais, and only now are we beginning to accept that the later Millais was at least as fine and interesting a painter as the young pre-Raphaelite. He was also interested in the work of the French expatriate, James Tissot, so long discounted as a mere observer of elegant society. But von Herkome, Holl and Fildes, and even so minor a figure as James Boughton, he also accepted for what they were. We need not rate them over high to recognise the inherent value of a great artist's interest. No artist works out of his time, indifferent to the attitudes and assumptions that inform it. He may challenge them, but to challenge them is to know and recognise them. Vincent never had any difficulty with the narrative and symbolic content of art, with the moral purpose that in the 20th century we have found so hard to accept. And if we begin to recognise that his own art throughout, every last bit of it, was instinct with such acceptance, so as much might be true of Gauguin, Pissarro, Lautrec - then Roger Fry's old exclusive heresy of significant form soon begins to fall away. It would be no bad thing were we able once more to look at narrative art for what it is, and accept it for the art it is.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President-elect Jose Maria Figueres at </F> the Universidad Estatal a Distancia auditorium on 25 April; from  the "Radio Reloj Newscast"; broadcast in progress -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Figueres] ...the political leaders of these  three friendly countries, and our interest in reviewing our  bilateral relations with them and in knowing how they view  matters of interest to us such as NAFTA.    In Mexico we had the opportunity to talk with President  Carlos Salinas about the bilateral treaty signed between Costa  Rica and Mexico. We discussed how to implement it better and  how to make it function effectively. We also discussed the  situation in Central America from Costa Rica's point of view.  We discussed issues that we should discuss at the  Ibero-American Summit to be held in mid- June in Cartagena,  Colombia.    We discussed with Mexican business leaders their  expectations  and aspirations for the bilateral treaty. We were accompanied  by the presidents of the chambers of commerce of Costa Rica.    We discussed Mexico's political situation with Mexican  presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo and matters of interest  such as NAFTA.    In Mexico we were accompanied by Farid Ayales, who will be  the labor minister during my administration, so he could talk  with his Mexican counterpart and gain firsthand information  about the great effort Mexico has been making based on the  national agreement proposed by President Salinas. Based on this  agreement, the various sectors -- business, labor, and  government -- meet weekly to examine potential areas of conflict  in the Mexican adjustment process.    We were also accompanied by Marco Vargas, who will be the  economy minister in my cabinet, so he could learn about Mexico's  special program to make small and midsize enterprises more  productive. [passage omitted]    From Mexico we went to the United States and held several  meetings with Vice President Al Gore; Alexander Watson,  assistant secretary of state for inter-American Affairs;  Assistant Secretary (Talbot); and Mr. Hamilton, a State  Department expert on U.S. policy for Central America.    We spoke with them about the importance of strengthening our  bilateral relations. Costa Rica and the United States  historically have had excellent relations, but we think they can  be improved in many fields [10-second break in reception].    We are very interested in achieving an equal footing with  Mexico so we can compete to attract foreign investment and so  our products can compete on the U.S. market. We discussed this  with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, the counterpart of  our foreign trade minister. We can say that the United States  views this as a possibility. We proposed this in September of  last year during our first visit to the United States. We  expect to see some specific action as early as July or August of  this year, when the legislature will meet to ratify the Uruguay  Round of GATT and may then incorporate annexes that will allow  the Caribbean Basin Initiative countries to secure more  benefits. Jose Rossi [foreign trade minister-designate] can  give you more details on this.    We also met with officials from multilateral and bilateral  organizations, with [words indistinct] and the vice president of  the World Bank, Mr. (Gourky) and Mr. (Beza), who holds a post  that is equivalent to the IMF vice presidency. We discussed  with them what we have been saying since 1991, when we presented  at (Corec) a proposal on the PAE [Economic Adjustment Program].  We talked with them about what we want: more investment in the  social sector, especially in health and education, to supplement  loans recently approved for health and education by the IDB. We  also discussed the need to improve production in the country.    We have done much without reducing tariffs or eliminating  tariff barriers as part of our world integration strategy, but  we have not done all that could be done to promote production or  to pave the way so that medium- and small-sized businessmen may  compete in the world economy.    We reached the very satisfactory conclusion they fully agree  to reanalyze and restructure the loan they had been negotiating  with the government. [passage omitted]    We feel strongly about the great responsibility we have on  the domestic side of public administration and the specific  things we need to do in the country. We also feel Costa Rica  should look abroad to forge strong alliances with at least three  groups. One group, of course, is our nation's friends and those  who lead their governments. We met with some of these people in  each of the three countries. A second group would be the  business sector in these countries. We met with members of the  U.S. and Mexican business communities.    Costa Rica is still interested in attracting large amounts  of  foreign investment to our country, but it must be foreign  investment that offers a high degree of added value, meaning we  want investment with a significant amount of technical transfer  attached to it, something which can make us the leaders in many  areas of worldwide competition. We want investment that can  allow us to have better salaries than what we have now.    A third alliance on the international scene, in addition to  the political alliance with friendly governments and the  economic alliance with the business community, should be with  the academic world. The truth is many of these universities and  learning centers have closely followed the process of  development in many other countries. They have had the  opportunity to study and propose alternatives and solutions to  the many problems of development; they have seen what has worked  and what has not. We believe, along these lines, it is  important to have their experience, advice, and interest in  Costa Rica.    We expressed to the three countries and the groups with whom  we met our desire for Costa Rica to become a prototype of  sustainable development. We explained such sustainable  development should be founded on the following: The enormous  lesson this country learned during the 1950's, 1960's, and  1970's, a lesson which showed us how productive social  investment can really be. What we invested in health and  education then is what has allowed us to enjoy the country we  have now. We want to continue with that investment. We need to  be more efficient and decentralize public services, as we  announced in our government plan. We must continue, however,  with social spending as one of the main pillars that will  buttress sustainable development. The second pillar should be  the lesson we learned during the 1980's, when this country  earned its place as a leader as of 1982.</p>

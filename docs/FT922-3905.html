			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: EFM Japan launch to raise Pounds 20m EDINBURGH FUND Managers is seeking between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m from the launch of a Japanese investment trust. EFM Japan will come to the market via an institutional placing and offer to intermediaries, and becomes the third geographical specialist investment trust to be launched this month, following trusts investing in Europe from Henderson and Thornton. However, Europe appears to be popular with private investors at present, while Japan, following recent heavy falls in the Nikkei-Dow index, is less fashionable. EFM has also bucked a recent trend for complex split-capital issues by opting for a conventional structure - there will only be ordinary shares, plus warrants issued on a 1-for-5 basis. Mr Iain Watt, EFM managing director, said he was confident that the trust would not move to a discount to net asset value and pointed out that Japanese investment trusts managed by Baillie Gifford, Robert Fleming, and GT were all trading at premiums. He said EFM was keen to add to its range of investment trusts, and already had two unit trusts investing in Japan - EFM Smaller Japanese Companies and EFM Tokyo - which were fourth and 54th respectively in the 60-strong sector of Japanese unit trusts over the five years to June 1, according to Finstat. Mr Watt said the offer was aimed at institutions and private investors. He was confident there would be considerable interest. 'Japan remains a dynamic economy with excellent recovery potential.' The ordinary shares of 25p will be issued at 100p while the warrants will be exercisable from 1993 to 2005 at that price. The trust will be open for subscription between June 15 and June 23. First dealings will be on June 30.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> CURTIS RECALL FIGHT MAY AFFECT RACE  </P> <P> As the filing period for November's city election opens today, voters should  get their first sign of whether an attempt to recall Councilman Robert A.  Curtis four months ago will be an issue in the upcoming race.  </P> <P> After a bitter fight that deeply divided the 2-year-old city, several  candidates are expected to oppose two council members who supported Curtis'  recall.  </P> <P> Last February, many voters in the recall election felt that they were either  voting for Curtis or for the Mission Viejo Co., which spent about $350,000 to  unseat Curtis because of his slow-growth stance.  </P> <P> And just minutes after Curtis retained his seat by a wide margin, his  supporters were vowing to work against the reelection in November of three  incumbent council members who came out against Curtis in the final days of the  recall campaign. One of them, Mayor Christian W. Keena, subsequently decided  not to run for reelection, citing a need to concentrate on his law practice.  </P> <P> The other two are Councilman Norman P. Murray and Councilwoman Victoria C.  Jaffe. Murray has declared his candidacy and Jaffee is expected to run.  </P> <P> "I think (the recall attempt) will have tremendous impact on the election,"  said Ray Carolin, who announced his candidacy within days after the recall  attempt failed. "The Curtis recall election served as a catalyst for a number  of groups that independently didn't like the ways things are done here in  Mission Viejo."  </P> <P> But Murray said the Curtis recall effort should not affect November's election.  </P> <P> "As far as I'm concerned, it's past history," he said. "I've made my amends  with Bob Curtis, and I feel that we are conducting city business on a friendly  basis."  </P> <P> In May, Curtis surprised the community by announcing that he had negotiated an  agreement with the giant development firm that would give the city seven acres  of land to build a civic center. In exchange, the city approved company plans  for a large commercial complex. However, the deal has not won the support of  the rest of the council. FRANK MESSINA  </P></p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Observer: Lloyd's crusader No one would have guessed a year ago that Michael Freeman, the solicitor leading the legal battle against the Lloyd's establishment, would have been catapulted into the headlines. His eponymous firm is better known for its commercial law expertise than for its insurance know-how. However, just over a year ago he was approached by members of the Oakeley Vaughan syndicate who had become frustrated at the way their case against the Corporation of Lloyd's was being handled. Not the sort of names to let their affairs go by default, they decided to abandon the respected City firm of Elborne Mitchell and head up west to find a tough, commercial lawyer. One of their number, Sir William Pigott-Brown, had recommended Freeman. The appointment achieved the desired effect. Pleadings were amended, evidence redrafted and general consternation created. Perhaps it was natural that, having no connection with the City, Freeman should develop a pronounced sympathy for his clients' plight. His speedy mastery of the inner workings of Lloyd's, coupled with his successful background in commercial litigation, made it almost inevitable that he would be leading the crusade when it set off. He has a powerful mastery of oratory - probably too abrasive a style for a QC, but just the tonic for spurring depressed and impoverished members of Lloyd's.</p>

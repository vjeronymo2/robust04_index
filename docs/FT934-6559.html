			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Northern Foods rises 5% to Pounds 72.1m - Profits held back as intensified competition and continued price-cutting are forecast Northern Foods, the dairy and food manufacturing company, yesterday forecast intensified competition and continued price-cutting by supermarkets after reporting a 5 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 72.1m in the six months to the end of September. Northern said its performance had suffered from much faster than expected growth in liquid milk sales to supermarkets, at the expense of more profitable doorstep deliveries, and from the continuing decline of small high street shops. Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman, said Northern had successfully resisted pressure to cut its prices to supermarkets and hoped to secure a modest price rise in May. However, market conditions had obliged it to accelerate cost-cutting plans. He said discounting and reductions in product quality caused by competition in the retail trade were unsustainable in the long run. They risked damaging supermarkets' brand image, while suppliers which competed purely on low profits would be unable to make satisfactory re-turns. Northern was determined to maintain a high level of product quality and to continue to compete on innovation, service and value, not on low price. The increase in the first-half figures, which compare with Pounds 68.4m a year ago, equalled almost exactly a drop in interest charges, and reflected mixed operating results. Sales rose by 3.5 per cent from Pounds 969.9m to Pounds 1bn. Operating profit of the dairy division edged up to Pounds 40m (Pounds 39.7m)  -the first time Mr Haskins could remember when the performance of the business had stagnated. Sales increased by 4 per cent to Pounds 477.3m (Pounds 457.1m), reflecting a surge in liquid milk sales to supermarkets, which carry a lower margin. Doorstep delivery volumes, excluding acquisitions, fell by 11 per cent. The company expected doorstep deliveries to fall to 30 per cent of total liquid milk deliveries in less than five years. Operating profit on convenience foods rose from Pounds 21.5m to Pounds 22.5m on sales of Pounds 272.3m (Pounds 262.4m), while grocery saw profits advance to Pounds 9.5m (Pounds 8.6m) on sales of Pounds 105.9m (Pounds 92.3m). Sales to Marks and Spencer, Northern Foods' biggest customer, had advanced strongly, while Park Cakes and Fox's businesses had performed particularly well. However, profit on meat products fell to Pounds 9.4m (Pounds 11.4m) on sales of Pounds 148.3m (Pounds 158.1m). The declines reflected a reduction in van sales to small shops and selective trading down by consumers. Earnings per share advanced to 9.37p (8.99p). The interim dividend is raised from 3.4p to 3.5p. COMMENT Northern Foods appears so far to have fended off retailer pressures to cut prices, thanks partly to its emphasis on premium products such as chilled foods and up-market groceries, which are on the sidelines of the supermarkets' war. However, not all its customers are like Marks and Spencer. Its biggest weak spot is liquid milk, almost half its business. Though it insists retailers are bearing most of the cost, their aggressive pricing is capturing sales from doorstep deliveries at alarming speed. Meanwhile, its highly profitable sales to small shops are suffering, as more consumers desert them for big supermarkets. At this stage, Northern Foods' warnings that the price war is unsustainable seem based more on hope than expectation. With no sign of a let-up in the second half, analysts have been downgrading their full-year forecasts to no more than Pounds 160m, compared with Pounds 153m last time.</p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Observer: Hairline crack Is Vladimir Zhirinovsky showing signs of losing his hair? The question is not as daft as it sounds if one supports the analysis of humorist Vladimir Voynovich, quoted in Solovyov and Klepikova's recent biography of Boris Yeltsin. Since Lenin's time, bald and hairy rulers have alternated throughout Russian history: Lenin (bald), Stalin (hairy), Khruschev (bald), Brezhnev (hairy), Andropov (bald), Chernenko (hairy), Gorbachev (bald), Yeltsin (hairy). So the message seems to be that as long as Zhirinovsky keeps his hair on, we should be all right.</p>

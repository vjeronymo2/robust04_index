			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EPA TO PUT CLEANUP BURDEN ON INDUSTRY  </P> <P> Environmental Protection Agency chief William K. Reilly, responding to a deluge  of criticism about the slow and costly progress of hazardous waste cleanup,  pledged Wednesday to shift the focus of the nation's Superfund program to force  industries to pay a greater share of cleanup costs.  </P> <P> The turn to such adversarial tactics -- including use of a law requiring  uncooperative polluters to pay triple the costs of the damage they cause --  comes as part of a full-scale EPA reassessment of Superfund, whose estimated  cost has soared to $30 billion.  </P> <P> In outlining the "mid-course correction" of the nine-year-old program, Reilly  acknowledged that Superfund had proven inefficient in the past. But he argued  that public expectations of rapid progress had often been unreasonable.  </P> <P> "This is a program on which the public will be embarked for a long time to  come," Reilly said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wants Faster Pace  </P> <P> The agency's projected crackdown on industrial polluters is aimed at speeding  the pace of hazardous waste cleanup without adding to the burden on taxpayers.  The effort is to be bolstered by near-doubling of the Superfund enforcement  staff, including a shift of 500 officials and $75 million previously allocated  to other tasks within the program.  </P> <P> A senior Justice Department official strongly endorsed the plan and said the  department stood ready to "take additional aggressive action in the courts."  </P> <P> "Businesses should simply not be allowed to avoid having to pay for the  detritus they're spreading around," said Donald A. Carr, acting assistant  attorney general for land and natural resources.  </P> <P> The new "blueprint" for Superfund was intended as the agency's answer to more  than 30 separate studies that have criticized the slow pace of hazardous waste  cleanup under the program, which has been saddled with cost overruns and  tainted by scandal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> List of Sites to Grow  </P> <P> Of 1,200 sites on the agency's top priority list, only 26 have been totally  cleaned up. And with scores of new sites identified each year, the  high-priority list is expected to reach 2,100 by the turn of the century.  </P> <P> Among the program's sharpest critics were members of the Senate Environment  Committee, who demanded that Reilly reevaluate Superfund's course. The EPA  chief is to formally present the plan to the panel's Superfund subcommittee.  </P> <P> Its chairman, Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N.J.), and another Superfund critic,  Sen. Dave Durenberger (R-Minn.), both praised the EPA review for its  willingness to acknowledge the failures of the past.  </P> <P> "It appears that we finally have a team willing to get the Superfund program  moving," Lautenberg said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Enforcement Tools'  </P> <P> Durenberger added: "EPA needs to make more use of the powerful enforcement  tools in Superfund to get recalcitrant industries to pay to clean up the  pollution they have created."  </P> <P> The agency has always sought to persuade polluting companies to pay the costs  of hazardous waste cleanup. But it has tended first to use federal money to  clean up the sites and only later to seek reimbursement. As a result, EPA's  efforts to recover Superfund costs now lag far behind its expenditures.  </P> <P> The agency had previously refrained from an "enforcement first" approach,  warning that to rely on polluters might unwisely delay necessary cleanup  efforts. But Reilly insisted Wednesday that if EPA were to demonstrate a  willingness to penalize polluters aggressively, the threat would force  companies to clean up hazardous waste sites promptly.  </P> <P> "I really hope and expect that we're going to increase the pace of the  cleanups," Reilly said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladislav Kuzmichev (NEGA) report in the "Privatization" </F> column: "The Russian Stock Exchange President Charges Anatoliy  Chubays. Formation of a New-Type Political Party Begins"]    [Text] Yesterday Igor Suvorov, president of the  joint-stock company Russian Stock Exchange [RSE], held a press  conference. According to the RSE president, the upcoming  termination of the circulation of the voucher as a state  security has provoked special activity by the State Property  Committee [Goskomimushchestvo], in the person of Anatoliy  Chubays who, while the privatization program has virtually  collapsed, is trying to regain the initiative from the Economy  Ministry and usurp the power to regulate the securities market  through the infrastructure created by Goskomimushchestvo.    The seminar for stock market makers, to be convened on 23  and  24 April by the Securities and Stock Exchange Commission under  the Russian Federation president, in Suvorov's opinion, is in  fact the beginning of the formation of a new type of political  party. It is sponsored by the state itself as represented by  the ministries and departments which have discredited themselves  in the sphere of privatization.    The statement also noted that Mr. Chubays is trying to  resolve the problem of the enterprise directors corps not on an  economic basis but by regimenting its activity and assuming the  function of regulating investment flows.    According to the RSE president, the approach that is being  imposed objectively leads to crime because it envisions a  multi-stage scenario as a result of which the capital market  will move from an organized to a cash basis [ot organizovannogo  k nalichnomy], which corresponds to the interests of shadow  structures.</p>

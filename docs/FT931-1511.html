			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Clinton talks tough on Nafta side pacts THE SIDE agreements it is proposed to attach to the North American Free Trade Agreement must raise wages and clean up the environment on both sides of the US-Mexican border, President Bill Clinton said yesterday. Referring to the Nafta in language generally used by its opponents, he acknowledged that the pact was 'not simply a trade agreement, this is also an investment agreement'. Because it would make Mexico a 'much more attractive' investment, the Bush administration had negotiated rules protecting intellectual property and investment. 'Shouldn't we also, in the interest of both the economies of Mexico and the US, see that basic environmental standards and labour standards are observed?' he said. A few hours before the president spoke, his private sector and labour advisers were briefed about the progress of the new Nafta negotiations. One said labour union representatives now seemed hopeful they could use the opportunity to strengthen labour law enforcement in both the US and Mexico. The administration will try to satisfy labour in order to fend off attacks by Mr Ross Perot, the former independent presidential candidate, who is still loudly opposing Nafta. 'Its going to be a tough spring,' the adviser said. 'There is a problem between the US and Canada, the US and Mexico, and the administration and the Congress. Congress wants a lot of teeth. Our guys know wonder how they can get teeth when they know (the enforcement provisions) work both ways.' Mr Clinton referred in his press conference to a Bush administration foreign aid programme in which the US 'spent taxpayers' money to encourage American companies to invest in Central America who then went down there and actually lowered wages instead of raising them in the host company'.</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Tomkins sets aside Pounds 90m for integration of RHM TOMKINS, the conglomerate which took over Ranks Hovis McDougall last year, has cut 1,500 jobs and set up a Pounds 90m provision to integrate the milling, baking and grocery products group. Giving the first glimpse of how integration was progressing, Mr Greg Hutchings, Tomkins' chief executive, said RHM and the cut-throat bread baking market were exactly as had been anticipated. He said Tomkins' preliminary results in the year to the end of May would be 'in line with market expectations' and would continue a 'record of above average earnings growth'. Tomkins' share price has underperformed the market since January. Last week it fell further amid fears the group had underestimated the strength of the dominant bread producer, Associated British Foods, and power of large supermarket buyers. Yesterday's announcement suggests there will be no early end to the baking market's overcapacity and low profitability. Mr Hutchings said yesterday that not all the provisions were to be used to reorganise milling and baking, adding that the market would settle down to the current 'relatively satisfactory situation' in which ABF had about 36 per cent of the bread market and RHM about 34 per cent. 'I think it will settle down to those sorts of market-share numbers for ever,' Mr Hutchings said. Mr Hutchings said the dividend for the year would be no less than 6.35p on the enlarged capital. Tomkins' share price rose 13p to 236p. Details, Page 20 Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei uptrend broken by interest rate standstill SHARE prices fell for the first time in six days, despite the overnight record close on Wall Street, as investors waited for the March money supply figures, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average fell 181.47 to 26,798.90 on index-linked selling and profit-taking, after a high of 27,042.90 and a low of 26,699.67. Volume fell to 400m shares from 480m, with institutional investors disappointed by the central bank's decision to maintain high short-term rates. Declines outnumbered advances by 727 to 250 with 180 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 17.27 to 2,011.55 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.02 to 1524.10. Traders said that sentiment had not changed drastically. Mr Fujio Katayama at CS First Boston said that some institutions were realising profits, but added that he thought the downside would be limited. The electrical sector, popular on Wednesday, fell back with Pioneer down Y10 to Y5,040 and Sony by Y110 to Y6,680. Large-capital issues fell as Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, ruled out the possibility of an easing in monetary policy. Nippon Steel lost Y7 to Y482 and Mitsubishi Heavy declined Y10 to Y785. Financials lost ground on poor interest rate prospects, with Industrial Bank of Japan Y170 lower at Y3,650 and Fuji Bank retreating Y80 to Y2,630. Non-life insurances were also weak with Tokio Marine &amp; Fire losing Y40 to Y1,350. Daiichi Pharmaceutical lost Y90 to Y2,230 on reports that earnings for the previous business year are expected to fall for the first time in eight years. Other drug makers followed with Yamanouchi down Y10 to Y3,020 and Dainippon Y20 to Y2,250. Chiyoda, the plant engineer, was the most active issue of the day, climbing Y20 to Y3,020. Investors liked reports that the company had agreed to supply a Czech engineering company with de-sulphurising equipment. Nippon Yakin Kogyo, the stainless steel maker, rose Y45 to Y1,030 on buying by a big Japanese securities house which is promoting the stainless steel theme. The brokers have been trying to boost activity by recommending 'theme' stocks, but traders said that institutional investors were not interested in taking positions at current levels. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 80.14 to 30,075.98 on volume 44.3m shares. Constructions and textiles lost ground, while some high-technology stocks were firm on the rally on Wall Street. Omron, the electronic component maker, rose Y30 to Y2,350. Traders said that investors who had bought its Eurodollar-denominated warrant bonds, launched last week, were trying to raise the price. Sanoyas Hishino Meisho, the shipbuilder, rose Y60 to Y1,920 on strong earnings projections, thanks to strong sales of its playground equipment. Roundup NEW HIGHS for 1991 were almost commonplace yesterday, with Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and Thailand all building on Wall Street's rally and breaking new ground. NEW ZEALAND extended its rally as falling domestic interest rates helped fuel bullish sentiment. The Barclays index closed 21.64 or 1.5 per cent to 1,480.37. The index has now climbed by 11.4 per cent in the last three weeks. Turnover, inflated by a cross-trade of 40m shares in Magnum, a brewing and grocery group, jumped from NZDollars 35.7m to NZDollars 146.2m. Brierley Investments said that it was selling its 17 per cent stake, 50.6m shares in Magnum, retaining a half-share in a separate 54.1-per cent stake in Magnum through an existing joint venture with Asia Pacific Breweries of Singapore. Brierley rose 2 cents to NZDollars 1.11 in volume of 7.2m shares, while Magnum fell 7 cents to NZDollars 2.73 in volume of 40.1m shares. AUSTRALIA broke through 1,500 on the All Ordinaries index which closed 22.5 or 1.5 per cent higher at 1,513.1, its highest close since September and its sixth consecutive rise. Brokers noted active Asian buying as turnover rose from ADollars 237m to ADollars 320m. TAIWAN saw a peaceful ending, by local standards, to a 15-hour opposition demonstration demanding political reform. The weighted index rose 239.05 or 4.4 per cent to 5,690.11 as turnover rose from TDollars 58.7bn to TDollars 78.9bn. BANGKOK heard that five big banks were cutting a percentage point off interest rates and traded in heavy turnover of 5.52bn baht, particularly in property shares, as the SET index cracked the key 900 resistance level to close 14.23 higher at 904.69. MANILA closed higher in spite of continued profit-taking, which ate up much of the session's early gains. The composite index rose 10.43 to 1,091.36. HONG KONG made moderate progress, the Hang Seng index rising 12.25 to 3,699.26. SEOUL, still dejected, saw the composite index 6.66 lower at 625.89, its tenth decline in the last eleven sessions.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Big Blue turns mean and lean to survive recession: Louise Kehoe analyses the latest cuts at IBM and why investors welcome them With yet another round of large-scale job cuts and manufacturing consolidation, International Business Machines is desperately struggling to stem the erosion of its share of the world computer market in the face of market changes and a global economic slowdown. Yesterday's announcements represent a further shake-up at IBM which only 12 months ago reorganised its operations into 13 semi-autonomous operations. IBM will shed about 25,000 employees next year, resulting in a Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.8bn) charge against fourth-quarter earnings. This comes on top of the Dollars 5.4bn charges that the company already planned to take this year to pay for other cost-cutting moves, including 40,000 job cuts. IBM employs about 300,000 worldwide. The company will also shift resources to services, software and client-server computing and other growth segments of the computer market and away from its traditional areas of leadership including mainframe computers, data storage products and semiconductors. Revising these plans, IBM said it will give its business units greater control over their manufacturing operations and their facilities, with the 'freedom to do what they need to do', such as cutting employment, reducing plant capacity or setting up their own sales forces. Some of those business units may eventually sell their own stock, IBM said. The latest cuts were forced by 'declining sales of computer hardware, coupled with rapid improvements in technology and productivity, (which) have reduced our capacity requirements', said Mr John Akers, IBM chairman. The announcement by the world's largest computer manufacturer underscores the problems facing many multinational manufacturers as they confront economic slowdowns in North America, Europe and Japan. However, IBM also faces problems that are unique to the computer industry which is in the middle of a transition from mainframe-based centralised information systems to 'client-server' networks of desktop computers. Yet the severity of IBM's problems and the scale of its cuts is shocking and even drew comment from President-elect Mr Bill Clinton, who was chairing an economic conference in Little Rock, Arkansas. He said IBM's cuts illustrated the enormity of the pressures faced by US manufacturers. In particular, he expressed dismay that IBM will slash its product development spending. 'Product development will be cut by Dollars 1bn - the exact thing we don't want to be cutting,' he said. Investors were, however, pleased by IBM's announcement. 'We have been urging IBM's board of directors to take action to put the company on a more profitable track,' said Mr DeWitt Bowman, chief investment officer of the California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers). 'Frankly the situation is similar to General Motors,' he said. 'We prefer to see companies to address problems before drastic action is needed, but if it comes to that, then so be it. 'Only time will tell whether the latest round of cuts at IBM are sufficient,' he added. Like many Wall Street analysts, Calpers is far from certain that the blood-letting is over. In the strongest suggestion to date that IBM may abandon its 'no lay-offs' policy, Mr Akers said that if business conditions do not improve significantly, 'it is likely that some business units will be unable to maintain full employment in 1993'. Although his statement has created fear and uncertainty throughout IBM, it was welcomed by analysts who have long criticised IBM for not taking more decisive action to reduce its workforce. IBM said the 1993 workforce cuts will come from manufacturing and development organisations as well as support areas of its marketing and services units. It said it will also make further reductions in its manufacturing capacity, concentrating primarily upon the company's mainframe, data-storage and semiconductor business units. These are IBM's traditional areas of strength and are the underpinnings of its claims to being a technology leader. However, deteriorating sales of mainframe computers in particular, have masked the strengthening performance of IBM's mid-range computer, computer workstation, service and software businesses over the past year, according to industry analysts. Until now, IBM's mainframe operations had been sacrosanct. Now, the company is specifically targeting the underperforming unit for cuts. Similarly, the data storage business unit, called Adstar, which produces large capacity disk-drives for mainframe computers, will have to cut its operations. Semiconductors, one of the most capital-intensive segments of IBM's operations, will also be cut for the first time, indicating that IBM may rely more in the future upon outside suppliers of components. The cost and expense reductions will be focused on capital spending, development and sales and general and administrative expenses, IBM said. Overall product development spending will be reduced by approximately Dollars 1bn in 1993 and capital spending, which has already been reduced by about Dollars 1bn this year, will continue to be cut. The company also expects sales, general and administrative expenses to decline by about Dollars 1bn next year. 'The actions we are announcing demonstrate IBM's continuing resolve to deal aggressively with the difficult transition that is occurring in the computer industry. The result will be a stronger and more prosperous IBM,' Mr Akers concluded. In the short term, however, IBM expects unfavourable business and economic conditions to continue into 1993 and that fourth-quarter results will be below expectations. It may also have to cut its Dollars 4.84-a-share dividend. Any such cut would be sure to further depress IBM's stock price further, which yesterday hit a 10-year low, sinking Dollars 4 5/8 to trade at Dollars 58 1/4 yesterday.</p>

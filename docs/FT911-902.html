			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Hawke uses his iron fist on the waterfront: Australia's docks will no longer be a graveyard of good intentions IT TOOK nearly 19 hours of non-stop talking, and a whole packet of cigars, but Mr Bob Hawke, Australia's Labor prime minister, appears to have pulled off a deal which will clear the way for reform of the country's inefficient docks. The outcome was a much-needed political victory for the prime minister, who ran the risk of losing his reputation as a master of consensus. If the deal holds, he will gain a prize which has eluded governments for decades. The Australian waterfront is a graveyard of good intentions. At least 11 official inquiries have recommended reform since the Second World War, warning that high costs and bizarre labour practices were hampering trade. All have sunk without trace in the face of lukewarm support from employers, and implacable opposition from the Waterside Workers' Federation (WWF), the monopoly supplier of labour. In the union's eyes, every attempt at reform threatened a return to the pre-war system of casual labour, when foremen would throw each day's work tickets in the air for the strongest and quickest to catch, leaving the slow and the unlucky without work. To the employers, protected by limited competition and pooled labour costs, any attempt to rock the boat raised the spectre of a prolonged dispute with a union which could bring the wharves to a halt. The result is that Australia has some of the world's most inefficient ports, manned by some of the country's highest paid and most cosseted workers. Among other benefits, dockers are guaranteed a job for life, paid for travelling to work, and sometimes paid for not working. The dockers of Thevenard, South Australia, were paid ADollars 370 (Pounds 169) a week last year for an average of six hours' work. The economic costs are high. The Inter-State Commission (ISC), a government advisory body, estimated that Australian cranes move an average of 13.34 standard 20ft containers per hour, compared to an average of 24.72 at overseas ports with which Australia trades. The ISC put the cost of unnecessary labour and delays to shipping and cargo at ADollars 620m a year, but exporters' organisations say the cost is closer to ADollars 850m if lost business is included. The Hawke government set out last year to reduce these costs through a ADollars 290m restructuring scheme, to be funded jointly over three years by the taxpayer and the employers, through a levy on cargoes. The scheme was intended to reduce the workforce from 6,500 to 4,500 by financing redundancy payments averaging just under ADollars 100,000 each for 3,000 older workers, and training 1,000 younger recruits. The ISC calculated the scheme would increase productivity by an average of 35 per cent. But only one company, National Australian Terminals, has so far implemented an agreement, while others say negotiations with the union have been unproductive. It was against this background that negotiations on reform came to a halt when the Industrial Relations Commission, the statutory authority which oversees Australia's centralised wage-fixing system, put a national limit of 2.5 per cent on pay rises. The decision meant that productivity-linked pay rises could not be paid to waterfront workers without a special hearing before the Commission, which both sides ruled out. Mr Hawke stepped in because the deadlock threatened to undermine the credibility of the government's wider programme of structural reform, which is intended to increase Australia's international competitiveness. The deal reached under his auspices will deliver a flat pay rise of ADollars 12 a week to dockers, plus 6 per cent over the next two years, but only after reform agreements have been implemented, effectively locking the union into the process. The Commission will be asked to approve the deal to keep it within existing industrial relations law, which also regulates arbitration and the conduct of disputes. But Senator Bob Collins, the shipping minister, says the government is determined to make the deal stick, even if it has to legislate to create an 'alternative mechanism'. The immediate impact will be to force the union to implement an outline reform agreement relating to the Sydney container terminal run by Conaust, a P&amp;O subsidiary which handles about 50 per cent of container trade. The Conaust agreement is significantly tougher than the earlier agreement with National Terminals, and is likely to provide a blueprint for reform in other ports. However, the reform could yet be threatened by the refusal of employers to recruit the 1,000 young workers specified by the government. Mr Richard Setchell, Conaust managing director, says recruitment would be 'madness' in the face of a severe decline in trade caused by Australia's stagnant economy. 'We are not interested in hiring more people. Why would we overman the industry again?' he says. 'What the unions are saying is a nonsense. We will get rid of the people that we don't want; we are not going to go out and hire them again.' Hawke pressed on mining, Page 28</p>

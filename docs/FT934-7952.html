			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Brussels approves Ekostahl sale plan THE European Commission yesterday set the scene for today's crucial ministerial meeting on restructuring the west European steel industry by approving amended plans for the sale of Ekostahl, the state-owned east German steelmaker. The Commission also attached strict safeguard clauses to the plan, to dispel private steelmakers' fears about distortion of the market. Riva, the private Italian steelmaker, is to buy 60 per cent of Ekostahl from the Treuhand privatisation agency, and build a new mill with a capacity of 900,000 tonnes. But Riva has now also pledged to close one of its own east German mills, cutting capacity by a further 320,000 tonnes by mid-1994. State subsidies to Ekostahl will be reduced from DM883m (Pounds 350m) to DM813m. The Commission said it was now up to EU industry ministers, meeting in Brussels today, to tackle the steel crisis by unanimously approving plans for restructuring east German, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese state steel producers. Only the Italian government has failed to agree with the Commission on an acceptable balance between state aid and closures. Officials are sceptical about the chances of a breakthrough today, but if the Commission's proposals are implemented the EU's state-owned steelmakers will have to cut capacity by a total of 5.5m tonnes, and will be allowed to receive Ecu6.8bn (Pounds 5.18bn) of subsidies in return.</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UN hits at embassy attacks in Libya MOB ATTACKS on foreign embassies in Libya were condemned by the United Nations last night, as the international confrontation with the North African state intensified. Angry demonstrators assailed the embassies of countries that voted for sanctions against Libya. They ransacked and torched the Venezuelan mission, destroyed diplomatic cars and hurled stones through Russian and Austrian embassy windows. Jana, Libya's state news agency, said dozens were injured as demonstrators clashed with riot police who, it claimed, were called in to protect the diplomatic missions. The protests yesterday were against the UN decision on Tuesday to cut Libya's air links and impose other sanctions unless it surrenders for trial two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in Scotland with the loss of 270 lives. Diplomats in Tripoli said the protests, the first since western pressure was applied on Libya over Lockerbie, appeared carefully orchestrated. In New York, the UN Security Council denounced the 'intolerable and extremely grave events'. It directed Libya to ensure the safety of all diplomatic premises and their staff, implicitly rejecting the government's denial of involvement in the rampage. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, summoned and strongly rebuked Mr Ali Elhouderi, the Libyan envoy, in what officials termed a tense meeting. The UN said Mr Elhouderi offered apologies to the UN and to Venezuela. Mr Thomas Pickering, the US delegate, dismissed Libya's 'profuse apologies with crocodile tears', warning that stronger measures than verbal condemnation might follow if the Libyan authorities failed to restrain violence against foreigners. The UN statement protesting at the Libyan violence was described by some diplomats as just the opening burst in a confrontation with Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader. Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, a senior UN envoy, is to be despatched to Tripoli after the three-day Eid al-Fitr Islamic holiday this weekend to discuss the sanctions vote with Libya. In Tripoli, Mr Miguel Raidi, Venezuela's ambassador, said about 300 people had broken into the embassy compound. Petrol bombs were thrown into the building, furniture was wrecked and bottles of drink smashed. Venezuela protested last night at the destruction of its embassy and demanded an explanation from the Libyan government. Windows were broken at the Austrian embassy and there were peaceful protests near the French, Hungarian and Italian missions - the latter representing British interests in Libya. The Belgian embassy, which houses the US interests section, is located in a tower block in Tripoli and could not easily be reached by protesters. More than 1m foreigners live and work in Libya, including 10,000 Europeans. Britain and the US have advised their nationals to leave Libya before the imposition of sanctions. Jana said Col Gadaffi had urged restraint among Libyans but he was quoted as threatening to expropriate foreign assets in retaliation at UN sanctions. He told L'Europeo, an Italian magazine: 'The countries that have got satisfaction out of provoking us will find themselves quickly expropriated of many billions.' Business as usual, Page 3</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- The Korean National  Peace Committee published a statement Wednesday in connection  with the fact that peace and security of the Korean peninsula  face a grave challenge.    The statement resolutely denounces the maneuverings of the  U.S. imperialists and the South Korean ruling quarters to deploy  new-type missiles and provoke another war, branding them as an  outrageous challenge to the sincere efforts of the DPRK and its  people for peace and peaceful reunification of the country, as  an unpardonable criminal act of driving the Korean peninsula  into a whirlwind of confrontation and war.    The military moves by the U.S. imperialists and the South  Korean puppets remind us of the situation on the eve of the  Korean war in the '50s, it notes.    The shipment of Patriot missiles into South Korea by the  U.S.  imperialists and their stooges can be justified on no account,  the statement says, and stresses:    The entire fellow countrymen in the North and the South and  overseas should turn out as one in an anti-U.S., anti-war, and  anti-nuke struggle to smash by their united efforts the moves of  the United States and the Kim Yong-sam group to introduce  patriot and provoke another war, which will wreck peace of the  Korean peninsula.    If the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets dare  to  provoke a war against the North, the Korean people will mete out  a severe punishment to the enemy, demonstrating the dignity and  stamina of chuche Korea to the world.</p>

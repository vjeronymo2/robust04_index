			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Gildemeister to raise DM40m GILDEMEISTER, one of Germany's leading machine-tool manufacturers, is to double its capital base and cut its workforce in an attempt to stave off the impact of deep recession in what was once one of Germany's most prosperous industrial sectors. The Bielefeld-based group said it planned to hold a near one-for-one rights issue to raise DM40m (Dollars 23.6m) in new equity. The issue is to be underwritten by Westdeutsche Landesbank, the house bank to the state of North-Rhine Westphalia in which Gildemeister is based. In addition, banks will be forgoing debts totalling DM32m. Gildemeister plans to reduce its workforce by 380, the latest in a series of job-cutting measures which have taken the group total to just over 2,000 from 3,200 at the end of 1991. The group, which specialises in turning machines, added that it had devised a new strategy to adapt further to difficult market conditions. It is planning to reduce the number of products which it makes and to contract out layers of manufacturing to third-party suppliers. It gave no detailed picture of its operational situation, but the measures imply a further deterioration in business conditions in the second half of the year. At the end of June the order book was 45 per cent of last year's level. Last year the group made losses of DM77m on turnover of DM470m; the group has already warned that losses for the current year will be substantial.</p>

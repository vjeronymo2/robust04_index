			<p>CSO     [Text] At about 6:00 this morning, the International  Section of the Bureau of Criminal Investigation cracked a drug  case at Li-ti Building on Taipei's Liaoning Street, seizing more  than 100 pellets of morphine and heroin (weighing a total of  more than 1,300 grams and worth nearly NT$100,000 [New Taiwan  dollars]) and arresting seven Nigerian males on suspicion of  drug trafficking. One of the suspects, named K'a-hsi-mo, was  shot in the calf by police for resisting arrest and attempting  to flee. The wound, however, posed no major obstacle, and after  being bandaged in a hospital the man was bound over to the  bureau for interrogation.    Police had received tips that several foreigners residing in  the Li-ti Building, located at Number 27, Lane 63, Liaoning St,  had smuggled narcotics into the country in order to sell them.  So at about 6:00 this morning, an assault group comprised of 10  officers, including six from the bureau's International Section  and four from its rapid-strike and police-network groups went to  the scene to investigate.    Upon arrival, the police found the behavior of two black  males, K'a-hsi-mo and Hsueh-jui-k'o, who had come downstairs, to  be suspicious and so arrested and led them back upstairs to  ascertain whether or not they possessed drugs and to search for  accomplices. The police first searched Apt 603, located on the  fifth floor. It was occupied by four or five foreigners, who  turned out not to be what the police were seeking. The police  then led the suspects down a floor to continue the search.    Next searched was Apt 508, which the suspects had suggested  was suspicious, but no one was found there. The suspects then  indicated that 506, next door, might be the place. Thereupon,  they were left, under guard by two officers, in 508, while the  rest of the police went to search 506.    As the police entered that apartment, three black males  inside immediately threw a plastic bag like the kind used to  store narcotics out a window, where it landed on the balcony.  After subduing the men, the police discovered that the bag did  indeed contain drugs, many pellets of heroin and morphine.  According to the initial count, there were 56 pellets of heroin,  40 of morphine, and several of the latter loose or crumbled,  with a total weight of 1,300-plus grams, worth nearly NT$100  million.    After finding the drugs, the police led the three men,  K'a-wen, Ao-k'u Ssu-ting, and Na-wa Ch'u-k'a, out of the  apartment, which they then searched, discovering two more black  men, Ya-mai-hsi and Ou-ni Pu-hsi, hiding under a bed. Including  the first two detainees, Hsueh-jui-k'o and K'a-hsi-mo, seven  suspects were apprehended.    As the police led the seven downstairs, suspect K'a-hsi-mo  suddenly broke free and dashed downstairs. The police fired  shots in the air to halt him, but he continued his flight. The  police then fired at him, striking his right calf, which was  pierced by the bullet. Even so, the suspect continued to flee,  but the police finally subdued him after a chase of about 500  meters.    The police surmised that the suspects had smuggled the drugs  into Taiwan by swallowing them or inserting them into their  anuses. However, the suspects denied involvement in trafficking  and are still being questioned as of this noon. Nigerians  reportedly now comprise a major force in international  trafficking. In Thailand alone, nearly 800 are in prison for the  offense. The seven suspects in this case did not have any  passports in their possession, so efforts are still under way to  verify their identities.</p>

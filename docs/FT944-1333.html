			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Australian brush-off for cheap Russian wool sales Wool International, the Australian wool sales organisation, said yesterday it was unperturbed by the recent surge in wool sales by Russia, notably to China. However, the organisation said some large European textile companies, such as Benetton of Italy, had acquired supplies from Russia, and expressed hope that 'they don't make a habit of this'. The organisation, whose primary function has been to handle the sale of Australia's large wool stockpile, said it became aware of more Russian wool being used in China last September, when a large Australian trade delegation went to talk to Chinese buyers. Wool International said some Chinese customers claimed the Russian wool was available at about one third the price of Australian supplies. However, WI maintains the Russian wool is fairly low quality, greasy wool, and requires additional processing. It also believes that the surge in supplies will be short-lived. WI's relaxed stance was backed up by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics, the government-owned forecasting agency, yesterday. In its quarterly commodities report, ABARE said the sharp rise in wool prices this year and the purchase of lower-quality Russian wool by China in the September quarter were likely to have contributed to reduced activity by the Chinese at Australian auctions. 'Access to Russian wool is expected to be short-lived ..with Russian stocks estimated to have fallen to around 10,000-15,000 tonnes. This and the current low level of stocks in China are expected to encourage Chinese wool buyers for the remainder of the season,' it said. Australian sheep account for about 30 per cent of the world's wool production, and the commodity represents one of the country's largest export categories. Woolgrowers faced unfavourable conditions in the early 1990s, but the recent surge in wool prices has surpassed expectations. Although prices have been volatile in the most recent quarter, ABARE forecast yesterday that the eastern wool market indicator should average 790 cents/kg clean in 1994-5, compared with 547c/kg in the previous 12 months. One reason for the lack of serious concern about the Russian wool supplies is that Australia's wool clip is about eight times the size of Russia's. The ABARE report said Australian rural exports would fall by 10.4 per cent in 1994-5, as a result of the severe east coast drought which badly hit winter crop production. The agency said yesterday the fall in volume would be only partly offset in value terms by higher prices for some rural commodities, notably wool. The bureau predicted the value of rural exports would dip by around 5.5 per cent, to ADollars 18bn (USDollars 13.9bn) for the 1994-5 financial year. This is the first fall in value terms for four years. Wheat exports are likely to halve in value and beef exports could be down by 11 per cent. Sugar exports, however, are predicted to rise strongly while wool exports could be up by one-fifth. On the minerals front, the bureau is looking for a 2 per cent rise overall, to ADollars 30.4bn. This would leave the total value of Australian commodity exports, which make up the lion's share of total exports, at around ADollars 48.4bn for the year, compared with ADollars 48.8bn in 1993-4.</p>

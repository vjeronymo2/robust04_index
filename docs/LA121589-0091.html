			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FIRE KILLS 4 AT HOME FOR ELDERLY BUT CALM COURAGE SAVES REST  </P> <P> Courageous retirement home residents helped their less able neighbors escape a  pre-dawn fire Thursday that killed four people and injured 23 others, officials  said.  </P> <P> The residents, many in their pajamas, fled into the 19-degree cold as smoke  filled the six-story building. Those in wheelchairs or using walkers were  assisted by fellow residents and rescue personnel. Some TV cameramen also  pitched in to help with the evacuation.  </P> <P> "The smoke was horrible!" Louise Dudney, 79, said through tears as she sat on a  bench in her pink house robe at a skating rink being used as a shelter. "I  thought I couldn't make it but told myself, 'I'm going to make it.' I ran out  and started knocking on doors."  </P> <P> Marjorie Branson, 78, wrapped in a blanket, said: "I left my walker, got my  cane and everybody helped each other get out."  </P> <P> Resident fire captains assigned to each floor coordinated the evacuation, which  had been rehearsed in recent drills, and reported room numbers to sheriff's  deputies and firefighters when no one answered the knocks, chaplain R. C.  Wilson said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "What the Parties Want To Achieve </F> After 12 June; Five Election Platforms Under Eight Headings"]    [Text] This coming Sunday [12 June] when, depending on  electoral district, voters will be presented with up to 12  different lists of candidates for the new composition of the  Chamber of Representatives, it will be important that the people  are aware of each party's manifesto. In recent weeks, the  public has been bombarded with a overflow of advertising  material and statements about the programs of the various  parties, both by the media and by post, which is not exactly the  ideal way of gaining information.    To help our readers, we have therefore compiled, below, a  comparative analysis of the individual election statements of  the five relevant parties represented in the Parliament. While  this comparison is by no means complete, it will nevertheless  give an impression of what the various parties have to say on  different topics. We have restricted ourselves to matters which  are currently under discussion or which relate to fundamental  social issues.  <H5>  Christian Social People's Party [CSV] </H5>   Income Tax: Thinks isolated tax benefits are possible, if  necessary; stands by tax rehabilitation for married couples and  the family as opposed to the unmarried and wants Luxembourg to  keep the lowest indirect taxation in Europe.    Index: Is in favor of maintaining indexation in inflationary  times. Prospect of negotiations with the social partners on  index modulation for those on higher incomes if inflation soars.    Shorter Working Hours: Rejects legal reduction in working  hours; this is more a matter for unions and management at  company level.    Security: Wants to increase numbers of police by 200 and set  up additional police stations.    Ecotaxes: Wants to introduce ecotaxes (on sewage  purification, packaging, carbon dioxide products and special  waste); for products and goods for which consumer alternatives  exist, the ecotaxes should be entirely or partially immunized in  the index.    Hospital Insurance: Has own model of compulsory hospital  insurance (for domestic or hospital nursing).    Pensions: declares itself in favor of closer link between  the  two systems. Pensions should be further matched to the  development of wages and prices and contribution rates frozen at  their current level.    Protection of the Unborn Child: Wants to protect the unborn  child.  <H5>  Socialist Workers' Party of Luxembourg [LSAP] </H5>   Income Tax: Wants to replace tax reduction for children by  higher family allowance.    Index: Wants to preserve index but advocates a maximum  income  threshold for index adjustment.    Shorter Working Hours: In theory in favor of shorter working  hours, which should chiefly be negotiated in a collective  agreement.    Security: Wants to introduce planned law on increase in  numbers in police force up to the year 2000.    Ecotaxes: Says yes to ecotaxes if they have a controlling or  deterrent effect and are used for a specific purpose.    Hospital Insurance: Wants to introduce compulsory hospital  insurance which insures all those in need of care.    Pensions: Aspires to the progressive adjustment of both  systems, among other things by the introduction of a maximum  pension.    Protection of the Unborn Child: Wants to introduce a limit  on  the timing of abortion.  <H5>  Democratic Party [DP] </H5>   Income Tax: Wants to lower direct taxation in a few isolated  cases, make reclassification retrospective but increase indirect  taxation.    Index: No statement.    Shorter Working Hours: No statement.    Security: Wants to increase security forces and improve  their  training and organization.    Ecotaxes: Supports the introduction of a system of  specifically introduced ecotaxes.    Hospital Insurance: No formal statement; consideration  should  certainly be given to hospital insurance.    Pensions: Wants to critically analyze system of care for the  elderly. Three principles govern: 1. Consideration of  contributions paid in (for guaranteed minimum pension); 2. No  overtaxation of working force people; 3. Long-term financial  security.    Protection of the Unborn Child: No statement.  <H5>  Green Alternative Party/Green Ecologist Initiative List </H5> [GAP-GLEI]    Income Tax: Believe that there should be a system of more  socially fair individual taxation.    Index: In favor of standard basic amounts for index changes.    Shorter Working Hours: Demand reduction in working hours to  35 hours per week in the short term.    Security: Instead of one large central prison, want to  create  semi-open prisons.    Ecotaxes: Say that products which threaten the environment  and health should be subjected to an ecotax to make them  unattractive to manufacturers and consumers.    Hospital Insurance: Demand official hospital insurance, i.e.  hospital allowance graded in accordance with hospital  requirements.    Pensions: Advocate a standardized pension scheme which  insures everyone in their old age, irrespective of whether they  are in employment or not, and which prevents the loss of social  achievements.    Protection of the Unborn Child: Want exemption from  punishment for abortion.  <H5>  Action Committee for Democracy and Pension Fairness [ADR] </H5>   Income Tax: Declares itself in favor of an easing of the  indirect tax burden and a stronger shift in the tax burden  toward direct taxes.    Index: No statement.    Shorter Working Hours: Is in favor of voluntary reduction of  the working week brought about by the social partners in  companies.    Security: Demands increase in numbers of police and  extension  of the prison.    Ecotaxes: Would like to achieve a reduction in energy  consumption through gradual introduction of a carbon dioxide tax.    Hospital Insurance: Is only in favor of hospital insurance  (within the context of health insurance) if it precedes pension  reform.    Pensions: Demands the introduction of universal insurance  with equal rights and obligations for all those insured, in both  the private and public sector, with the introduction of a  minimum and maximum pension.    Protection of the Unborn Child: No statement.</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES: THE PIANISTS WHO TAUGHT THE BRIDGES BOYS  </P> <P> How did Beau and Jeff Bridges learn to look like they were pros for their film  roles as piano-playing brothers in "The Fabulous Baker Boys"?  </P> <P> Pianist Joyce Collins, who makes one of her occasional nightclub dates tonight  at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks, and Lou Forestieri, who backs singer Lois Bolieau  at the same venue Friday and Saturday, taught the Bridges brothers high-level  lounge piano from September, 1988, to February, 1989.  </P> <P> "Beau was a wonderful pupil -- he'd get up at 5 in the morning to practice,"  said Collins, who teaches at the Grove School of Music and whose latest LP is  "Moment to Moment" (Discovery). We took it piece by piece, starting slowly and  working up to tempo."  </P> <P> "Jeff is very talented, and has a fondness for all kinds of music, not just  jazz," said Forestieri, referring to the Bill Evans-ish piano Jeff Bridges  plays in the movie.  </P> <P> Both brothers studied a videotape that showed the hands of pianists Dave  Grusin, the film's musical director, and John Hammond. Grusin and Hammond  recorded the sound track, which was played back while the Bridgeses were filmed  playing dummy instruments (which look real but make no sound), a practice  called "sidelining." In one scene, however, it is Jeff Bridges playing a moody,  unaccompanied piece in an empty resort lounge.  </P> <P> "This music was very hard and they did a great job," said Collins, "and even  though they sidelined, they still had to know how to play. I think they looked  fabulous." No pun intended.  </P> <P> To offset medical expenses incurred by his wife, LaVerne, Bay Area pianist  Andrew Hill will play a solo recital Saturday at the Sherman Clay Steinway  Hall, 3330 Wilshire Blvd., at 8 p.m. Hill is highly regarded for such early  '60s classics as "Point of Departure"; his latest release is "Eternal Spirit"  (both Blue Note). Those unable to attend Hill's concert may send donations to  Cedars-Sinai Comprehensive Cancer Center, LaVerne Hill Patient Activity  Account, 8700 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles 90048. Information: (213) 384-1858.  </P> <P> The melodic-bent vibist Bobby Hutcherson, who has appeared on several Hill LPs  through the years, including "Eternal Spirit," also drops in from the Bay Area  for a quartet date Friday and Saturday at Marla's Memory Lane.  </P> <P> On the heels of the brand new "Ambos Mundos" (Landmark), a blend of acoustic  jazz and Afro-Cuban rhythms, Hutcherson will play "some old stuff and some new  stuff" for this date, which finds him working with his son, Barry, on drums,  bassist Larry Gales and pianist extraordinaire Billy Childs.  </P> <P> The vibist, whom many remember from his role in Bertrand Tavernier's "Round  Midnight," is particularly enthusiastic about Marla's Memory Lane, because of  actress/singer/owner Marla Gibbs. "She's very in tune to what's going on," said  Hutcherson. And when I perform, she always comes down to the club. That's a  pleasure."  </P></p>

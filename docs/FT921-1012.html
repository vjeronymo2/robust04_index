			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Company News: Consortium acquires PAL in largest Philippine privatisation THE PHILIPPINE government yesterday formally turned over control of Philippine Airlines (PAL) to a private-sector consortium in the country's biggest privatisation. PR Holdings, a consortium of leading local business groups, became the owner of 67 per cent of PAL after paying Mr Jesus Estanislao, the country's finance secretary, 7.5bn pesos (Dollars 308m), the first of two payments for the acquisition. The group had made the winning bid of 9.7bn pesos at the auction for PAL held in January. The second payment of 2.2bn pesos is due in June. PR Holdings was set up recently by Bank of Commerce, headed by Mr Antonio Cojuangco, president of Philippine Long Distance Telephone and a nephew of President Corazon Aquino, and by AB Capital and Investment Corporation, which is identified with the Soriano family that controls San Miguel Corporation, the country's largest industrial enterprise. Four other large commercial banks, a retirement fund for military personnel, two venture-capital firms and a cargo-handling company, are among the investors in the PR Holdings consortium. Mr Cojuangco, chairman and president of PR Holdings, yesterday said his group aimed to make PAL 'truly a world-class airline.' Among PAL's assets are un-utilised options to rich trans-Pacific routes. The sale reduced government holdings in PAL to 13 per cent, although two other state institutions, Government Service Insurance System and National Development Company, still own 15 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively. PAL employees will acquire 5 per cent of the remaining government holdings within the year under the privatisation. Last weekend, PAL marked its 51st anniversary by predicting net profits of 1.3bn pesos in the year to March 31, reversing losses of 2.3bn pesos in the previous year.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Truck and van sales down 7.7% SALES OF commercial veh-icles in the UK fell 7.7 per cent last month compared with May last year. Demand for new commercial vehicles has fallen for 32 months in succession, and sales last month were 50.5 per cent lower than in May 1989. Sales of new commercial vehicles fell last month to 16,024 from 17,358 a year ago and 32,393 in May 1989, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said. In the first five months of this year, registrations of new commercial vehicles were 86,331, 10.8 per cent lower than a year before. Last month sales of medium vans, the sector led by the Ford Transit, rose 3.5 per cent year-on-year, but this was overshadowed by a further fall of 13.7 per cent in light-van sales, and a further drop of 14.4 per cent in truck sales (above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight). Truck sales in the first five months of the year at 12,520 were 60.8 per cent lower than in the corresponding period of 1989. However, some commercial vehicle makers have increased their sales in spite of the recession. In the small-van sector Vauxhall has seen a year-on-year increase of 5.9 per cent in sales, boosting its share of the sector market to 33.8 per cent from 27.9 per cent in May last year. In the medium-van sector Leyland DAF and Volkswagen have increased their sales by 12.3 per cent and 14.1 per cent respectively in spite of a drop of 9.7 per cent in the sector. Renault's fortunes have deteriorated sharply with its UK sales of trucks over 3.5 tonnes plunging by 40.7 per cent in the first five months. However, Volvo truck sales have risen.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS JANUARY-MAY 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Volume    Volume     Share (%)    Share (%)                            (Units)  Change (%)  Jan-May 92   Jan-May 91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*                86,331    -10.8        100.0        100.0 Imports                      30,213    -13.2         35.0         35.9 Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) Total                        27,125    -12.7        100.0        100.0 Imports                       5,239     -9.3         19.3         18.6 Ford                         11,173    -18.7         41.2         44.2 Vauxhall (General Motors)     9,161     +5.9         33.8         27.9 Rover (British Aerospace)     2,210    -34.2          8.2         10.8 Peugeot incl.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Xu Wenzhong [1776 2429 1813], Du Nianxing [2629 </F> 1819 5281], Department of Animal Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural  University, Nanjing; Li Guangdi [2621 0342 0966], Wang Yuan  [3076 0997], Li Zaiping [2621 6528 1627], Institute of  Biochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai]    [Abstract] Today's new approach to promote animal growth is  the use of animal growth inhibition hormone (somatostatin, ss).  Because animal growth is controlled by the secretion of growth  hormone (GH), which is in turn controlled by the inhibition of  somatostatin. Since Chinese researchers failed their first  attempt to obtain a genetic engineering somatostatin subunit  vaccine through expression of somatostatin gene in E. coli, they  therefore switched their attention to the use of live vectors,  the vaccinia viruses. They first fused ss gene with HBsAg gene,  then used the ss antigen-carrying HBsAg gene to construct a  recombinant vaccinia virus. When the recombinant vaccinia virus  is used to directly immunize animals, the ss antigen expressed  in animal bodies induces immune response to neutralize the ss  antigen, and animal growth is therefore promoted. The vaccine is  believed to be the first genetic engineering product worldwide  for animal (livestock) growth promotion.</p>

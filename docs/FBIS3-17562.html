The ultimatum contains a demand to immediately lay down arms,  the Abkhazian military department reported to Interfax.    If this is not done by the end of March 25 then, in  accordance with the ultimatum, the Georgian grouping will be  eliminated. Security will be guaranteed to those who will lay  down their arms.    According to Abkhazia's Defense Ministry, in over two days  of  hostilities the Georgian side has lost 50 people killed and  wounded.    As Sukhumi reports, hostilities between Georgian and  Abkhazian formations in the mountains of the Gulripsh region  were resumed on Thursday [24 March] after two Georgian  battalions supported by armored vehicles tried to break through  the tunnels of the Kodorsky canyon. In the morning of March 25  the Abkhazians entered the village of Nizhnyaya Lata where the  headquarters of the Georgian grouping had been staying since  last autumn and then went to the mountains after the Abkhazi  side's defeat.    Meanwhile, Tbilisi asserts that the Abkhazian army is waging  punitive operations against the civil population living in the  mountainous villages.</p>

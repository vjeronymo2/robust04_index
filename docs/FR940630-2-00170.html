			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (e) The applicant has sufficient personnel or access to qualified experts or professionals to deliver the proposed level of technical assistance in each proposed service area in a timely and effective fashion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Transferability of results (10 POINTS). In rating this factor, HUD will consider the extent to which the applicant proposes a feasible, creative plan, which uses state of the art or new promising technology, to transfer models and lessons learned in each of its TA program's activities to clients in other TA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  Selection Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Once scores are assigned, all applications will be listed in rank order for each TA program for which they applied. All applications for the CDBG TA program will be listed in rank order on one list, all applications for the CHDO TA program will be listed in rank order on a second list, all applications for the HOME TA program will be listed in rank order on a third list, and all applications for the Supportive Housing TA program will be listed in rank order on a fourth list. Under this system, a single application from one organization for all four TA programs could be assigned different scores and different rankings for each program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications will be funded in rank order for each TA program by Field Office jurisdiction, except for national providers and others which cannot be ranked by Field Office jurisdiction. National providers and others will be ranked separately and funded in rank order for each TA program. Irrespective of final scores, HUD may apply the following criteria to select a range of providers and projects that would best serve program objectives for each program serviced by the TA funded under this NOFA: geographic distribution and diversity of methods, approaches or kinds of projects. HUD will apply these program policy criteria to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Ensure compliance with all statutory and regulatory requirements of each TA program;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Select providers that bring expertise in one or more specialized activity areas to strengthen or supplement the intermediary network in terms of the location (service area), types and scope of technical assistance provided;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Ensure adequate geographic coverage of urban and rural areas to maximize the number and diversity of clients served;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Ensure an adequate representation of approaches used by small and large TA providers or providers with special skills;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Ensure coverage of TA services for minorities; women, particularly women in the homebuilding professions under 24 CFR 92.302(c)(7); the disabled; homeless; persons with AIDS and others with special needs; and rural areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, HUD reserves the right to adjust funding levels for each applicant for each TA program as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Pursuant to 24 CFR 92.302(d) (1) and (2) of the HOME regulations, funding to any single eligible nonprofit intermediary organization seeking to provide CHDO TA, whether as an independent or joint applicant, is limited to the lesser of 20 percent of all funds (i.e., $5 million), or an amount not to exceed 20 percent of the organization's operating budget for any one year (not including funds sub-awarded or passed through the intermediary to CHDOs);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Reduce the amount of funding for an application based upon the appropriateness of the proposed activities or to meet statutory requirements; not fund all or portions of the activities proposed in an application; and/or determine an appropriate amount of funds for proposed activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Award additional funds to organizations designated as lead TA providers as discussed in Sections I(E) and I(F) of this NOFA;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Adjust funding levels for any provider based upon the size and needs of the provider's service area within each Field Office jurisdiction in which the provider is selected to operate, the funds available for that area, the number of other awardees selected in that area, or funds available on a national basis for providers that will be operating nationally, and the scope of the technical assistance to be provided;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) To negotiate increased grant awards with applicants approved for funding if HUD requests them to offer coverage to geographic areas for which they did not apply or budget, or if HUD receives an insufficient amount of applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on US A STRING of US data this week should help dealers to decide whether the dollar has a firm underpinning, writes James Blitz. The US currency is bound to affected in the immediate term by events in Russia and by anything that may have emerged from the weekend meeting of G7 finance ministers in Washington. But the most serious problems that the dollar has faced in recent weeks have been related to new perceptions that the US economy is having a difficult recovery. Tomorrow's consumer confidence figures for September, issued by the Conference Board, will therefore be looked at closely as a sign of whether US citizens are in a position to go out and spend. Last month's figure was 59.0 and the market consensus is for a rise to 60.00. Two other indicators could also the move the dollar. The final revision of the second quarter GDP figure is due on Wednesday: the market is looking for the figure to remain unrevised at 1.8 per cent. The National Association of Purchasing Managers report is also due on Friday: the market expects the figure to rise from 49.3 per cent to 50 per cent. In Europe, there will be a strong focus on the French unemployment figures due out on Thursday. The market is looking for a rise in the figure for August, from 11.7 per cent to 11.8 per cent. That could put more pressure on the French authorities to ease their intervention rate, currently at 6.75 per cent, if they do not do so today. Japan has a host of economic data but few of the numbers are likely to excite the markets there either. Economists say inflation remains subdued and expect little good news from the retail sales and industrial production numbers.</p>

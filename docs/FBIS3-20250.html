Previously, Esko Aho had said that  Finland's referendum should be held in September. Aho certainly  does not want to postpone the referendum any longer than 13  November because of the upcoming parliamentary elections in  Finland, scheduled for March 1995.    Yesterday, Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt's office did  not  wish to make any comment on Esko Aho's proposal. In Norway, the  parties in favor of saying no to EU membership are urging the  government to take Aho's request into consideration. Hitherto  Finland -- a country well disposed toward the EU -- has been  seen as providing excellent stimulus in the run-up to the  referenda in Sweden and Norway: The latest poll shows that 48  percent of Finns support EU membership, while 26 percent are  opposed. The remaining 26 percent are "undecided."</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'A' STREET WAR: NEIGHBORS AND NEUTRALITY ACT  </P> <P> Unbelievable! I just finished reading "The War on 'A' Street" (Life section,  June 15). Are the residents of that area upset because babies are being  destroyed in the nearby Doctors Family Planning Clinic? Oh no, they are upset  because caring Christians, at great personal risk, are there to rescue babies  and -- God forbid! -- they might see a picture of an aborted fetus.  </P> <P> Some residents do want the clinic to move. But is the reason because of baby  killing? No, they don't like the inconveniences the Operation Rescue protests  have caused. Unbelievable!  </P> <P> Sadly, I have to admit that this neighborhood may very well exemplify the  attitude of most Americans: Don't show or tell me what goes on during an  abortion; I don't care. If it doesn't directly affect my life, it's not  important. Ignorance is bliss.  </P> <P> I'm sure glad I don't live in that neighborhood. I wouldn't want an abortion  center near me, nor would I want those people as my neighbors.  </P> <P> Brenda Hester, Garden Grove  </P></p>

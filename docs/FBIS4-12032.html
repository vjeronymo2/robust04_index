			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Maryam M. Shahin] </F>   [Excerpt] Amman--A last-minute veto by Israel prevented the  return of three Palestinian expellees close to Palestine  Liberation Organization (PLO) chairman Yasir 'Arafat from  joining 43 other expellees who return to the occupied  territories today.    Scaled down from a list of 49 whom Israel was allowing to  return as part of an agreement with the PLO, the 43 expellees,  along with up to 25 family members, will enter the West Bank and  Gaza today via Jordan and Egypt.    "Twenty-seven deportees will leave Jordan for the occupied  territories on Tuesday," confirmed 'Umar Khatib, deputy chief to  the PLO's mission in Amman. "They will take their families with  them. The other 16 deportees in Egypt will enter Gaza from  Egypt, also on Tuesday," Mr. Khatib added.    Two expellees allowed to return to the West Bank by Israel  left to the occupied territories on Monday on their own and  another, Mursi Abu-Ghuwaylah, is in the United states and will  return later, said officials at the PLO mission in Amman.    "The list we received today did not include the names of  Akram Haniyah, Jibril Rujub and Muhammad Dahlan," said Mr.  Khatib.    The return to the occupied territories of Mr. Haniyah,  senior  advisor to Mr. 'Arafat on occupied territories' affairs, was  reportedly blocked by Israeli negotiators in Cairo. "The  Israelis felt that Haniyah was too senior, too close to Chairman  'Arafat to go in this early," one PLO official in Amman told THE  JORDAN TIMES.    Mr. Rujub and Mr. Dahlan are also close to the PLO  leadership  in Tunis, where they were until Monday night, according to PLO  officials in Amman. They were seen by the Israelis as "too  close to the leadership to return at this time," one official  said.    "The three men are still in Tunis. Therefore we don't expect  any last-minute changes," said Mr. Khatib.    Mr. Rujub is from Hebron, where dozens of Palestinians were  gunned down by a fanatic settler on Feb. 25. Mr. Dahlan directs  Fatah military operation in his native Gaza Strip from his exile  in Tunis.    All three men are expected to exercise influence on behalf  of  Mr. 'Arafat and his Fatah factions in their respective areas  once they are allowed to return home. According to reports from  the occupied territories the popularity of Mr. 'Arafat has been  waning since the Hebron massacre. [passage omitted]</p>

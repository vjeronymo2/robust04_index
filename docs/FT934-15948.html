			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Hopewell to lift dividend after 25% advance in net HOPEWELL Holdings, the Hong Kong property and infrastructure group controlled by Mr Gordon Wu, yesterday announced a 25 per cent increase in net profit to HKDollars 2.03bn (USDollars 172.5m) for the year ended June, up from HKDollars 1.62bn previously. The growth in profits came primarily from the sale of investment properties, which contributed HKDollars 2.1bn to operating profit compared with HKDollars 516m last time. Hopewell plans to increase its dividend to 34 cents a share from 30 cents. The group has been selling properties to fund its push into China and south-east Asia. Phase one of its Guangzhou-Shenzhen superhighway is due to open at the end of the year. The company plans to develop properties on sites adjacent to the road, and construct a second stretch from Guangzhou to the Macao border. Hopewell plans to float off its power interests as a separately listed company.</p>

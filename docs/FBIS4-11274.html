			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 25 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Four Cuban adults and a  three-and-one-half-year-old who entered the Canadian Embassy in  Cuba today to request asylum, have left the building on their  own accord after occupying it for eight hours, according to  embassy sources.    "We told them there was no possibility of their being  granted  political asylum under Canada's international policy," David  Morrison, secretary of the diplomatic mission, stated today. He  said the five entered the Canadian Embassy, which is located in  the Miramar residential neighborhood of Havana, at 1000 (1400  GMT) in a peaceful manner and left at 1810 (2210 GMT).    "After thinking it over," the occupants left the building on  their own and without incident," the diplomat said. Morrison  said those who requested asylum said they were doing so because  "life is very difficult" in Cuba.    Morrison said he personally spoke to the occupants, one of  whom was the father of the minor, who entered the Canadian  Embassy by taking advantage of a change of personnel. NOTIMEX  was able to confirm that the situation in and around the embassy  building is normal tonight.    Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina told newsmen this  afternoon that "these issues are connected to the extremely  difficult period the country is enduring and that in difficult  times some people begin to make rash decisions."    Cuba opposes all attempts to leave illegally, even by those  "who resort to requesting political asylum, which is the best  way to get some other country to receive them," the Cuban  foreign minister noted. Robaina said this phenomenon is  encouraged "from abroad," and he noted that "situations of this  type will continue to occur."    He added, "I believe the news in this country is no longer  that 10 people defected or 50 people defected; the news  continues to be the millions who are resisting."    Seven Cubans entered the Belgian Embassy last February  demanding permission to leave Cuba, but they left the embassy on  their accord a month later, after receiving confirmation that  the Cuban Government refused to grant them permission to leave.</p>

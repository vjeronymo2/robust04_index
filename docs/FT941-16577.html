			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / (CORRECTED) BT price move intensifies competition Correction (published 11th January 1994) appended to this article. The tariff changes announced by British Telecommunications this week intensify its fight for residential customers with Mercury and the cable television companies. In the process, its tariff structure is becoming more confusing than ever before. Gone are the days of peak, standard and cheap tariffs, with calls dependent on the time of day and the distance of the call. The main changes are as follows: 'Option 15', introduced two years ago, gives BT customers 10 per cent off call charges in return for a payment of Pounds 4 a quarter. A new weekend rate, introduced last month, sharply reduced the cost of most BT long-distance calls on Saturdays and Sundays. A 'close ties' tariff, announced this week, will give BT customers a 5 per cent discount on five numbers of their choice, in return for a one-off payment of Pounds 4.99. Mercury's policy has been to promise a reduction on BT's standard long-distance tariffs, while mirroring most of BT's special offers. It guarantees to undercut BT standard tariffs by 20 per cent for long-distance UK calls made at cheap rate; by 10 per cent for international calls made at any time; and by 10 per cent for UK long-distance calls made during peak time. To counter Option 15, Mercury has its own special deal for day-time callers. For a Pounds 3 quarterly fee, customers get 15 per cent off BT basic prices for calls made during standard and peak periods. As for 'close ties', Mercury has launched its own 'Yourcall' scheme, which starts in March. Mercury's version does not charge a registration fee, but, unlike BT's scheme, is not available for local calls. Mercury has no local network, and it charges a Pounds 10 quarterly connection fee. Connecting with Mercury can be done via a special phone with a blue button in most of the country or, in those areas with digital phone exchanges, by prefixing long-distance numbers with '132', once the user has registered with the scheme. The cable companies, which now boast more than 300,000 phone customers in urban areas, almost all levy lower standing charges than BT, and guarantee reductions on BT standard tariffs. Nynex, one of the largest UK cable operators, charges a quarterly line rental of Pounds 16.50, against BT's Pounds 20.16 (from next month). Yet in some cases it is cheaper to phone long distance on Mercury using a BT line than it is to take a cable connection. CORRECTION Mercury's residential connection fee is Pounds 10 a year, paid in quarterly instalments, not Pounds 10 a quarter as stated in Saturday's FT.</p>

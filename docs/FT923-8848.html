			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Books: Doves and doom DARK MIRRORS: A NOVEL OF PROVENCE by Gustaf Sobin Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99, 152 pages THE SINS OF THE MOTHERS by Frank Delaney HarperCollins Pounds 14.99, 509 pages WE KNOW that the central figure of Dark Mirrors is doomed from the opening line: 'On the last night of his life, Guy Fallows dreamt of pigeons.' The dream, in a mistral, involves a dovecote, and the stonemason who restored it about 40 years ago. The rest of the novel traces Fallows' involvement with that same pigeonnier, and reveals the events that lead to his death. The author, Gustaf Sobin, has lived in Provence for the last 30 years, and has published one other novel, Venus Blue, and more than 30 volumes of poetry. Dark Mirrors is poetic in just the right degree: the precision of its prose, the unusual way the story is told, and the sparse details given about its central characters combine to suggest multiple layers of meaning. There are parallels between the novel that Guy Fallows is writing about the pigeonnier and the reconstruction work carried out on it years before by Guido Stampelli. He had an obsessive affair with the woman who owned it, just as Fallows is involved in a differently obsessive erotic affair with the owner's daughter. One affair relies for its continuance on an unfinished dovecote, the other on an unfinished novel, 'stone by stone, syllable by syllable.' There are many other resonances, but they never intrude on a thoroughly convincing story. It helps that Fallows is also concerned with everyday matters such as good meals, without which no Provenccal novel would be complete, teenagers, of whom he seems to have a remarkable understanding, and alcohol: his ex-wife died of it, and he is a heavy drinker himself. Add to this an authentic account of the local community, and Sobin's concise evocations of the scents and sights of the Luberon, and one has the perfect antidote to the ersatz Provence pedelled by Peter Mayle. The Sins of the Mothers, set in provincial Ireland in 1925, tells the tale of the new schoolmistress, Ellen, an outsider from the city, and her marriage to the village schoolmaster, Thomas, a gunman hero of the 'Troubles' and now a pillar of the community. The marriage gets off to a good start but is soon threatened by Ellen's inability to trust her own instincts in matters sexual, and her blind obedience to her Jesuit confessor. Neither is the local parish priest quite what he seems, and she has also to cope with uncertainties about Thomas's past. This could have made an interesting short novel but the gold-embossed jacket and its 509 pages suggest that the publishers were aiming at a Bragg-Binchy blockbuster leading to a TV mini-series, and, sure enough, the proceedings are enlivened by a shooting, a hero in coma for months, and a near-miraculous recovery, thanks to the selfless devotion of his wife, Ellen.</p>

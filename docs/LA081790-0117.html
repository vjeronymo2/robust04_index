			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GINGRICH URGES TAX CUTS TO AVOID RECESSION  </P> <P> Breaking again with President Bush and other budget negotiators, House Minority  Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) called Thursday for big tax cuts instead of tax  increases to stimulate the economy and avoid a recession.  </P> <P> "My individual belief is that we ought to look at a broad collection of tax  cuts," Gingrich said in a telephone interview from his congressional office in  Newnan, Ga.  </P> <P> "It's my individual belief that we ought to look at a fairly wide range of tax  cuts that help the American family, that help home buying and that help job  creation."  </P> <P> His comments came roughly two months after Bush broke his "read my lips -- no  new taxes" campaign pledge and called for higher taxes to help cut the deficit.  Gingrich and other Republicans broke with Bush over the tax issue and House  Republicans passed a resolution opposing any tax increases.  </P> <P> Gingrich's comments also came three weeks before the White House-congressional  budget talks are scheduled to resume during the first week of September.  </P> <P> Negotiators have given themselves an unofficial deadline of Sept. 10 to reach  agreement on a deficit reduction package.  </P></p>

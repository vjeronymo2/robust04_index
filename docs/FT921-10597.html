			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Sales of houses 'fell by 7% to 1.24m last year' THE NUMBER of house sales in Britain fell 7 per cent to 1.24m last year, compared with 1.34m in 1990, according to figures published yesterday by James R. Adams, the independent research consultancy. Transactions last year were 40 per cent fewer than in 1988, when the housing market was at its peak. The figures underline the depth of the recession in the market, which in the past few weeks has seen renewed interest from prospective house purchasers. The consultancy said sales in an average year would be about 1.5m, or 20 per cent higher than in 1990 and last year. The figures were calculated from a sample of 12,500 transactions involving more than 20,500 individuals and submitted by a panel of more than 100 solicitors. They showed that house sales dipped sharply in October, November and December after rallying in the previous three months. Mr Jimmy Adams, chairman of the consultancy, said: 'It takes several months to complete sales after purchasers have agreed to buy. It is therefore likely to be early summer before we can be sure whether the current upsurge in interest has resulted in higher sales. 'The rally which took place last autumn probably reflected increased confidence following the end of the Gulf war,' he continued. 'This evaporated as people became more concerned about job prospects and the state of the economy.' According to the consultancy, sales fell 10 per cent to 301,581 in the final three months of last year compared with the previous three months. Sales were 12 per cent lower than in the final three months of 1990. The cash value of sales last year was Pounds 77.27bn compared with Pounds 80.08bn in 1990 and Pounds 114.92bn in 1988. The percentage of properties bought for cash has fallen from 19.1 per cent in 1988 to 14.2 per cent last year. Loans accounted for 71.3 per cent of purchases last year compared with 66.8 per cent four years ago. People moving to another region accounted for 17 per cent of house sales last year. The largest group moving between regions was from greater London to south-east England. The second-largest was those moving from the south-east to the south-west. The survey also showed that nearly three quarters of those moving paid more for their new home than they had for their old one, in spite of lower prices in London, southern England and in the Yorkshire area, said the consultancy. Most builders and estate agents expect the number of house sales to increase this year as buyers who have been staying out of the market take advantage of lower prices. Few, however, expect prices to increase this year. A survey of 27 house builders conducted by stockbrokers Barclay de Zoete Wedd found that nearly two thirds of the companies had seen an increase in activity since the new year. Seventy per cent of the builders expected sales to increase this year, while 67 per cent said house prices were unlikely to increase even if sales rose. BZW said it expected a gentle upturn in the market this year. The Adams Residential Property Index - 1991. James R. Adams Associates, 5 Langley Street, London WC2H 9JA. Pounds 2,100.</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Savers create Pounds 56m outflow - At a glance Savers withdrew more money from building societies than they deposited in June, creating a net outflow of Pounds 56m. This followed a net inflow of Pounds 700m in May and more than Pounds 1bn in April. The net inflow for the second quarter as a whole was Pounds 1.7bn, compared to Pounds 77m in the same period last year. The Building Societies Association blamed June's outflow on seasonal factors combined with the BT3 share offer, for which many savers withdrew money.</p>

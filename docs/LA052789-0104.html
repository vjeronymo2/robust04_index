			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JEWISH-CATHOLIC RELATIONS SOURED;  </P> <P> FEELINGS RUN HIGH ON NUNS AT AUSCHWITZ  </P> <P> Nuns praying silently for the 4 million dead of Auschwitz have provoked a  dispute that is souring relations between world Jewry and the Catholic Church.  </P> <P> Jewish leaders outside Poland demand the removal of the small group of  Carmelite nuns from a convent they established in 1984 in a warehouse attached  to the former Nazi death camp.  </P> <P> The Nazis are believed to have used the building beside the camp's outer walls  to store the Zyklon-B gas, which killed at least 1 million Jews at Auschwitz.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Site Called Unique  </P> <P> Jewish leaders say that by settling at Auschwitz the nuns have usurped a site  unique in Jewish history, the most symbolic of all monuments to the Holocaust,  in which a total of about 6 million Jews died.  </P> <P> The church agreed in 1986 to move the nuns by last February, but work has not  begun on a new convent planned to house them a few hundred yards away.  </P> <P> A Jewish group canceled a meeting in Rome with Polish-born Pope John Paul II  this month and demanded an "effective reply to tragic misunderstandings" over  the convent.  </P> <P> Father Stanislaw Musial, a Polish Jesuit priest who took part in negotiations  on the dispute, said, "Our Jewish friends can be sure the convent will be  transferred. It must happen soon because the issue could generate anti-Semitism  in Poland."  </P> <P> But Musial said work on the new convent could not start for months because land  to build it on has not been bought.  </P> <P> "The nuns must have a stable place to go to. They can't go from one temporary  place to another. We can't just play with the nuns as if they were Ping-Pong  balls," he said.  </P> <P> Many Poles want the nuns to stay on in the building, known as "the old  theater," arguing that it is outside the camp walls and that they pray for Jews  and Catholic victims alike.  </P> <P> Jewish leaders want Auschwitz to remain almost as it was when it was liberated  in 1945, a unique symbol of the Holocaust and a silent tribute to millions of  dead.  </P> <P> They say that although the convent building is outside the camp walls, it was  part of the camp because it was used to store the lethal gas. They are outraged  by the wooden cross erected by the nuns just outside the camp wall near Block  11 -- the "Death Block" in whose courtyard 20,000 people were shot to death.  </P> <P> "There is a 23-foot high cross standing on the largest Jewish graveyard in  history," said a spokesman for the World Jewish Congress in New York.  </P> <P> The nuns, who belong to one of the strictest contemplative orders of the  church, do not receive visitors and have made no comment.  </P> <P> Local feelings are running high, and residents angered at criticism of the nuns  sent a protest last month signed by 1,375 people to Slowo Powszechne, a  pro-government Catholic newspaper in Warsaw.  </P> <P> Musial said there were no intentions to mislead the Jews and called for calm.  </P> <P> "There is no plan to deceive the Jews. The Polish authorities are doing their  best to carry out the decision (to build a new convent), but everything takes  time," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Call for new R&amp;D audit rules THE DEFINITION of research-and-development expenditure in company accounts should be revised to make it more relevant to contemporary business, the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants has recommended. Companies are already required to disclose research-and-development (R&amp;D) expenditure under SSAP 13, an existing accounting standard, and may soon be required to provide details of other spending that influences future growth. The institute says in a submission to the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) that R&amp;D is defined too much in scientific terms, rather than in a way applicable to most businesses, and so the figure is not taken seriously by managers. It neglects types of investment common in service companies, including expenditure on developing computer software, innovation and training. The ASB is expected to release a reporting standard in the autumn that will include recommendations on R&amp;D and other 'revenue expenditure'.</p>

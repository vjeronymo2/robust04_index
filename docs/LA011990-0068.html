			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MANY CITIES FAIL TO MEET QUAKE SAFETY  STANDARDS  </P> <P> Fewer than half of the 29 cities in the San Gabriel Valley have met a state  deadline for complying with an earthquake safety law to make unreinforced  masonry buildings less hazardous, a report shows.  </P> <P> The number, included in a report released last week by the state Seismic Safety  Commission, reflects a 43% compliance rate statewide.  </P> <P> State law requires cities and counties in earthquake zones to notify owners of  brick buildings constructed before 1933 that the structures may be unsafe and  to adopt safety measures.  </P> <P> Only 14 San Gabriel Valley cities have fully complied with the law's Jan. 1  deadline. In some of the other 15 cities, a lack of building experts and a  number of historical landmarks contributed to their failure to comply.  </P></p>

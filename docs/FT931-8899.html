			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Hanson marginally ahead on 'slow improvement' in US LORD HANSON, chairman of Hanson, the US-UK conglomerate, said yesterday: 'As expected the new year has begun with lower operating margins than in the comparable quarter'. He said there were 'some signs of a slow improvement in the US, but it is too early to say this for the UK'. He was reporting results for the first quarter of the current financial year, which showed pre-tax profits up from Pounds 226m to Pounds 236m, helped by a Pounds 20m disposal profit. The group does not reveal operating profits at the first quarter stage, but analysts suspected that interest receivable was slightly lower and operating profits were down. Recession is still affecting many of the group's businesses. However, in the US Cavenham Forest Industries was seeing markedly higher prices for lumber used in the construction industry. Mr Martin Taylor, vice chairman, said prices were 30 to 40 per cent higher than six months ago. This could be a leading indicator of an upturn in construction However, any increase in demand has yet to work through to Hanson's aggregates business. Mr Taylor said another good sign was that DuPont, the leading maker of titanium dioxide, had removed its price discounts on the chemical which could help Hanson's SCM subsidiary. In the UK, profits at Imperial Tobacco were higher, he said, but otherwise there were no signs of 'green shoots'. The group's brick and aggregates operations were not seeing any upturn in demand yet. He declined to comment on negotiations in the US between the coal industry and miners. In the US, 44 per cent of the group's coal mining capacity has been hit by a strike since the beginning of this month. He said a judgment on the case against Costain over the sale of Costain's Australian coal mining business, was expected in the next week or so.</p>

Pienaar] </F>   [Text] Pretoria March 12 SAPA -- Events in Bophuthatswana  had been orchestrated by an "unholy" ANC [African National  Congress]/SACP [South African Communist Party]/National Party  [NP] alliance which should take responsibility for the loss of  life in the strife, Conservative Party [CP] leader Ferdi  Hartzenberg said on Saturday [12 March]. In a statement, Dr  Hartzenberg expressed the CP's dismay at the past week's unrest  in the homeland, whose embattled leader President Lucas Mangope  was a partner with the CP in the election boycotting Freedom  Alliance.    According to the CP leader, the ANC/SACP/NP alliance had  orchestrated a "communist revolution" in Bophuthatswana through  various ways. These included ferrying busloads of ANC activists  to the area, carefully planning strikes, instigating student and  youth vandalism, selective Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear of the  Nation, ANC armed wing] shooting actions and intimidation of the  homeland's security forces as well as a "massive SABC [South  African Broadcasting Corporation] and leftist media campaign of  disinformation".    "The killing of four Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner  Resistance Movement] members was an indication of the ruthless  manner in which the operation had been carried out", Dr  Hartzenberg said. He reiterated that the CP would never contest  the election. "To do so would make the CP guilty of complicity  in the enslaving of the Afrikaner Boerevolk [Boere nation] by a  communist government of national unity."    He further contended that the proclamation of 52 magisterial  districts as unrest areas was a ruse. "(Law and Order) Minister  Hernus Kriel's proclamation...is a selective enforcing of his  powers because he deliberately did not include areas where  unrest was happening. In not doing so he gave the ANC the  opportunity to continue their revolution unhindered."    The CP leader concluded by calling on all "Boere Afrikaners"  and those people who had become involved in the "struggle" to  regroup and consolidate. "The four Afrikaners who offered their  lives...should serve as an incentive to us to also pay the  highest price in order to achieve our nation's freedom in our  own fatherland. The struggle which our fathers started, will  rage until we die or vanquish," Dr Hartzenberg said.</p>

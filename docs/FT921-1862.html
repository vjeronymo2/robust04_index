			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Mickey makes the long march back to China MICKEY MOUSE is to return to China after a two-year absence - courtesy of the recently negotiated bilateral agreement with the US over intellectual property rights. Disney products had a run of success in China before 1989, the year of the crackdown on dissidents in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. A television show used to attract 300m viewers a week, according to Mr John Feenie, executive vice president for Disney Consumer Products, Asia Pacific. But the company decided to pull out when it felt that counterfeiting of Disney products had become endemic. Now, with the Chinese economy booming and a certain amount of protection from 'piracy', Disney has issued a product franchise to a Hong Kong company that will unleash Mickey and friends on what is expected to be a highly receptive market. Mr Feenie said Disney's theme park division was watching developments in China but there was no immediate plan to bring Disneyland into the Communist country. He said Disney products would be sold initially through 20 exclusive Disney sales counters in five mainland cities, with the start-up planned for children's day, June 1. This will coincide with the launch of a Disney magazine, and Disney television should return to Chinese screens before the end of the year. Euro Disney, Page 8</p>

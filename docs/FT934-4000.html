			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Former east German spy sentenced to six years Markus Wolf, the former east German spymaster, holds a bouquet of red roses as he enters a Dusseldorf court yesterday. Wolf, long known as 'the man without a face' was sentenced to six years in prison for treason and bribery during the cold war, Ariane Genillard writes from Bonn. The verdict was booed by his supporters and members of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), who saw the trial as a show of force by the west German justice against former east German agents. The sentence brings to a close a controversial seven-month trial which has called into question the validity of bringing to justice former east German spies. Doubts remain among legal experts about whether Wolf could be charged with treason against a country of which he was not a citizen - West Germany. Lawyers for Wolf, who is on DM250,000 (Pounds 100,000) bail, said they would appeal against the decision. He will remain free anyway until the constitutional court in Karlsruhe issues a verdict on the appeal of Mr Werner Grossman, his successor, after a Berlin court refused to send him to prison.</p>

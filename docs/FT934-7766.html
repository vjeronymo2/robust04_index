			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Statoil borrows Dollars 1bn through five-year loan STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, has raised Dollars 1bn through a five-year syndicated loan. The loan will re-finance two expiring revolving credit facilities totalling Dollars 600m and raise fresh funds for the company. Bankers involved in the deal said that the lack of high-quality corporate borrowers seeking to raise funds in the syndicated loans market had enabled Statoil to achieve aggressive pricing. Banks had been willing to agree to the terms in the hope that it would lead to more business with Statoil. Statoil said that 41 banks had been involved in the expiring facilities but that a core group of 19 banks were participating in the new loan. Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan are joint co-ordinators of the loan, which is due to be signed on November 24.</p>

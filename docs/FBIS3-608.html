			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The National Assembly has approved the government's  Social and Economic Program for this year. It also approved a  resolution that was read by Idalina Valente, Popular Movement  for the Liberation of Angola deputy to the National Assembly.    [Begin Valente recording] In its fourth meeting of the  second  legislature, the National Assembly discussed the government's  Social and Economic Program for 1994. The implementation of  this program is limited by the, war which continues to beset  large sections of Angolan territory. In those areas, the  effects of this program are likely to be felt only indirectly.  For this reason, whatever progress is made over the course of  this year to bring peace to Angolan territory must perforce  facilitate the implementation of measures and policies mentioned  in the government's program.    The National Assembly believes that the strategy contained  in  the Social and Economic Program will, for its successful  implementation, require a high degree of discipline and  perseverance concerning the implementation of planned measures.  It will also be necessary to adjust structure, organization,  and the government's team to the program's principles and  practices.    The National Assembly believes that the program which was  presented here is made up of a coherent set of macroeconomic  measures whose rigorous and disciplined implementation should  result in a significant short-term reduction in the inflation  rate experienced in 1993 and a slowing down in the pace and  level of national impoverishment, which has caused the citizens  to face a serious increase in the cost of living. Nonetheless,  only the continued implementation of that program and the  correct integration into the macroeconomic program of the Public  Investment Plan, as well as of sectorial programs can lead to  medium term growth in production levels, which in turn should  allow the economy to stabilize, help improve consumption levels,  and ensure greater well-being for the people.    In those terms and under the terms of Paragraph B of Article  88 and of Paragraph 6 of Article 92 of the Constitutional Law,  the National Assembly hereby issues the following resolution:    Point: The Social and Economic Program for 1994 is hereby  approved. It was presented by the government, and it carried  the following recommendations:    A. By 10 May, the government must have presented to the  National Assembly the Public Investment Program and sectorial  plans to function as management tools for the 1994 program;    B. As its basis for drawing up the Public Investment Plan,  the government must seek a constant percentage sharing in  accordance with the program that has been approved. The  government must, however, make every effort to increase the  forecast amount of 2.5 trillion new kwanzas by reducing expenses  arising from diplomatic representation, scholarships abroad, and  work trips, among other things;    C. With regard to sectorial plans, they must reflect the  Social and Economic Program's economic and administrative  decentralization policies; they must reflect a correct  adjustment of sectorial goals to the resources planned by  General State Budget for 1994 and present a timetable for their  implementation;    D. The continuation of the process for restructuring the  state entrepreneurial sector will be linked to the National  Assembly approving the Law on Privatization. [end recording]    This resolution approved with 102 votes in favor, none  against, and 10 abstentions.</p>

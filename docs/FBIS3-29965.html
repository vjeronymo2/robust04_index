He said soldiers are not businessmen and  therefore do not have barter skills. The army commander's frank  remark reflects a problem between the military and the  government. That problem is lack of good coordination, which  has created a gap of understanding and brought on reports about  the military's anxiety over the government's policy.    Frankly, the cabinet's decision on arms barter is worthy of  support. Apparently, there is flexibility in the policy's  principle. It is unlikely that the policy requires that a  billion baht worth of rice is to be bartered straight for an  aircraft of the same value. It probably means that the  government selling the plane should facilitate the purchase of  our agricultural products.    A recent example comes to mind. The Air Force wants to buy  Italian G-222 transport planes and the Italian side is coming  here to pursue the matter. The government should inform the Air  Force that Italy has enjoyed considerable trade surplus with us  and has set a very high standard for import of agricultural  products. This virtually negates any chance for any Thai  imports. Now that the Air Force wants Italian planes, the Thai  Government should be able to bargain with the Italian Government  to open its market for Thai agricultural products.    This is a principle in negotiating arms barter. The issue is  coordination between the government, comprising the officials  concerned -- the commerce, agriculture, foreign and defense  ministers -- and the military services. Therefore, the  government should send its representatives to meet with the  armed forces to explain the government's principle. The absence  of such meeting has created an issue, as reflected in the  remarks by the supreme commander and the army commander.    Coordination is important and the government must quickly  bring it about. Without it there will be misunderstanding, as  is in the case of the arms barter issue. The absence of  coordination will lead to skepticism and confusion even in  purchase of small amount of arms, such as whether barter is to  be applied in purchase of artillery shells. A consultation will  eliminate misunderstandings. The absence of coordination is what  caused the military officials to express their skepticism.</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SARA LEE BIDS $321 MILLION FOR ATHLETIC WEAR MAKER  </P> <P> Sara Lee Corp. carved out a bigger piece of the consumer goods pie Monday,  agreeing to buy Champion Products Inc., in a deal that values the athletic-wear  company at about $321 million.  </P> <P> Best known for its frozen baked goods, Sara Lee is expanding its non-food  operations. It said it will soon begin a tender offer for all outstanding  Champion Products shares at $77 each, beating out a $61-a-share bid from  Phonicam Inc.  </P> <P> Champion stock climbed $12.125 to close at $75.75 in American Stock Exchange  trading Monday.  </P> <P> Rochester, N.Y.-based Champion Products makes athletic, recreational and  leisure wear products that are sold to educational institutions, including  college bookstores. It reported sales of $219 million in 1988.  </P> <P> A Champion Products official said the company has 4.17 million shares  outstanding on a fully diluted basis, which would make the Sara Lee offer worth  $321 million.  </P> <P> The purchase would be the latest in a string of small acquisitions by Sara Lee,  which has annual sales of more than $10 billion. Last week, it announced plans  to buy Hygrade Foods Products Corp., a Southfield, Mich.-based meat processor,  for $140 million from Britain's Hanson PLC.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Owns Hosiery Maker  </P> <P> "Sara Lee is absolutely in an acquisition mode," said securities analyst Janet  Mangano of Josephthal &amp; Co. Mangano said the company's recent moves were  strategically logical because "you can do only so much through product  development and by adding new capacity on your own."  </P> <P> Last year, the company struck a deal to buy hosiery maker Adams-Millis Corp.  for about $80 million.  </P></p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Books: Intellectual? It's all academic SECULAR VOCATIONS by Bruce Robbins Verso Pounds 34.95/Pounds 11.95, 288 pages RECENT YEARS have seen a spate of books on the subject of intellectuals and their place in society. Some are hostile; John Carey in his recent Intellectuals and the Masses launched a swingeing attack on intellectuals, alleging crimes ranging from snobbery to Fascism in their attitudes to less literary folk. Others debate the political responsibility of intellectuals, yet others the alienation of intellectuals from society, either because they are disgusted by its philistinism, or because society fails to recognise their value. In this book Bruce Robbins joins the debate, but with a particular aim in view. 'The near total absorption of intellectual life by the universities,' say some critics, 'marks the decline, if not the obliteration, of the 'intellectual' as a social type.' Others add, 'Today non-academic intellectuals are an endangered species.' The point is that intellectual life has been increasingly professionalised in the 20th century. It has turned into a job; in fact, a university job. This means that intellectual activity has become specialised and compartmentalised, and the compartments do not communicate. Not only is there little contact between academic specialisms, but - worse - there is little between the academy and the surrounding society. This means that society has lost the benefit of having independent critics in its midst, publicly leavening the general debate by their oblique perceptions and their powers of opposition. The answer Robbins gives these critics is uncompromising. It is that there is nothing amiss with the academic professionalisation of intellectual life. He argues that such terms as 'professionalisation' and 'specialisation' mislead us, serving as terms of art in the argument of those who seek to establish that there are no intellectuals left. But his intention is clear. It is to protect the claim of university academics to be the continuers of the intellectual tradition. Robbins proceeds by exploring the interplay of culture and theory, the transformation of the academies, and examples - afforded by Edward Said and Raymond Williams - of intellectuals embodying 'the meaningful life', in these two cases by working in 'exemplary fashion' both inside and outside the academy. But as the book unfolds one sees that Robbins' prime interest is the status of the academic literary critic, and a dismaying feeling grows that the debates he reports are merely the internal squabbles of a breed of professors anxious about their role. Academic literary critics have come to see themselves as cultural commentators, and as usurpers of the traditional position of the philosopher in society as critic and shaper of ideas. It is ironic therefore that they do so in a manner, and in a language, unappealing if not incomprehensible to the public whose applause they seek. Robbins' view, roughly put, is that intellectuals are alive and well in the academy. I only partially agree. I think they are alive and well outside it too: in the media, arts and theatre, in the professions, Civil Service and City. A measure of this is the surprisingly wide readership that exists for serious newspapers and books, and the discriminating audiences that fill theatres and concert halls every night. It is a pretension to think that ideas are only taken seriously in universities. If anything, in the current climate of demoralisation and dismantling of the universities, new ideas and genuinely radical criticism are far more likely to come from the pub than the academy. As this implies, academics and intellectuals are not co-extensive groups. There are many non-intellectuals in university posts, narrow clerks of learning whose juices, if ever they flowed, have run dry. Of course, scholarly excellence is the essence of academic work. But one wishes to see imagination and creativity in addition, and an alert sense of the contribution that the recondite can make to the everyday. Such gifts are sometimes lacking in the academy, and nothing Robbins says convinces me otherwise. By contrast, the social debate at large is flourishing. What we should therefore seek is a reunion of the best in both the academy and the wider bazaar of ideas. One way of doing so is to open university doors. Why should members of the public not attend lectures and seminars? Why should universities not invite more playwrights and painters to lecture? Why should companies and the Civil Service not give their staff paid sabbaticals to go (back) to university, to return refreshed and full of ideas? Such developments would help remove altogether the necessity for hand-wringing over the nature and status of intellectuals in society.</p>

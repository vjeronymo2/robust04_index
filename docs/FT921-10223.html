			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Provision pulls Waste Management into the red WASTE Management, the larg-est US waste disposal company, yesterday reported a fall in 1991 profits to Dollars 606.3m from Dollars 684.8m a year earlier. However, the reduction comes after a special after-tax charge of Dollars 181m - which represents the company's estimate of its share of future liabilities relating to the clean-up of old disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Liability and Compensation Act. The company warned last month that the clean-up charge would be taken in the fourth quarter, and yesterday its shares gained  1/4 to Dollars 46 1/8 . It said profits before this extraordinary item increased from Dollars 709.3m to Dollars 787.3m, on revenues up from Dollars 6bn to Dollars 7.55bn. In the fourth quarter, Waste Management recorded a profits improvement from Dollars 195.6m to Dollars 207.5m, again before the special charge. Earnings per share for the year - which saw Waste Management acquire Wimpey Waste Management in the UK via a joint venture partnership with Wessex Water  -fell from Dollars 1.44 to Dollars 1.23, with the special charge accounting for approximately 37 cents. The company noted that Chemical Waste Management, its 76 per cent-owned subsidiary, had already reported lower fourth-quarter earnings and also saw remedial work slow down as clean-up projects were deferred until this year. However, it added that Waste Management of North America, Wheelabrator Technologies, Waste Management International and The Brand Companies - all owned directly or indirectly by Waste Management - had improved results in the fourth quarter.</p>

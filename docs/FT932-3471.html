			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / BAe benefits as it brings its head out of the clouds: A change of culture at the UK's biggest export manufacturer MR JOHN CAHILL flew in last week to his first Paris Air Show as chairman of British Aerospace on a regular British Airways flight. 'I'm a small businessman and I simply cannot justify coming here on a private BAe 125 jet at a cost of Pounds 6,000 an hour,' he said, watching the noisy flight displays from BAe's entertainment chalet at the world's biggest air show. Since he was brought in to lead the UK's biggest export manufacturer a year ago, Mr Cahill has sought to instil the same sort of 'hair shirt' mentality that prevailed in his old company, the BTR industrial conglomerate. Although the company is by no means out of the woods, and has been buffeted like the rest of the industry by recession in the civil aircraft market and contraction in the defence business, it had more to celebrate in Paris than most aerospace companies. It was one of the few to announce a big order: for Hawk trainer-light attack aircraft worth Pounds 500m from Indonesia. Its shares climbed over the 380p mark for the first time since its ill-fated rights issue 18 months ago, which provoked a savage boardroom battle, the resignation of the chairman, Professor Sir Roland Smith, and ultimately the arrival of Mr Cahill. The company also returned in the FT-SE 100 index after a nine-month absence. Last September, BAe's shares hit a low of 107p. On Friday, they closed at 410p. This sharp rise is making Mr Cahill a little nervous. 'It's getting too hot now: I'd hoped the share price wouldn't go through 400 so quickly,' he said. For Mr Cahill the reason the company is returning to favour in the City is simple. 'We simply had to establish credibility: we had to tell the world what we were doing and then deliver the goods.' The strategy itself has not changed. What has changed, according to Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, is the internal chemistry. 'No one guy can lead a company of this size which is very diverse and has a big political element because governments are our customers. But to be successful we had to have a team of people who were able to work together,' he explained, adding that this had not been the case under Sir Roland. But Mr Cahill has quietly brought a change of attitude and culture in the company. From the beginning, he sought to introduce at BAe the same concept of open management, accountability, transparency and tight cost controls that BTR adopted. In the early 1960s, Mr Cahill recalled, BTR had a bad habit of always predicting more than it could achieve. The result was that the company lost money twice in three years. 'We then sat down and said: we must be predictable, reliable, an open book. BAe for many years was a very private company and we have to show that we have nothing to hide,' he said. BAe's basic strategy is 'to support and protect' its main defence business, he emphasised. To do this, the company, which has been cash negative in the last few years, had to become cash positive again. 'Cash is our mission. Our plan is to get overheads down, turn inventories back into cash and sell off non core assets,' he explained. Three significant developments have recently helped revive confidence in the company's Pounds 5bn a year defence business: the UK government's commitment to the European Fighter Aircraft; Saudi Arabia's intention to go ahead with a new order for an additional 48 Tornado combat aircraft; and the negotiations to merge BAe's guided missiles activities into a joint company with those of the French Matra group. In the commercial aircraft sector, BAe is focusing on its 20 per cent stake in the European Airbus airliner programme. After establishing a joint venture company with Taiwan Aerospace for its loss-making regional jet business, the company is now seeking a similar partnership with other international manufacturers for its Jetstream and ATP turbopropeller regional aircraft activities which have been regrouped at Prestwick in Scotland. And two weeks ago, it sold for Pounds 250m its BAe 125 executive jet business to Raytheon of the US. The decision helped the City of London realise the true worth of the company, Mr Cahill said. 'The corporate jet business with Pounds 300m a year turnover and Pounds 25m pre-tax profits represented only 3 per cent of our total sales. We sold it for more than a quarter of our market capitalisation.' In any case, the trend in the hard-pressed commercial aircraft sector as well as in the military was towards ever-increasing consolidation and collaboration. 'We have to rationalise and we won't be building aeroplanes on our own any more,' Mr Cahill said. 'It is almost inevitable that in the US there will be two military aircraft and one large commercial aeroplane manufacturer, against just the possibility of one of each in Europe,' Mr Evans forecast. In the longer term, a similar consolidation is likely to take place in the car business, according to Mr Cahill. At present Rover remained an important component of his group. 'The objective is to get Rover into profit and we hope to see Rover moving into profit this year,' he said. But what will eventually happen to the car group? 'Who knows?' said Mr Cahill. 'At the moment we have no plans, but I could see the car industry concentrated one day into six companies: two in the US, two in Japan, two in Europe - and one will not be called Rover.' Although he believes the company has now found some badly-needed stability, Mr Evans warned that the process of restructuring was by no means over. 'We are now finally getting the organisation up and running again. But closures and redundancies have also created a lot of uncertainties and has made the job even more complex,' conceded Mr Evans. Over the last three years, BAe has shed about 45,000 jobs. 'And the process is not over,' warned Mr Evans. But for a short moment at least, BAe and its 'wise old sage of a chairman who has seen it all before', as Mr Evans described him, are having a party in Paris.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Trustees told: do your job properly - A High Court rebuke to NatWest - and its implications THE HIGH Court last month fired a shot across the bows of trust fund managers. Although Lord Justices Dillon, Staughton and Legatt decided unanimously in the Court of Appeal that the National Westminster bank had not been in breach of its duty as administrator of a will trust, they made several stinging criticisms. Lord Justice Staughton said the bank had fallen 'woefully short' of maintaining the real value of the fund, let alone matching the average increase in the price of ordinary shares. He added that the trustees had failed to conduct a regular and periodic review of the investments and spoke of 'incompetence and idleness.' Lord Justice Dillon said the bank had 'little to be proud of' in its handling of the fund. But the most damning comment came from Lord Justice Legatt, who declared that "no testator would choose the defendant bank for the effective management of his investment." The facts are simple. A man named Nestle died in 1922, leaving an annuity fund of about Pounds 37,000 and two subsidiary funds of about Pounds 5,000 each. He appointed the National Provincial Bank (later incorporated into NatWest) to look after them as a trustee for his family. In 1986, when the trust ended, a woman descendant was paid Pounds 269,203 as the sole beneficiary. But she claimed this was not enough and that NatWest had misunderstood its powers of investment. She said the bank had put money only into fixed-interest securities and bank and insurance shares rather than in a wider range of equities which probably would have performed better through the 1970s and '80s. Case law on the liability of trustees for breach of their investment duties has remained relatively static since the last century. In 1886, Lord Lindley said the duty of a trustee was to be just as careful as an ordinary prudent man when investing for the benefit of others. In 1961, the Trustee Investments Act set out in further detail the duties of trustees. They should: Diversify investments so long as this suited the circumstances of the trust. Decide if particular investments were suitable. Get and consider proper written advice about whether the investments were satisfactory. Review the investments at regular intervals to decide if they should be kept or changed. The woman, who had already lost before Mr Justice Hoffman in the High Court, lost again because the judges ruled she had failed to show that the fund's value had performed less well than it would have done if the bank had not misunderstood the investment clause. They said the fund had kept pace with the cost of living and had outperformed certain unit trusts. It had not kept up with the FT-SE share index, but it was accepted that this could be difficult for any investment manager to achieve. So why, then, were the judges so critical of the trustees? Possibly because the fund had increased eight times under NatWest's management; thus, despite the bank's poor administration, the judges could not find that it was liable for breach of trust. The case might not have been the best one to bring before the Court of Appeal, since the fund had performed reasonably well. But the judges did feel it was appropriate to warn all professional trustees that, if they were charging a fee, they should provide a professional service; and that any trustee which failed to preserve a fund's capital value through incompetence and idleness might not treated in the same way as the trustee in this case. The decision is, however, disappointing for both settlors and beneficiaries who might be left feeling they cannot get redress from the courts for anything other than a disaster resulting from incompetence and idleness. A trustee may be judged by absence of default rather than lack of success. This puts the onus back on settlors and beneficiaries alike to keep an eye on their trustees' performance. So what can a settlor do to keep his trustees on their professional toes? Certainly, if you have not yet set up a trust, there is nothing to stop you taking advice on how to impose special duties and obligations on trustees. In addition, you could reserve power in the trust deed, either for yourself or a third party, to remove the trustees without explanation. (You could find, however, that trustees would resist these clauses or refuse to be a trustee at all). For trusts already in existence, it might not be possible to add such provisions. If you are a beneficiary, you should first ask your trustees for information on how they are administering the fund. If you are not happy with this, you should then remind them of their investment duties. Only if this fails should you consider removing them, although this could mean going to the courts - which could be time-consuming and costly. Even then, success is not guaranteed.

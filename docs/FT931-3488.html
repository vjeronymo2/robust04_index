			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: CRA makes hostile bid for Cail COAL and Allied Industries (Cail) is likely to wait two weeks before responding to a hostile ADollars 11.50-a-share takeover offer from CRA, the Australian mining group, Mr Tony Haraldson, managing director, said yesterday. Mr Haraldson said directors would seek an independent valuation of the company before responding to the offer, which values Cail at ADollars 716m (USDollars 511m). CRA owns 40.4 per cent of Cail following a ADollars 7.85 a share offer in March 1991, and the purchase of a further 2.9 per cent stake yesterday morning. The offer is conditional on approval by Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board because CRA is 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: CGT need not be paid Where a holding of shares included in a person's estate shows a considerable capital gain, is this deducted from the value of the shares (less exemption Pounds 5,800) for inheritance tax purposes? Alternatively, if the shares are willed to a beneficiary, is the liability for CGT also transferred? The answer to both questions is no. Capital gains tax on death was abolished in 1971 (although there is an income tax charge on death in respect of those types of capital gain which are treated as income). Ask your tax office for the free leaflet IR45 (What happens when someone dies). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

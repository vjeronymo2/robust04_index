			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Americanization of the KGB </F> Continues"]    [Text] MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has learned from reliable  sources that the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service  [FCS] will be reorganized once again.    It is planned to split the FCS and to subordinate the  splinters to various ministries. For instance, the main service  -- the Administration of Counterintelligence Operations -- will  be renamed the Federal Administration of Investigations and  subordinated to the Justice Ministry. The Military  Counterintelligence Service is to become part of the Defense  Ministry General Staff as a main administration. The Economy  Ministry will also acquire its own counterintelligence service.  It will be the Economic Counterintelligence Administration.    It is planned to strip military ranks from staffers of the  new special services to be set up on the basis of the FCS  (except for the military counterintelligence service). Instead,  counterespionage system officers will have the following  positions: agent, agent second class, special agent, and so  forth.    In the course of reform it is planned to cut down the FCS  central staff so as to strengthen the special service's regional  branches at its expense. It is even possible that the entire  central staff of the former FCS may move from the capital to  nearby areas of Moscow Oblast. The reorganization of the FCS  will be completed within the next six months.</p>

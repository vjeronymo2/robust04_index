This proposal would require inspection to detect cracking of certain fuselage longitudinal lap joints, repair of any cracking found, and replacement of the countersunk fasteners in those laps joints with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protruding head fasteners. This proposal is prompted by a structural reassessment of Model 747 series airplanes. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent skin cracking in the longitudinal lap joints of certain stringers, which can lead to rapid decompression of the airplane.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by April 29, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;212&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

The FAA has reviewed the results of this reassessment and has determined that the longitudinal lap joints of Stringer (S&hyph;)12 are critical to the structural integrity of these airplanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The upper skin in the S&hyph;12 longitudinal lap joints are made of waffle doublers that are hot bonded to skin panels. The S&hyph;12 longitudinal lap joints have three rows of countersunk fasteners. The depth of the countersink exceeds the thickness of the skin panel. If the waffle doubler disbonds from the skin panel, the resultant sharp edges at the longitudinal lap joint fasteners can cause fatigue cracking at the fastener holes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Skin cracking in the longitudinal lap joints of S&hyph;12L and S&hyph;12R, if not detected and corrected, could result in rapid decompression of the airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2366, dated August 6, 1992, that describes procedures for repetitive high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections to detect cracking of the skin around the fasteners in the upper row of the longitudinal lap joints of S&hyph;12L and S&hyph;12R from station 520 to station 741.1, and replacement of the countersunk fasteners in these longitudinal lap joints with protruding head fasteners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require repetitive external HFEC inspections to detect cracking of the skin around the fasteners in the upper row of the longitudinal lap joints of S&hyph;12L and S&hyph;12R from station 520 to station 741.1, and replacement of the countersunk fasteners in these longitudinal lap joints with protruding head fasteners. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. This proposal also would require repair of all cracking in accordance with procedures specified in the 747 Structural Repair Manual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal is applicable only to airplanes having line numbers 201 through 230. Since the tolerance specifications for the bonding process for airplanes manufactered after line number 230 were more stringent, those airplanes are not subject to the unsafe condition addressed by this proposed AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 30 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 12 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 17 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspections, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed inspections on U.S. operators is estimated to be $11,220, or $935 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that it would take approximately 302 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed requirement to replace fasteners, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would be nominal in cost. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed requirement to replace fasteners on U.S. operators is estimated to be $199,320, or $16,610 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the figures, above, the total cost impact of the proposed actions (cost of inspections added to the cost of replacement of fasteners) on U.S. operators is estimated to be $210,540, or $17,545 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA recognizes that the proposed replacement of fasteners would require a large number of work hours to accomplish. However, the 4-year compliance time specified in paragraph (b) of this proposed AD should allow ample time for the replacement of the fasteners to be accomplished coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities, thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

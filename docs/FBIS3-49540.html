			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Neven Kopandanova: "A Colossus on Feet of </F> Clay"]    [Text] No matter how cleverly the Socialists are trying to  conceal not only the visible cracks in their party's unity, but  also the lack of clear concepts for the country's future  development, likely to conform with the preferences of their  electorate, BSP leader Zhan Videnov's visit, which he paid to  the headquarters of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], at 134  Rakovski Street, yesterday, revealed even more transparently the  weakness of the 100- year-old party. The fact that the  Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] is trying to restrict the  president's prerogatives, or even to replace him, has long since  been discussed, not only behind the closed doors of the BSP  headquarters at 20, Positano Street. The present initiative of  the Socialists can hardly be defined as the result of their  foreboding about forthcoming elections, alone. One of the  latest causes of concern for Videnov's people seems to be a  possible, new reorganization of the parliamentary structures  under the aegis of the head of state. The separation of living  political organisms such as the Civic Alliance for the Republic  [GOR] and of the Alliance for Social Democracy [OSD] from the  aging body of the BSP, which is evidently underway, would  deprive the giant party from its control over parliamentary  events and from the possibility of overthrowing the government  at a convenient time.    The fact that the president himself is no longer a decisive  force in political life is beyond any doubt. However, the  danger that he might stand behind a vigorous parliamentary  center force, or even support the SDS, a possibility that has  been repeatedly hinted at from the president's headquarters on  2, Dondukov Street, evidently suffices to cause panic among the  Socialists, whose political isolation would be devastating in  such case. By further stimulating the antipresidential campaign  of the SDS, the BSP will presumably rely on threatening our head  of state with the SDS guillotine, while trying to make the  Democrats more open for reconciliation with their chief  opponent, at the same time, and acting as a balancing force  between the centers of power so as to preserve control over the  situation.    The political game of the Socialists who are trying to pull  the strings of the government, while distancing themselves from  it at the same time, has long since been unsuccessful. Their  current attempt at sharing the responsibility with others, which  they tried yesterday, will hardly be more effective. It would  be naive to believe that the colossus on clay feet, as the BSP  can already be described, could rely on a supportive crutch from  the SDS.    We can presume that SDS leader Filip Dimitrov will be  subject  to a new series of attacks by his fellow party members. The  attacks are most likely to come from those who, until recently,  accused him of preventing the dialogue with other political  forces. Nevertheless, the SDS leader confirmed that those  capable of exploiting their opponent's failures are the real  winners in the political game.</p>

Speaking here at ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of  the entrance of the Italian air force in the war of Liberation,  Ciampi also said how "All of us, in their place of  responsibility, are helping Italy along an important path  towards its political and institutional renewal" and in this  effort the armed forces are giving their firm and essential  support "today as fifty years ago when, after the disaster  brought by the dictatorship, hope was re-born and civil and  moral reconstruction began, which came first and was more  important than material reconstruction."    Looking at the situation in neighboring Bosnia, the premier  observed "Italy's role has been essential for the possibility of  exercising international pressure aimed at halting the horrible  massacre in Sarajevo and to pave the way for just agreements,  acceptable for all sides involved."    "We are giving to the UN and NATO operations in Bosnia" he  continued, "the essential contribution of air bases and  logistical support and command systems. Our presence in the  international effort to restore peace in the ex-Yugoslavia is  also in line with all the missions we are involved, under the  banner of the United Nations: from Somalia to Lebanon,  Mozambique to the Persian Gulf."    Ciampi went on to state how Italy's commitment in  international missions is linked to a world no longer divided  into blocs which make it impossible for "isolationist policies"  and also implies Italy must assume its responsibilities given  "the difficulties the New World Order in having in establishing  itself."    Italy's position among other nations, Ciampi observed, "also  depends on its ability to play an active role in operations to  re-establish and maintain peace in areas where the risks are  greatest. Among these areas the Mediterranean, not only for us,  is of central importance. This government has worked in all  forums for a new security alliance stipulated among the peoples  of the Mediterranean."    The Italian premier went on to recall how, at the last NATO  summit, he underscored how "the Mediterranean question not only  regards southern Europe, but the whole Alliance and all of  Europe." Military alliances and agreements, such as between NATO  and the Western European Union (WEU) or NATO's Partnerships for  Peace with East Europe, "must be coupled with greater  concentration and multilateral cooperation in the Mediterranean  and a renewed effort against the dangers of the proliferation of  missiles and weapons of mass destruction."    What is needed, Ciampi said, is a "major diplomatic,  political and economic effort which must continue to seek to  stabilize the situation in the southern Mediterranean" and in  this "Italy cannot allow itself to be the egotist short-sighted,  nor stingy towards peoples distant only a few hundred  kilometers."</p>

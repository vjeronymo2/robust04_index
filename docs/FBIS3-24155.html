In It, the Fifth  Wheel Is the Betrayed Voter"]    [Text] Hardly had the postelection passions subsided,  hardly had the rallies and the political terror abated, when two  individuals returned to Crimea from Russia, each of them capable  of influencing the fate of the peninsula. The first--the Russian  Yevgeniy Saburov--turned up here in order to test his reforming  abilities, carrying out the slogans of Yu. Meshkov. The  appearance of the other, Nikolay Bagrov, who had been staying  with St. Petersburg relatives, could act as a brake on the  beginning of the Crimean president.    Nikolay Bagrov made a statement about this without beating  around the bush at the very first press conference: "I confirm  my disagreement with the pre-election program of the president.  It is impracticable. But I must help Crimea get out of the  economic crisis."    Three weeks ago, Yuriy Meshkov, already aware of the  resignation of his rival, played to the public, saying: "Such a  smart specialist as Bagrov cannot be disregarded. I will be  happy cooperate with him." Now that the Supreme Council of  Crimea has voted down the speaker's resignation, the variously  directed politicians will have to come together in a single  harness. Will it be for long?    It is not inconceivable that the enforced Bagrov-Meshkov  union will be delayed. Crimean political scientists predict that  at the end of March, Leonid Makarovych will offer Nikolay  Vasilyevich the position of Crimean presidential representative.  The deputies of the Supreme Council of Ukraine are talking about  the same thing in the corridors of power. And the Crimea and  Ukraine Committee stated: "Bagrov the politician will not work  well with Meshkov, and this will be to the benefit of Ukraine."    The clash of the three political figures is capable of  changing the Crimean situation in unpredictable fashion.  Especially since Yuriy Meshkov, upon coming to power, suddenly  failed to find around himself a team of like-thinkers and was  compelled to turn to all of the ministers and committee chairmen  and their deputies with the call, "Everyone stay where you are."  "No one is going to displace you," he exhorted the denizens of  the Council of Ministers. Much the same had been promised the  government bureaucrats by their future leader, Yevgeniy Saburov.    However, these promises were perceived without rapture. They  evoked a reaction of concealed sabotage: Many of the Council of  Ministers' deputy chairmen left in a state of diplomatic  illness. And their former head Samsonov packed himself off on  leave, offering Yuriy Meshkov his deserted office.    The Crimean president, however, suffering greatly for lack  of  a residence, resolved the sore point in his own way, taking an  office in the former oblast Communist Party Committee of Crimea,  which earlier belonged to Leonid Grach.    Now the wounded leader of the Communist Party republic  committee is counting on compensating the loss through the  political continuity of the new owner of the apartments. And in  some ways, he is decidedly not far wrong. Yuriy Meshkov began  work at his new post with a "swelling of the staff"--the  formation of his own administration and a group of advisers  comprising 60 people. Observers have already called these  actions unconstitutional: According to Crimean legislation, the  president heads the government; the ministers act as advisers,  and he is not entitled to an administration.    The prime ministership of Yevgeniy Saburov likewise seems  fairly shaky. Since the Constitution provides only for the  position of deputy prime minister, now occupied. The man in this  position is Anatoliy Franchuk, who has worked well with the  president.... While Yuriy Meshkov, who until recently worked  for the Crimean Constitution, is attempting to disengage himself  from the trap of its articles, he will not be up to any new  edicts. But then, the president is feeling out contact with  Crimean parties and movements. The other day, he even conducted  a roundtable with their representatives. But in the opinion of  Majlis deputy chairman Refat Chubarov, this will hardly improve  relations between the Tatars and the president: The sides have  taken a wait-and-see position.    Much more concrete is the disposition of the Ukrainian Civic  Congress of Crimea [UGKK], which resolved to consolidate its  forces and the Tatars' "against the expansion of pro-Russian  tendencies in Crimea."    "Crimea is becoming yet another stage in the genocide  against  everything Ukrainian," announced UGKK representatives to Nikolay  Mikhalchenko, head of the Ukrainian president's service dealing  with internal politics. And, in their words, they forced  official Kiev to do some serious thinking.    This thoughtfulness was probably transmitted to the  parliament as well, which decided a few days ago to fix the  logical stress marks in the Crimean question. The decree adopted  by the Supreme Council of Ukraine "On the Status of the  Autonomous Republic of Crimea...." "explicates" that Crimea  cannot change the state borders of Ukraine, or enter into  political relations with foreign states, or have its own  military formations and monetary system. In the course of a  month, Crimea's parliament is advised to bring the Constitution  and laws of the republic into conformity with Ukrainian ones.    However, during the discussion of this ticklish question at  the session, broadcast transmission from Kiev was strategically  blocked by the local radio station. Is it not for this reason  that official Simferopol is still in no state to evaluate the  resolution of the Ukrainian people's deputies?    It seems that the very authors of the document did not count  on concrete results. And not only because the decree makes no  provision for responsibility for its nonfulfillment. Simply, the  month's time allotted Crimea runs out on 24 March--at the height  of the election campaign.    "The document has no legislative weight--it just states the  situation. This is natural; after all, the de facto author of  Crimean autonomy is the president of Ukraine," summarized A.  Tkachuk, deputy chairman of the deputy commission dealing with  questions of legislation and legality.    The newly fledged decree is capable of impeding only the  introduction of the ruble in Crimea. As R. Shpek, minister of  economics, explained, "This would complicate the accounting  process and the tax system. L. Kravchuk proposed to Yu. Meshkov  that he present "ruble" calculations. He did not do this in  time. And now it is too late."    To Crimeans, pecking at the pro-Russian/ruble plan of their  president, only one thing is left that is not forbidden out of  all the pre-election promises--the introduction of Moscow time.    It seems as though the Crimeans are not to see the mountains  of gold guaranteed by Yuriy Meshkov. Just as earlier, they did  not receive the political tranquility promised by Nikolay  Bagrov. Will the hopes of the third--Nikolay Bagrov--be  fulfilled? Opinions were shared at NEZAVISIMOST's open  microphone.</p>

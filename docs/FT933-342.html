			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Marriott wins tax ruling on spin-off MARRIOTT Corporation, the US lodging and food services group, has received a favourable ruling from the US Internal Revenue Service that the planned spin-off of its lodging and services management operations as Marriott International will be tax-free, Reuter reports from Washington. The company said the spin-off had been dependent on a favourable IRS ruling, among other conditions, and should its board at a September 29 meeting find that all conditions had been met, the distribution of one Marriott International share for each Marriott Corp share held would be made on October 8 to holders of record on September 30. After the spin-off, which is taking the form of a special dividend, Marriott will change its name to Host Marriott. The associated exchange offer for its outstanding notes and senior debentures is scheduled to expire on October 7.</p>

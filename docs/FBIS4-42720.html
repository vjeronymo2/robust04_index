			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, now turns  from marking the D-Day anniversary to a round of bilateral  meetings in France after offering the French an olive branch.  Linda Mottram reports from France: Mr. Keating stepped back  from comments last year in a trade row that France had forgotten  the sacrifice made for it in the Second World War.    [Begin recording] [Mottram] Mr. Keating has praised French  President Francois Mitterrand for his thanks during the D-Day  celebrations to those countries whose people fought and died in  the liberation of Europe in World War II. Mr. Keating says it's  now clear to him the French have not forgotten the war  sacrifice, as he had claimed in France last year at the tense  end of the Uruguay Round of international trade negotiations.  Mr. Keating's next engagement in France is a meeting with  President Mitterrand.    [Keating] This is a good opportunity, I think, to, you know,  again go over common ground with the government of France and  I'll be looking forward to meetings with President Mitterrand  and Prime Minister Balladur.

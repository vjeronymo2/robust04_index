			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Arts: Captital concert hall for Athens - A triumph of space, planning and acoustics LOVABLE, chaotic, incomparable in its relics and in the ugliness of its modern buildings, Athens is not a city of which exciting innovations can generally be expected. Images familiar to the international eye tend to focus upon streets locked in traffic jams and skies coated with life-threatening pollution haze - not the Acropolis. It is also a city whose cultural institutions have long been characterised by their stagnation, brackish pools of special-interest domination, intrigue and hand-to-mouth mediocrity. Of European capitals it is, therefore, not the first to spring to mind as the likely home of a magnificent new concert hall. But that, as I found out last weekend, is exactly what the new Megaron Mousikis Athenon must be judged: a triumph of intelligent space-planning, fine architectural execution and - most important of all, of course - inviting acoustics. The only concert hall in Greece, it is the achievement of two groups of music-lovers, the Society of the Friends of Music and OMMA, who together bulldozed their way through numerous obstacles, attracting state and private money in the process. It was inaugurated last year, 25 years after the foundation was laid, having taken four years and Dollars 1 billion (one-sixth, I was proudly informed, of the Paris Bastille) to build. It was designed by a team of European architects who came on board - crucial point  -only after the consultative acousticians had compiled their list of requirements. Though minor finishing touches have still to be applied, its obvious success is already causing an exhilarating new vitality to ripple through the artistic life of the whole country. The Megaron is two halls - the 2,000-seater Friends' Hall and the 500-seater Dimitri Mitropoulos - connected and surrounded by what seems airy acres of foyer, apt for exhibitions, lunchtime and early-evening recitals, or simple relaxation and refreshment. Different, wonderful kinds of marble make up the substructure and surfaces; fastidious care has been taken over decorative details such as the foyer seating, lights and 'signature' emblems embedded in the marble flooring. The ambitions of the hall management do not end with simply providing a decent house for music-making. The provision for conferences and recording facilities, a new home-based chamber orchestra and a thematic slant to programme-building are just some of the signs of determination to make the place a real artistic force. (Significantly the Greek National Opera is not being allowed any important role in the activities of the Megaron.) The first 'theme' is that of Electra, in all her various dramatic manifestations (next year's will be Helen of Troy). An Electra Cycle began on May 2 with Xenakis's completed Oresteia and continued last weekend with three performances of Strauss's Elektra with the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra. Other items on the way to the closing date (June 20) will include a Moscow Taganka staging (in the small hall) by Yury Lyubimov of Sophocles's Electra, a new chamber opera, Pylades, by the Greek composer George Kouropos, and the Bolshoy Ballet in Grigorovich's Electra. As all this suggests, the halls are intended to be multi-purpose. The quick-change possibilities of the handsomely wood-surfaced Friends' Hall seemed to me quite astonishing: when it is scheduled for fully-staged opera, such as this Elektra, the removal of whole side-boxes of audience seats can be accomplished with remarkable ease. There is no covered pit; for the Strauss the Dresden Philharmonic was laid out, open and in all its vastness, at a level below the stage. This may have provided a slight visual distraction, in this of all operas; but the unclotted fullness and beauty of the orchestral sound in all its panoply of Straussian combinations, and the way all the voices were allowed to soar above it, certainly testified to the excellence of the acoustics. The purposeful warmth of the bass line - how clean and ample the Dresden cellos, double basses and low brass sounded] - reinforced my admiration for the 'neurasthenic' brilliance of Strauss's Elektra orchestration. But every facet of this extraordinary score sounded new-polished - and this was in spite of the ungripping conducting, honest, able but workaday, of Ralf Weikert. The production by Claus Helmut Drese, the ex-Vienna State Opera boss, was likewise no more than middling, with 'ideas' about costume notable only for their thudding ineffectiveness. The pleasure lay in the singing; the cast was on the top level of current Elektra standards. Indeed, after worrying reports of her recent New York encounter with the title role, it was a relief to hear Hildegard Behrens returned to vocal health: in any case, her ability to rise radiantly above natural vocal limitations is always a source of wonder. At the second of the two performances I attended, the heroine was Evanghelia Antoninia, a highly promising young Greek currently active in Germany - but the voice, more Chrysothemis than Electra, is in danger of being overstretched by this most ferociously demanding of dramatic-soprano roles. Eva Randova (Clytemnestra, in terrific form), Nadine Secunde (Chrysothemis) and Horst Hiestermann (Aegisthus) were common to all three evenings, and well routined. Elektra was a splendid test of the acoustics. I cannot wait to get back to Athens, and get to know the Megaron in all its other manifestations.</p>

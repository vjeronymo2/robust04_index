			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Clear case of humanitarian horrors: While diplomats and leader writers talk rubbish, women and children die ON WEDNESDAY the US special envoy, Robert Bartholomew, met the former psychiatrist, and practising war criminal, Dr Radovan Karadzic. Dr Karadzic is more commonly referred to as 'the leader of the Bosnian Serbs'. After his meeting Bartholomew proclaimed: 'What we are saying to them very clearly - and by we, I mean the international community - is that the military and humanitarian horrors have to stop now.' This is a fascinating sentence and deserves parsing. What is meant by 'very clearly'? Bartholomew was speaking in the context of Lady Thatcher's call on British and US television for immediate action against the Serbs to stop their massacre of Bosnian Muslims. Yet on the same day as Bartholomew made his position 'clear', his boss, the US secretary of state, Warren Christopher said: 'Thatcher's prescription is one for only increasing the carnage . . . a rather emotional response.' So it is 'clear' that the US, in spite of Bartholomew's brave words in Belgrade, is absolutely against providing or encouraging any military impediment to the Serbian bombardment of Bosnian civilians. The US, in fact, is interested in Bosnia only in so far as it affects relations with Russia, and since Russia sympathises with the Serbian view, the State Department will not jeopardise Bill Clinton's buddy buddy relationship with Boris Yeltsin, merely for the sake of a few million measly Muslims. But Bartholomew claimed that by 'we' he did not mean the US. He said 'we' meant 'the international community.' This phrase should be consigned to the dustbin of diplomacy. It occurs about four times in every newspaper leading article on Bosnia. It is constantly on the lips of Douglas Hurd and Malcolm Rifkind, when they seek moral authority for their policy of giving the besieged Bosnians butter before guns. What, actually, is the 'international community', for whom Bartholomew, Christopher, Hurd, Rifkind et al, claim to speak? Who are the members of this club? Can anyone join? Does it consist of the entire membership of the UN? Well, no. By common usage it does not include Libya or Iran. But does it include India? Is Chad 'saying clearly' to Dr Karadzic 'stop these humanitarian and military horrors now.' I think the good people of Chad and their leaders know little of the troubles of the Bosnian Muslims and care even less. Does 'international community' mean just the security council of the UN? Well, no again, unless the UN envoy to Bosnia thinks that in his strictures to Dr Karadzic he is speaking on behalf of China's billions, but not for the Japanese population, disenfranchised from the great honour of membership of the UN security council. And what of South Africa? It used not be part of 'the international community'. Now, perhaps, it has country membership of this club. Possibly, when Bartholomew refers to international community, he means only 'those who regularly and reliably support the actions and utterances of the government of the US.' That is quite a good working definition, particularly for Hurd and Rifkind. It means they - we - are quids in. Back to parsing the US envoy's pregnant little sentence: what on earth does he mean by 'humanitarian horrors'? Human horror I understand, but not this polysyllabic refinement. He surely does not mean horrors in the name of humanitarianism. But that, actually, is the truth. We have a policy of 'humanitarian aid', which means that we are prepared to give food to the besieged Muslims of Srebrenica, but not to lift an arms embargo which prevents them from lifting the siege which is starving them, and which, when the city falls, will result in further murders of women and children. The Muslim soldiers, will of course, escape Srebrenica: in this war it is the civilians who perish. In the name of 'humanitarianism' we leave these people to their fate. Hurd argues that to allow the Bosnians arms, would 'increase the quantity of fighting.' Indeed it would, just as when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt agreed to send arms to Britain in 1940 it increased 'the quantity' of fighting in Europe: we were willing to fight more in the short term, in order to promote a just settlement for the long term. Unfortunately, the US is not now led by a man of the calibre of Roosevelt. As for Britain, Lady Thatcher is absolutely right: we should be ashamed of ourselves.

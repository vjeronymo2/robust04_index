			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a waste is loaded into a container by pumping, the proposed standards would require submerged fill of waste only into those containers with a capacity equal to or greater than 0.42 m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (110 gal). Accordingly, drums with design capacities up to and including 0.42 m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (110 gal) are not required to be loaded by submerged fill. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When it is necessary for a container to be open during certain treatment processes, the proposed standards would require the container to be located in an enclosure connected to a closed-vent system with control device. The enclosure would be required to be designed to operate with sufficient airflow into the structure to capture all organic vapors vented from the container and route the vapors through the closed-vent system to the control device. The enclosure could have permanent or temporary openings to allow worker access, passage of containers through the enclosure by conveyor or other mechanical means, or entry of permanent mechanical or electrical equipment, or to direct airflow into the enclosure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Standards for Individual Drain Systems <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would require individual drain systems to meet one of two standards. In the first case, the owner or operator would comply by operating and maintaining on each opening in the individual drain system a cover and closed-vent system. The covers and all openings and the closed-vent system would meet the leak detection requirements, unless the system is operated and maintained under negative pressure. The cover and all openings would be maintained in a closed, sealed position at all times when affected wastewater or residual is in the system except when it is necessary to use the opening for sampling or removal, or for equipment inspection, maintenance, or repair. Each individual drain system would be subject to initial and semi-annual inspections for improper work practices and control equipment failures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatively, individual drain system components would be required to comply with equipment standards. Each drain would be equipped with water seal controls or a tightly sealed cap or plug to eliminate air flow through the system. Each junction box would be equipped with a cover and emission controls. Each sewer line would be covered or enclosed in a manner so as to have no visible gaps or crack in joints, seals, or other emission interfaces. This equipment would be subject to regular inspection requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Standards for Oil-Water Separators <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed standards would require owners or operators to operate and maintain either a fixed roof and closed-vent system that routes the VOC vapors from the oil-water separator to a control device or a floating roof. The fixed roof and all openings and the closed-vent system would be maintained in accordance with the leak detection requirements of the proposed rule, unless the system is operated and maintained under negative pressure. As with standards for other waste management units, each opening would be maintained in a closed, sealed position except when it is necessary to use the opening for sampling or removal, or for equipment inspection, maintenance, or repair. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Except in cases where it is impossible to operate a floating roof, such as over the weir mechanisms, the owner or operator would have the option of using a floating roof that meets the requirements of subpart QQQ of 40 CFR part 60. The owner or operator would measure primary and secondary seal gaps on a periodic basis as well as inspect the oil-water separator for improper work practices and control equipment failures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Standards for Treatment Processes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The owner or operator would be required to treat each affected wastewater or residual stream by one of the following methods: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Recycle or return to a production process such that the wastewater stream or residual is not exposed to the atmosphere and ensure that intervening waste management units meet the applicable requirements of the standards; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Treat using a waste management unit that either is a design steam stripper, reduces by 99 percent or more the total volatile organic mass flow rate, reduces the average volatile organic concentration to less than 50 ppmw and reduces the total volatile organic mass by 95 percent, or achieves a required volatile organic mass removal rate for combined or mixed streams; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Treat wastewater streams generated by an affected process unit with a biological treatment unit that achieves 95 percent total volatile organic mass removal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the treatment process or waste management unit is a properly operated biological treatment unit that meets the mass removal (i.e., biodegradation) requirements, the biological treatment unit need not be covered and vented to a control device. However, the owner or operator of any other treatment process or waste management unit subject to the applicable standards (for example, if the treatment process is a steam stripper, air stripper, or thin-film evaporation unit) would be required to cover and vent the unit through a closed-vent system to a control device and meet the leak detection requirements, unless the cover and vent are operated and maintained under negative pressure. In addition, any openings must be kept closed at all times that an affected wastewater stream or treatment residual is in the process or unit, except during inspection and maintenance and unless the unit is a properly operated biological treatment unit as defined by the standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

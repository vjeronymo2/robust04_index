			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Brazil tries to boost standing abroad THE Brazilian government is to launch a campaign to improve its international standing, after last week's agreement with foreign bank creditors on arrears payments. 'We feel we've turned a corner with this accord and can now hope for a new climate in our international dealings,' said Mr Marcos Azambuja, director-general of the Brazilian foreign office. Ms Zelia Cardoso, Brazil's finance minister, is planning trips to Japan, Europe and the US to try to recapture the support initially given to the government's adjustment plan. President Fernando Collor plays host to Britain's Prince Charles next week and, in June, will visit President George Bush. Brazil intends to remove the major thorns in trade relations with the US by introducing patent protection and ending a law which prevents importing of information technology similar to products manufactured in Brazil. Brazil is blacklisted by the US commerce department for failing to deal with these matters and for pirating of US films. The US, Brazil's biggest creditor, did much to ensure the recent delay of a Dollars 350m loan from the IADB. This loan may be released soon, following the arrears accord, but Brazil is far from shedding its image in the international financial community as the black sheep of Latin America.</p>

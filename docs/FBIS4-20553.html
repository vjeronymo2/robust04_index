			<p>CSO     [Text] In a 21 February announcement in Tokyo, Honda  confirmed its intention to withdraw the 20 percent share it held  in Rover's capital. This announcement has been made during the  discussions begun on the same morning between BMW's CEO Bernd  Pischetsrieder and his Hoda counterpart Nibuhiko Kawamoto.Since  the announcement of the sale by Rover to BMW of the 80 percent  previously owned by Airbus, Honda did not hide its  dissatisfaction. The Japanese manufacturer, Rover's partner  since 1979, considers itself visibly betrayed. Therefore, the  announcement on Monday, 21 February, expressing the company's  intention to withdraw from Rover's capital, did not come as a  surprise. The consequences of this position industrially and  commercially may be quite risky, since Honda has not been just a  financial partner (to Rover) but an industrial ally as well.  Thus, this collaboration has to be renegotiated also. In the  future--the announcement stated--we will reexamine the diverse  technical contracts with Rover. Until now, Honda's policies in  Europe have been based on this collaboration with Rover. In the  future, we intend to set up independent production units  (solely) through our own resources. Up to the present, Rover  has been producing for Honda some vehicles (the Concerto model  in particular) intended for the European market, while Honda had  conceived severel models of the Rover series, the Rover 200,  400, 800, and the new Rover 600. Beyond this, the Japanese  manufacturer had supplied the British company with several  strategic components, such as gear boxes. The cooperation  extended also to commercial interests; in Japan Honda has been  selling the 4x4 Land Rover Discovery model under its own trade  mark.The renegociation of agreements existing between the two  firms could profoundly disrupt Rover's production.</p>

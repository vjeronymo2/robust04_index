			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Disclosure by late payers demanded A LEADING Scottish banker yesterday said companies should be required to state in their annual accounts the average amount of time they took to pay their suppliers. Mr Bruce Pattullo, governor and chief executive of Bank of Scotland, said this would help reduce late payment of bills, which causes serious difficulties for small companies. The time taken to pay bills would have to be confirmed by company auditors. He said 29 per cent of the total assets of smaller manufacturing companies were accounted for by trade debts. Earlier payment would free companies' cash flow for investment or expansion. Addressing the Scottish Council's international forum at Gleneagles, Mr Pattullo suggested that the problem of trade credit 'would disappear overnight' if the government announced that all departments and local authorities would pay their bills in 30 days and that the private sector was expected to follow suit. This could be accompanied by a media campaign to identify and 'attach a stigma to those companies, often well-known names, who continued to be slow payers'. Separately, Mr Pattullo urged the Scottish Office to persuade multinational companies based in Scotland to buy more of their components locally. He said only 25 per cent of all components used by multinational electronics companies in Scotland were made locally - adding that if the level were raised to 50 per cent it would have a considerable effect on the Scottish economy. Mr Pattullo said certain companies such as NCR, which makes automated teller machines in Dundee, or IBM, which produces personal computers at Greenock, Strathclyde, had successful programmes to encourage UK and Scottish suppliers.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: The global investor Sir, I refer to Gillian O'Connor's comment (Serious Money, June 25) in which she states that 'sticking to the UK (stock market) is the global equivalent of keeping your life's savings in a box under the bed'. This could hardly be less true today when an increasing proportion of UK national product is earned in trade with the 'global market' and as a result of the UK's high level of investment overseas. The UK stock market is unusual because, unlike other leading stock markets such as New York or Frankfurt, its largest constituents trade predominantly outside their home markets. Although it is reasonable to spread investments across other markets, including (for the brave) the emerging markets, it is also possible to have a globally balanced portfolio with the majority of constituents quoted in London.

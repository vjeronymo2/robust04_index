			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / IT contracting 'is beneficial' SIGNIFICANT benefits can be achieved by contracting out government computer services to the private sector, a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says. The Paris-based organisation says countries which have put computer services out to tender can save 20 per cent to 30 per cent of costs, even when the contract is won by the in-house team. Contracting out also improves the quality of service, especially where governments lack the staff with necessary skills. The report appears as the UK government plans to increase the contracting out of Civil Service work 50-fold, with information technology services accounting for the largest proportion by value. The OECD says sharing government information technology development with the private sector can stimulate industrial development, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises. This could improve a country's international competitiveness in these applications. Benefiting from this requires careful preparation, a clear understanding of expectations, a good contract, strong project management and constant monitoring. Unforeseen costs can arise where performance is unsatisfactory or staff are demotivated. Complex Contracting Out for Information Technology. OECD. Free.</p>

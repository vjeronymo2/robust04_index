Therefore, the amount of land traded may be different than that shown after values are equalized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the exchanges are to acquire and block up lands in Grant County, particularly along the forks of the John Day River. These lands have high public value for riparian, fisheries, wildlife, recreation and scenic quality. Acquisition of this land would be consistent with the Bureau's planning system after the plan is amended. The value of the lands has not been determined; however, upon completion of the final appraisal, the acreage will be adjusted or money will be used to equalize values. The public lands will be transferred subject to: (1) A reservation to the United States of a rights-of-way for ditches or canals constructed by the authority of the United States, Act of Aug. 30, 1890 (43 U.S.C. 945); (2) All valid existing rights-of-way, leases, permits or licenses in effect at the time of exchange. The mineral estate is expected to be included in the exchange.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interest has also been expressed in a tract of public land described as:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s50,6 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Acres <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> T. 13 S., R. 31 E., <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=02 g=1 f=1 --> Sec. 26: SW1/4SW1/4  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 40 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 35: NW1/4NW1/4 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 40 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=03 g=1 f=1 --> Approximately <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 80 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 007 0162 extable --> n,s <!-- PJG 0003 extable -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This land would be retained for use associated specifically with the airport and allow for expansion of airport activities.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 25 Jan (NA) -- Foreign Minister Guido  Di Tella will travel to Washington tonight. He will seek a  definition on the proposal to transform the Falda del Carmen  plant. It was reported that Henry Kissinger's consulting firm  is interested.    Di Tella has scheduled a series of meetings to arrange the  participation of President Carlos Menem in the summit of the  Americas presidents with Bill Clinton, which still does not have  a date, to discuss the supply of A4M planes with radars, and to  discuss a possible association for the manufacture and sale of  the Pampa 2000 plane.    The foreign minister will meet with State Department  officials to hear concrete proposals for converting the Cordoba  plant, following a U.S. offer of economic and technological  assistance.    Depending on the answer, the Argentine Government will  analyze other proposals by foreign firms, particularly one from  France that arrived during the middle of 1993, and the alleged  interest by Kissinger's consulting firm.    It was reported that the company of the former secretary of  state has links with a mobile telecommunications firm that won a  bid in the interior of the country and expressed interest in  installing its headquarters at the former Condor-2 missile  project site.    The sources told NA that Di Tella will ask the U.S. firm to  define its position on the Falda del Carmen conversion plan so  that the government can have "a free hand" to analyze other  proposals which have arrived at the Defense Ministry.    The Argentine foreign minister will also meet with Commerce  Secretary Michael Kantor, State Secretary Warren Christopher,  and Military Affairs Secretary Anthony Lake.</p>

			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Poles win Dollars 900m IMF standby Poland has agreed a new draft Dollars 900m standby agreement with an International Monetary Fund team for 18 months until the end of next year. The funds will go to boosting Poland's hard currency reserves as well as helping to finance a 45 per cent debt reduction deal agreed earlier this year with western commercial banks. The policy draft, which is likely to be approved early in August by the IMF and still has to be formally adopted by the Polish government, assumes that inflation next year will fall to 16 per cent from this year's projected 23 per cent figure. Next year's deficit budget meanwhile will fall to 3.7 per cent of gdp from this year's 4.1 per cent. Mr Michael Deppler, the head of the IMF group said yesterday that the medium-term programme drafted by Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, the new finance minister, and adopted recently by the Polish government, contained 'good policies for Poland' and that he was confident that unemployment would fall by the end of 1997.</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Sport: Pakistan opens without the master of the late entrance - Cricket FORTUNE WAS against me when it sent Imran Khan to Oxford University in 1973, the year after I had left. Although I enjoyed many a happy hour watching cricket in the Parks, I only saw Imran later, when the county circuit brought him nearby, playing sadly for Worcestershire, drinking milk and hating the pub evenings that are the heart of most cricketers' social lives. I did not see him play for Pakistan until 1982, when he brought them on a short tour of England. Imran is an easy man to miss. So easy that one is tempted to conclude that managing his absences ranks among his most astute cricketing skills. No-one knows better than Imran when to make people miss him, miss him so much that he has no alternative but to return in a blaze of glory because his country cannot go on without him. His captaincy is not especially exciting or enterprising, but it is strong. When Imran made his debut as captain of Pakistan 10 years ago, Pakistan lost the three-Test series 2-1, but came away triumphantly because they had won Pakistan's first Test victory at Lords. Imran followed that up with crushing defeats of Australia, where his leg-spinning protege Abdul Qadir fatally mesmerised the batsmen, and then of India. Only a stress fracture of the shin removed him from power for the next couple of years. I suppose it was only that. First Zaheer Abbas, then Javed Miandad took over the leadership when Imran had to drop out in late 1983, but in early 1984 the selectors were sacked because they had preferred Javed to the unfit Imran as captain in Australia, to nationwide dismay. Imran was declared captain although he could not bowl at all and could only play a bit, cautiously, in the fourth Test. The crack in his shin kept opening and closing. He said it might well be the end of his Test career. By late 1985 he was back, after Javed's aggressive captaincy had provoked complaints, from Pakistan's players and opponents alike. Imran then led Pakistan through a drawn series against the West Indies and a victorious one against the old rivals, India, which saw the team welcomed home as national heroes and Imran as a phoenix deserving of endless adulation. Instances of Imran reluctantly returning to power are too numerous to list, the latest and most spectacular being the World Cup. But they illustrate a principle worth remembering, now that Pakistan are here for a gruelling 15 week tour, with 34 matches, including five Test and five Texaco one-day internationals. This is ideal waiting ground for Imran. He is nursing his sore shoulder, watching and waiting. Anyone lucky enough to be at Worcester could testify to the glorious ferocity of Pakistan's batting attack, as Ramiz Raja and Salim Malik tore the bowling apart on Wednesday, and also to its volatile nature: on Friday they were all out for 93 in the second innings. Aamir Sohail had a less than memorable match, but he is a difficult character who makes his presence felt in every game in which he plays. Wicket-keeper Moin Khan is another fiery, disruptive element. In a long tour, after a hard but victorious World Cup with a month's unremitting celebrations afterwards, the problem is going to be keeping up the team's momentum and keeping its players together as a team. A set of meteoric personalities like these is liable to crack into factions under pressure. Javed, Pakistan's captain, is a great fighter and an insatiable competitor, but he is not a man to ease pressure or, I think, to use it to best advantage, which is one of Imran's strengths. If they confront it right, the Pakistanis thrive on adversity. Sometimes it is almost as if they get into trouble on purpose, so they can come out of it all the more sensationally. 'Forget all these worries about no-balls and wides and just go and fight,' Imran told his troops three games before the World Cup final, with three wins needed to qualify. They qualified and won. If Javed can keep all the fighting directed against the enemy, he has some players of fearsome talent at his disposal. England's best policy is probably to 'try and stay cool', as Gooch put it when asked last summer how he helped his team face ferocious West Indian bowling bombardments. You would not find either Imran or Javed telling the Pakistani Tigers to try and stay cool, but they would find it frustrating if the enemy stays cool. In Karachi, where Javed comes from, cricket is battle, and if the game itself fails to generate enough crackle, I would not be surprised to see him get himself involved in some sort of trouble associated with the game. This would be a sad second best. Pakistan are disappointed that England are using English umpires for this tour, though they have accepted the fact. This position, which has a certain ironic tinge to it, is a possible source of trouble under pressure, as is the over-crowded schedule crammed with one-day matches, England's desire for revenge after the World Cup, Pakistan's desire to complete their humiliation of colonial England and, of course, the ever-present tensions of Pakistani cricket politics. Whether or not Javed and Imran end up playing this tour as a double act, it should be an exciting one to watch. Wasim Akram of Lancashire, Salim Malik of Essex and the injured Waqar Younis of Surrey have enough experience of English teams and conditions to give useful advice, though of course that can become too much of a good thing. Intikhab Alam, Pakistan's manager, with 12 popular years of leg-spin bowling and muscular batting for Surrey behind him (1969-1981), will have to handle that carefully. He should be a good man to help bring young Mushtaq Ahmed's bowling of wrist spin, leg-spin, googlies and flippers to its best. And of course there is always Imran. The man who first spotted and fostered the talent of Wasim and Waqar; who picked Mushtaq as a worthy successor to the magical Qadir, another of his discoveries, and has declared the dynamic 22 year-old batsman Inzamam-ul-Haq to be a genius. Who dare argue? Imran has an expert knowledge of cricket. He loves being in command; indeed, some say he was born to be in command. I wonder what odds are being offered on whether Imran will emerge from retirement this summer, for the very last time, to show his players how to play and win, even when it is impossible.</p>

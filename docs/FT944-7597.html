			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Hopes for housing trusts dashed Mr David Curry, the housing minister, yesterday poured cold water on hopes that a class of investment trust to increase the supply of private rented accommodation would be introduced in the Budget. Interest groups including the Association of Residential Letting Agents, the independent Housing Investment Group and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation had hoped legislation would be changed to allow for authorised housing investment trusts. The proposed trusts were aimed at promoting institutional investment in the private rented sector. They would be free from capital gains tax and pay corporation tax at the lower rate of 25 per cent. Mr Curry told a conference in London that no industry estimates had been provided on levels of subsidy needed. Once an estimate had been concluded, Mr Curry said, he would be prepared to explore the option in line with the government's objective of encouraging growth in the sector. Mrs Patsy Baker, of the Housing Investment Group, said the organisation had suggested that the government make Pounds 250m available to the trusts by way of a grant. She said the grant would bridge the yield gap of 1.5 per cent existing between investor requirements and the returns available in the private rented sector.</p>

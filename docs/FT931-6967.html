			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Aberdeen declares Brabant offer final ABERDEEN Petroleum yesterday declared final its hostile all-share offer for fellow USM company Brabant Resources with the publication of an offer document and annual results showing pre-tax profits up by Pounds 277,000 to Pounds 355,000. The group's shares rose 13 per cent on the news to close at 15p. Brabant's shares held steady at 37p. The profits increase was achieved on the back of lower overheads and an exceptional gain of Pounds 201,000 on asset disposals. Sales, dampened by the fall in the average oil price from Dollars 18.05 to Dollars 16.94, declined from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 2.6m. Mr David Hooker, Aberdeen's managing director, said the group's profits were the result of getting the 'housekeeping right'. Referring to the bid for Brabant, he said that future substantial growth for many small UK-quoted oil and gas companies depended on rationalisation in the sector. Aberdeen's offer document drew attention to the losses incurred at Brabant and its 'historic lack of success' in the exploration field. Aberdeen, which owns or has undertakings for 21.4 per cent of Brabant, claimed that the bid of 35 of its shares for 10 of Brabant's valued the target at 48.1p. This represented a 75 per cent premium over Brabant's price the day before Aberdeen indicated its interest, the document said. However, Mr Nicholas Gay, Brabant's finance director, said the valuation was based on an inflated Aberdeen share price, 'supported by bid speculation'. Using the 6p price for Aberdeen on December 7, Mr Gay said the bid valued Brabant shares at 21p. Analysts have speculated that if the offer for Brabant, which is largely UK based, does not succeed, then Aberdeen will become the target of an aggressive approach from Pittencrieff. Pittencrieff earlier this week increased its stake in Aberdeen from 16.6 per cent to 19.1 per cent. The acquisitive resources company is determined to expand both in the US and Canada, where Aberdeen's assets are based.</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Managers set to back British Coal bid REPRESENTATIVES of 6,000 managers at British Coal's pits are expected this week to back moves which may lead to them joining a bid for the organisation when it is privatised. This would increase the likelihood of British Coal employees taking a large stake even though the National Union of Mineworkers, the largest coalfield union, strongly opposes privatisation. Mr John Meads, general secretary of the British Association of Colliery Managers, is likely on Thursday to receive the support of his union's conference for investigating participation in a bid consortium. The Union of Democratic Mineworkers has already declared its interest in an employee buy-out. Whether the association joined with the UDM or formed a separate group, its interest would increase the credibility of a buy-out. The association would not regard any venture it entered as a management buy-out, Mr Meads said. 'We want everybody - all employees - in this together.' The likely sale of British Coal next year has already attracted the interest of companies. The government indicated in its election manifesto that at least some shares should go to employees.</p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: Growth rate slows at Thai banks COMBINED net profits of the 15 Thai commercial banks rose to Bt19.46bn (Dollars 807.5m) in 1991, up 25.4 per cent from Bt15.52bn a year ago, according to Bangkok Bank, Reuter reports from Bangkok. Bangkok Bank said the slower rate of earnings growth, compared with 1990 when profits soared 85.4 per cent, may be due to an economic slowdown, wide interest rate fluctuations, and higher operating expenses and staff salaries. Bangkok Bank said its 1991 record profit of Bt7.3bn accounted for 37.3 per cent of total net after-tax earnings of all Thai banks. Bangkok Bank was followed by the Thai Farmers Bank with Bt3.4bn, or a 17.5 per cent share, and the Siam Commercial Bank at Bt2.7bn, a 13.8 per cent share. Bangkok Bank's 54.7 per cent earnings growth was the highest among Thai banks, while three medium-sized and small banks posted annual profits between 3.3 per cent and 32.3 per cent lower than a year ago. Total Thai bank lending rose a combined 21.8 per cent in 1991, to an outstanding Bt1,797.4bn at the end of December. Bangkok Bank's credits accounted for 27.7 per cent of overall bank loans, followed by Krung Thai Bank at 14.5 per cent, Thai Farmers at 13.4 per cent, and Siam Commercial at 10 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, 26 Apr (INA) -- A delegation of the Arab  Socialist Ba'th Party led by 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Hashimi, director  of the Foreign Relations Bureau of the Iraq Command of the Ba'th  Party, met in Vienna today with Mr. Henkel, the official in  charge of the Middle East department at the Austrian Foreign  Ministry.    During the meeting, the Iraqi delegation explained the  latest  developments in the Iraq-UN talks, pointing out that Iraq has  fulfilled its international obligations and that this requires  that the Security Council honor its commitments toward Iraq and  lift the economic blockade.    Mr. Henkel expressed his understanding of Iraq's position,  stressing the importance of relations between Iraq and Austria  and the need to develop them in the interest of the common  objectives of the two countries.    The Ba'th Party delegation also met with Alfred Kerstel of  the Federal Council, the upper house of parliament. Discussions  dealt with relations between Iraq and Austria and ways of  developing them, as well as the recent developments at the  Security Council and Iraq's implementation of its obligations.    In a press statement following the meeting, Mr. Kerstel said  the two sides stressed the importance of working to create  foundations for a just and lasting peace in the region,  especially after Iraq's implementation of all UN resolutions.    Mr. Kerstel added that the situation in Iraq has become very  difficult as a result of the continued economic blockade against  it and the severe shortage of food and medicine, stressing the  need to work to lift the blockade.    Mr. Kerstel suggested sending a delegation of Austrian youth  and journalists to Baghdad to familiarize themselves with the  situation in Iraq.</p>

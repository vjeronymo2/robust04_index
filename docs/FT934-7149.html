			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Five executive decisions: Minister for a Day AS environment secretary for a day, I make an early start, arriving by bicycle at the hideously ugly Marsham Street Towers, central London, in which the Department of the Environment is located. Demolition would seem to be the only solution for such unloved carbuncles, but I am not feeling sufficiently explosive so early in the day to order it then and there. I do however note the paucity of bicycle racks. Five executive decisions before breakfast, essentially to knock off all the things the Government has been promising to do, but has not quite managed: to bring the long-awaited Environmental Protection Agency into being before the end of the year; to reintroduce Peter Ainsworth's Hedgerow Protection Bill into the Commons in the next session - this time as an official Government Bill so that it cannot be talked out by those who see all such regulation as an unwarranted extension of the powers of the State; to implement the measures (already enacted by this Government in the 1990 Environmental Protection Act , but disastrously postponed in breach of EC Directives) to regulate operators of landfill sites and toxic waste dumps more rigorously; to triple the budget of the Energy Efficiency Office, starved for so long of cash and influence that it has not even managed to persuade Government departments to save any energy; to extend statutory protection to all Sites of Special Scientific Interest, the so-called 'jewels in the crown of UK conservation', of which more than 500 have been damaged over the last two years. Over breakfast, I realise that I could go on all day effecting equally useful bits and bobs of environmental legislation. But very few of them would leave the UK any more prepared to confront the challenge of sustainable development - embraced so enthusiastically at the Earth Summit last year by John Major, the prime minister - than it is today. Ironically, it turns out that the environment secretary has few direct powers to protect the environment. Real power lies in the Treasury, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Department of Transport and Ministry of Agriculture. At which point I seize hold of the phone, ring the prime minist er's direct line, and persuade him to extend my powers for a day to address environmental issues within those departments. First stop, the Department of Transport. The first decision is to axe most of the Pounds 24bn road building programme which until now has been mysteriously immune to cost-cutting pressures from Clarke and Portillo. (Anticipate considerable brownie points from these two gentlemen, which could come in very handy later.) Retain only those by-pass schemes which have the overwhelming support of the towns and villages involved. Then I would do everyone a favour, including John MacGregor, the transport minister, by binning his fatuous plans for privatising British Rail, and redirecting around 50 per cent of the money saved on the road programme to new investment in rolling stock and electrification projects. Simultaneously, I would authorise local authorities to introduce road pricing schemes on roads for which they are responsible, on condition that the proceeds are earmarked specifically for investment in new light rail or tram systems, in further traffic-calming measures (which have already proved popular), and in measures to promote cycling. (You may think I am a bit obsessed by bikes, but don't you realise there are 5m riders?) From there to the Department of Trade and Industry with a modest brief to shame them into implementing the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Business and the Environment - a committee made up of leading business representatives which the DTI itself established but has since systematically ignored. Even the business community is fed up with this Government's prevarication in adopting the business case for sustainable development, let alone the ecological case. Then to the Ministry of Agriculture to set aside the infamous Set Aside scheme, by designating the whole of the UK as an Environmentally Sensitive Area. Last stop on my magical bicycle tour: the Treasury. Just two little reforms here: a complete revamp in the way we present the national accounts, relegating gross national product so that it becomes just one of the indicators of wealth used in a new index of sustainable welfare. There is nothing wrong with economic growth of the right kind, but the pursuit of growth at all costs as an end in itself is absolutely incompatible with achieving sustainable development. Finally, end the day with a big bang by committing the Government to phasing out income tax entirely by 2000, and to recoup the missing Pounds 56bn through new taxes on energy, raw materials and waste. That should get the jobs market moving. Back home for a large and well-deserved malt whisky, one of the most environmentally-friendly products known to man.

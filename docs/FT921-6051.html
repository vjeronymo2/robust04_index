			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses ease in pre-weekend trade SENIOR BOURSES traded quietly ahead of the weekend, while Brussels and Zurich closed at their year's highs, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT eased back after a firm performance this week. Dealers reported position unwinding ahead of the weekend and Dusseldorf's closure on Monday for Carnival. The FAZ index, calculated at midsession, showed a small rise of 0.99 to 709.75 for a gain of 1.9 per cent on the week, while the DAX index fell 4.77 to 1,745.13, up 1.6 per cent on the week. Turnover fell to DM6.0bn from DM8.5bn. Analysts said that under-lying sentiment remained positive. Mr Gary Dugan, European strategist at Baring Securities, said a visit to the Bundesbank this week reinforced his favourable stance towards interest rate-sensitive stocks, such as banks and insurers. He said that German inflation was likely to peak at 4.6 per cent in March, below previous estimates of 5 per cent, and fall further by mid-year. Money supply, which grew at an annualised rate of 9 per cent in January, should also be back within the Bundesbank's 5 1/2 per cent target by mid-year. These factors increased the possibility of an interest rate cut in the second half, Mr Dugan said. Klockner-Werke weighed on the steel sector, falling as low as DM116.50 on Thursday's news that it would pass the dividend on 1990/91 results. Analysts were surprised that the stock fell so much because the decision had not been unexpected. The stock closed DM5.90 lower at DM118.90. Thyssen lost DM1.60 to DM232.90 and Preussag slipped DM2.30 to DM384.70. The car sector gave back some of the week's gains, with Daimler-Benz down DM4.30 at DM757.50 and BMW DM4 off at DM562.50. PARIS ended slightly lower as the expiry of monthly options contracts brought the market off the day's highs. The CAC-40 index went as high as 1,995.59 before closing down 1.74 at 1,983.38, up 1.1 per cent on the week, in pre-weekend turnover of FFr2.8bn. Blue chips were mixed. Michelin added another 60 centimes to FFr172 on volume of 328,150 shares after touching a new 1992 intraday high of FFr173. Elf rose FFr1.50 to FFr390 with 297,900 shares traded but Total fell for the second day running, closing FFr5 down at FFr243. MILAN ended lower on a lack of interest before the weekend. The Comit index fell 4.47 to 536.03, hardly changed on the week, in turnover estimated near to Thursday's L95.8bn. The insurance and banking sectors continued to be weak. Banco di Roma fell 3.5 per cent or L90 to L2,335, while Banco di Santo Spirito dropped 3.4 per cent or L90 to L2,550 following Wednesday's news of a one-for-one share exchange. Generali dropped L525 to L30,950 and Ras fell L124 to L22,471. But Sai rose L535 to L15,700. AMSTERDAM was generally quiet and the CBS Tendency Index closed unchanged at 126.6, a 0.4 per cent rise on the week. Nedlloyd, the transport group, rose Fl 2.4 or 3.8 per cent to Fl 64.20 after news that European shipping lines were to co-operate in an effort to improve freight rates on Far East lines. Philips remained strong following Thursday's results and closed up Fl 0.80 at Fl 36.40, although down from the day's high of Fl 36.80. KLM showed a slight improvement after Thursday's announcement that merger talks with British Airways had failed: it was up Fl 0.40 or 1 per cent to Fl 38.60. Fokker's results, which showed a 4.3 per cent rise in 1991 net profits, and the announcement that it would pay a dividend for the first time since 1986, came after the market had closed. It finished down Fl 0.10 at Fl 31.70. ZURICH, led higher by UBS reporting a 36 per cent rise in 1991 profits, recorded a year's high. The SPI Index closed up 6.0 at 1,149.6, a rise of 1.4 per cent over the week. UBS bearers gained SFr80 to SFr3,930. Nestle bearers lost SFr20 to SFr9,490 on profit-taking. BRUSSELS followed early gains in Paris and Amsterdam. The Bel-20 index closed at the year's high, up 4.63 at 1,210.55, a rise of 2.3 per cent on the week. Turnover was BFr1.15bn. Petrofina gained BFr75 to BFr10,625. OSLO ended weaker with interest focused on Den Norske Bank after its shares were briefly suspended on concerns over its capital adequacy. The All-Share Index closed down 1.97 at 412.31 in turnover of NKr133m, a fall of 0.5 per cent on the week. DnB finished down NKr0.6 at NKr6.4, having traded at NKr5.30 prior to its suspension. The bank had reported earlier this month that 1991 net losses had risen threefold to NKr4.32bn after credit losses had swelled to NKr5.58bn. STOCKHOLM took some optimism from expectations that the central bank may soon cut interest rates. The Affarsvarlden General Index closed up 5.0 at 940.4, a gain of 0.9 per cent on the week. Turnover was SKr445m against SKr502m. MADRID also rose on hopes of further interest rate cuts, and a stronger opening on Wall Street. The general index closed up 1.83 at 266.51, a rise of 2.9 per cent on the week. Turnover was estimated at some Pta20bn. ISTANBUL fell as the rising dollar prompted selling by investors wanting to switch into the currency market. The 75-share market index closed at 3,664.36, down 91.61 on the day and 8.06 per cent lower on the week.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - FEB 28  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1170.16  1169.06  1170.58  1170.76  1170.73  1169.30  1170.65  1169.95  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Day's High  1170.98    Day's Low  1168.70  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Feb 27    Feb 26    Feb 25    Feb 24    Feb 21 1167.26   1165.89   1156.42   1163.91   1154.51  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOHN PAUL CAUTIONS RICH, SECULAR NORDIC SOCIETIES;  </P> <P> CELEBRATE MAN, NOT MACHINE, POPE ASKS  </P> <P> A stern moralist in the Land of the Midnight Sun, Pope John Paul II cautioned  the rich, secular societies Friday that mankind is more important than machines  and spirit more valuable than substance.  </P> <P> John Paul's arrival here at the Arctic tip of Europe -- latitude 69 degrees, 40  minutes north -- in nighttime daylight earned a modest footnote in the list of  firsts by history's most traveled pontiff: Never before had a Pope traveled  north of the Arctic Circle.  </P> <P> "I like it here," the Pope told Norwegian interviewers on the second day of a  10-day swing through the five Nordic countries.  </P> <P> John Paul came to Tromso to call on 621 Catholics, 30 nuns, eight priests and  one bishop who represent his church in the chill northern fastness.  </P> <P> "As Christians we proclaim a wisdom that recognizes and upholds the priority of  ethics over technology, the primacy of the person over things, the superiority  of spirit over matter," the Pope said in an address issued en route to Tromso.  </P> <P> In this "top-of-the-world" fishing and tourist port that is the traditional  jumping-off point for expeditions to the North Pole 1,375 miles away, John Paul  led a vesper service at light-as-noon 10 p.m.  </P> <P> The sun, which never sets here at this time of the year, tried mightily to  break through stratus clouds as the overcoated Pope addressed a festive  leather-jacket-and-gloves crowd of several thousand in the town's main square.  </P> <P> "(We are) gathered this evening in the long bright twilight of the north, in  the light of the unsetting sun which so clearly symbolizes Christ, the light of  the world, who is the same yesterday, today and forever," said a Pope obviously  enjoying himself.  </P> <P> In the prayer service structured as a papal analysis of the Lord's Prayer, John  Paul hailed scientific and technological advances that "have dispelled many of  our fears," but he warned against "the temptation to decide for ourselves what  is good and evil without reference to the God who made us."  </P> <P> Norway, flush with oil, has one of the highest standards of living in Europe.  All but a handful of the 4.2 million Norwegians are nominal Lutherans, but few  practice their faith in a liberal, socialist society.  </P> <P> En route north from Oslo, the Pope spent most of the day in Trondheim, the  third-largest city in Norway and the birthplace of Norwegian Christianity a  millennium ago. In a white-robed Mass for central Norway's 1,704 Catholics, he  distributed first communion to schoolchildren at a state technical university.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Norway's Patron Saint  </P> <P> Formerly Norway's capital, Trondheim, which sits at the mouth of an inviting  fjord, was home of 11th-Century King Olav II, who is patron saint of both  Norway's Catholics and Lutherans. The old king's bones once rested inside a  then-Catholic and now-Lutheran cathedral where the Pope prayed in an ecumenical  service Friday.  </P> <P> Symbol of historic Lutheran-Catholic hatreds in Norway, Olav's bones were  stolen during the Reformation and haven't been seen since. Where Olav lies  today is a Great Norwegian Mystery, although folks in Trondheim, not an  excitable lot, don't seem to talk much about it any more.  </P> <P> At Trondheim's copper-spired, Gothic Nindaros Cathedral, last rebuilt earlier  this century, John Paul told his Lutheran interlocutors that "before us lies  the duty of opening a new Christian chapter in history." Only four of Norway's  11 Lutheran bishops attended the service, packed with more than 2,000 people.  </P> <P> Speaking to Norwegians in a nationally televised address, the Pope cautioned  that "science and technology, like the economic life that they generate, cannot  of themselves articulate the meaning of existence or of human striving. They  cannot of themselves explain, much less eliminate, evil, suffering and death."  </P> <P> Traditions of community, home and family are being undermined today, the Pope  warned, "by transformations which do not always acknowledge the ethical  dimension inherent in all human activity and endeavor."  </P> <P> "We wish to be free, but unless there is common understanding of what we ought  to do, and not simply what we can do, freedom ends in the tyranny of  selfishness and superior force," the Pope said.  </P> <P> John Paul flies this morning from Norway to Iceland on the third day of his  Nordic pilgrimage -- the 42nd voyage of his reign -- that will also take him to  Finland, Denmark and Sweden.  </P></p>

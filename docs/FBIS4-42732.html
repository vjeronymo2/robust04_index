			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, June 7 (AFP) -- Jacques Delors, chief  executive of the European Union [EU], called here Tuesday [7  June] for the creation of an economic security council to  promote world economic stability.    Delors, president of the European Commission, said urgent  action was needed towards "global management of economic  problems."    He was speaking at the end of a three-day session of the  Commission on Global Governance, a body comprising 28 men and  women established by world leaders in 1992 to study global  cooperation following the end of the Cold War.    Delors identified the growing swell of world capital  movements as a particular threat to economic stability and  sustainable economic growth.    "If the rationale of the capital market goes against the  interests of the global neighbourhood, who can react?" he asked  at a press conference.    Delors's answer was an economic security council comprising  the United States, Japan, the EU, China, Russia and countries  heading regional economic organisation in Africa, Latin America,  Asia and the Pacific.    He proposes that such a council meet regularly with  representatives of such institutions as the World Bank, the  International Monetary Fund, the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade and the International Labour Organisation.    "We cannot go on talking about the global and the world  economy without knowing how to tackle the problem," Delors said.    He stressed the need to take a global view of a world  economy  becoming ever-more unified, and to establish links between  "trade, currencies, finance, the environment and polulation  growth."    Delors said that the international capital market had to  bear  much of the blame for the current rise in longterm interest  rates.    Co-chairing the Commission's meeting were the former  secretary-general of the Commonwealth, Shridath Ramphal, and  former Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson.    They said the meeting had also discussed a United Nations  peacekeeping force to extinguish flare-ups of violence, and ways  to make the UN more accountable to ordinary people and  organisations as well as governments.    But Ramphal would not be drawn on what action should be  taken  to bring countries such as China into line with international  standards of human rights.    "Good government doesn't need the suppression of one set of  values in favour of another," he told journalists when asked  whether the Asian drive towards economic development might clash  with individual human rights.</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FROM LINKS TO BOARDROOMS, DOORS ARE CLOSED  </P> <P> When the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Joe Lowery,  announced it would boycott the Shoal Creek Country Club in Birmingham, Ala., he  said, "To cooperate with evil is to affirm it."  </P> <P> Lowery must have been gratified by the response to his condemnation. Corporate  sponsors of the 1990 Professional Golf Assn. Championship threatened to reduce  their financial participation in the tournament because Shoal Creek seemed to  discriminate against blacks. So Shoal Creek invited a black man to be a member.  There was figurative cheek kissing, warm fuzzies passed out all around. And  there will be no boycott.  </P> <P> The acceptance of one black man to "honorary membership" in the Shoal Creek  golf club is a baby step in the giant war against institutional racism. Indeed,  some of the very sponsors who said they'd not be part of a discriminatory  tournament are probably part of some other discriminatory activity. Their  corporate boardrooms probably look no different than the Shoal Creek locker  room -- white, male and unapologetic until those who are raising questions put  financial muscle behind their queries.  </P> <P> Few golf clubs have written rules that exclude blacks, but of the 25 clubs that  will host future U.S. Golf Assn. or PGA tournaments 16 do not have black  members. Similarly, most corporations say they are equal opportunity employers,  but few have blacks in senior management. Golf clubs exclude blacks and other  minorities by requiring that two or three members provide references for  prospective members. There are rarely two or three to be found to bring color  to a club that was once all white.  </P> <P> This is nothing but the old boy network hard at work again. It encourages and  promotes people who look and act so much like each other that eye contact is  not much different than a glance at the mirror. It is friends and friends of  friends, keeping doors closed to protect their turf. They can write down the  rules, but if the laws change they can remind themselves, in the words of Shoal  Creek's founder, Hall W. Thompson, that black membership in their private clubs  "just isn't done."  </P> <P> But the members of these white male clubs often claim their memberships as a  tax deduction, and say they use their clubs to do business. All of us pay for  their segregated membership, pay for them to stand at the first hole and  whisper those three magic words, "Let's do business," into a colleague's ear.  Because few, if any, of their colleagues are people of color, the doors to the  boardroom have been as firmly slammed as the golf links have been closed. And  as dollars trickle away from our tax coffers to subsidize rites of white male  bonding, all of us pay for the way the doors slam.  </P></p>

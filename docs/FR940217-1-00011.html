			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definition of a person. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of a person found in paragraph (a)(2) of the reproposed rule varies only slightly from the proposed definition. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The lone modification to this definition would be the deletion of the term ``trust'' and the addition of the phrase ``persons, entities, partnerships, or other groups acting as a trustee.'' The addition of this phrase addresses a legal issue raised by a private pension trust, which asserted that a trust may not be deemed a person because it does not have a present ability to act ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  effect transactions) separate from its trustee. The Market Reform Act intended that trusts of all types be included in the definition of a large trader. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The definition of a person contained in paragraph (a)(2) of the reproposed rule would assure that all trusts, through their trustees, are included within the definition of a person and thus may be large traders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Proposing Release, 56 FR 42552, at n. 26 and accompanying text.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definition of an account. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(3) of the reproposed rule would add a definition for the term ``account or accounts.'' This term was not defined in the proposed rule and the comments received from banks, investment advisers, and other non-broker-dealer market participants exhibited substantial confusion in this respect. The Commission believes that this confusion led the commenters to incorrectly interpret ``who'' the Commission intended to be included within the definition of a large trader. These commenters appear to have believed, incorrectly, that the accounts of ``small'' trust or advisory customers would become large traders, with all of the duties attendant thereto, by virtue of the fact that a large trader exercised control over such accounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission, therefore, is proposing new paragraph (a)(3) that would define the term account or accounts to mean each proprietary and customer account maintained or carried by a registered broker or dealer, which is disclosed or undisclosed to such broker or dealer as to ownership, and for which books and records are required to be kept in accordance with the provisions of Rule 17a&hyph;3 under the Exchange Act. This definition would clarify that only accounts maintained or carried by broker-dealers under the Exchange Act would be subject to the reproposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definition of ownership. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ownership would be narrowed and reorganized in paragraph (a)(4) of the reproposed rule. The apparent breadth of this definition received extensive comments, especially with respect to its impact on the proposed rules for aggregation and the information required to be provided on Form 13H. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission also received many comments on the proposed inclusion of custodians or nominees within the definition of ownership.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> infra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Sections III.A.2. and III.B.2., for a discussion of the reproposed rules pertaining to aggregation and Form 13H, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the commenters failed to understand that the concept of ownership is focused on the ``accounts of a person.'' The Commission, however, acknowledges that the proposed definition of ownership, combined with the rules for aggregation, may support some of the sweeping interpretations of the proposed definition of a large trader expressed in the comments. These commenters broadly interpreted the proposed definition of ownership and the rules for aggregation to require: (1) The aggregation of individual accounts of all employees, officers, directors, controlling shareholders, and partners with their large trader corporation, trust, or partnership, irrespective of such individual's role in the trading decisions of the large trader entity; (2) the accounts of all parent, subsidiary, and affiliated companies within a holding company structure to be aggregated by and with each parent, subsidiary, or affiliate; and (3) the accounts of wholly unrelated large trader entities to be aggregated due to common directors, controlling shareholders, partners, or trustees. In response to these comments, the Commission has revised the proposed definition of ownership.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General definition. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ownership, as reproposed in paragraph (a)(4), would provide that an account of a person shall be deemed to be owned or under common ownership of the person in whose name an account is maintained, or custodian or nominee that maintains an omnibus account, and any other person who has more than a 10 percent financial interest in the equity in the account or accounts of such person. This reproposed definition of ownership would incorporate existing rules, procedures, and practices that require broker-dealers to maintain the name and address of the beneficial owner of an account and would be interpreted consistently with such rules, procedures, and practices. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Rule 17a&hyph;3(a)(9)(i) under the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 240.17a&hyph;3(a)(9)(i).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The reproposed rule states that ``an account of a person'' would be deemed to be owned or under common ownership, thus emphasizing that the primary focus of the concept of ownership would be the ``accounts of a person,'' and not ownership of the person itself. Accordingly, under the reproposed rule, accounts maintained in the name of a parent, subsidiary, or affiliate would be deemed to be owned by that parent, subsidiary, or affiliate. This focus would be made evident in the reproposed Schedules 6a and 6b to Form 13H.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The focus on accounts also would address those comments that deemed the accounts of employees, officers, directors, controlling shareholders, and partners to be owned by their respective corporation or partnership, irrespective of such individual's role or lack thereof, in the trading decisions of the large trader entity. The reproposed rule would eliminate the sweeping nature of the proposed definition by providing that an account is owned or under common ownership of the entity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) Commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, General Michael  Rose on Sunday said that analysis had been completed but it was  impossible to say which of the warring sides had on Saturday  fired a mortar shell on an open air market in Sarajevo, killing  68 people and wounding nearly 200. REUTER said that General  Rose had visited the market on Sunday together with UNPROFOR  Commander for the former Yugoslavia, Gen. Jean Cot, and civilian  head of UNPROFOR Yasushi Akashi to inspect `the mortar crater  and surrounding shrapnel holes.' The UNPROFOR officials were  accompanied by Sarajevo's Muslim Mayor Muhamed Kresevljakovic  and Bosnian Muslim Interior Minister Bakir Alispahic. Akashi  was quoted by the AFP as saying there were some suspicions but  it could not be said with certainty who was responsible for the  tragedy.    The Bosnian Serbs on Saturday categorically rejected the  Bosnian Muslim accusations that Bosnian Serb troops were  responsible for the crime, and it called for an urgent  investigation to be carried out by a joint commission of  representatives of UNPROFOR, the Bosnian Serb and the Muslim  sides. The proposal was turned down by the Muslims.    After visiting the market in Sarajevo, Akashi and General  Cot  went to meet with the Bosnian Muslim presidency, according to  the AFP. The two officials are to leave Sarajevo on Sunday  afternoon, according to the same source. Representative of the  office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sergio  Mele on Sunday said the evacuation of the wounded had begun.    Mele said that U.N. armoured personnel carriers were being  used to take the wounded from city hospitals to the airport. He  said 58 wounded were expected to be evacuated.</p>

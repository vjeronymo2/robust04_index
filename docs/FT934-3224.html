			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Properties strong Property stocks were at the vanguard of the market's surge as new industry statistics underlined the sector's recent strong performance. Investment valuations for November in a survey by Richard Ellis, the property agency, show a rise of 15.6 per cent on a year ago and also the highest month-on-month increase from October since the index began 13 years ago. Land Securities hit a record high, jumping 16 to 783p, MEPC advanced 14 to 560p and British Land, reporting interims today, climbed 6 to 444p. Conglomerate Hanson gained 6 at 266 1/2 p on news that the US miners unions had struck a tentative deal following a six-month strike against members of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, which represents leading US coal companies. The strike hit Hanson's Peabody and Eastern Associated subsidiaries. Dealers in the banks sector were by no means surprised at the latest attempts by some marketmakers to push through a widening of spreads in the sector. Some traders attempted to widen the previous 5p spread between buying and selling prices in the leading banks to 7p, but the move was resisted by three of the biggest traders in the sector, SG Warburg, UBS and Kleinwort Benson. Attempts by some marketmakers to widen dealing spreads in banks were first made last Friday. The big UK institutions were said to have refused to deal at the wider spreads, which reverted to 5p within an hour of the opening. Some marketmakers have come under increasing pressure in the sector, which has been among the market's best performing areas this year as provisions against bad debts have begun to shrink and low interest rates have reduced lending risks for the banks. Profits are set to surge ahead, as are dividends, as shown by the recent profits surge and 25 per cent dividend increase announced by Royal Bank of Scotland, 6 up at 452p. The big squeeze in bank shares continued yesterday as marketmakers again bid prices higher to try to balance their trading books. All of the high street banks set all-time highs, Abbey National advancing 20 to 480p, TSB 6 to 241p, Barclays 16 to 642p, HSBC 15 to 803p, Lloyds 8 to 654p and National Westminster 16 to 615p. Talk that Mr David Michels, chief executive at Stakis, could be linked to a top job at Ladbroke was said to be one reason for Stakis shares slipping yesterday. Analysts said Mr Michels' support of Ladbroke's Hilton hotels arm at a court case in the US had prompted the speculation. Stakis, which finished 3 adrift at 59p, was also affected by newspaper reports of property valuations in the hotel industry. Ladbroke added 6 1/2 at 152p. Media conglomerate Pearson rose 20 to 595p on hopes that the pricing of Camco International, its US oil services subsidiary, a majority interest of which is due to be floated in the US soon, was going well. Analysts said there were further potential gains from a successful conclusion of the Gatt world trade talks, particularly in the international copyright. Gatt hopes also helped Reed International, up 18 at 823p.</p>

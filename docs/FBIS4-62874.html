			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku, 18 MAY (SNARK)--The Azeri President Geydar  Aliyev's visit to Georgia, which had to take place today is  postponed. Sources in Baku refrain from commenting on the  reasons of the visit's abolition.    The observers say, Aliyev was obliged to postpone his visit  because of the aggravation of the internal situation in  Azerbaijan. It is due to the adoption by Azerbaijan of the  Bishkek protocol and the possible signing of the Moscow  agreement on the Karabakh conflict's settlement.    In connection with this, the Azeri opposition forces will  try  to obtain the abolition of the "disgraceful for Azerbaijan"  Bishkek protocol during the today's session of the Milli Majlis.    Meanwhile, the speaker of Parliament Rasul Guliyev, signed  the Bishkek protocol and roused the opposition's range, came out  the other day in support of the Milli Majlis dissolution. He  said rejecting the Russian peaceful initiative the Parliament is  going against the national interests of the Azerbaijani people.</p>

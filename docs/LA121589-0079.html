			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> TEXAS;  </P> <P> WOMAN GETS RECORD CRASH JUDGMENT  </P> <P> A woman whose family burned to death in a 1982 car fire won a $43.2-million  judgment in a state court in Houston against Toyota, the largest award ever  entered against the company. Nike Adegbite, 36, had watched while her husband  and two daughters died in the burning car. Two other people also died in the  fire when the woman's 1973 Toyota Corona station wagon caught fire after being  rear-ended on a Houston highway. The plaintiff's lawyer had argued that the  crash pushed the station wagon's fuel tank forward, puncturing the tank on an  empty spare tire carrier and a valve on the rear axle.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Ivica Saric reporting] The Muslim army continued  its attacks on our army in the Lasva valley [central Bosnia]  this morning -- Ivica Saric reporting from Vitez for Croatian  radio.    An artillery and infantry attack was carried out at 0635  [0535 GMT] from the direction of Travnik and Slimena towards the  Vitez area against the [Croat] defense forces comprising the  Stjepan Tomasevic Brigade and the Travnicka Brigade in the area  of (?Smrinka) and Nevic Polje. Forty inmates from Travnik  prison, who have been promised an amnesty if they break through  the positions of the Croat Defense Council [HVO], are also in  the aggressors' formations. After fierce fighting the attack  was repelled. The HVO suffered one killed and two wounded, and  the indications are that the Muslim army suffered at least five  killed and many wounded. In addition, the defenders succeeded  in seizing an M-84 machine gun.    An attack of similar strength was also repelled in the area  of Kruscica in the region of (?Sofe). At 0750 [0650 GMT] the  enemy army continued the attack it suspended last night on the  (?Buhina Kuca) region and the Vitez-Busovaca road. Here the  aggressor is trying to expand the territory it occupied  yesterday, which is 100 metres by 150 metres. In the fierce and  [word indistinct] fighting for every house and every square  metre the HVO formations are, for the time being, thwarting the  intentions of the Muslim army.    As regards the often mentioned Vitez-Busovaca road, it is  worth saying that it has been out of action throughout the  period of Muslim aggression, so there is no question of the  cutting of communications between Vitez and Busovaca.    According to information which has reached the area of Vitez  so far, the consequences of yesterday's Muslim offensive are  serious -- seven killed and 35 wounded, while 35 people are  listed as missing, and of these 14 are women, of whom it is  known that they have sought refuge in a safe village not far  from the focus of yesterday's Muslim offensive.</p>

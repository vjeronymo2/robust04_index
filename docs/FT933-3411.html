			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Clarke to hold firm on public pay: Stand against 'catch up' awards likely to provoke teacher unrest MR KENNETH Clarke, the chancellor, will today underline the government's commitment to tight control of public-sector pay, in a move that seems likely to provoke further disputes between the government and teachers' unions. He will tell the Teachers' Pay Review Body, in a submission from the Treasury, that the coming year should not be used to compensate public employees for a year of pay restraint. The same tough message will be delivered to nurses, doctors and top civil servants whose salaries are also set by review bodies. In last November's autumn statement, the government pre-empted the work of the review bodies, which make recommendations covering about one in four of public-sector employees, and imposed a 1.5 per cent limit on salary increases for public-sector workers. This year, ministers have made clear they will not set a particular figure, but will expect what Mr Clarke has called the 'current pay realism' to continue. Yesterday, teachers' unions made clear that they expect pay rises this year that allow them to 'catch up' with equivalent jobs in the private sector. The National Association of Head Teachers called for an award 'well in excess of any government pay norm'. Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said that the teaching profession 'must be allowed to catch up the value lost through the government's misguided public-sector pay policy'. The National Union of Teachers, the largest teachers' union, is expected to make its pay claim on Thursday. In the further-education sector, the Colleges' Employers Forum, which represents 350 colleges in England and Wales, said it would be offering '1.5 per cent, the maximum allowed under public-sector policy, and no more'. Mr Roger Ward, chief executive of the forum, said a claim by the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education, the largest union in the sector, would add about 20 per cent to the colleges' wage bill. College principals are also seeking a high court injunction banning the union from carrying out a planned one-day strike against proposed new contracts on September 21.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Discussion between Hiroshi Kato, dean of General Policy </F> Science Department, Keio University and chairman of the  government Tax Commission, and Masaru Yoshitomi, deputy director  of the Long-Term Credit Bank General Research Institute: "On  the Problems and Future of the Japanese Economy"; place and date  not given]    [Text] [Kato] For the reduction of the income tax to bear  full fruit, it is important to implement it at the right time,  when all conditions for it are completed.    I think that such conditions have been considerably  completed  already. We had better implement an income tax cut starting 1  January 1994 ahead of schedule and consider raising the  consumption tax rate during the period when they coincide.    [Yoshitomi] It is said that, "in a democratic society there  are people who call for tax reductions in time of recession, but  there are none who call for tax increases in time of  prosperity." However, if the combination of the present tax cut  and the future tax hike, which can overcome the problem  mentioned above, is consolidated, we should implement an income  tax cut as a means of economic recovery and we can fully expect  its fruit.  <H3>  Implementation of an Income Tax Cut and a Consumption Tax  Hike </H3>   [Kato] A recent sharp drop in personal consumption has a lot  to do with the negative assets effect -- a decrease in family  assets due to the bubble economy's collapse. Worried about a  decrease in their assets, people have hurriedly decreased their  consumption and have increased their savings. I think that a  higher savings rate among the aged in particular might have been  caused by such a phenomenon.    The fruits of the income tax cut cannot be expected and the  income tax cut cannot become an economic stimulus measure unless  we can stop the negative assets effect.    Recently, however, the negative assets effect has finally  disappeared and conditions which can produce a positive assets  effect have been created. If land prices decrease another 15  percent in the case of residential areas and another 25 percent  in the case of commercial areas, the rate of variation of land  prices and the rate of increase of nominal gross national  product will approximately match, where the land prices become  stable in general. If that happens, a positive assets effect  will come about, which in turn will further ensure the income  tax cut's fruit.    [Yoshitomi] What is important in discussing the income tax  cut is to determine the extent of expansion of consumption in  proportion to the scale of the tax cut. In theory, it is  possible for the consumers to save all the taxes reduced in  anticipation of a future tax hike. Will 3 trillion yen or none  be consumed out of the 5-trillion-yen tax cut? Only the actual  proof can answer such a question. One actual proof study shows  that nearly 3 trillion yen will be consumed.    [Kato] In any case, I do not think that the income tax cut  alone will be enough to stimulate consumption. Unless we  provide an opportunity to consume the income increased through  the tax cut, motivation to spend will not come about.    For that purpose, we should decide in advance that the  consumption tax will be raised after one year or 15 months. If  we do that, we can expect the last-minute expansion of  consumption during that period. There are people who say that  since this is only a last-minute demand, consumption will  decline after a temporary increase in demand. However, if the  economic environment improves even through such a temporary  expansion of consumption, that will trigger a continuous  expansion, and there is a very fair possibility that the economy  as a whole will pick up.    [Yoshitomi] I agree with your opinion that the fruits of the  last-minute demand can be expected. Therefore, what is  important is how to realize a combination of the present tax cut  and the future tax hike.    [Kato] However, the government and ruling coalition  parties intend to issue deficit-covering bonds to finance an  income tax cut. It is not that I have an antipathy to  deficit-covering bonds. If it is certain that we can reduce  deficit-covering bonds in the future, I am not against them.    Actually, however, it is impossible to extinguish  deficit-covering bonds once they are issued, which has already  been proven by history. In Japan, former Prime Minister  Masayoshi Ohira promised to extinguish deficit-covering bonds,  but to no avail. The Ad Hoc Commission on Administrative Reform  chaired by Mr. Doi decided to extinguish deficit-covering bonds,  but it took the Commission as long as 10 years to do so,  including an additional period necessitated by the collapse of  the bubble economy.    [Yoshitomi] Since 1973, which was called the first year of  welfare, the welfare budgets have been expanded; the prolonged  recession after the oil shock, as well as the tax reductions,  had increased budget deficits; furthermore, the theory that  Japan and West Germany should be the locomotives of the world --  the locomotive theory -- was developed in 1977-78. Because of  the various demands from both within and without the country,  Japan's budget deficits showed a rapid increase in the  seventies. For this reason, Japan had to dedicate the eighties  to financial reconstruction.    [Kato] Government finances, once expanded under a recession,  can never be reduced, even when business prosperity returns. In  economics there is Peacock's "the rule of transfer" [as  published] but, the government finances once expanded in time of  emergency do not return to normal even after the end of the  emergency. This is a common occurrence.    [Yoshitomi] Since we have promoted our financial  reconstruction to such a level with much effort, we should exert  our ingenuity in implementing short-term economic stimulus  measures without committing the same error committed during the  seventies and eighties.    [Kato] Issuing deficit-covering bonds will bring serious  consequences. I was against the income tax cut financed by  deficit-covering bonds which we cannot be sure of redeeming.  However, if the present tax cut is combined with the future tax  hike, I do not mind the issuance of short-term deficit-covering  bonds as a revenue source.    What is important in that case is not a revenue source but  seeing the present tax cut and the future tax hike always in the  same perspective.    I think that as a temporary measure there should be a  one-year to about a one-and-a-half-year grace period between the  initiation of the tax cut and the increases of the consumption  tax. However, if the resultant economic recovery is not  satisfactory, the initiation of the tax hike should be  postponed, with a future tax hike in mind.    [Yoshitomi] I think that the grace period of one and a half  to two years is enough time before the consumption tax rate is  raised; I think that a certain degree of economic recovery is  expected in the first or latter half of 1994.    It was said around the spring of 1993 that there would be a  slow economic recovery in the latter half of 1993 due to the  adjustment of capital stock. Things turned out quite contrary  to our expectations. There are three reasons for that: 30  percent appreciation of the effective exchange rate of the yen;  the cooler summer; and the delay of the execution of public  investment due to the general contractor scandals. For these  reasons, economic recovery was delayed for about a year.    However, if an income tax cut is feasible starting in  January  1994, its effects will be produced in the latter half of 1994.  If the prospect of the deferred adjustment of capital stock  becomes certain, an economic recovery will begin in the latter  half of 1994, although it was one year behind schedule.  Therefore, the necessary conditions for a tax hike will be  ready by 1996. Of course, since an income tax cut alone is not  sufficient as an economic stimulus measure, it is necessary, for  example, to discuss the problem of the bad debts held by banks.  <H3>  The Method of Introducing Public Funds for the Writing Off  of Bad Assets Held by Financial Institutions </H3>   [Kato] Concerning the question as to whether or not public  funds should be used for the writing off of bad assets held by  financial institutions, the important thing is whether the  financial institution themselves are really serious about  writing off their bad assets and are making efforts for that  purpose.    [Yoshitomi] If bad assets are to be written off by the  introduction of public funds, financial institutions must  clarify such managerial problems as nondividend-paying and  deficit settlement of accounts; otherwise, the market does not  function well.    [Kato] Concerning the introduction of public funds for the  writing off of bad assets, I think it is good to provide a  chance for that. For example, agriculture and forestry-related  bad assets amounting to 6 trillion yen is held by housing loan  companies. I think it is right that the government should pay  the 6 trillion yen in the form of public funds, based on the  idea that public funds should be used for public industries.  However, such an undertaking will cause an objection -- why  should the government help private financial institutions?    [Yoshitomi] As you said, the media calls for the  implementation of economic stimulus measures, but at the same  time, it calls a stop to whatever measures are to be taken to  stimulate a sluggish economy caused by bad assets held by  financial institutions.    [Kato] I am not for the introduction of public funds without  reservations, but I am sure it is time to think of introducing  them.    [Yoshitomi] Chairman Greenspan of the U.S. Federal Reserve  Bank commented on the issue of bad assets held by financial  institutions: "Because of their bad assets, the banks are  unwilling to extend loans. As a result, economic recovery is  unsatisfactory, thus delaying the solution of employment  problems. If that is the case, a drastic reduction of interest  rates will be conducive to the economy as a whole."    In short, a drastic reduction of interest rates will let the  banks earn interest margins and at the same time make them lower  loan interest rates -- let the banks earn business net profits  and make the banks use the profits as depreciation funds. When  you make the banks lower loan interest rates when they are  intent on earning interest margins, you have no alternative but  to drastically lower deposit rates.    [Kato] Concerning the money flow, we must change the present  framework in which postal savings are overwhelmingly  predominant. As compared with the 18 trillion yen collected by  private financial institutions in 1992, there is 19 trillion yen  of postal savings, less than half of which, about 8.8 trillion  yen, was used for fiscal investment and loans. The rest went to  the Bank of Japan for the purchase of government bonds or to  stock markets for the purpose of so-called price-keeping  operations.    [Yoshitomi] Concerning stock price-keeping operations, I was  in charge of the comprehensive economic measures concerned with  those operations. When the average stock price is on the point  of dropping below the 14,000-yen level, the market runs into a  kind of system crisis. Therefore, every effort is made by all  concerned, including securities firms, so that the average stock  price will not drop further. However, the purpose is to  strictly prevent the rapid fall of stock prices and to avoid a  system crisis; therefore, instantaneous countermeasures must be  taken.    However, the countermeasures were taken for more than a year  thereafter, and stock prices came to be formed artificially. As  a result, the stock market transaction balance has continued to  dwindle to the dismay of securities firms, which has caused  people to entertain the opinion that price-keeping operations  are for the rescue of financial institutions.    [Kato] Seen from such an angle, it is evident that the  aggrandizement of postal savings distorts the flow of Japan's  money. Therefore, postal savings, taking up a little more  reserved position, should play a more supportive role for the  sake of private financial institutions.    [Yoshitomi] Concerning postal savings, the discussion  inevitably centers on how to implement "the outflow" of postal  savings, since it is impossible to hold back "the inflow" of  postal savings. At present, however, it is difficult to discuss  the outflow of postal savings.    For, when private loans by financial institutions do not  increase because of their holding bad assets, or when small and  midsize firms, in particular, are unable to obtain loans, other  countries cannot take direct action against these; but, for the  purpose of fiscal investment and loans, Japan has governmental  financial agencies intended to help small and midsize firms; and  to our amazement, the agencies' loans are still increasing at  the rate of 7 percent a year. Therefore, even when financial  institutions find it difficult to extend loans, small and  midsize firms are relatively free from troubles.    Things are going rather well on a short-term basis, and that  may be the reason long-term reforms are difficult to implement  at present.  <H5>  The Economy Is on the Track to Gradual Recovery in 1994 </H5>   [Kato] Now, concerning the economy in 1994, first of all, I  think that adverse assets effect will change into positive  assets effect. In addition, if a deregulation series is  implemented, local beer will be made in various places and  medicine will be sold at convenience stores, thus increasing  business opportunities.    [Yoshitomi] Recently, there have been people who say that "a  depression is coming," but I am absolutely sure that there will  be no depression.    For example, if Japan's unemployment rate rises to 25  percent  like the Great Depression in the United States, we may call it a  depression. At present, Japan's unemployment rate is 2.7  percent, which may rise to nearly 3.5, but that is anything but  a depression. In addition, the former Great Depression was a  worldwide phenomenon and each nation resorted to extreme  protectionism. At present, however, there exists GATT, and  trade rules are in good order. Moreover, at that time, there  were no thriving countries like Asia today.    [Kato] If general contractor scandals subside and public  works begin to be undertaken, then an income tax cut should be  implemented. The consumption tax should be raised in the  future; but, for the time being, the present 4.5 percent  consumption tax on passenger cars, for example, should be  lowered to 3.0 percent. We can expect the last-minute stimulus  effects.    [Yoshitomi] People say it is terrible to have their overtime  work shortened and their bonuses reduced. Conversely, the  reduction of wages keeps Japan's employment as it is. The  reason Europe's unemployment rate is high is because wages do  not decrease even in time of recession because of the downward  rigidity of wages. In addition, enterprises have to bear a  tremendous amount of nonwage labor costs, such as installments  for social security systems, besides wages. A wage system with  such extreme downward rigidity and high nonwage costs have  raised Europe's unemployment rate.    This is not the case in Japan. Such an adjustment mechanism  of Japan's labor market is highly evaluated all over the world.  Wages should be determined flexibly at the market. In  forecasting the economy for 1994, no opinion is more erroneous  than the one that the higher spring wage settlements go up, the  weaker the consumption recession becomes.    Higher wages will increase unemployment and strengthen the  consumption recession. In addition, an income tax cut of 5-6  trillion yen will probably have the power to raise real wages  nearly 2 percent. Furthermore, the rise of consumption prices  will become almost zero.    [Kato] Concerning land measures, reconsideration of the land  tax has not been made yet. However, we can make an exception to  the rule when one uses the proceeds of land sales to buy a  choice lot, or we can reduce the tax on the profit upon  alienation. If these are complied with, the economy's bottom  will further firm down more than ever before.    [Yoshitomi] The appreciation of the yen exerts a negative  influence on the economy for the first year, but afterward it  works for the raising of real income through a deduction in  commodity prices. A combination of three excess stock  adjustments -- the adjustment of capital stock of manufacturing  industries, of excess stock of office buildings, and of excess  stock of durable goods for domestic use -- is the fundamental  reason for the current recession. Of the three adjustments, the  adjustment of capital stock of manufacturing industries and of  excess stock of durable goods for domestic use had been expected  to be almost completed by the latter half of 1993.    For this reason, a slow economic recovery was supposed to  begin around early autumn of 1993, which was delayed for another  year due to the higher yen, the scandals of general contractors  and a cool summer.    Judging from this, it is certain that there will be an  economic recovery in the latter half of 1994. The medium- and  long-term growth rate of Japan's future economy may be weaker by  about 1 point compared with the growth rate of a little over 4  percent after the oil shock. However, Japan has the power to  grow at about 3 percent due to its higher savings rate and its  greater research and development investment than Europe and the  United States.    [Kato] Both of us have a bright prospect for 1994. However,  unless political reform bills are agreed upon and budget  compilation is moved forward, this scenario may come to naught.</p>

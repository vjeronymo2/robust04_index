			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / AEEU to assist unions in Romania THE GOVERNMENT is encouraging the AEEU engineering and electrical union to provide know-how to the nascent free trade unions of Romania, Michael Smith writes. The Foreign Office's 'know-how fund' has paid the expenses of Mr Nigel Harris, an AEEU executive councillor, for a visit to the former communist country. It has also agreed in principle to a two-week visit by eight union officials. The Foreign Office's know-how fund was set up to provide technical assistance for east European countries to adapt to market economies. Although the money for the AEEU will have only a limited impact on the fund's annual budget of Pounds 46m, its use may raise the eyebrows of some Tory MPs. The AEEU is a moderate union but led the successful campaign for a 37-hour week for engineering workers. The AEEU's engineering section last year incurred a deficit of Pounds 949,714, according to accounts published yesterday.</p>

Taped inside a gritty nightclub with a live "house band," the show  will test contestants' knowledge of hard-core rock trivia and gossip as they  play their way through three brain-numbing, and often eardrum-shattering,  rounds of plays.  </P> <P> "You're On the Air With Dr. Ruth," a new call-in show for adults hosted by  reigning sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer, will premiere on Lifetime July 6 at  midnight. The half-hour show, featuring celebrity and expert guests, will  address adult sexuality and relationships.  </P> <P> Mike Ritter of Rock Creek, Ohio, the man who lost his pants going after a fly  ball in a softball game, won the $100,000 grand prize in the recent season  finale of ABC's "America's Funniest Home Videos." There were 14 contestants  from the program's weekly $10,000 winners.  </P> <P> MINISERIES  </P> <P> "The Godfather Wars," based on a series of articles by New York Newsday  reporter Tom Renner, is a four-hour miniseries being planned by NBC for the  1990-91 season. The TV drama explores the complex personal relationships and  power struggles inside one of New York's organized-crime families during the  1970s and early 1980s.  </P> <P> Stuart Woods' best-selling novel "Grass Roots" served as the inspiration for a  four-hour political thriller that NBC is now casting. The story follows Will  Lee, a well-respected lawyer and politician about to undertake a campaign for a  seat in the U.S. Senate. His life begins to unravel when he is forced to defend  a young white man for the brutal murder of a beautiful black activist.  </P> <P> MOVIES  </P> <P> On July 4 beginning at midnight, KCOP will run a string of uninterrupted and  unedited classic movies to celebrate Independence Day.

The mystery-thriller stars Nancy Allen as a wife and mother suffering  from amnesia who must protect her family from the actress Vanity, a vengeful  woman who blames Allen for the loss of her lover.  </P> <P> When Veronica Hamel is raped by prominent attorney Judd Hirsch, her nightmare  is just beginning in "She Said No," an NBC movie beginning production this  month for the 1990-91 TV season. After Hirsch is acquitted of the criminal  charge on a technicality, he shocks Hamel and prosecuting attorney Lee Grant by  representing himself in a multimillion-dollar slander suit against Hamel,  forcing her to face him again under cross-examination.  </P> <P> Two more movies NBC has planned for 1990-91: "Aftermath: the Fate of Flight  1501," starring Lee Remick, is a fictional drama about the wife of a commercial  airline pilot who attempts to clear her husband's name of the charge of "pilot  error" by reconstructing the events leading up to his fatal crash. And Dana  Delany of "China Beach" headlines "Angels Without Wings," based on a true story  about a Cape Cod family whose quiet life is shattered when a double tragedy  leaves four orphan boys on their doorstep.  </P> <P> CARTOONS  </P> <P> Tom Cruise, who recently urged Earth Day celebrants in Washington to help save  the planet, has dropped out as television's Capt. Planet because he is too  busy. But "Capt. Planet and the Planeteers," Ted Turner's cartoon eco-series,  will press on. Production continues on the 26-episode, $7.8 million project to  alert kids to dangers to the environment. The show's producers are searching  for Cruise's replacement.  </P> <P> Hanna-Barbera has announced casts for two new syndicated cartoons to premiere  this fall. "Monster Tails," about famous monster pets, features the voices of  Jonathan Winters, Tim Curry, Frank Welker, Charlie Adler, Pat Musick and Dick  Gautier.

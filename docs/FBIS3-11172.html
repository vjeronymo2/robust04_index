			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bahia State Governor Antonio Carlos </F> Magalhaes by Cristiana Lobo; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [Lobo] Is [Foreign Minister] Fernando Henrique  Cardoso the PFL [Liberal Front Party] candidate?    [Magalhaes] No. The PFL has a natural candidate, a party  candidate. I am that candidate. As I intend to resign on 30  March, I could tour Brazil, boost my image, and become a strong  candidate. But this is not what I am going to do. I want to  become senator for Bahia State. I believe the political forces  must be able to find a common candidate to face the critical  situation that the country is experiencing. If possible we will  select a common candidate. It could be Fernando Henrique  Cardoso, some other member of his party, or a candidate from  another party. There are some very good names.    [Lobo] Who?    [Magalhaes] It may be someone from the PP [Popular Party] or  the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party]. Citing names is always  unpleasant because no one likes to be excluded. Everyone  believes that he is capable of resolving the country's problems.  This is why I will not cite names. Some are known to the  public, others will have to campaign to become known by the  public...    [Lobo] The PFL was initially critical following the launch  of  the economic plan. What has now changed: the plan or the PFL?    [Magalhaes] The PFL did not change nor is the plan  successful. One thing is certain: The PFL supported all the  measures submitted by Itamar [Franco's] government to save  Brazil. But, this has not happened. It is not the fault of the  PFL that the plan will not succeed. Leaving the plan aside, the  PFL believes Cardoso has aptitude. But he is not the only one  who has the necessary aptitude to resolve Brazil's problems.  Like Cardoso, there are others who can make Brazil grow again.  Brazil needs an administrator. It is a question of observing  who is administering his state appropriately in order to choose  a good presidential candidate.    [Lobo] Is the PFL making any demands over joining a  coalition?    [Magalhaes] The PFL could make demands, it even has the  right  to make them. But it's strength lies in the fact that it wants  the basic points of its program to be studied by associates of  an alliance. These points must be taken seriously because they  are very important. We are convinced that no one can govern  Brazil well without adopting the basic points of our program,  because they are the hallmarks of a candidate that wants to save  Brazil and get it out of the chaos. To have political interests  is natural. Those who deny it are hypocrites. The PFL does not  admit incongruous conduct. Over the years the party has helped  in the functioning of the democratic system. We do not accept  those who have no tradition of struggling for democracy, but who  now talk about democracy and at the same time about social  democracy. [passage omitted]    [Lobo] How will the PFL channel talks with other parties?    [Magalhaes] The PFL has competent people, and a competent,  experienced, and serious man at the head of the party who has  the ability to command. He is Jorge Bornhausen. He is  currently leading very well with a democratic spirit and with a  lot of aplomb. He has clearly demonstrated that the PFL wants to  resolve Brazil's problems.    [Lobo] Problems always appear over the vice presidential  candidacy of your party when an alliance between the PSDB  [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] and the PFL is discussed.    [Magalhaes] We do not accept any type of problems. If there  are problems, the respective party should resolve them  internally. When the PFL has a problem it is always discussed  internally. If you are referring to the PSDB, then it is up to  the leaders that want to dispute the presidency to resolve the  problem so they can talk with authority.    [Lobo] Could this alliance include the PDT [Democratic Labor  Party]?    [Magalhaes] When I defend an alliance I believe no one  should  be excluded from the consultation. It is the situation,  specially a party platform situation, that excludes a person.  The way to react and to administrate, the way to perceive how  the country's problems can be resolved are what separates one  person from another. This why Lula [Workers Party, PT, leader  Luis Inacio da Silva] isolates himself when he wants to create a  totalitarian alliance instead of a democratic alliance.    [Lobo] Does the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]  have a place in that alliance?    [Magalhaes] An alliance cannot exclude anyone on principle.  [Rio de Janeiro State Governor Leonel] Brizola is better than  [Orestes] Quercia.    [Lobo] Will this alliance be a rehash of the 1985 Democratic  Alliance?    [Magalhaes] Each election is different and Brazil is now in  a  very different position than in 1984. It has something to do  with justice: [Former President Tancredo] Neves was a  compromiser, but he had the courage to make decisions when  necessary. I was very close to him for a long time and despite  what many people say, I observed how often he had to make  decisions and how he rigorously complied with his commitments.  He kept his word. On 12 August 1984, the day of the PMDB  convention, I was the first minister to be named by Neves. He  rigorously complied with his commitment, even though the media  stated that I was not going to be a minister and that my fellow  party members were concerned. [passage omitted]</p>

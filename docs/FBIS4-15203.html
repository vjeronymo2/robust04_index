			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has  reaffirmed his government's intention to press for Russia's  incorporation into the Group of Seven (G7) to make it a "Group  of Eight."    Russia will raise the matter at the next G7 summit in  Naples,  Chernomyrdin told a U.S. congress delegation in Moscow on  Wednesday, government spokesman Valeriy Grishin said. He said  the American delegation, headed by Republican minority leader  Richard Gephardt, had expressed support for Russia's plan.    Chernomyrdin also said his government was not putting all  its  hopes on foreign loans. He said the $1.5-Bn credit the  International Monetary Fund had recently agreed to give Russia  was mainly a political matter. He said there were those in the  United States who sought to restrict Russia's access to the  world market and undermine its role there. What Russia wants is  not easy terms but equal partnership in trade, he said.    Grishin said that at the meeting, held behind closed doors,  the U.S. delegation had expressed support for the Chernomyrdin  government's policy of reform and that Gephardt had promised to  make a public appeal to America's business community "not to be  afraid to invest in the Russian economy."</p>

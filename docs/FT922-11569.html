			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Italian duel over parliament jobs THE Italian parliament yesterday held its first session since the general election this month. But there was no resolution of the deadlock between the main parties over the choice of candidates for president of the Senate and leader of the Chamber of Deputies. The disagreements. which will probably require further rounds of voting today, may also postpone the planned resignation of Mr Giulio Andreotti, the prime minister. However, signs of a compromise, at least between the Christian Democrats and the Socialists, were emerging as politicians canvassed the names of Mr Andreotti as Senate president, and Mr Gianni De Michelis, foreign minister, as lower house leader. The choice of the two men, which would maintain the delicate balance between Christian Democrats, Mr Andreotti's party, and Mr De Michelis's Socialists, could still be upset by disagreements among the other party leaders. The sharpest differences have emerged between the Socialists and the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), led by Mr Achille Occhetto. Mr Occhetto, who is trying to exploit the sharp fall in Christian Democrat and Socialist support in the election, says any compromise on candidates would have to be linked to a clearer picture on the composition of the government. However, the PDS itself has suffered from sharp internal differences following its decision to back Mr Giorgio Napolitano, a senior member, as Chamber of Deputies leader. The choice has angered veteran PDS member Ms Nilde Iotti, who has had the job for virtually the past 13 years. It was incorrectly reported in the FT on Wednesday that Ms Iotti had been Senate leader and Mr Giovanni Spadolini leader of the Chamber of Deputies. Mr Spadolini was in fact the leader in the Senate.</p>

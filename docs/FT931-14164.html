			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Councils win cash concession LOCAL councils in England will be allowed to spend an extra Pounds 150m next year above the government's original expenditure plans. The concession stems mainly from a revision of how spending should take account of authorities' losing responsibility for further education. While the amount is relatively small compared with the overall planned spending for local government in England of just over Pounds 41bn, it could be critical in enabling some councils to escape the formal 'capping' process through which the government limits local budgets. Authorities benefiting most include Kent, which receives an increase of Pounds 16.3m; Cheshire, with an increase of just over Pounds 12m; and Nottinghamshire, up by almost Pounds 9m. Altogether, 23 councils have received increases of more than Pounds 3m in the amounts the government says they can spend. In London, the largest increase is to Camden (Pounds 4.2m). Mr John Redwood, local government minister, said yesterday that the changes had been made on the basis of new and more accurate information. The move follows about 200 representations to ministers from councils. When the plans were first announced in November last year, local authorities warned that the government's intended deduction of Pounds 2.4bn from local spending to reflect the switch of further education was too much. Ministers expect the main opposition attack to be over the level of settlement rather than the nature of the council tax. They are hopeful, however, that a significant proportion of threatened job losses in local government will come from natural wastage.</p>

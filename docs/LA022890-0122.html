			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BOYS' SOCCER PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> SMALL SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> DISPUTED CALLS HELP LA SALLE DEFEAT ORANGE LUTHERAN IN OVERTIME  </P> <P> La Salle of Pasadena scored a disputed goal halfway through the second overtime  period to defeat Orange Lutheran, 1-0, in the semifinals of the Small School  division boys' soccer playoffs Tuesday at Orange Lutheran.  </P> <P> Senior sweeper Matt Pendroh took a pass directly in front of the Orange  Lutheran goal and kicked it into the net.  </P> <P> The score held up and Orange Lutheran (16-7-2) was eliminated from the  playoffs. La Salle (14-4-3) will meet the winner of the L.A. Baptist-Harvard  match for the small schools championship.  </P> <P> "The referee called offsides on the goal," Orange Coach Del Montel said, "but  it was waved off by the center official and they kicked the goal. I protested  but (the official) said it was only by a few feet. That was their only shot on  our goal (in the second overtime) and they were offsides."  </P> <P> In the first half, Orange Lutheran was stung by a referee's decision. Lee  Back's apparent goal 12 minutes into the first half was nullified by an  offsides call. Later, an apparent goal was kicked out of the net by a La Salle  player. "That ball was in the net, but the side official was out of position  and didn't see it," Montel said. TOM BIRSCHBACH  </P></p>

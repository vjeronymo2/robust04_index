			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Sport: After the crowds melt away - Skiing THE SKIING season is going out in a blaze of glory: what a shame there are so few skiers to witness it. This week, the sun has been scorching down on snow which on higher ground has defied ultra-violet and infra-red and remains in remarkably good condition. But because skiers tend to think that their world comes to an end at Easter there is an extraordinary, almost surreal and ghostly emptiness in the mountains. The Alps are almost as silent as they were before recreational skiing was invented. In Verbier, Switzerland, teeming with people less than two weeks ago, there were not enough people on the entire network of slopes to form a queue even at Medran, where queues are something of a way of life in mid-season. You could actually arrange to meet someone on the mountain just by looking out for them: a notion that in mid-winter would be as absurd as hoping to bump into a friend in Oxford Street during a busy Saturday afternoon. At Courchevel, where many executive jets were leaving but few were arriving, piste-grooming machines, for all the world like remotely-controlled moon-buggies, resolutely continued to groom and cover-up the odd bare patch on the lower slopes even though there was hardly a skier for miles. Although many hotels put their shutters up this week, officially the season does not finish in many resorts until next weekend. Will there be anyone out there still skiing? There are exceptions. Some British tour operators, like football fans beginning to troop out of the ground before the final whistle, have done a U-turn and decided to stay on as clients suddenly appear from the ether wanting to ski next week. Just as chalet-girls have started to spring-clean, a few skiers have woken up to the fact that there is still some good skiing out there. In spite of an explosive start to the season and some wonderful snow - apart from an unnerving lack of fresh supplies between January and February - it has been a mixed season for hoteliers, particularly in France. March, normally the central plank of a good season, was a disaster. The effects of the recession, exacerbated by the French themselves, who found election fever keeping them off their own mountains, were felt particularly badly by luxury hotels trying to take advantage of late school holidays in France by keeping their March prices high in an attempt to extend the February high season. Claude Pinturault, who owns the Hotel Annapurna in Courchevel 1850, admitted that most of Courchevel's ten four-star hotels have had miserable periods this season. There have not been enough affluent clients to go around. Pinturault has restructured next year's high season prices so that they will only apply to the French school holidays from mid-February to mid-March. To a certain extent, Courchevel has been a victim of the 'fat cat' syndrome that has in the past shaken such self-confident resorts as Zermatt and Aspen. Believing themselves to be unassailable they have risked pricing themsmelves out of the market. At least one hotel has gone bankrupt this winter in Verbier. There are whispers about one or two in Courchevel. Yet a few four-star hotels, like the Latitude, in Val d'Isere - which have pitched their prices more sensibly  -have had a good season. And lower down the scale, two-star hotels, such as the Eldorador and Aiguille Rouge, in Arc 2000, and the Eldorador, in Belle Plagne, have enjoyed enormous success. Although snow conditions in the Alps after Easter have been excellent for the last three or four years, and prices are low, skiers often seem to have melted away by then. Next year, Easter is early: April 3. It would be inconceivable for this to signal the end of the season. Nevertheless, many resorts and tour operators are trying to improve their lot by promoting a summer season. Verbier is particularly anxious to fill chalets occupied by skiers in the winter with golfers, ramblers and parapentists in the summer. Small tour operators, such as Neal Manuel, who runs FlexiSki (071-352-0044), have chalet apartments lying idle for much of the summer. 'The mountains after Easter and during summer are spectacular,' he says. 'As it happens, we've got some late bookings for next week, just as we were about to pack up and go home.' Verbier's tourist director, Patrick Messeiller, says: 'You can even ski here in June and July if you want to.' For those torn between a winter-skiing break and a summer holiday, a morning on the slopes followed by a round of golf or some tennis in the afternoon is a tempting combination.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 27 Apr (NA) -- Colonel Mohamed Ali  Seineldin [the rebel leader of the 3 December 1990 military  uprising] has "categorically" denied that the arsenal found on  an island in the Tigre District belongs to the "Painted Faces"  former rebel Army group. He flatly denied that an "operation"  was being prepared on the island to liberate him from the  Magdalena prison.    Seineldin's spokesman Santiago Cahil conveyed the former  rebel leader's position to NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS, explaining that  Seineldin characterized the report as "absurd and outrageous,  totally lacking substance."    Cahil was the Justicialist Party mayor of the town of Moron  between 1993 and 1994. He said that Seineldin considers the  theory that the arsenal discovered by the Buenos Aires police  belongs to the "Painted Faces" to be "an aberration" that merely  illustrates the existence of "an evil service that seeks to  besmirch the Army."    "To say that the `Painted Faces' have anything to do with  this arsenal is a totally absurd and outrageous aberration.  Seineldin told me that when he learned what was being said he  did not whether to laugh or cry," the former Moron mayor said.    The spokesman for the rebel leader of the 3 December 1990  uprising said: "All of them -- Colonel Seineldin and his  comrades who are serving sentences with him -- have accepted  their situation and decided not to leave (prison) through force.  They never planned or even conceived anything like this."    According to Cahil, Seineldin said: "Some groups are  determined to besmirch" his "name" and "the Army." Seineldin  added that "without doubt an evil service is involved in this."    "No one in his right mind would ever believe (the painted  faced rebels) built a training camp with a heliport in the  delta, which is open to everyone," Cahil said.    The former mayor added that Seineldin categorically rejected  the idea that an operation was being prepared in the island to  liberate him, adding that all remarks on those lines are  "groundless."</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: GE APPROVES SHAKE-UP AT KIDDER PEABODY  </P> <P> General Electric Co. has announced a management shuffle at its Kidder Peabody  Group, the Wall Street investment house that has provided its share of problems  since GE took control in 1986.  </P> <P> GE Capital, the company's financial services division, stated that Michael A.  Carpenter, an executive vice president of GE Capital, has been named president  and chief executive of Kidder Peabody Group. Silas S. Cathcart, a former GE  director brought in as an interim chief executive in 1987, will stay on as  chairman.  </P> <P> Max C. Chapman Jr., a longtime Kidder employee who had been running the group  from his position as president of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., the broker-dealer  unit, resigned to pursue other interests.  </P> <P> Kidder suffered a major blow to its reputation when it became embroiled in the  Ivan F. Boesky insider trading scandal. The 124-year-old firm agreed in 1987 to  pay $25.3 million to settle civil charges with the Securities and Exchange  Commission.  </P> <P> The episode also prompted GE to make aggressive management changes at the firm  in response to what it perceived as management weaknesses that led to Kidder's  involvement in the scandal.  </P> <P> The management shake-ups at Kidder are seen by many as highlighting the  problems that can occur when smokestack companies try to bring new types of  business into their corporate fold, as has happened frequently this decade.  </P> <P> GE management generally has gotten excellent marks for the handling of its  expansion into financial services. But analysts say some clashes are  inevitable.  </P> <P> "It's tough for industrial companies to own Wall Street financial firms. They  drive the creative people out. Creative people feel limited, suffocated," said  one analyst, who asked not to be named.  </P></p>

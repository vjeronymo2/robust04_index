			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee  of the South Korean National Democratic Front [Hanminjon]  published a white paper headlined "Heavy Water Reactor and  Multipurpose Research Reactor Are for Nuclear Arms Development"  on March 30, which says that the atomic reactors used for the  development of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula are not  the experimental reactor of North Korea but the heavy water  reactor in Wolsong and the multipurpose research reactor in  Taedok, South Korea.    The white paper notes:    The Wolsong heavy water reactor is a plutonium-producing  reactor introduced for nuke development. It is not a reactor  for commercial use but one for the development of nuclear  weapons in view of its structure.    The multipurpose research reactor now in operation in Taedok  nuclear complex is advertized not to be related with nuke  development, but it is one of the key reactors exclusively for  nuclear development in South Korea.    Nevertheless, the International Atomic Energy Agency, making  a noisy fuss about the experimental reactor of North Korea, has  overlooked the heavy water reactor and multipurpose reactor of  South Korea which are for military purpose and whose capacities  are scores of times and several times that of North Korea. IAEA  has not disclosed as yet the result of inspection of these  nuclear facilities of South Korea.    The South Korean authorities must, first of all, give up the  nuclear development policy and destroy the heavy water reactor  and the multipurpose reactor that are used for the production of  nuclear weapons.</p>

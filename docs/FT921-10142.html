			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Sony chief says accountants should not lead industry MR AKIO MORITA, chairman of Sony Corporation, the Japanese electronics group, last night challenged the way senior executives are promoted in British industry by declaring that accountants should not run manufacturing companies. Mr Morita, originator of the Walkman portable stereo and other consumer electronics products, was giving the first in a series of lectures on innovation organised by the Department of Trade and Industry. The lectures are intended to raise the profile of innovation within British industry. He contrasted Japan, where almost every big manufacturing group is run by an engineer or technologist, with Britain, where a significant proportion of manufacturing companies are run by executives with a background in accountancy. Mr Morita said senior executives of a company had to be committed to technology and engineering to promote innovation at lower levels. 'Here in the UK I am told some manufacturers are led by chief executives who do not understand the engineering that goes into their own products,' he said. 'Someone mentioned to me that many UK corporations are headed by chartered accountants. This strikes me as very curious.' Mr Morita continued: 'Though I have a great deal of respect for accountants and financial professionals, I do not believe they should be at the helm of industry.' Successive studies of senior British management have found that more top British industrialists have a background in finance and accountancy than those in competitor countries such as Germany, France and Japan. Mr Morita called on companies to give technologists higher status to combat the widespread view that engineers are similar to mechanics. He said: 'We must advance young technologists through the managerial ranks. Manufacturing and high-technology corporations must be led by those who understand not just business but technology as well.' Letters, Page 13</p>

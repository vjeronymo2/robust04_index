			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MURRAY WAY OFF BASE FOR HIS DEFENSE OF ROSE  </P> <P> What's the controversy?  </P> <P> There's a simple rule in baseball and everybody knows it. You don't bet on  ballgames. Pete Rose knew the rule; and if he ignored the rule, he has to go.  </P> <P> No more megabuck contracts and $15 autographs. No more big league perks. He's  not going to be special anymore, and for a guy like him, that's probably the  worst punishment of all.  </P> <P> ED HONECK  </P> <P> STEVE ORTH  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

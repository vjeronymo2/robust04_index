			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TROUPE TAKES ITS FIRST STEPS ON A N.Y. STAGE;  </P> <P> "IF I CAN MAKE IT THERE, I'LL MAKE IT ANYWHERE. IT'S UP TO YOU, NEW YORK, NEW  YORK."  </P> <P> So says the Big Apple's unofficial theme song. And performers throughout the  country tend to take those words to heart.  </P> <P> When Three's Company decided it was ready for serious scrutiny -- after 15  years of making modern dances on the home front -- the troupe packaged its  strongest program of repertory works and took it east.  </P> <P> "Of course, it's the biggest center of dance in the world," director Jean  Isaacs said. "There were eight other dance events going on there the same time  we were performing (last week). That's where it's at.  </P> <P> "New York is also a major media center, and their validation is very important  in attracting the attention of big grant givers. And all the presenters are  there, so you get a good chance to be seen.  </P> <P> "We got reviewed in the New York Times and the Village Voice," Isaacs said.  "Those mean a lot more (to major funding sources) than a good review in the San  Diego Union."  </P> <P> Although the New York Times review was far from glowing, it was basically  positive, particularly where Isaacs' choreography was concerned.  </P> <P> "The company was best when it was most vigorous and least fussy," wrote  reviewer Jack Anderson, singling out Isaacs' "Tabula Rasa" as the prime example  of that simple vitality. Michael S. Roth's throbbing accompaniment was also  praised. However, Anderson thought the two major theater pieces by resident  choreographer Nancy McCaleb "abounded in affectations."  </P> <P> "I wasn't all that discouraged" by the review, Isaacs said. "It was actually  pretty good, although it was more descriptive than evaluative. His one  criticism about 'a tendency to exaggerate' was valid. We're used to dancing in  a larger house, and the stage is so close at the Merce Cunningham Studio that  we should have made adjustments. We'll know better next time."  </P> <P> Three's Company fared better in the weekly Village Voice, which came out with a  review Wednesday, more than a week after the concert.  </P> <P> Dance critic Gus Solomons dubbed the troupe "a breezy bunch," and admitted he  was skeptical of the "passel of raves" from California critics that preceded  Three's Company to New York. Nevertheless, he found the six repertory works on  the program "solid . . . and nicely performed.  </P> <P> "Cutting-edge work it is not, but (it was) bright, intelligent and neatly  staged."  </P> <P> McCaleb thought the New York concert "went beautifully," noting that the second  performance had a near-capacity crowd, including a respectable contingent from  the city's dance community.  </P> <P> "More important than the critics was the response from dance professionals,"  McCaleb said. "And we definitely made connections."  </P> <P> Self-producing in New York is expensive, but Isaacs is convinced the trip will  pay dividends.  </P> <P> "It's already helped here at home with fund-raising," she said. "Everybody knew  about our going to New York. We even got flowers from Maureen O'Connor. It was  great."  </P> <P> "We showed people in New York that we can take such a big dog-and-pony show on  the road," McCaleb said. "It's important to show your work if you want to do  touring, which we do. We demonstrated our ability to take a technically  intricate show to the most professional setting. The dancers learned something,  too: that they can get out on any stage and just do it."  </P> <P> There were also fringe benefits to San Diego aficionados, McCaleb noted.  </P> <P> "People enjoy the whole idea of San Diego taking its work out of town. Everyone  was proud when the theater had its successes in New York. It says something  about the arts growing up in San Diego."  </P> <P> When Three's Company debuted at the Merce last week, it was not only the first  stint in the nation's dance capital for the San Diego-based troupe, it was the  first time any local dance group had appeared on a New York stage. But it  certainly won't be the last, according to Isaacs.  </P> <P> "We intend to go back," she said. "It was a wonderful experience for us, and I  think others will be going too in the future."  </P></p>

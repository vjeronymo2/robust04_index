			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Letter: Holding on to Gibraltar Sir, It has been fascinating to read the various reports on Premier Felipe Gonza1ez's official visit to London. I believe that on most matters his views and opinions are correct and clearly there is much common ground which should enable Spain and the UK to play important roles in the enhancement of the European Community. However, the British government should continue its present position with regard to Gibraltar. Britain should not, under any circumstances, consider changing the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht until such time as Spain indicates its willingness to relinquish its sovereignty of Ceuta and Melilla to Morocco. By the same token, I can see no harm in permitting the Spaniards to use the airport in Gibraltar - after all, it is closer to the town hall in La Linea than it is to Government House] David Glazier, 6 Bow Field, Hook, Basingstoke, Hampshire</p>

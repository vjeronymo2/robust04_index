			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Arts: Today's Television The programme chosen by David Attenborough as one of his 12 favourites from the past 16 years of 'Wildlife On One' is indeed a classic. The methods invented or adapted by producer John Downer to get film of birds in flight included building a miniature camera into a radio controlled model plane which was then disguised as a stork. This trick and others worked astoundingly well, as you can see in Wildlife 100 (7.00 BBC1). Assignment reports on the illegal trade in Russia's national treasures, especially religious icons (7.45 BBC2). This has been going on for years but has intensified since the collapse of communism. If Sailortown maintains the standard set by the previous seven comedy pilots in this series it will be quite appalling. This one is set in a Belfast pub (8.30 ITV). On the other hand, if the second of three programmes about modern technology in Without Walls is as good as the first it will be very well worthwhile (9.00 C4). The hugely improved 40 Minutes uses tapes of original phone calls to document a hair-raising incident when a Belgian banker's family was taken hostage (9.50 BBC2).</p>

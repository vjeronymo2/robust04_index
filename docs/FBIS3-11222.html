			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Joao Baena Soares, the Brazilian secretary general  of the OAS, said on 17 March that the possibility of an armed  forces' participation in the antinarcotics effort "had not been  requested by the United States through the OAS, and the idea had  only been placed under discussion."    Baena Soares added that the possibility of including drug  trafficking on the agenda of the meeting he will hold with  President Carlos Menem and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella on 18  March "depends on the decision" of Argentine officials.    As to armed forces' participation in the antinarcotics  effort, he said: "It is up to each country to decide about that  because several countries believe this is a task to be fulfilled  by police."    The OAS has a special commission to deal with this issue,  and  Baena Soares said he is in favor of "concentrating efforts to  reduce demand for drugs."    He said: "To reduce this demand means to educate and  rehabilitate drug addicts and reinstate them into society."    At 1030 today, Baena Soares and Menem will attend the  ceremony closing the OAS experts' meeting that has been  discussing the guidelines of a new security system for the  hemisphere that can adapt to the changes that have been  occurring in the international political scene.    On 17 March, Menem received from the Panamerican Foundation  for Development the Inter-American Leadership Award for 1994.  President Menem was decorated in the presence of Baena Soares.  Thanking him for the honor, Menem said he was proud to have  "brought peace" to the country by granting presidential pardons.    At the end of the 17 March meeting, four basic points to be  included in the final document were established. This final  document will officially be released at the end of the experts'  meeting that started 15 March.    According to a proposal made by a U.S. delegation member,  the  OAS might establish "a center for the solution of conflicts"  occurring in countries on the American continent, and a  mechanism to bring together OAS member countries' defense  ministers similar to the one that institutionalized the foreign  ministers' conferences. It was established during the meeting  that the Inter-American Defense Committee should advise the OAS  political organizations, and that the Inter-American Defense  College should cooperate in reorganizing a security system for  the continent.</p>

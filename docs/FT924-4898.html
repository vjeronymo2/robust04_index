			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Observer: Royal wonder Peter Wood, the 46-year-old founder of Royal Bank of Scotland's money-making Direct Line Insurance subsidiary, started yesterday with a game of tennis before heading for the office to return the anticipated volley of criticism over his Pounds 6m bonus. Wood is hardly the traditional clearing bank director. An entrepreneurial figure who rattles off an array of statistics about his telephone sales operation, he is briskly unapologetic about what he gets paid. 'I certainly don't want to be known as the Dollars 6m man,' was the closest he came to sounding defensive. The bank was supporting its colourful director yesterday. But does it really want more 'Peter Wood clones', as he himself thinks? Far be it for Observer to sow seeds of boardroom dissent. But if Wood can keep up this type of performance - he told The Observer that his operation could be 'worth more than the Royal Bank before too long' - he should be running the Royal Bank and not George Mathewson. Like Michael Hepher, Lloyds Bank's insurance supremo who defected to BT, it is hard to imagine the Royal Bank offerring Wood the sort of career prospects which will satisfy a multi-millionaire for the next 14 years.</p>

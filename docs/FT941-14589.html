			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Red tape bill to target hundreds of regulations: Big savings predicted for industry - Fears over new powers for ministers The government yesterday announced a sweeping attack on red tape, aimed at abolishing or changing 450 items of regulation. Areas covered include shop opening hours, children in pubs, building society lending and the streamlining of the law on mergers. There will also be legislation to allow the contracting out of public services in areas where it is presently illegal. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the de-regulation and contracting out bill was 'the biggest bonfire of controls that has taken place in modern times in this country'. It would save industry 'hundreds of millions of pounds, at a very modest assumption', he said. At Westminster, the bill was immediately attacked because of the powers it would give ministers to amend or repeal laws without primary legislation. Downing Street officials admitted the measure - originally flagged as an important part of a legislative programme designed to unite the Conservative party - would be 'a difficult bill to get through'. But they said the prime minister was confident of the government's ability to do so. The bill contains a requirement for ministers to wait 40 days between laying a draft order before parliament and submitting a final draft for parliamentary debate. The government said this interim period would allow for additional parliamentary scrutiny. It suggested that new scrutiny committees could be established in the Commons and the Lords to perform this task. Mr Heseltine said there were 55 pieces of legislation that would be appropriate for the use of the new powers. A further 22 would need primary legislation. He said: 'This is the first stage of a deregulation initiative. It is very important to recognise there will be subsequent stages.' Mr Francis Maude, a junior Foreign Office minister before losing his seat at the last election, has been appointed head of a de-regulation taskforce to carry the programme forward. Mr Heseltine said the measures were intended to increase the competitiveness of UK industry. Government departments introducing legislation would have to consult two or three typical small firms about its effect. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry spokesman, said 'ministers must not be allowed to smuggle in lower standards under the cloak of cutting red tape'.

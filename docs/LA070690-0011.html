			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLARIFICATION NEEDED ON AVOCADOS, CANCER  </P> <P> As president of the California Avocado Commission, which represents the nearly  7,000 growers in the state, I am writing to express our deep dissatisfaction  and concern about your article that erroneously linked avocados with certain  types of cancer ("Links Between Cancer, Dietary Fat Increase," June 26).  </P> <P> In your article, you state that there is "a strong connection between dietary  fat -- found in such goodies as ice cream and avocados -- in particular types  of cancers. . ." By singling out the avocado, you incorrectly inferred that  eating avocados can potentially cause cancer.  </P> <P> Your misleading reference to avocados has alarmed consumers, many of whom have  contacted our offices for clarification of your article.  </P> <P> Your unfortunate choice of the avocado as a potentially detrimental food will  undoubtedly have a negative impact on consumers' perception of a fruit that has  many nutritional benefits when included in a healthful, well-balanced diet.  California avocados are cholesterol-free, low in sodium and an excellent source  of vitamins and potassium.  </P> <P> We want to make it clear to your readers that avocados are healthful and  nutritious.  </P> <P> MARK AFFLECK  </P> <P> president, California Avocado Commission  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> After reviewing contracts between RKO and Orson Welles and his Mercury  Productions company, Turner Entertainment Co. has dropped plans to colorize  Welles' classic film, "Citizen Kane." "While a court test might uphold our  legal right to colorize the film, provisions of the contract could be read to  prohibit colorization without permission of the Welles estate," Roger Mayer,  president of Turner Entertainment, said Tuesday. He added that Turner has  restored a printing negative that will provide "first-rate black-and-white  prints of this masterpiece" for TV viewing. ALEENE MacMINN and Shauna Snow  </P></p>

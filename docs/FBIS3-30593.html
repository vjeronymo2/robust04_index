Regarding some criticism and various interpretations  of Slovenia's participation in the Partnership for Peace plan,  Peterle said that they were a result of lack of understanding of  the matter. He emphasized that this plan envisages several  groups of countries and corresponding procedures for their  incorporation. A special procedure is envisaged for the former  Warsaw Pact members, while a different procedure is envisaged  for some other countries, among which is also Slovenia.  Minister Peterle said that Slovenia is still waiting for the  official reply of the NATO consultation council regarding the  request to be included in the Partnership for Peace plan. The  headquarters in Brussels have indicated that Slovenia's  membership in the consultation council will only be possible  when our country will sign the agreement on associate membership  in the European Union, Lojze Peterle said.</p>

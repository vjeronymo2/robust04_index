			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIBRARIES GET HELP FROM CELEBRITIES TO ENTICE READERS  </P> <P> "Wild About Reading," the summer program to encourage recreational reading  among children of all ages, is under way through August in all 91 branches of  the Los Angeles County Public Library system.  </P> <P> Surveys were conducted in the libraries to find out who children admire most.  National and local celebrities named in the surveys were then asked to send a  picture and letter to post in all libraries. The responses are now on view in  all the libraries to encourage children to write the celebrities in keeping  with the theme, "Reading and Writing Go Together."  </P> <P> Television weatherman George Fischbeck, professional wrestler Hulk Hogan,  basketball star Magic Johnson and First Lady Barbara Bush are a few of the  celebrities who responded.  </P> <P> Pentel of America is co-sponsoring the program and is providing stationery and  pens for all participating children. Pentel has cooperated with the library  system since 1980 on various projects for children, and each year helps sponsor  the library's bookmark contest.  </P> <P> The county library's summer reading program has been going since 1931.  </P></p>

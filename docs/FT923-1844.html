			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / UK Company News: The dilemma facing food's rag and bone men  -Fresh doubts are emerging about prospects for Hillsdown FOR five years, Sir Harry Solomon, chairman of Hillsdown Holdings, has repeated one central message to the City. It is that the company's days of go-go diversification are over, and from now on it will focus squarely on developing as a food manufacturer. By stressing long-term commitment to a stable core business, Sir Harry has hoped to rally investor confidence, which was badly jolted when the 1987 stock market crash abruptly ended Hillsdown's brief record of meteoric, acquisition-led, growth. But though Hillsdown's food business has grown to the fifth largest in Europe and 80 per cent of group sales, the message has failed to get through. The company's Pounds 281m rights issue last autumn flopped, and its share price has tumbled by two thirds in the past year to close at 83 1/2 p on Friday. Now, as recession catches up with the food industry, fresh doubts are emerging about prospects for Hillsdown, which last week reported slightly higher pre-tax profits but lower operating results for the first half. The doubts turn not just on current trading performance, but on the soundness of the company's basic strategy and business mix. Hillsdown has followed a simple formula to grow big in food. Unable to afford to buy companies with top brands, which can command premium prices for their products, it has relied on acquiring and rationalising run-down producers of basic products. One City analyst calls the company 'the rag and bone men of the food business.' The company has sought scale economies and efficiencies - and the volumes needed to stand up to powerful retailers - by establishing leadership in sectors such as poultry and red meat and building a vertically-integrated structure from farm gate to factory. Its skilful cost-cutting, firm management controls and continuous high levels of investment are widely praised. However, the question is whether its single-minded emphasis on low-cost production is enough to guarantee sustained high margins and competitive strength in the future. As Mr David Lang of stockbrokers Henderson Crosthwaite puts it: 'Hillsdown bought terrible businesses and made them half-decent. But the trick of turning them into really good businesses has eluded the company.' Hillsdown's dilemma is that it seems unable to outgrow its past. Though efficient, many of its businesses remain trapped in low value-added sectors beset by chronic excess capacity, poor margins and fierce domestic and foreign price competition. The problems have been underlined in chickens. In the past 18 months continental producers - aided by more favourable tax systems, cheaper feed and less exacting health standards than in the UK - have flooded Britain with birds at prices which Hillsdown has difficulty matching. In red meat, Hillsdown's slaughterhouses are under pressure from marginal UK operators which were recently given another three years to comply with rigorous EC hygiene rules, while the company's canning business is embroiled in a price war. Hillsdown has responded by doing what it knows best - acquiring and rationalising troubled large competitors, notably Associated British Foods' Anglia canning operations and Unigate's JP Wood poultry business. However, while these steps were widely considered essential to safeguard Hillsdown's business, the economics are increasingly questioned. 'Money from last year's rights issue is going into factory closures and redundancy payments just to protect the existing base,' says one analyst. Furthermore, far from increasing Hillsdown's bargaining power with supermarkets, some acquisitions have cost the company business. The Anglia deal prompted several retailers to transfer contracts to smaller suppliers. Hillsdown recognises that it needs to create a stronger market franchise by putting more emphasis on product strategy. It is withdrawing from commodity businesses such as frozen chicken and has moved into higher-value lines such as prepared meals, sandwiches and salads. However, it faces several challenges. Having long relied on manufacturing efficiency as its prime competitive weapon, Hillsdown lacks a marketing culture. Its sales of branded groceries - chiefly by the Premier and Canadian Maple Leaf subsidiaries - are relatively small, and spending on advertising and product support is modest. As a consequence, its quest for higher margins will hinge on private-label products, which retailers sell under their own name. Hillsdown is already Britain's leading supplier of private-label goods, which provide most of its UK food-processing revenues. However, profits in private-label products depend less on scale than on dedicated specialisation, agility and close co-operation with retailers. Hillsdown has yet to match Northern Foods' - admittedly exceptional - success in building a lucrative private-label business on long experience in the dairy industry and a close relationship with Marks and Spencer. Hillsdown's structure may also be becoming a handicap. Growing price competition from abroad and the trend among UK supermarkets to shop around Europe for commodity items such as fresh chicken make the advantages of vertical integration increasingly questionable. Though Hillsdown is streamlining poultry production, Mr David Newton, chief operating officer, concedes volumes will still exceed demand for higher-value processed items such as breaded and stuffed chicken which, in any case, are subject to increasing competition. Some of these weaknesses may be dealt with by further restructuring. But others will require deeper, longer-term changes in corporate culture and skills. Unless that challenge is met, Hillsdown's fortunes seem likely to remain closely tied to the ups and downs of consumer spending and the commodity cycle long after the current recession has ended.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS CONGRESSIONAL RACES;  </P> <P> LEVINE, OPPONENT DIFFER SHARPLY OVER ISRAEL  </P> <P> Voters in California's 27th Congressional District do not have to look long or  hard for a major difference between the Democrat currently representing them  and the Republican seeking to replace him.  </P> <P> The two candidates, both of whom are Jewish, are sharply divided on the subject  of Israel.  </P> <P> Incumbent Mel Levine is one of Israel's most outspoken supporters on Capitol  Hill.  </P> <P> David Barrett Cohen, meanwhile, says the United States should work for the  establishment of a Palestinian state.  </P> <P> The two lawyers are running for the seat that Levine has held for four terms,  representing a largely coastal district that stretches from the South Bay to  Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Levine, often spoken of as a possible candidate for Alan Cranston's U.S. Senate  seat in 1992, may well be running his last race for the House of  Representatives.  </P> <P> But he insisted in an interview that any other ambitions are on hold.  </P> <P> "I love being in the House and I'm focused on getting reelected in '90 and  serving in '91 and '92," Levine said. He had built a massive $1.6-million war  chest by the middle of May.  </P> <P> A strong environmentalist, Levine has been a leader in the fight to protect  Santa Monica Bay and resist offshore oil drilling.  </P> <P> He has introduced legislation to create a federally chartered corporation to  assist American high-tech industries in their competitive battle with Japanese  companies.  </P> <P> In Cohen, Levine faces an opponent who changed his party registration from  Democrat to Republican in January of last year. Cohen said he made the switch  after becoming disenchanted with the Democratic Party and its presidential  candidate, Michael S. Dukakis.  </P> <P> Cohen said he has raised more than $40,000 in contributions, and has also  loaned his campaign $33,000 of his own money.  </P> <P> He has not been shy in his quest for money. At a recent fund-raiser in Carson,  Cohen, who is half-Samoan, put on a Samoan reed skirt and danced bare-chested  for his supporters.  </P> <P> The challenger has been attacking Levine in commercials on cable television,  accusing the lawmaker of being a top recipient of contributions from savings  and loans, citing a report from the public interest group Common Cause.  </P> <P> The GOP candidate also contends that Levine has not moved swiftly enough to  protect aerospace jobs in the South Bay, including those provided by the Los  Angeles Air Force Base in El Segundo.  </P> <P> It is the subject of Israel, though, that perhaps most clearly defines the  differences between the two men.  </P> <P> Cohen advocates a "two-state solution" that would lead to creation of an  independent Palestine on land now held by Israel, which he accuses of "trying  to forcibly occupy a population of 1.7 million people against its will."  </P> <P> Arguing against Israel's refusal to negotiate with the Palestine Liberation  Organization, he maintained that "Palestinians have a right to choose their own  leaders, and it is not for the Israelis or Americans to dictate who their  leaders will be."  </P> <P> Cohen acknowledges that this is an unorthodox position. "Unique. I'm the only  mainstream American candidate for Congress who has called for a two-state  solution," he said.  </P> <P> For his part, Levine charges that PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat has been Iraqi  President Saddam Hussein's proxy since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait inflamed  passions in the occupied territories.  </P> <P> Calling him the "least responsible actor" in the region, Levine said that  Arafat has been "trying to increase the level of violence and incite violent  behavior in the region, despite promises to contain himself over the last  several years."  </P> <P> Responding to a request from the Los Angeles-based Muslim Public Affairs  Council to comment on the recent clash between Israeli police and a crowd of  Arab demonstrators in Jerusalem, Cohen said he supported the Bush  Administration's denunciation of the use of excessive force.  </P> <P> Levine said: "Passing a U.N. (Security Council) resolution condemning Israel  before we know what the facts are, and then sending a fact-finding mission, is  like rendering a verdict before you have the trial.  </P> <P> "I have always felt that the United States should and does support Israel's  survival within secure borders on one hand, and legitimate rights for the  Palestinians on the other hand," he added.  </P> <P> In an unusual move, Cohen sent a mailer to Inglewood -- the portion of the  district containing the largest concentration of black voters -- accusing  Levine and his political allies of taking black voters for granted and treating  the city "like a voting plantation for Mel Levine."  </P> <P> Levine brands the mailer "an unfortunate effort by a desperate political  candidate."  </P> <P> "The fact is, my track record on civil rights and civil liberties is quite  solid," he said. "For a candidate to dream up some wild charges that have no  basis whatsoever in fact is offensive both to me and to the voters of the city  of Inglewood."  </P> <P> So far, Levine has refused to debate his challenger, although he said he would  be willing to meet him, if Cohen apologizes to Levine and to Inglewood voters  for the brochure.  </P> <P> Peace and Freedom Party candidate Edward F. Errer is also on the ballot.  </P> <P> Times staff writer George Hatch contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 27TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT  </P> <P> Candidate: Party  </P> <P> Mel Levine (inc.): Democrat  </P> <P> David Barrett Cohen: Republican  </P> <P> Edward E.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by Thierry Belfroid] </F>   [Text] Here now a report on the most secret company of  Belgium's military units: the special reconnaissance teams  [CSR]. It consists of 40 men specialized in military  intelligence operations, and is based in Germany. Thierry  Belfroid's report unveils the secrecy that surrounds the  existence of these men, whose company will be disbanded in June.    [Begin Belfroid recording] If a major conflict had taken  place, the Army's special reconaissance teams certainly would  have played one of the most dangerous roles. Indeed, the  four-person teams would have parachuted right into the middle  of the enemy's positions for reconnaissance and sabotage  missions, without any help from the outside and at distances  exceeding 150 km from any allied base. That is why these  volunteers over the past 30 years accepted the very difficult  training regimen. The CSR have been trained for every possible  situation and have engaged in the most physically demanding  sports.    The members of the CSR company prepared for every possible  scenario, making them seem like "Rambo men," although they do  not like this expression.    After 30 years of hard and secret living, the CSR have never  been used for a real mission. In June 1994, they will be  disbanded. A page of Cold War history thus will be turned. [end  recording]</p>

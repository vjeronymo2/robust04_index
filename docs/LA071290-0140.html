			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI VALLEY;  </P> <P> WATER DISTRICT TO ASK PUBLIC FOR COMMENT  </P> <P> The Casitas Municipal Water District decided Wednesday to hear public comment  before voting whether to charge customers $500 and other fees to be placed on a  waiting list for new hookups or additional water allotments.  </P> <P> The district's board of directors will hold a public hearing on the proposal in  August.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, a $500 application fee would be required along with an  annual fee of $50 per acre-foot of water requested. Failure to pay the annual  fee would result in the applicant being dropped from the list.  </P> <P> Casitas General Manager John Johnson said fees are necessary to cover  administrative costs for keeping track of the applications and for  investigating if applicants meet the new service criteria.  </P> <P> In response to the drought and increasing demands on the Lake Casitas  reservoir, the board declared a water shortage emergency April 11 and ordered  at least a one-year delay on approving new or additional water service  requests.  </P> <P> The water company serves 2,800 customers and sells water wholesale to 14 other  agencies, serving a total of 55,000 residents in the northern county.  </P> <P> Also, the board will decide how to allocate any new supplies of water, should  they become available. The board's water resources subcommittee has proposed  that 44% of any new supplies be allocated for agricultural use. The remaining  56% would go for residential and industrial use. Also, no one applicant would  receive an allocation of more than 10% of the total available new supply.  </P> <P> In some cases, applicants would have to prove that they have installed low-flow  plumbing fixtures or have had a water audit of their irrigation methods before  they could receive additional water.

BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SON BORN RETARDED, JIM BEAM SUED  </P> <P> A woman who says drinking during pregnancy caused birth defects in her son is  suing the maker of Jim Beam bourbon for not putting warning labels on its  bottles.  </P> <P> Jury selection in the lawsuit filed by Candace and Harold Thorp began today in  federal court.  </P> <P> The couple's 4-year-old son, Michael, was born mentally retarded,  neurologically impaired and developmentally stunted, with facial and other body  malformations, according to the lawsuit. The Thorps sued the James B. Beam  Distillery Co. of Deerfield, Ill., claiming it should have provided labels  warning that alcohol could cause birth defects.  </P> <P> Thorp said in court documents she drank up to a half a fifth per day of Jim  Beam bourbon while she was pregnant and didn't know her drinking would damage  her child.  </P> <P> The company asserted in court papers that Washington state law governing  product liability does not require manufacturers to issue warnings of risks  that are considered "generally known" by the community.  </P></p>

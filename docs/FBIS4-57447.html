			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jaime Yoshiyama, president of the Democratic </F> Constituent Congress, CCD, by Juan Carlos Tafur; place and date  not given]    [Text] [Tafur] In the last few days, several legislators  have raised the question of whether they are eligible for  reelection in the next legislative term. Some time ago, you  said this is more a moral issue than a legal one. In  conclusion, how does the situation stand? Do you believe the  national situation can tolerate these petty discussions?    [Yoshiyama] Let me explain exactly what happened. First,  there was great confusion about the electoral system. We wanted  to implement the Constitution based on the three organizations  [National Election Board, National Office of Election  Procedures, and National Civil Registry] because this is the  modern thing to do. This is not something we invented because  this system is working in other countries. We believe an  electoral system based on three organizations is perfect. When  we started analyzing it, however, we realized that we might have  some difficulties implementing it. For example, we had no  control over how long it would take the professional boards to  choose their representatives to elect the National Council of  Magistrates members.    [Tafur] No one realized this when you were drafting the  Constitution?    [Yoshiyama] Yes we did, but we thought the Constitution's  drafting was not going to take that long. We drafted those  chapters back in August-September 1993 and believed that if the  Constitution was approved after the referendum, we would  immediately start to work on all this. Aside from all this, we  thought we would first implement the system. Only later did we  realize that despite being the modern thing to do, we were  taking risks and that perhaps we might be unable to implement it  by election time. Not at our end, but because we depended on  others and political problems always come up. Secondly, our  main objective was to achieve an image of complete openness, of  security and cleanliness. We sought to achieve a completely  clean electoral system. After making a cost-profit analysis  like economists do, we have no qualms in accepting what the  opposition is upholding. We took the Bar Association draft,  which in its sixth article clearly states: "You cannot seek  reelection." That is what it states. We discussed it among  ourselves and all of us decided "we are willing" to accept it.    [Tafur] Whom are you referring to when you say all of us?    [Yoshiyama] The people who helped the New Majority-Change 90  [NM-C90] internal group. Clearly aware that this article  specifies that we cannot seek reelection, I asked: "Are we  aware of this? Are we aware that this means we cannot seek  reelection, that we are sacrificing our personal interests for  superior interests so that the country gets a clear message  about the electoral system?"    [Tafur] All of them agreed?    [Yoshiyama] Well, not everyone was present, only some...    [Tafur] ... Who were the ones who attended the meeting?    [Yoshiyama] I do not remember...I believe CCD members Robles  and Sandoval were there, but...    [Tafur] ... Was CCD and NM member Luz Salgado there?    [Yoshiyama] Yes, I believe Luz Salgado was there...I cannot  say because I do not remember but we made decisions of this  sort. There were 30 of us. Not all of them are in Lima all the  time. CCD member Martha Chavez was certainly not there because  she was involved in all the dealings...    [Tafur] ... Perhaps she refused to attend the meeting?    [Yoshiyama] No, but perhaps she just did not know about it.  We hold regular meetings but sometimes we do not know which  issues are going to be discussed on the agenda because we  discuss correlated issues. We are a very flexible group in this  sense. We do not have a fixed agenda, taking of minutes,  reading of minutes. A person stands up and starts speaking;  that is all.    [Tafur] In short, we can assert that the group accepted the  proposal?    [Yoshiyama] Yes, the group accepted it although perhaps some  did not understand the issue. I am speaking on a personal  basis. In that meeting, Yoshiyama understood that the group  decided not to seek reelection.    [Tafur] Beyond the constitutional provision, would you say  there is a moral obligation to do this?    [Yoshiyama] I believe there is a commitment I will assume  when I vote on the issue. To my surprise, when we held the  plenum session the friends in the minority, who have much more  legal experience, were in favor. At the time, I was very  pleased and of course I thought they also agreed not to seek  reelection. This is why I say that I believe we assumed  commitment when we approved the Bar Association draft bill. How  can we speak of reelection? Personally, I will never propose it.  I feel morally unable to propose an amendment to this clause  because I voted in favor of it despite the fact that, as you  know, the plenum president does not vote.    [Tafur] Many people say you are not really making a  sacrifice because you will run for vice president.    [Yoshiyama] No, absolutely, no, no. That is what people say.  They have even told me: "Obviously chap, you are already on the  ticket, so why should you care." No, I emphatically declare,  first, that I have no political ambition whatsoever and that I  am not making electoral calculations. All the people who know me  are aware that things are not like this. I have always thought  that we are here to make a constitution and a series of laws,  without thinking of personal objectives or reelection. I fully  disapprove of lawmakers turning this into a profession.    [Tafur] Do you think there should be professional  politicians?    [Yoshiyama] I do not think so.    [Tafur] Do you think they should be amateurs?    [Yoshiyama] I would not go as far as that, but at least they  should not take this as a profession. The point is that there  are extraordinary lawmakers, but a few of them are using their  position for personal advantage.    [Tafur] OIGA magazine claims that this Congress is too  professional. In other words, that its salary level surpasses  even that of the previous Congress.    [Yoshiyama] No. Look, I have some information here. I  emphatically maintain that this Congress is much more efficient  than the previous ones. I will prove it by mentioning three  figures. First, the previous Congress had 4,000 people. Today,  we are 700 and the trend is to reduce this number. Each person  now corresponds to six in the previous Congress. Don't you think  this is highly efficient? Not only because of the lower number  of people, but because fewer people means smaller facilities,  lower transportation expenses, lower electric power consumption,  and many other reduced items. Second, our annual savings amount  to $70 million. This amount is enough for building 280 schools,  of the type of beautiful schools President Fujimori is  dedicating everyday. They are 280 schools; $70 million is a lot  of money. Third, our average legislative production has been  three times as much as that of the previous Congress and the  Constituent Assembly.    [Tafur] Are high salaries justified then?    [Yoshiyama] No, wait a minute. Why did we reach this  production level? Because in the past, all bills were studied at  plenary sessions of Congress and committees worked very little.  There was the impression that people worked harder, but debates  were highly unproductive. Today committees are at work and only  the bills that have been properly screened reach the plenary  session for approval. We approved five laws yesterday (7 May).  It is much more productive. Do you know how long it took the  previous Congress to change the name of Cusco to Qosqo? Three  days. Can you imagine the country using three days to change  Cusco to Qosqo? We probably would have needed one hour to do the  same.    [Tafur] Going back to the question that you do not want to  answer...    [Yoshiyama] We earn an average $2,500 per month. You should  compare this salary with the salary of, say, the general manager  of EXPRESO -- which I can assure you is much more than $2,500.  Therefore, I believe we are earning the right amount. Some  people have said we earn 17,000 sols, but I believe this is  foolish. But citizens want productive, efficient, and  hardworking lawmakers. The salary issue has been magnified. It  should not be a political problem.    [Tafur] Lawmaker Torres y Torres Lara maintains that a  series  of constitutional amendments like the one dealing with multiple  electoral districts might be necessary. Is that a majority bloc  position or simply that lawmaker's idea?    [Yoshiyama] That is his own personal idea. I should first  say  that we hold lawmaker Torres y Torres Lara in very high regard  because he is the one who has practically directed the  constitutional work; that is, his opinions are authoritative.  The matter, however, has not been debated yet within the NM-C90  alliance.    [Tafur] What do you think about it?    [Yoshiyama] We will change a lot of things: the death  penalty, the Constitutional Guarantee Tribunal, and the method  for electing the National Council of Magistrates, which will end  up in chaos the way it is.    [Tafur] ...You will enforce such changes despite Dr.  Ferrero's begin mad about them.    [Yoshiyama] What else can we do? Concerning the  constitutional reforms, over the past three months we have heard  very authoritative opinions explaining to us how to improve the  election of members of the National Council of Magistrates and  the Constitutional Tribunal, the death penalty's enforcement,  the implementation of the single district, and the cancellation  of lawmakers' tenures, which we have considered very  interesting. We have no problem at all admitting that we made  some mistakes, but we are flexible and willing to consider those  opinions for a possible amendment of the Constitution.    [Tafur] About the electoral issue, is it true that NM-C90  will not compete, that a new political movement will be created  for this purpose?    [Yoshiyama] No. We have not made any decision about  electoral  issues. We have not decided if NM-C90 will compete or if we will  create another movement. The only thing we want is to make it  possible for the president to run again. Besides, we are  convinced that we need strong support from independents if we  want to succeed in the next election. This is why we have not  made a decision. Today, to speak the truth, we, and particularly  the president, are all busy governing the country. I am not sure  if journalists are aware of how difficult it is to keep pace  with the president's activities when he is visiting the  provinces. He works from seven in the morning until three in the  morning the next day.    [Tafur] Are NM-C90 leaders as concerned as some government  officials about Javier Perez de Cuellar's candidacy?    [Yoshiyama] There is still a lot of time, is there not?    [Tafur] But you are not concerned?    [Yoshiyama] It would be hypocritical to say that I am not  concerned; but we are taking it calmly. I do not need pills to  sleep.    [Tafur] But the president says he cannot sleep.    [Yoshiyama] He does not sleep because he works too hard.  What  I mean is that Javier Perez de Cuellar is an excellent  ambassador and a diplomat. He is attractive because he has great  international prestige, which might make many things easier for  him in a future government. A possible negative factor is that  he is not acquainted with Peruvian problems.    [Tafur] Do you not think that statement is rather  misleading?  How else could he have helped Fujimori at the beginning if he  was not acquainted with Peruvian problems?    [Yoshiyama] Perhaps I did not express myself well. I said  Perez de Cuellar has many things in his favor. He is an  ambassador with great international prestige, but he has to  update himself on national problems. At this time, he is not up  to date on national issues because he has lived abroad during  the past 20 years. That is what I mean.    [Tafur] Why do you think people support Perez de Cuellar's  candidacy? Why is a government such as Fujimori's government,  which has achieved important things in diverse areas, unable to  convince the people as much as his accomplishments might lead  you to imagine they would?    [Yoshiyama] People's approval of the president continues to  be high by all standards. The people are happy with his work. In  the case of Perez de Cuellar, the people see an image. He is  practically a stamp. They are comparing an ideal image with a  real person like Fujimori. Besides, the comparison is being made  one year before the election. I think it is too early to  forecast anything. The only thing we know is that Ambassador  Perez de Cuellar has yet to formally announce whether he will be  a candidate. The leaders of traditional political parties,  however, such as the Popular Christian Party, the leftist  movement, and a group of American Popular Revolutionary Alliance  followers, already have launched him, involved him. There are  even discussions on a possible congressional ticket and in some  places they are forming committees. I think they are using him.    [Tafur] Would you accept that Fujimori's biggest  shortcoming,  compared to his achievements, is the handling of human rights,  or at least the handling of reports on human rights violations  in cases such as the "La Cantuta" or "Huallaga" case?    [Yoshiyama] I am not aware of a country where the president  has had such a high approval rate for so long. There have  obviously been mistakes and we are determined to correct them.  For instance, there were some abuses on the issue of human  rights. In the Upper Huallaga case, it was the Armed Forces'  duty to enter and eliminate the terrorist groups. Probably, and  this is being investigated, some Armed Forces members committed  abuses in isolated instances. It is denigrating to learn that a  soldier raped someone. It is not a matter of counting to see if  one or 18 people have been raped or killed. All cases are acts  of aggression against human rights. These acts must be harshly  punished. But it is wrong to generalize and involve the entire  Armed Forces or police in these acts because it turns the issue  into a political issue. It is also wrong to cover up things.    [Tafur] Do you agree with Monsignor Cipriani that all those  human rights commissions are nonsensical, as he has publicly  said?    [Yoshiyama] No, in no way do I agree. I believe that each  commission of this type, like the Human Rights Coordinating  Board, like all human rights groups, does play a role. They  certainly operate as a counterweight within society. The problem  begins when there is exaggeration, when groundless statements  are made. If Monsignor Cipriani said what you are telling me, I  do not agree with him.    [Tafur] If Fujimori were reelected, do you think Commander  Nicolas de Bari Hermoza should keep his post throughout the  government term?    [Yoshiyama] Ask him. Do not ask me. Work relations between  two people are known to those two people. It is not only a  matter of professionalism, but also of personal rapport, of all  the things that make relations between people so productive.    [Tafur] My question obviously was not aimed at the emotional  side of the relationship.    [Yoshiyama] No, I am not talking about that. I am referring  to the professional side. I hear the news; I read. I believe  General Hermoza is doing an excellent job in his fight against  terrorism. I know Hermoza's merits because he is not a general  who stays at a military building handling documents. He is at  the battle front. If you read the news, you will learn that  Hermoza is in Upper Huallaga, in Tarapoto, in Madre de Dios,  just everywhere. To put it clearly, "it is the master's eye that  makes the mill go." That is the reason for the successful drug  enforcement effort. When the history of Peru is written, the  name of Nicolas de Bari will deserve a special place. But the  decision is to be made by the president.    [Tafur] Will a second Fujimori administration bring anything  new? Will there be any news from a structural viewpoint, say, in  terms of a government program?    [Yoshiyama] The main problem here is to fight poverty and  create new jobs. I believe very significant steps forward have  been taken, but we are still very far from this objective. Major  reforms have been enforced, but this is over because the reforms  have already been implemented. We should look at the future,  continue with the reforms, like in the agricultural sector. We  will not give up before Peruvian cherimoyas, for example, are  sold on the international market. A Peruvian cherimoya costs $50  in Japan. Several things must be corrected. First, land deeds  should be issued for farmers in order to create a land market;  second, the Water Law should be thoroughly amended to give water  the most advantageous use; third, transportation facilities,  highways, and ports should be improved; and fourth, the dollar  value should continue to be increased. This project, which seems  as simple as exporting cherimoyas, calls for several things that  have not been made yet, which are halfway done and have to be  made.</p>

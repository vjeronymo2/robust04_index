			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / World Trade News: Norway may get sharp boost in gas payments SEVERAL European buyers of natural gas from Norway's giant Troll field have agreed to a novel adjustment in the terms of their purchase contracts which could increase significantly sales revenue for Europe's biggest gas supplier. Norway this year will export more than 28bn cubic metres (bcm) of gas to France, Germany, Holland, and Belgium. However, exports will expand to around 40 bcm of gas in 1994 under the Troll supply agreement. Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, leads the consortium which sells natural gas on Norway's behalf. Under a new clause in the Troll supply contract - a so-called price review clause - both the buyer or seller may demand prices per cubic metre of gas be renegotiated at any given point in time to better reflect prevailing market conditions. European demand for natural gas has grown fast since the Troll sales contract was agreed in 1986 and the price review clause works to the advantage of Norway which is coming under increased pressure to meet rising demand. For example, for each NKr0.01 per cubic metre increase in the sales price of the gas, Norway's sales revenue could rise by some NKr400m annually if Norway deemed that market conditions had changed since the original price was agreed in 1986. By the year 2010 supplies from the Troll field alone could peak at up to 50 bcm annually. This could mean a massive increase in revenue for Norway. There are 'fixed criteria' under which market conditions can by definition be considered to have changed, but these details are known only to the sellers and buyers.</p>

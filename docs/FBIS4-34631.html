			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Uruguay monitored through 16  June.    According to the Central Bank, the central government  registered a $15 million deficit in April compared with a $24  million surplus in the same month last year. Tax revenues  declined 2.2 percent and export earnings fell 5 percent due to  tariffs cuts. The government's surplus in the first four months  of the year shrank to $14.1 million compared with the $103  million surplus in the same period in 1993. The reason is that  government spending increased 11.7 percent in real terms in the  first four months of the year compared with the same period last  year. Social security expenditures, which represent 41.3 percent  of the government's current expenditures, showed the highest  increase -- 23 percent. Investments rose 45 percent, totaling  $120 million in four months. (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO  in Spanish 6 Jun 94 p 9)    In its Monetary Balance released on 3 June, the Central  Bank,  BCU, reported that its net international reserves have  maintained the rate of growth registered since July 1993 with  the exception of November 1993. They increased $21.2 million in  May, thus totaling $1.28 billion. This performance indicates  that despite the growing trade deficit the balance of payments  continues to show a surplus, which amounted to $78 million in  May. The two main factors that accounted for the rise in  reserves were a $35 million increase in banking system deposits  in the BCU and the net purchase of $23.5 million in foreign  exchange by the BCU. Despite the increase in net international  reserves in May, the BCU foreign exchange position registered a  $4.5 million contraction last month, declining to $44.6 million.  The BCU Monetary Balance also reported that the money supply  contracted in May due to a reduction in net domestic credit,  which was prompted by the increase in the banking system  deposits in the BCU. (Montevideo BUSQUEDA in Spanish 9 Jun 94 p  31)    Industrial production was down 18.1 percent in the first  quarter of the year. Excluding oil refining, which has been  paralyzed since April 1993, the contraction in industrial  production was 5.9 percent by volume. The sharpest decline was  in "chemical substances," mainly due to the aforementioned  paralyzation. The drop in the employment rate is seen in both  the 12.6 percent decline in hours worked as well as the 13.6  percent shrinkage in hired workers. This is especially  significant in the "textiles, garments, and leather industry."  (Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 9 Jun 94 Market Indicators  Section p 1)    The BCU reported on 3 June that Uruguay's net external debt  decreased 3.7 percent to $1.838 billion in the first quarter of  the year due to an increase in international reserves. The gross  debt, however, increased $77 million, totaling $4.369 billion at  the end of March. Liabilities in the nonfinancial public sector  were $3.7466 billion. Loans to the central government and  government-owned enterprises accounted for more than half this  amount while liabilities from the issuance of public securities  in foreign currency accounted for the remaining $1.558 billion.

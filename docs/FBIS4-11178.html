			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Third of three-part article by "the people's lawyer" from </F> the Fricasse" column: "Zedillo's Men"]    [Text] We have now reached the third part in this trilogy  of articles on Zedillo's team. We began with Salinas'  associates, continued with Colosio's associates, and now we will  introduce the most loyal Zedillo associates. This is the group  that has created the most expectations because it is the closest  to the candidate and the least known. Once again, these people  share an impeccable university education and steady progress in  the government apparatus.    For starters, there is Fausto Alzati Araiza, currently  director of National Council for Science and Technology. He  studied law at UNAM [National Autonomous University of Mexico]  and received a master's degree and a doctorate in political  economics and government from Harvard University. He has worked  in the energy sector, including Secretariat of Energy, Mines,  and Parastate Industry and Mexican Petroleum, and has served as  economic adviser at National Finance, Inc., the Planning and  Budget Secretariat, and Institute for Political, Economic, and  Social Studies.    Another of Zedillo's cronies is Antonio Arguelles Diaz  Gonzalez, who studied arts and economics at Stanford University  at the same time that Cordoba Montoya was working toward his  master's degree. Arguelles Diaz is now deputy coordinator for  administration and finance of the PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party] presidential campaign.    Hector Morales Corrales, the federal government's spokesman  in Chiapas, was Zedillo's classmate at the Instituto Politecnico  Nacional. He has worked in the field of press and public  relations at System for Complete Family Development, National  Consumer's Institute, Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit,  SPP [Secretariat for Planning and Budget], and SEP [Secretariat  for Public Education] with Zedillo.    Miguel Antonio Estrada Meza, Zedillo's former private  secretary while at SEP, has held administrative positions at  this secretariat and at Baja California's Autonomous University.  He graduated as a teacher from the Mexicali Teacher's School  and received a degree in political science from the Baja  California Autonomous University. In addition, he holds a  master's degree on pedagogical discipline from California  University and a doctorate in sociology from UNAM.    Another of Zedillo's cronies is Pascual Garcia Alba  Idunatec.  Garcia Alba, born in Hidalgo, currently holds the post of deputy  secretary for educational coordination at SEP. He has a  master's degree in economics from the College of Mexico and a  doctorate in economics and a master's degree in arts and  philosophy from Yale University.    There is also a woman, Aurora Pierdant Grunstein, who now  holds the post at CONAFE [not further identified], an agency  that supports SEP. She has a degree in economics from ITAM  [Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico], a master's  degree in planning from the Social Studies Institute in the  Netherlands, and a doctorate in economic policies which she  received in the United Kingdom. She distinguished herself by  founding the Institute for Peasant Studies. German Andres  Fernandez Aguirre is a lawyer and has held juridical positions.  He is linked to Zedillo through SPP, SEP, and, particularly  through the Banco de Mexico.    Fernando Solis Camara y Jimenez Camet played a significant  role in Zedillo's academic development. Solis Camara has even  been mentioned in connection with Zedillo's doctoral thesis.  Solis Camara is an economist who graduated from Anahuac  University, holds a master's degree in public policy and a  doctorate in public policy from Harvard University and a  master's degree in economics from Boston University.    Sonora-born Eduardo Guadalupe Almeyda Armenta, the current  director of professions at SEP, graduated from UNAM's Law  School. He worked as private secretary and technical secretary  at SEP, the Foreign Relations Secretariat, the Chamber of  Deputies, and SPP.    A very important young politician and Zedillo's crony is  Carlos Mancera Corcuera, only 31 years old. He is an economist  who graduated from ITAM, and he is the son of Miguel Mancera  Aguayo, the first governor of Banco de Mexico. Zedillo  appointed him associate director for scientific and  technological policy at SEP thanks to the man's direct  relationship with Mancera Aguayo. Zedillo is grateful because  Mancera Aguayo helped him secure the position of economic  technical adviser and a scholarship to study in the United  States.    There are other Zedillo associates. Pascual Garcia Alba, a  classmate at Yale; Raul Talan Ramirez, deputy secretary for  education, who graduated from the Instituto Politecnico Nacional  just as Zedillo did; Jose Angel Pescador, Jose Cordoba's  classmate at Stanford and related to Zedillo through Cordoba;  Gilberto Guevara Niebla; Olac Fuentes; Antonio Gago Huget, an  education technician who joined Zedillo's group through SEP;  German Fernandez Aguirre, lawyer at UNAM and Banco de Mexico;  Elias Calles, Perez Correa, Juan Rebolledo, Dionisio Perez  Jacome, and Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, Zedillo's liaisons with  the Army, old PRI members, and certain political factions  outside the PRI.    From the profile of these men, probable assistants to the  probable president of the republic, we can see that the economic  aspect is adequately covered by experts in the field. The good  news is that we can predict that the team will be particularly  sensitive toward social and educational aspects. If the vote  count favors Zedillo, we will see the presidential ribbon on his  chest, and in his cabinet we will see many of these names which,  for the good fortune of Mexico, are not at all improvised or  inexperienced.</p>

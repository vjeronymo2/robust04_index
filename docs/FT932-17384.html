			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Caring for key clients How much emphasis should companies place on managing their key customers? The question was tackled - if not necessarily resolved - this week at a seminar organised by the Sundridge Park corporate and executive development centre in Kent. Top of the agenda were results from what Sundridge Park believes is the first reliable UK survey of Account Management (shorthand for the art of paying particular attention to, and developing a long-term relationship with, specific customers). Based on the responses from 300 manufacturing and service businesses, the survey demonstrates that practice for the moment varies widely: in 18-19 per cent of companies polled, for example, more than four fifths of total turnover is handled by account managers, but in nearly 25 per cent of cases the figure drops to under a fifth of total sales. Among the findings is evidence that too much may be expected of account managers - on average individuals in half the companies looked after more than six clients, which some experts think may be too much. Training needs are also being neglected - 40 per cent of companies said there had been no formal training for account managers in the last year. Nor are the rewards exactly handsome. Two thirds of respondent companies were paying under Pounds 30,000 (including commissions and bonus) per manager, and 16 per cent less than Pounds 20,000. More encouragingly, there are signs that companies have been able to integrate account management across product areas and different territories The most important test, of course, is the bottom line. Sundridge detects a tentative link between 'defensive' or 'responsive' sales strategies and lower sales growth. But more research is needed to establish a clearer relationship between offensive strategies such as account management and better performance.</p>

			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Group of Seven: Brady's tight schedule calls for some fast talking - G7 Diary US Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady is either a harsh taskmaster or an incurable optimist. He packed no fewer than seven items onto the agenda of yesterday's Group of Seven meeting which began only at 11.30am and was to end at 5.15pm - although in the event it slightly overran. The most contentious issue - the world economy and the policies to be pursued to ensure low inflationary growth - was given 1 1/2 hours at the beginning. A discussion on exchange markets was scheduled over an hour-long working lunch. Trade and financial issues relating to eastern Europe were allocated 50 minutes to 2.50pm, and ministers and central bank governors were then expected to polish off long-term developments in the Middle East in the 40 minutes to 3.30. Some 50 minutes were alloted to the international debt question, including how best to help Egypt and how to avoid granting too favourable debt forgiveness terms to too many countries. The 25 minutes to 4.45 were deemed enough to deal with relations between the Soviet Union and the so-called IFIs - bodies such as the IMF and World Bank. In the final scheduled half-hour the 21 assembled finance ministers, central bankers and top treasury officials were due to discuss the communique. Under this schedule, if only the seven finance ministers opened their mouths, they would have had 13 minutes each to discuss Mr Brady's wish for lower interest rates and a mere 3 1/2 minutes each to address the Soviet Union's future links to the IFIs. We can only guess what G7 new boy Donald Mazankowski made of this. Mr Mazankowski ('Maz') was appointed Canadian finance minister a week ago. Known as 'minister for everything', because of the large number of government offices he has held since 1979, Maz is said to be as hard-working as his predecessor, Michael Wilson, who despite taking over Canada's trade and industry portfolio will be chairing today's meeting of the IMF policymaking interim committee. Maz is a grassroots politician and has had only limited dealings with economic issues. But this should be no handicap. Among the finance ministers, France's Pierre Beregovoy, Japan's Ryutaro Hashimoto and Germany's Theo Waigel came to their present jobs from non-financial backgrounds. Karl Otto Pohl, the German Bundesbank president, seems to be developing some affection for European economic and monetary union. Speaking to the G7 Council, a talking shop of the great and the good, he recalled that the feathered variety of Emu has two characteristics: it can't fly and can only go forward. That specification would suit Mr Pohl, who doesn't want to rush union. The application in January by Albania to join the two institutions leaves only three sizeable countries outside their sphere of influence. Although the question of the Soviet Union's membership is likely to be put off for some time, the institutions are regularly sending missions there. The countries without applications pending are a rather odd mix: Cuba, North Korea and Brunei. The World Bank's new chief economist, Larry Summers, already has at the age of 35 a pretty impressive resume. Eight years ago he became professor at Harvard University, said to have been the youngest so appointed. If Michael Dukakis was now in the White House, Summers would have almost certainly been the head of his Council of Economic Advisors. He has made his first public pronouncements since joining the bank over the past week, suggesting that he will not be afraid to tackle some of the broad issues now facing the bank - such as the link between economic performance and democracy. Of the statistics he is fond of quoting, he points to one as the most striking: that infant mortality is higher and life expectancy lower in New York City than in Shanghai. The Chinese, he notes, spend only 5 per cent of their Dollars 500 annual per capita income on health care. In the third world, Yemen, Sri Lanka and Indonesia have about the same per capita income. Yet life expectancy in Yemen is 51 years, in Indonesia 60 and Sri Lanka 70.</p>

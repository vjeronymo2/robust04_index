			<p>BFN     [Text] Tiraspol, ROMPRES, 23/06/1994 -- Informed sources  from the 14th Army told BASA that a group of 30 officers of the  Dniester Security Ministry had left for Crimea. The group is  assigned to take part in preparing the soldiers of the Crimean  Interior Ministry to carry out certain military operations.  Sources from the Dniester security told BASA that such  information is totally unfounded. The same sources stated that  the spreading of such rumors is part of the campaign to  discredit Tiraspol officials. Earlier, it was said that a group  of eight officers of the "Delfin" detachment and "Dniestr"  battalion of the Dniester Interior Ministry were sent in 1993 to  Abkhazia to organize diversions in the rear of the Georgian  Army. Sources from the 14th Army said that the Abkhazian defense  minister sent a letter to the Tiraspol Interior Ministry  recommending promotion of the officers of the "Dniester"  battalion who took part in military operations in Abkhazia.</p>

It was Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze who proposed  extending the emergency at the parliament session on January 18.  He said it was needed to enforce law and order in the country.    Opposition deputies who agreed with the head of state on  most  points demanded that he give up the "services" of the Defense  Ministry in enforcing the emergency and lift censorship of mass  media.    Shevardnadze responded by saying that there was not  censorship in the country while the emergency was being enforced  by the police and interior troops.    The emergency was extended in a 112 to 23 vote with 15  abstentions. There are 220 deputies in the Georgian parliament.</p>

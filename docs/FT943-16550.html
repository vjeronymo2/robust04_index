			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Arafat in Gaza Another important, if still largely symbolic, stage has been passed in the Middle East peace process. Mr Yassir Arafat, having signed an outline peace agreement with Israel and won recognition for the Palestine Liberation Organisation, has now returned to territory freed from occupation. With the toughest part of the negotiations yet to come, it is vital for Mr Arafat and the Palestinians to build quickly on what has been achieved. This means buckling down to the detailed work of creating a viable administration. Miracles are not expected. The heavily populated Gaza strip and Jericho suffer serious economic deprivation and guerrilla organisations do not breed efficient bureaucrats overnight. Mr Arafat also faces political opposition from Islamic and radical forces, thousands of Palestinians are still in Israeli jails, while more than 30 per cent of the Gaza strip remains in Israeli hands, along with virtually all the West Bank. But the achievements can already be appreciated. The level of violence in Gaza has dropped sharply and the Palestinian police force appears to have made a good start. More than Dollars 2.4bn is available over the next five years to rehabilitate and improve the infrastructure. Some of these funds have also been necessarily committed to budget support and assisting the Palestinians establish a bureaucracy. There is too much at stake for donor governments to insist on unreasonably high standards of trans-parency and accountability. In return, they have every right to expect Mr Arafat to behave in the democratic manner to which he is committed. Elections for an interim Palestinian self-rule authority are due to be held just as soon as Israel has completed its withdrawal and troop redeployment in the West Bank. Mr Arafat should not be allowed to duck that requirement. Israel also bears a heavy responsibility for the success of the present experiment. Pulling out of the West Bank carries a much weightier domestic political price than departing from Gaza, but speed and a greater flexibility in Israel's negotiating stance are essential if even the modest momentum so far achieved is to be sustained. The Israeli government of Mr Yitzhak Rabin should be additionally buoyed by Jordan's agreement to resume direct bilateral negotiations later this month. The issues which divide the two governments are by no means minimal, but should be capable of resolution within relatively few months. The return of Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, to the region shortly also suggests there is some chance of a breakthrough in Israel's negotiations with Syria. Symbolism may not be a substitute for substance, but the message behind the television pictures of Mr Arafat, back on his home territory and being cheered by thousands of Palestinians, will not have been lost on President Hafez al-Assad or King Hussein.</p>

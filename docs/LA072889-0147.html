			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EARLIER BID REJECTED;  </P> <P> TENDER OFFER RAISED TO $11 FOR NEWPORT  </P> <P> A Connecticut investor, whose $9.50-per-share offer was rebuffed last week by  Newport Electronics, has sweetened his offer for 35% of the company's stock to  $11 per share.  </P> <P> In documents filed Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission,  Milton B. Hollander upped his original offer to increase his holdings in the  Santa Ana maker of electronics instruments.  </P> <P> Hollander -- both individually and through a holding company called High  Technology Holding Corp. -- currently owns 13% of Newport's shares.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Board Rejects Offer  </P> <P> On July 19, Newport's directors rejected Hollander's $9.50 per share offer in  favor of two offers it has received from Sensor Control, a Sunnyvale maker of  heat and pressure sensors.  </P> <P> Sensor Control has made a tender offer of $9.75 for 43% of Newport's  outstanding shares, said Norman Gray, a Newport board member. In addition, the  Sunnyvale firm has made a merger offer to buy the remaining Newport stock at $9  per share, if the tender offer goes through, Gray said.  </P> <P> Two days after rejecting Hollander's $9.50 offer -- but before the $11 offer  was made -- Newport's directors voted to recommend that shareholders tender  their shares to Sensor Control, Gray said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Action on New Offer  </P> <P> "We haven't taken any action on (Hollander's latest) offer as far as modifying  our recommendation," Gray said Thursday. "I'm not sure if it's a possibility. .  . . Everybody's considering meeting. No meeting has been called yet."  </P> <P> According to the filing, Hollander will seek the resignations of all of the  company's current directors, except for Barret B. Weekes, Newport's chairman  and president, if he gains control of the company.  </P></p>

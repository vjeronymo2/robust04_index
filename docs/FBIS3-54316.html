This was stated by  the foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, while talking to  newsmen in Islamabad today prior to his departure for Tehran to  attend ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization] ministerial  meeting beginning tomorrow. He said the representatives of  Hezb-e Wahdat [Islamic Unity Party], Jonbesh-e Melli [National  Movement], Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party], and Jabha-e Melli  [National Liberation Front] put up a seven-point proposal for  the solution of the Afghanistan problem. The foreign minister  said Pakistan cannot decide itself as it has no favorites. He  said it is a matter for the Afghans to decide.    The foreign minister said he will brief the ECO foreign  ministers on the latest developments in Afghanistan and human  rights violations by Indian occupation forces in occupied  Kashmir. The ECO council of ministers will consider a broad  range of subjects, including the establishment of ECO trade and  development company, shipping company, airlines, and insurance  company.</p>

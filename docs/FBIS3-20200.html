			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpt] Prosperity Party [PP] leader Necmettin Erbakan  has declared that his party increased its share in the votes by  100 percent in the 27 March local elections. Erbakan, in a news  conference in Ankara today, said that according to results he  received from his party's organization, PP is the winner of the  elections. Under these circumstances, Erbakan noted, the  parties that have shrunk should unite under the PP.    Charging that the votes of the coalition government dropped  from 48 to 33 percent, Erbakan asked for early elections as soon  as possible. He proposed a True Path Party [TPP]-Motherland  Party [ANAP]-Social Democratic Populist Party tripartite  coalition until the early elections on a trial basis.    According to information reaching him from provinces and  districts, his party is leading both in the municipal council  elections and the mayoral posts, Erbakan remarked, adding that  from now on his party will mark 27 March as the holiday of local  authorities. He said:    [Begin recording] The most important number showing the  strength of the parties is the votes for the provincial  councils. These results are not final yet. The work is still  continuing. Looking at the data so far, we see that the PP is  leading with a big majority in the big cities, in the towns, in  districts, and in townships. As far as the total provincial  council election results are concerned, the three parties -- PP,  ANAP, and TPP -- are competing with one another. Any one of  them is leading in accordance with the vote counts. We have not  yet received the final results. [end recording] [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Renewed buying helps Nikkei erase week's losses Buying by public funds supported share prices and the Nikkei average, which has been depressed by overseas selling, erased most of the week's losses, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 index rose 201.54 to 20,449.39, marginally lower than last Friday's close of 20,462.89. The index fell to a day's low of 20,318.16 in the early afternoon before rising above the 20,500 level for the first time in a week to 20,517.10, the day's peak. The fall in the yen against the dollar encouraged dealers and individual investors, while public fund managers were seen buying export-oriented stocks in the afternoon. But volume totaled 273.7m shares against 286m. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 15.95 to 1,637.41 while the Nikkei 300 gained 2.83 to 297.16. Gainers led losers by 799 to 199 with 156 issues remaining unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 7.64 to 1,333.79. Traders said investor confidence had improved as the Nikkei has remained above the 20,000 level. However, trading was expected to stay within a narrow range next week as most market participants are reluctant to buy stocks aggressively at higher levels. Export oriented stocks, which had been hit by selling from overseas investors, gained ground. Toshiba, the most active issue of the day, rose Y6 to Y733 and Hitachi Y13 to Y965. Nissan Motor rose Y22 to Y770 and precision machinery companies also improved, with Canon up Y10 to Y1,710 and Minolta adding Y10 to Y525. Profit-taking hit Ihara Chemical Industry, which rose Thursday on speculative buying. The stock fell Y30 to Y1,270. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 237.68 to 22,736.49 in volume of 14.4m shares. Roundup A positive mood prevailed in much of the region. TAIPEI advanced 1.6 per cent on the day on purchases of plastics, electronics and financial sector stocks, so ending a two-day correction. The weighted index gained 107.27 to 6,749.40, 4 per cent ahead on the week. Turnover was TDollars 100.5bn. Leading computer makers Microtek International and First International Computer both rose by the daily permitted seven per cent limit, gaining TDollars 3.30 to TDollars 50.50 and TDollars 6 to TDollars 92 respectively. Plastic stocks were strong on expectations of continuing international demand for petrochemicals, with Taiwan Styrene Monomer gaining TDollars 6 to TDollars 93. SYDNEY climbed to its highest level in seven trading days, as sentiment was boosted by options-related trade and encouraging economic data. The All Ordinaries index rose 19.4 to 2,061.5, up 0.5 per cent this week. Turnover was ADollars 740.8m. Brokers said news that the current account deficit, which narrowed to a seasonally adjusted ADollars 1.439bn in June, from ADollars 1.699bn in May, was at the lower end of market expectations. Foster's Brewing dominated volume with 30.8m shares exchanged. The stock rose 2 cents, or 1.8 per cent, to ADollars 1.12, with most of the major broking houses involved in heavy options-related trade. Among gold stocks, Pacific Placer surged 22 cents to a five-week high of ADollars 33.45 and Poseidon Gold added 9 cents to ADollars 3.38, its highest share price in 14 weeks. North Flinders Mines, which earlier reported a 47 per cent rise in annual net profit to ADollars 30.01 million, was steady at ADollars 8.35. HONG KONG finished moderately higher after profit-takers pared early gains and the Hang Seng index added 80.15 to 9,482.81, for a 3.6 per cent rise on the week. Fund buyers had pushed the index to a high of 9,525 before profits were taken. Preliminary turnover dropped sharply to HKDollars 4.26bn from Thursday's HKDollars 6.54bn. Among blue chips, HSBC rose HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 93.00 and Swire Pacific gained HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 63.50. Property developers also performed well with Cheung Kong advancing 60 cents to HKDollars 37.90 and Sun Hung Kai Properties climbing 65 to HKDollars 50.25. But the real estate investor, Hong Kong Land, was a target of profit-taking, losing 15 cents to HKDollars 20.50. KUALA LUMPUR overcame a round of profit-taking and continued its advance for the sixth straight day. The composite index closed 1.21 higher 1,027.51, taking the week's rise to 2.7 per cent. Volume swelled to 215m shares from Thursday's 159m, boosted by a lower-than-expected inflation figure for June and overnight gains in Wall Street. Pan Malaysia Cement jumped 76 cents to MDollars 5.60 after its announcement of a two-for-one bonus issue. SEOUL finished higher after an afternoon spurt, led by gains in several blue chips and banking issues and the composite index closed 7.45 higher at 933.65, 0.6 per cent down on the week. Posco and Samsung Electronics were limit up, adding Won25,000 each to Won73,400 and Won91,000 respectively. SINGAPORE came back from its intraday high, while trade in Malaysian stocks dealt over the counter benefited from renewed rumours of an impending election announcement in Malaysia. Some resurgent interest from Japanese funds in Singapore bank stocks was reported although brokers were still mixed on the market's near-term outlook, seeing a prolonged consolidation still on the cards. The Straits Times Industrials index closed 5.18 higher at 2,206.42, little changed on the week. MANILA finished slightly higher as PLDT and Philippine National Bank showed strength. The composite index put on 12.07 to 2,803.21, up 3.4 per cent across the week. Turnover was 1.26bn. WELLINGTON improved on light volume, the NZSE-40 capital index up 18.23 at 2,027.18, unchanged on the week. Telecom rose 10 cents to NZDollars 4.78 ahead of going ex dividend on Monday. SHANGHAI's A index fell another 7.38 or 2.2 per cent to close at a new record low of 328.84. The decline came ahead of a statement from the stock exchange authorities announcing a suspension of the issue and listing of new shares in Shanghai and Shenzhen for the rest of this year, in an effort to stabilise and standardise the markets.</p>

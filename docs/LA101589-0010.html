			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN UGLY JAZZ STORY;  </P> <P> MILES THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY BY MILES DAVIS WITH QUINCY TROUPE (SIMON &amp;  SCHUSTER: $22.45; 416 PP.)  </P> <P> As if the biographies and movies dealing with the narcotics problems of Billie  Holiday, Art Pepper, Hampton Hawes, Bud Powell, Anita O'Day, Charlie Parker and  Chet Baker were not enough, we are now confronted by the dreary, drug-ridden  story of Miles Davis, which he had assured his public would be a book about  music.  </P> <P> As it turns out, the grinding monotony of these pages too often relegates music  to secondary consideration, while interminable passages deal with the women he  has beaten up, the musicians and managers he has fought with, and his  off-on-off-on-off-on relationship with cocaine, heroin and other mind-altering  impedimenta.  </P> <P> What has long been an open secret is now in print: "From 1975 to early 1980 I  didn't pick up my horn," Davis says. "Mostly during those four or five years .  . . I just took a lot of cocaine (about $500 a day at one point) . . ." He also  had sex with "all the women I could get into my house. I was also addicted to  pills, like Percodan and Seconal, and I was drinking a lot . . . mostly I  snorted coke, but sometimes I would inject coke and heroin into my leg; it's  called a speedball and it was what killed John Belushi."  </P> <P> Clearly it did not kill Miles Davis, but over the years dope ruined his health,  his career and his marriages. Yet there is not enough mea culpa to sound a  cautionary note; he gladly admits that he "really enjoyed" getting high on  champagne, beer, Cognac and cocaine.  </P> <P> "Miles" begins as the story of a black boy who grew up with advantages that  were unusual for any musician. His father, an oral surgeon in East St. Louis,  prospered even during the Depression. His mother wore mink. While other black  kids were struggling to escape from the ghetto, Miles Dewey Davis III was  riding horses on a large family estate, or serving on the golf course as a  caddy for his daddy.  </P> <P> His parents sent him to study at Juilliard, but after a year there he preferred  the company of beboppers. Barely out of his teens, on tour with the Billy  Eckstine orchestra, he began using cocaine and heroin, starting a 5-year  descent into a hell from which his father tried to rescue him.  </P> <P> The irony is that Davis' work, with its scurrility and pragmatic  sensationalism, will reach the best seller lists. Moreover, it will be praised  for its "painful honesty," though in fact it is riddled with major and minor  factual errors that indicate dishonesty and sloppy research. Typically, after  lambasting the promoter Monte Kay for making money off black people, he says  that "today he's a millionaire living in Beverly Hills." Kay never lived in  Beverly Hills; also, he died in May 1988. In another instance, Davis claims  that many white musicians, after working for black leaders and being nobly  treated by them, go out on their own and use only white sidemen, and that the  late pianist Bill Evans was one such white man. The truth is that Evans, after  leaving Davis, used the black drummer Philly Joe Jones, the black bassist Rufus  Reid, and recorded with several other black artists.  </P> <P> This is, in fact, an often untruthful, frequently ugly book without the  slightest redeeming value as literature. Its almost inevitable acceptance in  the marketplace bodes ill for the future documentation of musicology.  </P></p>

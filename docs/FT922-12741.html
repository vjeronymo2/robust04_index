			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Knives come out in France for Maastricht pact THE long-delayed French debate over the Maastricht Treaty on European Union seems finally to have been unleashed by President Mitterrand's weekend declaration that he expected to be able to complete ratification soon, probably by the summer. The realisation that ratification and the accompanying reform of the French constitution are now almost upon them, has suddenly goaded the critics of the treaty into mounting their campaigns and mustering their forces. The out-and-out nationalist opponents of Mr Mitterrand's vision of a quasi-federal Europe appear too few to block the Maastricht treaty. However, Mr Mitterrand could have more serious problems with moderate critics, who are already manoeuvring to set conditions for ratification, which may seem reasonable but could be incompatible with the treaty as signed. The outright opponents include the Communists on the left, and small nationalist fractions of the Socialist party, the centre-right UDF umbrella grouping, and the right-wing Gaullist RPR party. Outside parliament, the extreme right-wing National Front and the Greens may also be expected to campaign against the treaty. Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, former defence minister, will not vote for the treaty, but his nationalist clan has shrunk to well under 10 per cent of the Socialist party. In the Gaullist party, Mr Philippe Seguin has launched the anti-Maastricht campaign, with a book* co-authored with a group of like-minded politicians and jurists. But after calling a meeting of Gaullists yesterday, he was apparently able to draw only about a dozen. The official line of the UDF is traditionally pro-European and pro-federalist. Its leadership, headed by former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, has promised support in general terms. There are certainly two ultra-nationalist UDF MPs, Mr Philippe de Villiers and Mr Alain de Griotteray; but if there are more, they have not shown their colours. Serious trouble is only likely to come from the Gaullists. So far Mr Jacques Chirac, the party leader, has kept his head well down. The leadership is manifestly determined not to oppose the treaty on principle; on the other hand, it needs to satisfy the unreconstructed populists on the right as well as the moderate modernisers in the centre.

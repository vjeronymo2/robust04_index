			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXXON, AT SHAREHOLDERS' URGING, VOWS NEW ENVIRONMENT POLICIES  </P> <P> Exxon said Thursday that it will appoint a person with an environmental  background to its board and adopt new policies that its shareholders suggested  in the wake of the Alaskan oil spill.  </P> <P> Exxon said it also will recommend that its directors establish a committee to  review corporate policies and programs related to worker safety and the  environment.  </P> <P> In addition, Exxon said it will consider spending more money on environmental  research and pollution prevention. About $5.5 billion has been spent in that  area from 1970 to 1988, it said.  </P> <P> The announcement comes about a week after Exxon management met with  representatives of New York City's pension fund, a large shareholder.  </P> <P> New York City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, who recommended the changes, said  he was pleased by the announcement.  </P> <P> "It's a rather extraordinary development for a large American company," he said  in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> Ed Rothschild, a spokesman for the Washington consumer group Citizen Action,  called the announcement nothing more than "a public relations window dressing"  that will do nothing to improve the environment.  </P> <P> New York City officials had said that three city pension funds owning 6 million  shares of Exxon stock would vote against management at the May 18 annual  shareholders meeting if the company failed to act on their recommendations.  </P> <P> California's state employee pension fund, the nation's biggest, had indicated  that it might back the New York group.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 9 Mar (DPA) -- The Honduran military  today accepted the 10-percent cut in the defense budget ordered  by President Carlos Roberto Reina. General Reynaldo Andino  Flores, defense and public security minister, said the Honduran  Armed Forces will make their share of sacrifices by accepting  their budget cut.    The budget earmarked for defense in 1994 totals over 250  million lempiras (a little over $30 million), as approved by the  Congress. Independent sources, however, indicated that in  reality the defense budget is more than 600 million lempiras  (over $70 million), since the military budget is increased  through internal transfer mechanisms.    On Monday, President Reina announced a 10-percent reduction  in the general budget of the central government and autonomous  institutions. The entire public budget, including the central  government and autonomous institutions, totals approximately 12  billion lempiras ($1.5 billion), meaning 1.2 billion lempiras  ($150 million) will be cut from the budget.</p>

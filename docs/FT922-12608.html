			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Survey of Swindon (2): Driving force loses steam - Council answers claims that it has turned away from further growth THAMESDOWN has been a very enterprising authority council for a long time and has been the main driving force behind the town's expansion. From 70,000 in the 1950s, the population has more than doubled to 178,000 today. After 30 years of active growth, however, there have been some signs more recently of a slowing down and of some uncertainty over the scope and rate at which future development should take place. The evidence for this comes from a number of sources: After examining sites in a number of locations,BMW and Coca-Cola decided not to establish new plants in Swindon; Norwich Union withdrew from a scheme with the borough council to redevelop the main shopping complex in Swindon, the Brunel Centre; There have been cutbacks in spending at the economic development department which has been largely responsible for promoting Swindon in recent years; The council has decided to oppose the development of new greenfield sites. on promoting growth. Mr Tony Mayer, the leader of the Labour-controlled borough council, firmly denies that the council wants to stop further development. He says: 'Frankly, developers are taking far too naive a view of what we are doing. BMW wanted to develop a 92-acre site at Lydiard Fields at the western extremity of Swindon, just outside Thamesdown's local government area in the neighbouring district of north Wiltshire. 'There was a lot of local opposition to the development because there is a great deal of traffic around there, at Junction 16 of the M4 motorway. In the end, the application went to appeal to the department of the environment and permission was given. 'It was at the time of the collapse of eastern Europe and BMW decided it would be better off in Munich. The site is being developed. 'As for Coca-Cola, they wanted to develop the so-called Triangle site next to Honda. It was Thames Water which raised objections saying that there would not be enough water in the area for what the company had in mind, in terms of bottling or canning. It would have put pressure on the town's resources. 'With Norwich Union we went through a long list of potential developers and chose Norwich because of its good track record. 'We own the Brunel Centre. We accept that it needs refurbishing and upgrading. We were and still are keen to redevelop it. But come the recession, Norwich pulled out. It was we who were left in the lurch.' Mr Mayer says that in none of these cases could the blame for projects falling through be laid at the council's door. He insists that Thamesdown remains keen to help development wherever it can. The deputy leader of the council, Mr Jim D'Avila, cites the case of Honda setting up on the old airfield on the east of the town at South Marston. Honda bought the 360-acre site for Pounds 3m in the late 1980s. This was less than a third of the going commercial rate at the time. Had it not been so cheap Honda would probably have gone to either Wales or the north of England. The reason it was so cheap was that the land did not have planning permission. Mr D'Avila says: 'Once we knew that Honda was seriously interested we moved heaven and earth to get the planning permission. We knew that Honda would generate lots of jobs. 'Rover might have disappeared without Honda and Rover is a major employer.' Mr Mayer maintains it is just not true that the council has not made enough provision for further development of the town. He says: 'It is nonsense to suggest that we are anti-development. If you take in the northern development area, the Tarmac development at Churchward next to the station, the area left in the western expansion and the space on at least seven business parks, there are hundreds of acres for development. There is certainly enough space for at least the next 10 years. There is also around 1m sq ft of office space available in the town centre itself.' He continues: 'The developers are interested in greenfield sites because they are cheaper and easier to develop. However, we must strike a balance. There has been a major expansion here in the past 20 years, one of the fastest anywhere in the country. 'Pressures do develop and we want to make sure that we not only preserve the physical and social environment but also the economic environment. It was, after all, the employers who were complaining to us about labour shortages.' Explaining the cutbacks at the economic development department where the head of social and economic development has been made redundant from his Pounds 40,000 a year job along with others, Mr Mayer says: 'There has been a programme of redundancies and natural wastage but this reflects the severe cutbacks which we, along with other local authorities, have had to cope with in our spending. It does not mean we are less committed to promote the town.' Mr Mayer says that the council's revenue budget has been slashed from Pounds 25m last year to Pounds 23m this year and will be cut to Pounds 21m next year. Economic promotion is one area where cuts have been made.' He says: 'Times are very hard. We have Pounds 23m sitting in the bank from the sale of council homes but we are not allowed to spend it. Our capital budget has come down from Pounds 20m to Pounds 4m in the last two years.' The crux of the matter is that a council which has for so long been vigorously entrepreneurial and pro-active now finds stiff limits on its spending abilities. The caps imposed on its outlays by the central government are not the only reason for its low-key promotion activities. Mr David Griffin of J P Sturge, a main estate agent, says: 'It is important to recognise that the council is no longer a major landowner. It is like an old aristocratic landowner who has been forced to sell his estate but still wants a say in how it is run.' A council officer who does not want to be identified puts it differently: 'The council has had to undergo a cultural change now that it does not have the funds or the land to be an instigator of change. It is still coming to terms with this. Its changed role may have created the impression that it wants to blow the whistle on further development. This is not true.' Unfortunately it has been rather careless in the way it has presented its case for consolidation. The danger is that once the institutional money starts flowing again after the recession ends, it will bypass Swindon and go to places such as Cardiff which is heavily promotional, because Swindon is thought not to be interested.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleh Shmid: "The Election Became a Kind of </F> Revenge"]    [Text] A parliamentary election is always a war of ideas.  But in Ukraine, for some reason, it resembles a civil war. Two  camps, two mentalities, two dissimilar halves of Ukraine are  seeking revenge against each other over some wretched people's  deputies, who have been fiercely shot at from all sides. We must  acknowledge the following fact: In this election the Dnieper  River has historically divided our state into two huge election  districts. Success in one of them was turned into defeat in the  other.    More than half--64 out of 120 deputies from the left-wing  parties--have been elected to the parliament in just 4 Eastern  Ukrainian oblasts: Lugansk, Donetsk, Kharkov, and Zaporozhye.  Two-thirds of the people's deputies with a right-wing radical  orientation--8 out of 12--have been sent to the new parliament  from just 2 Galician oblasts--Ternopol and Lvov. But the people  closer to the Dnieper, in general, did not want to vote for  anyone: Most of the election districts with incomplete voting  are in the city of Kiev--18, as well as in the Kiev--7,  Dnepropetrovsk--13, Poltava and Vinnitsa (6 each) oblasts.  Crimea was an utterly unique case. Twelve districts in that  peninsula failed to reach the point of complete voting.    The first conclusion to be drawn here is as follows: Ukraine  has not yet brought forth such a powerful political force which  could unite the two societies living on the different sides of  the Dnieper. However, it has already brought forth left-wing and  right-wing radicals who are capable of transforming the Dnieper  into a frontline.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   The most contentious analysts have already calculated  that--out of the 337 persons newly elected to the  parliament--almost 200 acknowledge their membership in a certain  political party or election bloc with a precise political  orientation. The people, whom the parliament of the previous  convocation shamelessly burdened with a majority-type electoral  system, openly voted not so much for a specific candidate as for  his political bent. This is precisely the most suitable moment  for drawing our second conclusion: Our people are not stupid,  and they are capable of coping with party lists. Therefore,  during future elections we will hardly be able to neglect the  proportional principle in forming a parliament.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   Eight-tenths of the National Democrats who have made it to  the parliament should understand the following point: Their  strength lies in the "swamp." The latter is populated by  approximately 100 deputies with an indeterminate political  orientation, predominantly from the camp of the "independents"  or the "party of power." Whoever carries most of the "swamp"  over to his own side will have a parliamentary majority.  However, a spectrum analysis of this Ukrainian "swamp" yields  some disturbingly gloomy conclusions: There is a great deal of  red coloring here. And, therefore, the chances of profiting from  additional votes from the "swamp" are possessed by the  left-wingers--the Communist and Socialist parties, as well as by  the Peasants' Party of Ukraine--whose proportion in the Supreme  Council will amount to 120 persons. They lack only 50 votes to  create a parliamentary majority....    From everything mentioned above the third conclusion  presents  itself: The National Democrats ought to be made aware that they  have lost this election. Their principal tasks in this  parliament are not to allow the communists to lead our country  back to a point from which there is no return. That is to say,  they must endeavor to block whatever anti-Ukrainian or  anti-market decisions which may be made, while creating--at the  same time--alliances, when necessary, with the "party of power,"  the National Radicals, and--at times--even with the  Inter-Regional Bloc for Reforms. The main thing is to resist  temptation and to reject those two or three offers to work in  the government--offers which will undoubtedly be made to the  National Democrats at the time when the ministerial portfolios  are being distributed among the communists and the "party of  power." This is the simple hook which last year caught many  persons ready, willing, and eager to butt their heads against a  stone wall and which--in Eastern Ukraine created the myth of the  "Benderist-Nationalist" government in Kiev, a government in  which the only protectors and defenders of the people are  Zvyahilskyy, Landyk, Yevtukhov, and some other honest brothers.    The best thing that the National Democrats could do for the  government is to keep quiet and remain satisfied to see how the  communists attempt to extricate Ukraine from its economic  crisis. In order to sense its own fall, our people evidently  have to fall to the very bottom. And when everybody comes to  understand that this really is the bottom, perhaps a new  election will be called. The people must finally learn how to  change their rakes--how to substitute new ones for the old ones.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   The greatest danger for Ukraine lies in those oblasts on the  Dnieper which had 113 election districts not voting completely.  Whereas the present-day parliamentary game of solitaire still  allows for a blockage of openly anti-state or communist sudden  moves, several dozen Leninists or chauvinists elected in runoff  elections could totally shatter this delicately balanced glass.  If the pendulum begins to swing in the other direction, and the  people rush to elect right-wing radicals, war will begin in the  parliament and end in a slaughter throughout Ukraine.    There will be no fourth conclusion. Each person is capable  of  drawing it on his own.</p>

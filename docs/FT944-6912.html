			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Russia, US square off over security: Differing views about expanding the role of the CSCE As Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, discussed the Bosnian crisis with Serb leaders in Belgrade yesterday, his country was preparing a much broader initiative aimed at putting Moscow's stamp on the new security order in Europe. Russia wants a sharp upgrading of the prestige, budget and powers of the 53-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which groups the US, Canada, virtually all the countries of Europe and the former Soviet republics. It will press this idea hard at next week's CSCE summit in Budapest. The US - whose views on European security will be set out in a speech today by Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state - also wants the status of the CSCE raised. But that is where the resemblance between US and Russian thinking ends. For Russia, an upgraded CSCE could give Moscow a degree of influence over security in western Europe, while confirming Moscow's role as the main player in the security of the Commonwealth of Independent States. For the US and some European countries - including the ex-communist nations such as Hungary - boosting the CSCE would work as a sop to Moscow, helping to calm its objections to the expansion eastwards of Nato. Yet the latest pronouncements from Russia suggest that Moscow is not ready for such a trade-off: it wants both to upgrade the CSCE, and to head off the expansion of Nato. Russia's prickly mood was underlined when President Boris Yeltsin went to the border town of Pskov, his most important public engagement this month. Faced with claims for the return of 2,000 sq km of land which belonged to pre-war Estonia, he vowed not to give up a centimetre of Russian soil. Mr Yeltsin's pledge won fulsome praise from the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic party led by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Estonia, like virtually all the ex-communist states of central Europe, wants to be integrated into the European Union and ideally Nato. But Moscow is anything but reconciled to the idea of Nato expanding. Opinion among Russians, inside and outside officialdom, is firm: 'It's at least 99.99 per cent against Nato enlargement,' says Mr Sergei Karaganov, a presidential foreign affairs adviser. 'Everyone believes it would push Russia into a corner and increase tension, not bring security.' As for the upgrading of the CSCE, Russia's continuing commitment to this was underlined last week by Mr Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the Duma, parliament's lower house. He spoke of the need for the CSCE to 'obtain a mandate for the decision of all questions of security in Europe' and reaffirmed Russia's support for a CSCE Security Council along the lines of the UN. Russian hopes of playing a central role in a new European security structure  -with or without the CSCE - have been boosted by signs of disagreement between western Europe and the US over Bosnia. According to the daily Sevodnya, Mr Kozyrev was encouraged by his recent trip to France and has begun to talk privately of an 'historic Franco-Russian alliance' as a pillar of a new order in Europe. He has also suggested that both Nato and the CSCE may be superseded. 'Can't we give an innovative reply to the entirely new European situation which is emerging today in the mid-1990s?' the paper quoted him as asking. Western diplomats in Moscow acknowledge that Russia's opposition to Nato enlargement is, for now, both firm and heartfelt. But they hope that this could change if the issue is handled with care, and if Moscow is drawn further into the Partnership for Peace, a programme for military co-operation. On the face of things, US enthusiasm for early moves towards the expansion of Nato should set alarm bells ringing in Moscow. In today's speech Mr Christopher is expected to state firmly that Nato must 'begin the process' of expansion in the coming months. Mr Richard Holbrooke, the assistant secretary of state for Europe, recently confirmed the US policy of boosting the CSCE on one hand while keeping Nato strong, and preparing to expand it, on the other. Diplomats see only one way in which Washington's stated enthusiasm for enlargement and Russia's opposition could be finessed. Moscow has said it would not object to the enlargement of Nato as long as Russia itself is viewed as a candidate - however hypothetical - for membership. While Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, has said Russia can never join Nato, US officials avoid being so categorical. They speak of 'procedures' and 'criteria' by which members could be admitted to Nato, without naming countries. Cynics will no doubt say that that these word-games are a way to 'keep the Russians happy, and the East Europeans hoping': that is what they said when PFP was launched a year ago.</p>

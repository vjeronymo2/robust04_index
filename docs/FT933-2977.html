			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / War over price of transatlantic calls heats up PRESSURE TO cut transatlantic telephone call charges will intensify following a reduction of a quarter in the 'wholesale' price of delivering calls carried by AT&amp;T, the US operator, and Mercury, the UK competitor to British Telecommunications. The agreement, to take effect next month, led to an escalation in the war of words between AT&amp;T and BT. AT&amp;T accused BT of dragging its feet on concluding a similar deal between the two carriers. In a speech in London last night, Mr Iain Vallance, BT chairman, strongly attacked AT&amp;T for lobbying for the break-up of BT. He warned the government against 'pursuing the commercial equivalent of unilateral disarmament' in its attitude to the US giant's ambitions to enter the UK market. The AT&amp;T agreement with Mercury concerns accounting rates, the price carriers pay each other for delivering international calls to their final destination. US-UK accounting rates have halved in the past four years. AT&amp;T says, however, that the new agreement with Mercury still leaves rates at twice the cost of carrying calls. Its existing agreement with BT sets the peak-rate price at nearly three times the actual cost. Mr Tom Luciano, AT&amp;T's deputy director for international settlements, said: 'We are looking for an agreement with BT similar to Mercury's, however BT's response has been too little and too late.' BT said that in May it had proposed a 'sizeable reduction' in its accounting rate, and expected to reach agreement with AT&amp;T 'soon'. It declined to disclose figures. Since a majority of US-UK traffic originates in the US, AT&amp;T has a strong financial interest in driving down accounting rates and destroying the system which has kept them artificially high. Its campaign to reduce transatlantic rates has acquired added intensity by its growing rivalry with BT. In the past three months both companies have formed international alliances - BT with MCI, AT&amp;T's main US competitor. AT&amp;T has also applied for a government licence to gain direct access to the UK public telecommunications network. The Department of Trade and Industry is considering the application. Mercury welcomed yesterday's deal as 'good for customers' and supported AT&amp;T's objective of reducing accounting rates towards cost. It said that prices had already fallen by 40 per cent for large customers in the last three years and that the new agreement provided the world's lowest inter-continental accounting rates. In his speech last night, Mr Vallance called for stronger government support for BT in its quest to become a global company. 'The UK may have given up on the idea of national champions. The trouble is that the rest of the world has not,' he said.</p>

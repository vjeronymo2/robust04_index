			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW AND USEFUL: CONSUMERS;  </P> <P> CRUSHER LENDS CAN RECYCLERS A HAND  </P> <P> For recyclers, a new hand-operated compactor for aluminum cans called the  Crusher is now available nationwide in retail home centers, drug and discount  stores.  </P> <P> According to a spokesman for Pacific Fabrication Inc. in Rancho Cucamonga,  which makes the device, the wall-mounted Crusher "will easily and safely crush  12-and 16-ounce cans for efficient recycling, transporting and storage." It is  constructed of heavy-gauge steel and has a white baked-enamel finish.  </P> <P> Suggested retail price for the Crusher is $19.95. Currently, you can find it at  Ace Hardware, True Value Hardware stores and some Longs Drug Stores.  </P> <P> </P> <P> European Massager  </P> <P> There's a new non-electric massager from Europe that may interest athletes and  exercise buffs. Available for several years in West Germany, it's now being  sold nationwide through a distributor in Lomita. Endorsed by professional  golfer Bernhard Langer and Jimmy Kim, gold medalist in martial arts at the  Seoul Olympics, the Dermapoints massager is a roller -- consisting of 20 wheels  with 560 silver-plated points -- mounted on a rod with a plastic handle. The  idea is to roll it over the area where you're experiencing muscle pain to  increase the blood circulation and stimulate the skin. For best results,  company literature recommends using Dermapoints "regularly, eight to 15  minutes, up to twice a day," while also suggesting that consumers consult with  a doctor for proper diagnosis of any injury.  </P> <P> According to a manufacturer's representative, the product is FDA-approved for  sale in the United States and may be advertised as a device that "temporarily  relieves pain due to fatigue or overexertion, relieves tired muscles and  increases blood circulation in the area where it is applied."  </P> <P> Dermapoints comes in two sizes: Model 100 with the single roller at $110.45,  and Model 200 with double rows of rollers at $148.72, including sales tax and  shipping costs; C.O.D. is an additional $2. To order with MasterCard or Visa  call (800)-325-8477 in California or (800) 343-9803 if you live out of state.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Game Serves as Alarm  </P> <P> There's something new for kids that children and parents may both like. It's a  sound device -- a weapons-noise simulator for games played on bicycles -- that  also serves as a bike alarm.  </P> <P> The eight-ounce unit can be easily attached to bicycle handlebars and produces  four noisy sounds for make-believe bike battles -- a rocket launcher, machine  gun, laser blaster and a death ray. When you push the buttons, FIRE WHEN READY  emits tones like the sound effects from "Star Wars."  </P> <P> But it also can be programed as a motion-detector alarm -- activated by  pressing the alarm button after locking the bike with a chain lock. It does  scream if someone is tampering with the bike, and only the bike's owner -- who  programmed it with a code by pushing a combination of numbers -- can deactivate  the alarm.  </P> <P> At suggested retail of $14.99 to $19.99, it is available nationwide at K mart  stores and some Longs Drug Stores. In the Los Angeles area you also can  purchase it at Mr. G's Expressions stores, Lehr &amp; Black gift shop in  Beverly Hills, Cycle World in Northridge and Buddy Brown Toys in Studio City.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Signs for the Times  </P> <P> If you need a special sign for a birthday party or garage sale or want to make  a big personalized greeting card, you might try a new sign-making kit that will  create a sign in a few minutes by using a standard copy machine.  </P> <P> Bosses might not appreciate your using the office machine, but you can take the  kit -- composed of 8x5-inch letters, numbers, punctuation marks, a dollar sign  and a heart -- to your nearest copier shop and do it yourself, even in color  letters. Two letters fit on one copy page.  </P> <P> "It costs pennies per letter," said the kit's designer, Bill Baltz, a sign  painter for 20 years. "I got a lot of requests for paper signs, but my  customers were usually shocked when they found out how much sign painters  charge, and usually they wanted the sign immediately . . . I kept trying to  figure out a way they could make their own signs quickly and cheaply."  </P> <P> The sign kit comes with a plastic carrying pouch, easy instructions and hints  for better sign making. After copying the letters on individual sheets of  paper, you simply tape the copies together on the back. To order, for $5.95,  plus $1.05 for same-day, first-class shipping, write: Bannerman, 23 S. Fairview  Ave., P.O. Box 1261, Goleta, Calif. 93117. LYNN SIMROSS  </P></p>

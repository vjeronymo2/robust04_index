Gradov, Scientific Research </F> Institute of Nondestructive Testing; UDC 629.735:620.179.16]    [Abstract] The emergence of new-generation aerospace  equipment, e.g., super- and hypersonic aircraft, space shuttles,  cryoplanes, etc., calls for developing new materials and their  manufacturing and processing technologies as well as methods of  identifying the flying vehicle status during operation. The  problem of developing new methods of nondestructive testing of  welds is especially acute in aerospace engineering. Acoustic  testing based on the integral link between the metal structure  and its mechanical and acoustic characteristics is one of the  most promising methods whereby the material structure fully  determines its physical and mechanical properties, such as  ductility, strength, thermal conductivity, etc., while also  determining the characteristic features of elastic vibration  generation and propagation, i.e, the propagation velocity,  damping factor, acoustic emission intensity and its spectral  composition and phase correlations, etc. In particular,  attention is focused on ultrasonic and acoustic emission methods  and their advantages. A block diagram of the general acoustic  testing principle and a block diagram of a new-generation  acoustic diagnostic complex are cited, and the acoustic data  processing methods are described. Such a real-time  computer-based system may be placed on-board an aircraft but it  may be more efficient as a means of incoming and final  inspection. A plan for further development of acoustic  diagnostic methods is outlined. Figures 4; references 1.</p>

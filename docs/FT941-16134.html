			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Mexico seeks truce in armed uprising Mr Manuel Camacho, Mexico's newly appointed commissioner for peace and reconciliation in the southern state of Chiapas, is willing to meet rebel leaders to reach a political solution to the armed uprising that began last week. The former foreign minister said yesterday he would seek a truce as soon as possible. 'It is necessary to reconstruct the political process in the region. We will have to reach a dignified political solution for everyone. We will have to offer, in actions, a real solution to the problems.' Mr Camacho is a skilful political negotiator. The son of an army doctor, he has strong family links in the region. His appointment and apparent willingness to explore every avenue of negotiation is a strong sign that the Mexican government is looking for a conciliatory solution to the uprising. Mr Camacho will not receive a salary, and formally his commission will not represent the government. His appointment on Monday and the replacement of hardline interior minister Mr Patrocinio Gonza with respected attorney-general Jorge Carpizo, yesterday helped to revive Mexico's jittery stock market, which closed 3.8 per cent higher. On Monday the market fell 6.3 per cent, with investors worried about the Chiapas conflict spreading to other parts of Mexico. On Monday the defence ministry reported that clashes with rebel forces were 'minimal,' in an indication the conflict was subsiding. The army claimed that some groups of indigenous peasants had abandonned the rebel forces, after saying they were forced to participate. The self-styled Zapatista rebels seized several towns in Chiapas last week. They demanded a total ceasefire and formal recognition as a condition for the beginning of dialogue, according to a document handed to a Chiapas newspaper on Monday night. The document, signed by Commander Marcos, a rebel leader, demanded that the Mexican army withdraw from the conflict areas and return to army bases. Mr Camacho did not address specifically the demands of the rebels, saying he would have to confirm their veracity. The document denied that foreigners or clerics were involved in their movement, as the government has maintained. It said the majority of the Zapatistas are indigenous peoples from Chiapas, although some followers are from other social origins and states of the country. Mr Camacho, who until he lost out in the race to win his party's nomination to succeed President Carlos Salinas, was Mayor of Mexico City, said: 'It was not in the interests of the country to follow formulas that in other countries have led to prolonged violence, great suffering, and an absence of solutions.'</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Skill shortages threaten upturn in W Midlands Skill shortages have begun to appear in the west Midlands as the regional economy, still heavily dependent on manufacturing, starts a jerky recovery from recession. Fears that such shortages, a characteristic of the region during the growth years of the 1980s and present until late 1990, could inhibit sustained recovery have been fuelled by a series of reports and supported by anecdotal evidence. 'If we keep on going with a few percentage points of growth, that can be coped with. If there is an upsurge, the problems will be there,' warned Mr Bill Nicholls, the training specialist at the Engineering Employers' Federation West Midlands. Last year, the consultants Cambridge Econometrics forecast that, of all the UK regions, the west Midlands would be the most likely to be hindered by skill shortages. By June this year the West Midlands Business Survey, conducted by Wolverhampton Business School, was reporting a rise from 8 per cent to 12 per cent over the previous six months in companies facing difficulties in finding the right staff. The Confederation of British Industry and BSL, consultants, reported during the summer that more employers in the west Midlands and Wales - 13 per cent  -than in any other regions expected skill shortages to limit output over the following four months. Against the background of a long-standing regional shortage of managerial and professional skills, the Department of Employment said last month: 'There are now more lower and intermediate-level occupations being reported as difficult to fill.' But the position differs. There is no present indication of skill shortages in Birmingham or Wolverhampton. In Solihull, the Jobcentre sometimes finds it difficult to fill specialised positions, for example, some computer software specialists. In Madeley, Telford, the Jobcentre has filled nearly every vacancy - 'occasionally we have difficulty with specialised engineering things'. There are reports from Sandwell of problems in filling skilled engineering vacancies. Dudley is short especially of technical sales, setters and draughting personnel. Central England Training and Enterprise Council (Centec), based in Redditch, has surveyed 600 companies and found 21 per cent with vacancies which are hard to fill, half of which are professional and managerial and a third are engineering technicians. Information, however, is imprecise. The Department of Employment has reduced in number its classification of occupations so its statistics are more vague. Further, computer glitches have deprived it of information about the length of time vacancies are available. Employment analysts noted that difficulty in filling a vacancy could reflect low pay, bad conditions, unsocial hours or other factors. They also pointed to a mismatch between the presence of skills and the presence of work. Slimma, the women's clothing manufacturer, is expanding from its base in Leek to Cannock, Staffs, because of a shortage of machinists. Mr Gary Green, operations manager of Grau, the Redditch anti-lock braking system maker, said he had had vacancies for software engineers for a year. 'There are no major universities nearby you can feed off. The nearest is Birmingham and there you go into a pool with companies like Lucas trying to pull people off.'</p>

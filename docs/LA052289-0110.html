			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 1ST CLOSED UNDER N.J. ORDER: DEBT TOO BIG;  </P> <P> LAST HAND DEALT AT ATLANTIC CITY CASINO  </P> <P> Roulette wheels came to rest and the last card was turned onto the blackjack  felt at Elsinore's Atlantis Casino Hotel today as it became the first New  Jersey casino closed under state order.  </P> <P> When dealer Stan Kowal dealt his last hand at 3:47 a.m., more state gaming  regulators were in the casino than customers, and gamblers were saying "Good  luck" to Atlantis employees.  </P> <P> The state Casino Control Commission last week determined that the gaming hall's  $144-million debt was too big a risk to the industry's integrity to allow  continued play on Atlantis' three-tiered casino floor.  </P> <P> Only subtle signs indicated that casino employees were working their last  shift. A blackjack dealer taped a small "goodby" note to his table, and some  floor supervisors wore black-tinged carnations.  </P> <P> At the craps table, Larry Fishman threw out the last set of dice.  </P> <P> "I enjoyed myself here for seven years," he said. "I wanted to do it for  sentimental reasons, I guess."  </P> <P> Atlantis has been plagued with financial problems since 1981, when it opened as  the Playboy Hotel &amp; Casino.  </P> <P> In November, 1985, Atlantis filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but  when a reorganization plan was finally implemented in September, 1988, the  losses continued to mount.  </P> <P> The state Division of Gaming Enforcement, the arm of the state attorney  general's office that polices the industry, reported that the Atlantis was  losing money at the rate of $56,000 a day.  </P> <P> At the division's recommendation, the commission voted in April not to renew  Atlantis' regular casino license and appointed a conservator.  </P> <P> At least 1,000 of the hotel's 2,000 workers are affected by the casino closing.  </P> <P> Near the slot machines, mechanics gathered to console each other this morning.  </P> <P> "Ordinarily, we'd be fixing machines, but it doesn't matter now," said one  mechanic who would identify himself only as John. "It took me a year and a half  to get this job, and now I'm out looking again."  </P></p>

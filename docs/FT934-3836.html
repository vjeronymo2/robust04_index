			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft denies problems as shares tumble Metallgesellschaft reacted angrily yesterday after a newspaper report alluding to liquidity problems wiped almost 12 per cent off the group's share price on the Frankfurt stock exchange. The stock tumbled DM46 on the day, picking up only marginally after the company denied the story. Officials at the diversified metals, mining and industrial engineering group suggested insiders might have been responsible for reports of liquidity problems allegedly arising from speculation in US oil futures. Denying any difficulties, the company suggested the report, in the respected Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, might not have appeared simply by chance. However, it was not sensible to speculate over possible sources or reasons, he said. In a formal statement the company said its US subsidiary, MG Corp had did not speculate in oil futures on Nymex, the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was normal to hedge and cover delivery contracts to its customers on Nymex to avoid taking open positions, Metallgesellschaft said. When world oil prices were falling, additional payments had to be made on account, and MG Corp had always paid them promptly. These payments had lately turned out to be higher than expected. The company said suggestions that the company had had to find up to DM3bn (Dollars 1.8bn) at short notice were 'rubbish'. 'In order to be prepared for a further possible fall in the oil price, Metallgesellschaft has agreed to adapt its financing framework agreement with Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank,' the company said. The deal was done after Nymex prices for oil for January delivery hit a five-year low in the latter part of last week. MG Corp has about 500 large customers for oil products in the US and runs a fleet of about 200 delivery trucks. Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the group's chairman, said last week that MG did not have any liquidity problems and was the subject of a whispering campaign. Mr Schimmelbusch warned recently that the group might omit its dividend for the year to the end of September when it fell into a pre-tax loss of DM347m after the previous year's DM245m profit. However, he said he was confident of a return to the black in the current year. The continued sell-off of non-core businesses was expected to yield a DM600m book profit in 1993-94, and results would be helped by workforce reductions and other measures designed to cut costs by DM1.1bn in the three years to 1995.</p>

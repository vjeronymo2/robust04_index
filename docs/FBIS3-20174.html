The three worked on a  drinking water project and were seized last Friday [25 March]  close to the capital, Sanaa. Nothing has been heard from them  since.    The kidnapping is related probably to conflicts between  local  tribes and the government. Yemeni tribes regularly resort to  kidnapping to add force to their grievances against the  government. It is not known which tribe is responsible for the  latest kidnapping.</p>

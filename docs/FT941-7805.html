			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Road blocked Sir, The Swiss have the power to restrict access of foreign vehicles to their roads ('Swiss voters threaten to buck traffic trend', February 17). Switzerland is a sovereign state. It is also a land-locked state, so should beware of starting such fights. I suspect that the Swiss need access to EU roads more than the EU needs access to theirs.

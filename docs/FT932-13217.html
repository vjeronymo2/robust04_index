			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Austria heads for stagnation Austria is likely to suffer a short period of economic stagnation this year, with growth resuming at a modest 1 to 2 per cent next year, according to an annual country study by the Paris - based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Ian Rodger reports from Zurich. The OECD sees unemployment, at 5 per cent, continuing to rise. Inflation, at 4 per cent, should soon fall because of the sensitivity of Austrian trade unions to the risk to employment. The study says Austria has 'reaped the full benefits from building credibility' by pegging the schilling to the D-Mark. The short-term interest rate differential with Germany has disappeared and the country was unaffected by last autumn's currency turmoil.</p>

But Sensitive Issue  Remains Regarding Aerospace Research Policy That Awaits Clear  Answers"]    [Text] "We are not waiting for approval of the fourth  research framework program by the Twelve to launch specific  programs." That was how Antonio Ruberti, European commissioner  responsible for research policy recently submitted a working  document on what the future specific research programs should be  and that will be, in principle, the concrete expression of the  Community research framework program for 1994-1998. Antonio  Ruberti does not conceal the fact that the main objective in  submitting that working document is to speed up the legislative  process of the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament  to avoid momentary interruption of the financing of research  projects in January 1995. That is why, anticipating the  conclusion of the work of the Twelve and of the Euro-deputies,  Antonio Ruberti further defined the content of the specific  programs and sketched out the related budget lines (see box).  <H5>  Many Unresolved Problems </H5>   If, from a perspective of the impact of the announcement,  Antonio Ruberti and his colleagues are scoring a point, in  reality, all the problems presented some months ago have not  been resolved. To be sure, the college of commissioners did  somewhat lower the antagonisms among the various general  directorates of the Commission. It clarified the respective  purviews of the services that are parties in this issue. It did  set up inter-service groups to coordinate approaches and avoid  duplications. But it did nothing affecting the substance since  it did not manage to give concrete expression to its idea of  having horizontal research benefit the largest number while  supporting well targeted industries, no matter what it says in  this regard.    This applies especially to the aerospace sector that  functions like a magnifying mirror for the contradictions of the  member states and the European Commission. In fact, the top  question that some in Brussels are posing is to know whether  research projects can reasonably be conceived that can  contribute to improving the competitiveness of railways,  shipping and aviation simultaneously while the aerospace  industry, for instance, needs to face its own technological  challenges in order to be able to confront its chief rivals.    A top European official states: "You see, generic research  has become a religion, whether with the Commission or the member  states. So, horizontal research has to be done. But  simultaneously, the member states are telling us to still  coordinate specific actions for certain elements of European  industry without giving the impression that the Community is  supporting one sector more than another. The problem is that the  mechanism enabling us to solve this contradiction still has to  be invented." For an old veteran of the Brussels scene, there is  no doubt: "Therefore, within the Commission as well as among the  Twelve, everyone has to agree on what coordination means. By  planning the work, precisely defining the objectives to be  pursued, concurrently with the member states and their  industries, over the short, medium and long term, whether for  research on behalf of the aerospace, automobile or computer  industry, then there are prospects of being able henceforth to  solve this contradiction. All parties also have to know the  precise level of the total credits allocated for research in  those three sectors. On the other hand, if coordination means  drawing up a list of projects, the odds are strong that we will  have a heck of time in doing away with that ambiguity. And each  industry or laboratory will continue to try to glean as much  funding as possible."  <H5>  Lowering Acoustic and Gaseous Emissions </H5>   But it is not only on this underlying issue that the working  document on specific programs has not contributed any answer.  Others remain pending. For instance, those involving knowledge  of what Community aerospace research covers in terms of funding  allocated and specific activities to be performed. What is the  underlying strategy? Put another way, in which direction is  Community aerospace research headed? For example, is it going to  end up as massive financial support for projects focusing on  problems of management and control of air traffic to the  detriment of projects aimed at lowering acoustic or gaseous  emissions or improving propulsion technologies.    In its working document the Brussels Commission believes  that  the EEC should support ground/on-board communication, especially  via the use of satellite links supplementing traditional  resources like radar. The catch is that the real question has  been skirted. Europeans are lagging quite a bit in this sector  and they therefore have to opt for U.S. technology -- Global  Positioning System [GPS]-Global Navigation Satellite System  [GNSS] -- or for Russian Glonass know-how. But, neither the  Commission's services nor their officials have found a common  bond.  <H5>  Air Traffic Management </H5>   The General Directorate of Telecommunications and new  technologies, the DGXIII, that controls all projects developing  computerized communications in transportation and therefore  those focused on air traffic management, swears only by the U.S.  military system while the General Directorate of Transportation,  the DGVII, the policy and reflection leadership in matters of  transportation, is steadfastly inclined towards the Russian  option.    By failing to clearly broach some issues, the European  Commission is simply reflecting the pervasive coolness  prevailing among the member states and their contradictions. It  is unwilling to risk suffering a refusal. Hence its current low  profile. And yet it has made some attempts. Last year, Jacques  Delors, European Commission president, was prepared to supply  more resources to research policy to enable the Europeans to  stay in the technology race. The Twelve said "nyet" at Edinburgh  in December 1992. Jacques Delors should press forward again with  his White Book on the growth initiative. But the odds are heavy  that the Twelve will send him back to his fond analyses.  <H5>  [Boxed item] </H5> <H3>  European Commission Proposals Capable of Benefiting The  Aerospace Industry </H3>   Computer and communications technologies:     -  Total budget: 3.888 billion European Currency Units [ECU]  (One ECU=FF6.6).    -  The Commission proposes earmarking 24.5 percent of the total  budget for computer communications with 40-52 percent of that  24.5 percent set aside for computer communications in  transportation, medical care and administration.    -  In the transportation sector, the Commission set two  priorities: finalize a unified system using computer  communications instruments to enhance the capability and promote  use of satellite links to improve air/ground communication.       Industrial Technologies:     -  Total budget: ECU1.573 billion    -  The Commission is proposing that 34-39 percent of the total  budget be earmarked for design, engineering, production systems,  33-38 percent for related materials and technologies, 10-12  percent for advanced propulsion technologies and 12-16 percent  for standardization and testing.    -  In the aerospace sector, the Commission set two priorities:  work on fluid dynamics and on lowering energy consumption in  propulsion systems.       Environment:     -  Total budget: ECU625 million    -  The Commission is proposing to earmark 55-56 percent of the  total budget to the natural environment, to quality of the  environment, to global change, 20-30 percent to improvement of  "own" technologies and 10-20 percent to enhancement of earth  observation know-how.    -  In the space sector, the Commission drew up the following  priorities: assistance for advanced technologies research in the  sensors sector, EEC participation in the "Vegetation" space  sensor that will be incorporated into the SPOT satellite system,  EEC participation in development of AMAS atmospheric sensor,  financial support for development of a European decentralized  system for management and access to space data.       Transportation:     -  Total budget: ECU 280 million    -  The Commission is proposing to earmark 18-22 percent of the  total budget for definition of a European multimodal system and  78-82 percent to optimization of existing transportation  systems. Of that 78-82 percent, air transportation should  appropriate a not insignificant share for itself since it will  get 16-18 percent of that budget. Ditto for railways, albeit  somewhat less than the maritime and internal waterways  navigation that will get 19-21 percent.       Third Country Cooperation     -  Total budget: ECU790 million    -  The Commission is proposing to earmark 47-54 percent of the  total budget to scientific and technological cooperation in  Europe with the lion's share (41-47 percent) set aside for  research and development projects with the East European  countries and the former republics of the Soviet Union [CIS],  4.8-5.3 percent with non-European industrialized countries and  41-47 percent with developing countries.</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET;  </P> <P> WEATHERING THE WORKPLACE;  </P> <P> FITNESS;  </P> <P> EMPLOYERS FIND THOSE WITH PHYSICAL HANDICAPS CAN DO A FIRST-RATE JOB.  </P> <P> When Hewlett-Packard was trying to fill a high-level position for a research  scientist, a job that required some travel, the top contender was a man with a  doctorate who also had a physical disability, which necessitated the use of a  wheelchair.  </P> <P> So Hewlett-Packard contacted the Job Accommodation Network (JAN), a unique hot  line that acts as a clearinghouse for information for employers seeking special  accommodations for workers with disabilities. (The phone number for JAN is  1-800-526-7234.)  </P> <P> The network was set up five years ago by the President's Committee on the  Employment of People with Disabilities to help employers determine what  accommodations are necessary to help a person with a disability perform a job.  </P> <P> On the network's recommendation, Hewlett-Packard bought a portable hand control  device with a rod-and-pulley system that attaches directly to a car's brake and  accelerator and works like a hand brake on a bicycle. The $200 device can be  installed quickly in any car, making it possible for the job applicant to use  any vehicle in the company fleet. The man with the disability got the job.  </P> <P> "Ten years ago, JAN didn't exist and the product probably didn't either," said  Robert Ingram, affirmative action representative at Hewlett-Packard, the Palo  Alto-based electronics giant. "I would have tried to track something down, but  there's no guarantee I could have found anything to accommodate this man. Who  knows? He may still have gotten the job. But he certainly would have been  restricted as to some of the things he could be given to do in that job."  </P> <P> Attitudes toward people with disabilities and their role in the work place are  changing. Indeed, a recent survey by Louis Harris &amp; Associates of New York  found that:  </P> <P> * The overwhelming majority of managers give employees with disabilities a good  or excellent rating.  </P> <P> * Nearly all employees with disabilities do their jobs as well or better than  other employees in similar jobs.  </P> <P> * Eight out of 10 department heads and line managers feel employees with  disabilities are no harder to supervise than those without.  </P> <P> * Sixty percent of top managers said their companies can provide in-house  training for people with disabilities.  </P> <P> "We are getting away from the idea that people with disabilities are sick and  need care," said Frances Gracechild, executive director of Resources for  Independent Living in Sacramento. "That view is really a form of  discrimination, much like the discrimination suffered by blacks and women."  </P> <P> The difference, she said, is that while minorities may be disliked, "disabled  people are liked, sort of like sacred cows. 'Here, let us give you a nice  convalescence hospital to live in the rest of your life.' But that 'kindness'  is really denying people with disabilities equal rights to participation within  the community."  </P> <P> And it is that misdirected sentiment on the part of the non-disabled population  that many advocates believe has provided the biggest hurdle to those with  disabilities.  </P> <P> "It is not just the lack of ramps and physical barriers that have kept us from  participating," said Ramona Garcia, who serves on the California Governor's  Committee for Employment of Disabled Persons. "It is the attitudinal barriers  that are toughest of all."  </P> <P> The biggest hurdle for Ron Brown, an associate at the California Human  Rights/Fair Housing Commission, "was proving to myself what I always knew I  could do."  </P> <P> "Growing up, I heard a lot about what I would never be able to do as an adult  because of my disability," Brown said. "I grew up with shows like Andy Griffith  with a real bread winner who could take care of life and I always wanted to be  one of those fathers. I don't have any children yet but I have proven to myself  that I could be that breadwinner."  </P> <P> Today approximately one-third of the 36 million people with disabilities are  employed, according to a recent survey by the National Organization on  Disability. But that means two-thirds are still unemployed.  </P> <P> "We've never had any decent data in the past, and we feel that more people with  disabilities are working today than ever before," said Mary Kaye Rubin,  legislative analyst for the President's Committee on the Employment of People  with Disabilities. "The sad fact is that this two-thirds unemployment rate is  probably an improvement.  </P> <P> "The good news is that the statistics indicate that the U.S. labor force is  declining, while the number of new jobs is on the rise," she said. "The baby  boom is over. Companies have discovered they have to go after new sources,  which will be good for minorities and women, of course. We hope that it will  spill over for people with disabilities."  </P> <P> With economic independence, people with disabilities can take control of their  own destiny, said Gracechild.  </P> <P> "But they must do that by applying for jobs and expecting to get them," said  Gracechild, who says people should use the equal employment opportunity laws to  protect their rights. "If people with disabilities are willing to settle for  second-class participation, that is what they are going to get."  </P> <P> Advocates for people with disabilities say everyone benefits from the increased  independence and participation of this part of the population.  </P> <P> "This new involvement in the work force by people with disabilities is a  godsend to the economy," said Gracechild. "If you look at the health and  welfare budget, it is going up exponentially."  </P> <P> Today workers with disabilities hold almost every kind of job in Wendy's  restaurants. McDonald's Corp. has a McJobs program. International Business  Machines Corp. said it hired its first person with a disability in 1914 and  approximately 4% of its current workers have disabilities. For four years,  Apple Computer Inc. has had an office of special education and rehabilitation  which works to increase awareness and implementation of microcomputer  technology for children and adults with disabilities. Honeywell Corp. has a  Handicapped Employees Council to help employees with disabilities reach career  goals.  </P> <P> Even the athletic image of a fighter pilot is not immune to change. At Edwards  Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert, a test pilot's success depends on a  2,500-member civilian team that includes about 250 people who have the "right  stuff" in intelligence, training and motivation -- along with physical  disabilities.  </P> <P> Accommodations to allow someone with a disability to perform on a par with  other employees are often simple. JAN's consultants try to steer employers away  from stereotypes by dealing with individual functional limitations, such as  mobility, sight or hearing impairments, instead of a particular disability,  such as cerebral palsy.  </P> <P> "If you stand back and look at a job from a functional standpoint, many  activities within a job are often unnecessary," said Barbara Judy, a JAN  consultant. "Take work hours, for example. A flexible schedule for someone with  mobility problems will allow him to avoid rush hour. Or for a person who is  diabetic, allowing him to break a company rule of no food at the desk can  relieve him of a lot of anxiety. Or for someone who tires easily, maybe someone  who had polio or someone with multiple sclerosis, a flexible schedule to allow  for several short breaks makes a job much easier."  </P> <P> Despite fears to the contrary, Juanita Campbell of the President's committee  said: "It doesn't take a lot of time or money to make the work site accessible.  It might be a 5-cent pencil or cutting the legs off a desk to accommodate  someone in a wheelchair. And there are accommodations, like curb cuts, that  benefit us all."  </P> <P> JAN surveyed employers recently in order to dispel some of the myths and to  evaluate the costs of accommodating employees with disabilities. Of the  respondents, 31% said the changes cost nothing, 19% said the costs were $1 to  $50, and another 19% put the price tag at between $50 and $500.  </P> <P> For example, a JAN consultant helped a heavy construction company keep a  long-time driver who suffered a back injury. The consultant located a special  seat that absorbed almost all vehicle vibration and, for the price of a $1,000  seat, the company kept an experienced worker.  </P> <P> Computer technology has probably had more impact than anything else in opening  up career possibilities for those with disabilities.  </P> <P> "Personal computers are the great equalizer," said Alan Brightman, manager of  the innovative education program at Apple Computer in Cupertino. "A computer  doesn't have any preconceived expectations about you just because you have a  label attached. It allows us to approach someone with a disability as someone  who can, rather than someone who can't."  </P> <P> The options a computer offers are dramatic. For someone who is nonvocal, the  computer provides speech. For a blind person, the computer can print in  Braille. These people not only work more efficiently but do things previously  considered impossible.  </P> <P> While there are some federal protections for people with disabilities, they are  not of the scope as those for minorities and women. The Architectural Barriers  Act of 1968 was perhaps the first major step forward for those with  disabilities. It was followed by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which mandated  that federal contractors take affirmative action to hire and promote people  with disabilities. But federal contractors provide only 50% of the nation's  jobs, and there are no designated quotas or goals for hiring the disabled.  </P> <P> The Education of Handicapped Children Act of 1975, which was responsible for  helping thousands of children with disabilities to join the mainstream, may  have the most profound effect on future employment opportunities for people  with disabilities. The act opened the education process to children with  disabilities and, of equal importance to advocates, it exposed non-disabled  children to people who have physical differences and laid the groundwork for  future understanding.  </P></p>

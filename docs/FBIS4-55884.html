			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Verica Dukanac: "Fiscal Tricks"] </F>   [Text] Two-thirds of the budget expenditures will be  financed by revenues from the tax on personal incomes and sales  and excise taxes; to what extent is the impression of this  year's budget savings by the new government deceptive? What did  the deputies say about it?    In spite of the Assembly discussion for several days about  the draft law on Serbia's budget, this year's budget was also  adopted without much tension. The government's starting point in  setting the volume of public spending, which was publicly  explained by President Mirko Marjanovic, as well as his finance  minister, Mr. Dusan Vlatkovic, is that this sort of budget  projection actually makes a concrete contribution to  implementing the Program for Reconstruction of the Monetary  System. The argument is as follows: Since the consolidated  balance-sheet for public spending for this year in Yugoslavia  (i.e., the classic budget plus social insurance funds) provided  for Serbia's right to 6,664 million dinars, or 52 percent of the  social product, the government of Serbia, "acting frugally and  rationally," established the volume of public spending at 49.71  billion dinars (or 30 percent less than the permitted limit),  which reduced the share of its total public spending, according  to that calculation, to 42 percent of the social product.  <H5>  Government's Calculation </H5>   In fact, the total public revenues are projected to be 41.91  billion dinars, and public expenditures to be 49.71 billion,  with the imbalance in its fiscal books, 780 million, to be  covered by funds from the National Bank of Yugoslavia's reserves  and by issuing securities. The basic sources for financing the  republic budget (of 28.60 billion new dinars) are the tax on  personal incomes and the sales tax and excises. The revenues  from the tax on personal incomes constitute 33.3 percent of the  anticipated basic revenues (of a total of 22.37 billion dinars).  Actually, they were proceeding from an estimate that the average  wage this year would amount go 63.10 dinars and the guaranteed  wage, by which the tax base is reduced, 20 dinars. This also  took into account a reduction in the tax rate on wages from the  present 30 to 25 percent.    The revenues from the sales tax on products and services and  excise taxes are projected at 37.8 percent of total revenues.  Those sources, along with the republic's borrowing, 21.8  percent, constitute 90.9 percent of the basic revenues, so that  all the others represent a quite minor share in the structure of  revenues. Thus, for instance, revenues from corporate profit  taxes are expected to be only 20 million dinars, or 0.7 percent  of the total. Somewhat more revenues are expected from the tax  on independent activities (36.72 million, or 1.3 percent), while  16.50 million dinars, or 0.6 percent of total budget revenues,  is expected from the property tax.    According to the balance-sheet for the republic's budgetary  expenditures, 16 percent of the total of 28.60 billion dinars is  planned to be for the wages of employees of state bodies, 18.2  percent for encouraging development (1.9 percent or 55 million  for the fund for the lowest wages, and 1.8 percent or 55 million  dinars in funds for surplus employees), and 14.5 percent or  414.73 million dinars for other incentives in the economy. The  funds for exercising republic rights established by law  constitute 42.6 percent of the total budgetary expenditures,  primarily for education, science and technology, culture and  physical education (28.5 percent), as well as social protection  (3 percent), social care for children (7.9 percent), and  protection for disabled veterans (1.5 percent).    As many as 80 amendments were submitted in the Assembly for  this draft budget, of which the government submitted four and  Assembly committees submitted three, while the remaining 73 were  submitted by 25 deputies. The amendments mostly demanded a  different distribution of the money, but also additional funds.  The government complied by approving additional funds for the  work of the Vojvodina Autonomous Province, 3 million, and then 5  million each for the highway industry and the railroad, from the  budget reserves.  <H5>  Comments and Criticisms </H5>   If we ignore the favorable attitude of deputies from the  Socialist Party, which was expressed on this occasion as well  through truly numerous discussions (but not them alone, because  a majority was needed to adopt the budget), it remains for us to  note the points in the discussion that had quite reasonable  suspicions and comments about this proposal.    The first group of those comments should include, above all,  those pointing out the deceptive impression of frugality, which  can be reduced to saying that this had to do with a fiscal trick  and deception, as Mr. Milan Bozic said. It was explained in most  detail by Mrs. Jorgovanka Tabakovic: "It is claimed here that  the total volume of public expenditures is 49 billion, about 30  percent less than the amount projected in the consolidated  federal balance-sheet. These so-called savings, however, are  based on the share of the volume of public expenditures in the  social product, which is obviously overestimated." She said,  "You could have estimated the social product to be 20 billion,  and then the share of the volume of public expenditures would  have been only 25 percent. And that way no one has been  responsible for the plan and the estimate." At the same time,  she challenged the position of the government that borrowing  from the National Bank of Yugoslavia to cover the deficit would  not be inflationary, claiming that it really could have been  avoided if the republic had ensured additional real revenues  from which it would repay the loan. The law itself, however,  already says that the loans will be used under the conditions  established by the federal law, which, however, specifies that  loans to cover budget deficits will only start to be repaid in  December 1998. The same federal law also reschedules the  obligations coming due this year on that basis, namely the ones  from 1987 and 1988.    If the foundation of Avramovic's program is a strong dinar  and a revival of production, then this proposed budget does not  guarantee the achievement of those goals, through Mrs. Ljiljana  Lucic, primarily because the main source of revenue is the tax  on personal incomes, and so it is quite logical to expect that  the government will not be a serious obstacle to their growth,  which does not always have to be covered by production and  earned income--or else that means that the government, in fact,  does not believe in a revival of economic activity, because the  planned revenue from profits is minimal. In fact, she sees the  budget as a collection of requests submitted by various  ministries, and the government only rationalized them a little,  since one cannot see from the budget what its program is and  what its priorities are. Dr. Vladan Batic called attention to  the fact that the drafting of this budget, except for balancing  the budget, did not follow certain basic principles, such as the  principle of publicity, budget accuracy, or the principle of  budget integrity. He requested that the government not come back  in a month or two with a request to rebalance the budget,  especially if there was no inflation. He, and many others,  pointed out the amount of the funds planned for the police,  which were several times higher than the amount planned for the  judicial system. Zivorad Jeremic called attention to another  inconsistency. Specifically, Avramovic's program uses the figure  of close to a million people who, as a technological surplus,  should be the state's concern, but the budget mentions the  figure of 210,000, and specifies the amount of only 50 million  dinars for them.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Goode Committee recommendations A Pensions Compensation Scheme to cover fraud, misappropriation or theft, financed by a levy on all occupational schemes. Appointment of a Pensions Regulator and strengthened roles for the Pensions Ombudsman and Occupational Pensions Advisory Service. An employer should not be restricted from taking a contributions holiday, if the scheme meets a minimum solvency standard: assets of at least 90 per cent of what would be needed to meet liabilities. Employers wishing to extract cash from schemes should first obtain permission from the Pensions Regulator. Employers should be free to amend schemes to reduce or restrict benefits for future service, or to wind them up entirely, but they should not be able to restrict benefits earned before changes took effect. Scheme members should be entitled to appoint at least a third of all trustees, with a minimum of two per scheme. A new Occupational Pensions Schemes Act to codify reforms.</p>

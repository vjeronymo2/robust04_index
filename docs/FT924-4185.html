			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Company News: Tel Aviv urged to ride the raging bull - The Israeli government's attempt to divest itself of its bank stakes ON the face of it, the Israeli government's long, drawn-out effort to divest itself of its majority holdings in the country's four largest banks took an important step forward this week. The placing of the state's 42.5 per cent stake in IDB Holding, the rich industrial investment arm of Israel Discount Bank, on the Tel Aviv stock exchange (Tase) on Sunday was no less than 120 times oversubscribed, despite being the biggest issue the market had ever undertaken. If all the options involved are taken up, it will yield the government more than Dollars 350m. Officials at the Tase, well aware that a surging bull market this year is unlikely to carry on indefinitely, are urging the government to speed up privatising the banks and the state's big industrial holdings while demand remains strong. Mr Gil Leidner, managing director of MI Holdings, the government agency charged with selling off the state's stake in the banks, agreed the success of the IDB issue underlined the importance of moving ahead quickly with other bank share flotations. The government is committed to privatisation and says it is prepared to sell off big industrial companies such as Bezeq, the communications monopoly. But the government's complex involvement in the banking system remains fraught with difficulties and a swift resolution still seems unlikely. The IDB Holding issue was probably the most straightforward in the bank sale process. The company had been separated from Israel Discount Bank and majority control had already been sold back to the original owners, the Recanati family of Tel Aviv. It has proved much more difficult for the government to decide what to do about Israel Discount Bank itself and its two bigger rivals, Bank Hapoalim and Bank Leumi. Even the disposal of a controlling stake in Bank Mizrahi, the fourth-ranking bank, has apparently run into difficulties over the winning bidder's ability to gain approval from the banking authorities. The problem dates back to 1983 when the government was forced to acquire majority holdings in the four banks - at a cost of Dollars 7bn  - after an elaborate system run by the banks of ramping up their own shares collapsed. The government has never run the banks because a preferential share system left control and management in the hands of the original owners. However, under agreements reached with each of the controlling interests, all shares will have equal voting value after the state's holdings are sold off. The government has been grappling with the sale for at least five years without managing to dispose of one of the banks. Now a deadline is looming, adding pressure on it to deliver. Under the terms of the 1983 share buy-out, the banks will, in effect, fall under direct state control from October 1993 unless they have been disposed of by then. MI Holdings did reach agreement with Mr Gad Ze'evi, an Israeli businessman, in September to sell him a 51 per cent share of Bank Mizrahi (previously owned by the World Mizrahi religious organisation) for Dollars 185m. The balance of government-held shares in the bank would be sold on the Tase at a later date. But, so far, the Bank of Israel has not given its approval. It is understood one of the problems is the reluctance of the US Federal Reserve to approve the sale of Mizrahi's US subsidiary. This week, Mizrahi's board threatened to resign if the sale did not go through by the end of January. The Bank of Israel makes no secret of its unhappiness over the whole conduct of the bank sales. It originally wanted to break up Bank Hapoalim and Bank Leumi, which encompass a broad range of financial services from retail banking to fund management and insurance. Now it is pressing the government to form a committee, with Bank of Israel participation, to review the process. It is not convinced that the MI Holdings strategy of selling a controlling stake by private tender, followed by a share flotation, is the best way to proceed. In the case of Israel Discount Bank, for example, this is likely to lead to the bank reverting to the control of the Recanatis as they already hold 13 per cent of the bank through IDB Holding. Two of the Recanatis are on trial on criminal charges connected to the 1983 share scandal. Even Mr Leidner of MI Holdings admits the method of tendering a controlling shareholding as the first step will not work for Bank Hapoalim and Bank Leumi, respectively controlled by the Histadrut trade unions and the Jewish Colonial Trust, because of their size. Their combined assets of more than Shk150bn (Dollars 55.6bn) are more than twice the combined assets of Israeli Discount Bank and Mizrahi. Given creaky performance in recent years and lingering bad debt problems, the Bank of Israel reckons finding a group of investors able and willing to buy even a 10 per cent share would prove difficult. Mr Leidner is planning a test flotation on the Tase of a 10 per cent share in both Bank Hapoalim and Bank Leumi within three months. But it is becoming clear is that it is highly unlikely the process will be completed by the deadline of next October. This leaves the government with an additional headache of how to avoid the full nationalisation of the banks just when it is trying to privatise them.</p>

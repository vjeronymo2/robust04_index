			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / International Company News: Partial privatisation for Malaysian utility The electricity supply company in the East Malaysia state of Sarawak is to be partially privatised through a reverse takeover of Dunlop Estates (DEB), formerly a unit of the UK's Dunlop Malayan Estates. The Sarawak Electricity Supply Co (Sesco) is the sole provider of electricity in Sarawak, one of Malaysia's biggest and most resource-rich states. In one of the biggest deals undertaken in Malaysia, 45 per cent of Sesco, at present fully owned by the Sarawak state government, will be sold to DEB for some MDollars 750m (USDollars 294m). At the same time Sesco will acquire a 60 per cent stake in DEB for nearly MDollars 1.5bn. The deal forms part of a wide-ranging privatisation programme. Analysts say that by reversing into DEB, Sesco will gain access to stock market funds, enabling it to expand and participate in several big infrastructure projects planned in Sarawak. The most prominent of these is a proposed MDollars 30bn hydroelectric project along Sarawak's Rejang river, which will be capable of producing 2,500MW by the year 2005. Dunlop was acquired from Dunlop Malayan Estates by the Malaysian Multi-Purpose group of companies in 1981. Since DEB sold its plantations in 1990 its main focus has been on gaming operations - held through its controlling interest in Magnum Corporation, the operator of Malaysia's largest and most profitable lottery. In a corporate restructuring announced in November, DEB said it intended to sell its 52 per cent interest in Magnum to DEB's existing shareholders. The transaction will raise an estimated MDollars 1.04bn, part of which will be used to complete the Sesco deal. Analysts say that though the government in Sarawak will still control Sesco, DEB will be able to exercise considerable influence on the way the utility develops. DEB and the Multi-Purpose group are part of the business empire of Mr Lim Thian Kiat, who at 34 is often described as Malaysia's youngest tycoon. Multi-Purpose's activities include banking and other financial services, property development and a small shipping fleet.</p>

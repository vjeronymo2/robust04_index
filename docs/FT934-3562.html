			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: AB Engineering back in black after overseas lift Associated British Engineering turned in a pre-tax profit of Pounds 106,000 for the half year to September 30, against a Pounds 46,000 loss last time. The result was struck after an increase in pension fund contributions to Pounds 93,236, against Pounds 24,000 last time which reflected a surplus on the fund. All group businesses showed depressed conditions in the UK, but improved in overseas markets. Diesel power engineering turned round from Pounds 99,000 losses to Pounds 161,000 profits, but catering equipment losses rose to Pounds 223,000 (Pounds 49,000). Earnings were 0.02p (0.04p losses). The company is acquiring from the Leyland Daf receivers certain assets of a business specialising in the rebuilding and reconditioning of diesel engines.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oles Buzyna: ``Henceforth, Ukraine and Poland Are </F> Allies'']    [Text] The Ukrainian and Polish ministers of environmental  protection signed an agreement in Warsaw on cooperation in  controlling shipments of hazardous waste. Poland faced this  problem a couple of years before Ukraine. Its lengthy border  with Germany -- the world's largest manufacturer of these  ``products'' -- facilitated the immoral activities of companies  involved in selling toxic waste. However, the Polish side  adopted a strict law on shipping waste across the border.  According to Greenpeace Ukraine, this is one of the best laws  of its kind in the world.    Ukraine still has no legal footing for controlling this  sector. A resolution adopted by the Supreme Soviet in November  1993 was not implemented because the Council of Ministers has  been lingering in compiling the list of toxic substances. The  problem of German waste shipped to Rivne, Nikolayev, and Ochakov  has not been resolved, regardless of the investigation conducted  by competent organs and negotiations with Germany on returning  the waste ``to its native land.''    The treaty with Poland is important for Ukraine first of  all,  because it includes a clause on prevention of transit of  hazardous waste via the two states' territories. Thus, our  ecological border has moved farther to the west.</p>

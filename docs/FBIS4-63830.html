			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow May 24 TASS -- Cases of recruiting Russian  citizens for participation in combat operations in a number of  hot spots in the former Soviet Union have become more frequent,  Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoriy Karasin told a  briefing here today. Recruiters from the Caucasian republics  are particularly active in this business, he noted.    The Russian Foreign Ministry has lodged a vigorous protest  against illegal actions by persons recruiting mercenaries on the  Russian territory, Grigoriy Karasin stressed. The Russian  diplomat noted that "in accordance with international law,  recruiting, deploying, financing and training of mercenaries is  a grave crime. Such actions run counter to a friendly character  of relations among states and cannot be regarded otherwise than  doing them a serious damage. In accordance with international  commitments and the existing legislation the Russian side is  reserving the right to take all necessary measures to put an end  to such actions by the law enforcement bodies".    The Russian Foreign Ministry urged Russian citizens who have  already become or intend to become "soldiers of fortune" to  think better of it and give up such plans, and return to  peaceful life.    The Russian Foreign Office also appealed to all countries,  first of all to members of the Commonwealth of Independent  States, to take efficient measures to eliminate recruiting  activities, including recruiting Russian citizens as mercenaries.    "Taking into account the fact that the problem of  recruitment  goes beyond national borders and can be resolved only on the  basis of consolidation of efforts of all states, we are  expressing our readiness to hold consultations on practical  aspects of the struggle against this dangerous phenomenon both  within the framework of the Commonwealth and at a bilateral  level," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed out.</p>

They kept us for 68 hours in a cell deep  under the ground without electricity, in the middle of urine, on  a cement floor, without food and blankets. We have been beaten  with batons," said the socialist deputy Moikom Zeqo in a  statement made yesterday to Albanian TV.    The deputy Zeqo and the chairman of the Party of the  National  Unity, Mr. Idajet Beqiri, were arrested two days earlier in  Montenegro accused of illegal entry into the country. The  accused have denied the charge. After a staged trial in  Montenegro, the two Albanians were sentenced to twenty days in  prison, which was reduced to ten days upon appeal.    Mr. Zeqo has addressed a protest against the acts of  Montenegro police to the European Parliament, President Clinton,  and the People's Assembly of the Republic of Albania.</p>

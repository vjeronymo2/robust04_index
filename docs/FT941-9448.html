			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Performance pay goal ousts unions The goal of linking pay more closely to performance is the main reason given for de-recognising unions and switching to personal contracts, says a survey by Industrial Relations Services, the pay analysts. Of 98 companies which responded to the survey, 25 said they had abandoned collective bargaining in one or more areas of the company but only 10 had abandoned collective bargaining for all workers. Fifteen cited performance pay as the main motive for abandoning collective bargaining, 12 said collective bargaining was no longer relevant for the employees concerned, and 10 said there was already a low degree of union membership among the people involved. Asked to rate the success of de-recognition in terms of its impact on such things as employee commitment and productivity most said it had been 'fairly successful' a few 'very successful' and very few 'fairly unsuccessful'. De-recognised unions often kept some form of representative or consultative rights, especially over disciplinary and grievance procedures. Sixteen organisations claimed to have introduced personal contracts, but these appeared to vary little within individual organisations. The highest levels of sickness absence from work in spring 1993 were recorded in Yorkshire and Humberside, the latest Labour Force Survey says. Four per cent of men and 6.1 per cent of women were absent because of illness or injury for at least one day in the week during which the data was collected. In all regions - except East Anglia, which had the lowest rate of sick leave  -the levels of sickness absence for women were higher. Overall, 4.2 per cent of men were absent for at least one day in the week of the survey compared with 5.4 per cent of women.

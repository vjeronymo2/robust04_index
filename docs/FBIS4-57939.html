			<p>BFN     [Text] The new U.S. envoy in the Haitian crisis, William  Grey, began his mission with a visit to the Dominican Republic.  On 25 May, William Gray met with Dominican authorities,  including President Balaguer, regarding the possible closure of  the border. He was accompanied by Dante Caputo.    We have since learned that last night, President Balaguer  committed himself to completely closing the border with Haiti in  order to guarantee respect for the UN embargo against the  country.    The spokesman for Mr. William Gray, U.S. special envoy,  confirmed that President Balaguer committed himself to  completely closing the border out of respect for Resolution 917  of the UN Security Council, following a two-hour interview with  the head of the Dominican state.    Balaguer's government, which is opposed to the embargo, has  been accused by some North American sectors of allowing the  passage of goods, especially fuel, to Haiti. President Balaguer  made no comment following his meeting with President Bill  Clinton's special envoy.</p>

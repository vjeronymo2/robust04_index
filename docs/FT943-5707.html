			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Seeking a role for Apec The 17 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum have been long on visionary declarations about forging closer regional ties. They have been much shorter, however, on specific plans. This week, a panel of expert advisers sought to fill the vacuum with a blueprint for the long-term development of the organisation. Under the rubric of 'open regionalism', their report urges Apec leaders to commit themselves at their November summit in Jakarta to the total elimination of trade and investment barriers in the region by 2020. The aim, they stress, should not be to create an inward-looking trade bloc, but to use liberalisation within Apec to promote the advance of global free trade, in conformity with the principles of the Gatt. The authors of the report are to be commended both for their forthright rejection of the notion of a 'Fortress Apec' and for their drafting skills. In formulating their recommendations, they have had to bridge widely differing viewpoints among the organisation's members. While the US and Australia are keen that Apec should develop into an active trade negotiating forum, that idea is opposed by a number of Asian members, including Japan and Hong Kong. Against this background, the government-appointed experts' unanimous agreement on the report's recommendations is no mean feat. Richest economies Whether their proposed way forward is either politically feasible or economically desirable is, however, much more debatable. Impressive as the aggregate economic weight of Apec's members may be - accounting for half the world's trade and 60 per cent of its GNP - their diversity is more striking than their similarities. They include the US and Japan, the world's two richest economies, but also China and Indonesia, two of its poorest. The main distinguishing feature of economic relations within Apec is the dependence of most of its members on trade with the US, rather than with each other. This is not an obvious basis for regional trade liberalisation. It is made no easier by the fact that disputes between Apec members are also at the heart of almost every big confrontation in the international trade system, ranging from trade in services to anti-dumping, labour standards and the environment. It is unclear that Apec's members would be better able to settle these differences in regional negotiations when they have signally failed to do so in the Gatt. It is no less utopian to believe that the US will suddenly drop its aggressive trade stance towards countries such as Japan and China and agree to offer them trade concessions as part of Apec-wide liberalisation. Daunting hurdles But even if these daunting hurdles could be overcome, would an Apec liberalisation programme benefit the world economy, as the report's authors contend? Their argument rests heavily on the claim that freer regional trade provides powerful momentum at the global level. To the extent that disputes between Apec members are responsible for thwarting progress in the Gatt, they may have a point. Against that, the notion raises two objections. One is that any meaningful regional programme would require a huge commitment of government resources, and would therefore be likely to divert negotiating efforts away from the Gatt and its planned successor, the World Trade Organisation. The other objection is that any liberalisation programme designed primarily to satisfy Apec members could become an alternative to the Gatt. The consequences would be all the more serious if the programme aimed, as the report recommends, to tackle not only border obstacles but government procurement and competition policy. Other countries which sought reciprocal trade agreements with Apec might then have no choice but to accept rules dictated by the organisation. At present, that remains a remote possibility. It is one that many of Apec's members - as well as other countries - would also strongly resist. The experts' report offers Apec leaders an extremely ambitious agenda. Their sensible course in Jakarta may be to settle for more modest objectives.</p>

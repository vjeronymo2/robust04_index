			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Japanese companies wary of investing in east Germany JAPANESE companies, expected to play an important role in reconstructing Europe, have acquired a mere three businesses in east Germany through the Treuhand, the German privatisation agency - only one more acquisition than companies from India and the same number as Singaporean companies. The total is a disappointment for the Treuhand and an embarrassment for the Japanese government, which had suggested, at the fall of the Berlin Wall, that the country's current account surplus would be recycled in the reconstruction of the region. Having opened a Tokyo office two years ago in expectation of interest in the estimated 13,500 German companies on the block, the Treuhand has learned valuable lessons about Japanese corporate culture and the receding Japanese enthusiasm for Europe. The Japanese total of three acquisitions, two in the glass industry and one in car servicing, compares with the 78 east German factories acquired by UK companies and the 54 bought by US companies. 'It's quite amazing, isn't it?' lamented Mr Dietrich von Stackelberg, head of the Treuhand's east Asian operations. 'The timing was wrong. With the collapse of Japan's economic bubble, we have seen an increasing reluctance to invest in Europe. Their operations are contracting.' Facing criticism over Japan's huge current account surplus, the government had argued that investment in the reconstruction of Europe would recycle the surplus, which has more than trebled over the past two years. In the same period, new Japanese direct investment in Germany has fallen 38 per cent. Mr Nobuyuki Nagashima, assistant director for Europe at the Japan External Trade Organisation, said unification coincided with the slowing of Japan's economy, while companies were unfamiliar with east German companies and reluctant to risk funds. Mr von Stackelberg suggested that the agency's experience highlighted an important difference in corporate culture between the US and Japan, where controversial, friction creating decisions, such as staff cuts, are very slow to be made. 'The companies were basically restructuring cases, and we have found that Japanese companies are reluctant to get involved in this sort of operation,' Mr von Stackelberg said.

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DEFENDER  </P> <P> It is with an extreme sense of ironic incredulity that I view Abramson. She  makes the statement about being "bathed in the backwash of the Holocaust," yet  she defends those whose crimes are no less heinous than the vile, Nazi thugs  she deplores. One wonders if she would have been so charitable at Nuremburg.  </P> <P> MATTHEW L. DADAY  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Denby Pounds 40m placing on table Denby Group, the pottery company famous for its informal tableware, is being reborn as a quoted company with the promise to investors of a 52 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.1m for 1994. The company published the profits forecast and first half results to March 31 in the pathfinder prospectus sent to shareholders yesterday. Denby recorded pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.03m for the first six months on sales 32 per cent higher at Pounds 11.4m. Denby, which was rescued from the receivers of Coloroll - which bought Denby in 1987 - via a management buy-out in July 1990, is coming to the market through a placing and public offer this month with a value of more than Pounds 40m. The company is due to publish the flotation share price on May 19 and dealings will begin on June 2. Denby intends to use the Pounds 10m in proceeds which it will retain to pay net debt of Pounds 7m and fund capital expenditure estimated at roughly Pounds 4m a year. Mr Stephen Riley, managing director, said Denby had enjoyed better margins in the first half. The higher-priced new designs were selling more rapidly than the less expensive, but older, products. Denby had also shown significant progress in boosting exports, an area on which it aims to focus post-flotation. Sales abroad represented some 20 per cent of turnover in the first half, compared with 13 per cent. Mr Riley said Denby now operated out of 10 department stores across the US, including Macy's, the worlds biggest department store. Mr Riley said there was substantial room to increase Denby's share of the export market, given the performance of other tableware manufacturers which sold between 50 and 60 per cent of their products abroad.</p>

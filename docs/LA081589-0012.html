			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MORRIS LOOKS GOOD BUT LOSES IN 10 INNINGS, 4-1  </P> <P> It has been a tough season for right-hander Jack Morris of the Detroit Tigers.  </P> <P> After averaging more than 17 victories a season for the last decade, Morris has  suffered both injury and embarrassment this season.  </P> <P> For the first time, he has had a serious injury, an elbow problem that put him  on the disabled list. When he has been healthy, he has often been roughed up by  opposing hitters. Monday night at Detroit, Morris held the Baltimore Orioles to  three hits in nine innings. But all it got him was a 1-1 tie.  </P> <P> In the 10th inning Craig Worthington, who was 12 when Morris broke in with the  Tigers, hit a three-run home run and Morris became a 4-1 loser. Morris, who  dropped to 2-10, has not had a losing season since he became a regular starter.  </P> <P> "Morris was just outstanding," Manager Frank Robinson of the Orioles said. "He  took us to school."  </P> <P> Detroit Manager Sparky Anderson said: "Jack threw the ball awfully well. When  you lose pitching that well there's nothing you can say."  </P> <P> Morris, twice a 20-game winner, has always given up a lot of home runs. In the  fourth inning, Stan Jefferson, a .138 hitter, drove a pitch by Morris against  the facing on the second deck in right for his second home run.  </P> <P> Larry Sheets hit a single in the 10th and, with two out, Joe Orsulak drew  Morris' second walk. Worthington hit one into the second deck in right for his  12th home run. He has hit four homers in the last 11 games and his 60 runs  batted in lead all major league rookies.  </P> <P> Since returning from two months on the disabled list, Morris is 0-3 and has  yielded 17 runs in 40 innings.  </P> <P> The Orioles' eighth victory in their 10th extra-inning game enabled them to  remain 2 1/2 games in front in the East.  </P> <P> Toronto 4, Boston 2 -- The Blue Jays play better at Fenway Park than they do in  their own SkyDome.  </P> <P> With rookie Mauro Gozzo winning his second consecutive major league start and  Rance Mulliniks hitting his second home run of the season, the Blue Jays won  their 13th in a row at Fenway.  </P> <P> Gozzo, who shut out Texas for eight innings in his debut last week, went five  innings. He gave up seven hits, but only one of the two runs were earned. David  Wells and Tom Henke held the Red Sox to one hit in the last four innings.  </P> <P> Wade Boggs, coming out of a slump, went three for four nd scored both Boston  runs. He was three for 20 in the weekend series at Baltimore.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 5, New York 4 -- If the Yankees fail to win the East, they might look  back and say this game at Milwaukee is a big reason why.  </P> <P> They went into the bottom of the ninth with bullpen ace Dave Righetti holding a  two-run lead.  </P> <P> They wound up losing when Gus Polidor, a .194 hitter, drove in the winning run  with a two-out single. Glenn Braggs opened the ninth with a double and a long  fly and an infield out brought him home.  </P> <P> Righetti then walked Joey Meyer, and B.J. Surhoff doubled in the tying run.  After an intentional walk to Mike Felder, Polidor grounded a hit just inside  the third-base bag.  </P> <P> The Brewers remained 2 1/2 games out of first, but the sixth-place Yankees are  6 1/2 back.  </P> <P> Chicago 4, Kansas City 3 -- Dan Pasqua hit a 420-foot home run and Lance  Johnson later singled home the eventual winning run in the sixth inning at  Chicago.  </P> <P> Pasqua's home run off Luis Aquino (6-7) tied the score, 3-3. A single by Carlos  Martinez and a bunt set the stage for Johnson to get the decisive hit.  </P> <P> It was the 50th anniversary of the first night game played at Comiskey Park.  The White Sox also won that one, beating the St. Louis Browns. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

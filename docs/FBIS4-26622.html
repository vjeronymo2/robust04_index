			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, June (XINHUA) -- Esso, the largest oil  company in the United States, opened a subsidiary here yesterday  to direct its oil exploration in the East China Sea.    The subsidiary, Esso China Ltd., will begin to gather  seismic  data in a contract sea block on June 26.    Esso and 14 big foreign oil companies, including Texaco,  Chevron, Shell and Phillips-Arco, are now searching for oil and  gas over a 64,246 square kilometer continental basin area in the  sea.    In May 1992, the Chinese Government decided to open part of  the offshore area in the East China Sea to foreign oil companies.    On June 30, 1992, the China National Offshore Oil  Corporation  opened bids for Sino-foreign joint development of oil in that  area.    Esso and 14 foreign oil companies beat fierce competition to  win bids to search for and produce oil and gas in 18 blocks in  the sea, in cooperation with the Chinese corporation.    Li May Phipps and Kevin Biddle, both vice-presidents of Esso  China Ltd., said that they were delighted at Esso's success in  winning a contract block.    The 2,120 sq km block is about 200 km north-east of Wenzhou,  a port in Zhejiang Province.    Biddle said: "We are fully confident of our success in  exploring oil in the East China Sea."    Since oil exploration in the East China Sea began in the  early 1970s, an oilfield and nine oil-bearing structures have  been discovered and 27 oil exploratory wells drilled there.    After seismic exploration is completed and relevant data  processed, Esso China Ltd. will choose the best well location to  drill an exploratory well, he said.    Drilling is expected to begin next year, he added.    Founded in 1882, Esso is currently searching for oil and gas  in more than 80 countries. It spent 8.2 billion U.S. dollars in  investment and exploration in 1993.    Esso opened a representative office in Beijing 13 years ago  as part of its effort to participate in developing energy  resources in China.    Biddle said that over the past ten years and more, his  parent  company had spent 200 million U.S. dollars in the search for  offshore oil and gas resources in China.    To date, Esso has drilled 17 wells in two blocks in the  South  China Sea, striking both oil and gas there, he said.    Moreover, together with Chinese partners, Esso is also  searching for oil in the Tarim basin in northwest China's  Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, he added.    He said he thought that oil and gas resources in northwest  China are probably even more promising than those in the Daqing  oilfield in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province and in the  Shengli oilfield in east China's Shandong Province.    Esso's cooperation with China is based on long-term  interests, he said, adding that Esso will try to expand its  cooperation with Chinese partners in accordance with the  principles of equality and mutual benefit.    Esso is also willing to invest in energy projects in China,  such as oil projects, coal projects and power projects, he added.</p>

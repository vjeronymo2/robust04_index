			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Yelagin, under the "The Military" </F> rubric: "The Baltics Are Looking for Allies"]    [Text] Vyacheslav Ivanovich Yelagin was born in 1946.  He graduated from the Moscow State University Foreign Relations  Institute. He is the supervisor of a section of the department  of the MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] of Russia.    The breakup of the system of bloc confrontation in Europe  opened up the most favorable prospects before the Baltic  republics for the conduct of a balanced policy in the sphere of  military-political cooperation. The Baltic countries intend to  cooperate closely with one another on this question, which, of  course, is not at all unnatural. Just in recent months, a  number of practical steps were taken for this purpose. A meeting  of the ministers of defense occurred in September, and in  November there was a conference of senior army ranks. One  principal question was discussed: the elaboration of a unified  defense policy of the Baltic states. Recommendations were also  put forward for united efforts in a number of spheres of  military construction. In particular, the parties came to an  agreement on the unification of armaments systems and on the  operational exchange of information of a defense nature. A  coincidence of viewpoints was displayed regarding the  possibility of the participation of the Baltic states in  peacekeeping actions. The creation of a combined Baltic  battalion of 650 bayonets is being proposed for this purpose.    Special attention is being given in military-political  circles of the Baltic countries to their integration into  Western security structures. Thus, one of the recent  announcements of the ruling Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania  notes that "close cooperation with NATO, NACC [North Atlantic  Cooperation Council], WEU [Western European Union], and other  organizations is consistent with Lithuania's national  interests." And Lithuania intends to cooperate closely with  Latvia and Estonia on this question.    The concept of the national security of the country was  discussed at a conference of party leaders of the Estonian  parliament. The political leaders came out for cooperation with  the international defense structures of the West and the  creation of regional security structures. The thesis of "total  defense" was put forward at the conference, and the principle of  abandonment of neutrality. A proposal was also heard to arm the  citizens of the republic and to strengthen border security owing  to the "Estoniazation" of the border area population.    The Baltics do not conceal the fact that what they would  like  to do most of all is to take the path of arranging close  military ties with NATO in order to strengthen the security of  their states in the face of foreign danger. They are calling on  the North Atlantic bloc to give security guarantees, to conclude  agreements on dispatching reinforcements in the event that  crisis situations arise, to assist in the development of  mobilization plans, training of command personnel, organization  of the border service, and modernization of infrastructure  facilities transferred by Russian military units, and to supply  military equipment.    Active discussions are going on about the "Partnership for  Peace" plan, with the aim of extracting from it the maximum  possible strengthening of relations with the West. Lithuanian  President Algirdas Brazauskas declared that Lithuania intends to  strive for the signing of a treaty or an agreement with NATO on  partnership and cooperation. Lithuania, in the words of the  president, supports NATO efforts to extend the security zone to  all the states of Europe who want this.    And nevertheless, the choice of the Baltics in the direction  of unilateral cooperation with NATO puts one on guard. Forces  that are in opposition to the governments of the Baltic states  are especially active in this respect. For example, the  "Fatherland Union"--a new party of an extreme right orientation  established on the basis of the Sajudis movement and headed by  Vytautas Landsbergis--is persistently striving for Lithuania's  acceptance into NATO. And this despite the fact that the  question of NATO membership was completely removed from the  agenda at the meeting of the NACC in Brussels.    In turn, NATO headquarters in Brussels are prepared to give  the Baltic republics as much help as possible in the formation  of national armed forces, on condition that they are of an  exclusively defensive nature and are not directed at changing  the existing balance of forces in this region. What is more, at  the "Future Security" conference held in Vilnius, General John  Waters, the deputy commander in chief of NATO's combined armed  forces in Europe, directed attention to the fact that the "slide  of some states to positions of nationalism and militarism" is  causing increasing concern among NATO's leaders. There are also  no intentions in NATO under any circumstances, judging by  statements of its representatives, to occupy military facilities  abandoned by Russian troops. The maximum that the Baltics can  expect, as Manfred Werner, the general secretary of the North  Atlantic Alliance, gave Minister of National Defense Linas  Linkevicius to believe, is NATO assistance in military  construction; for example, in identifying defense systems and in  teaching English to compulsory service soldiers and officers in  training. However, the parameters of military relations of  individual NATO countries with Baltic states, it appears, are  beginning to go beyond the outlined scope of late.    Realizing that the possibilities for full membership in NATO  now are unlikely, the Baltic countries are developing variants  of establishing certain bloc formations as a counterweight to  Russia. The thesis about the need for rapprochement with some  neighboring states to the detriment of Russia's interests is  receiving wider and wider circulation. Baltic politicians are  repeating publicly that their countries will never be "under the  Russian collective security umbrella." And friendly relations  with Russia are seen in Vilnius, Riga, and Tallinn primarily in  mutually profitable economic cooperation, without which it will  evidently be difficult to live.    But the very same Landsbergis publicly accuses Moscow of "an  imperial policy," claiming that Russia, he says, will recreate  "a post-Soviet Euroasiatic union," and that in its relations  with neighboring states it will conduct an official policy of  "reintegration," accompanied by bloodshed in Moldova, in the  Caucasus, and in Central Asia.    The arrangement of the heads of the governments of Russia  and  Lithuania concerning the preparation of an agreement on  questions of military transit to Kaliningrad Oblast became the  subject of sharp attacks on the part of the Lithuanian  opposition. The basic argument, they say, is that the foreign  policy of Lithuania is made secretly, behind the back of the  Seimas. But the press organ of the opposition--LIETUVOS  AIDAS--came to the direct stunning conclusion that "the military  transit of Russia over Lithuanian territory is impermissible and  equivalent to an escalation of aggression." But even this did  not seem to be enough. The newspaper proposes to transform  Kaliningrad Oblast into a kind of a subject of international  trade between Russia, Lithuania, and Germany. Meanwhile, it is  well known that no kind of military equipment is being  transported through Lithuanian territory to Kaliningrad. Mainly  building materials and foodstuffs are being transported there.  To the credit of official Vilnius, it calls the future agreement  on military transit "a vital necessity," recognizing the right  of Russia to defend this territory.    Anti-Russian actions of this kind will hardly promote a  strengthening of the international prestige of the Baltic  countries. This thought was distinctly expressed during his  visit to Lithuania by FRG President Richard von Weizsacker, who  emphasized that peace and prosperity in the region of the Baltic  Sea are possible only in the neighborhood of a peaceful and  flourishing Russia. Current and future politicians of the Baltic  states evidently should not forget these prophetic words.    The military doctrine of the Russian Federation was given a  hostile reception in the Baltics. They see in it a threat to  their national security interests and the aspirations of Russia  to return to itself the status of a superpower and to resolve  interstate relations from a position of strength. It seems that  here the Baltic leaders are forgetting one simple truth: Our  doctrine has a strictly defensive character. It provides for the  use of force only in response to open aggression from outside,  and also in the conduct of peacekeeping operations in areas of  conflict in order to stop bloodshed. The Russian Armed Forces  are called upon to guarantee the stability of the Russian state.  Therefore, they do not constitute any kind of threat to the  national security of the Baltic states. To think otherwise means  to engage in wishful thinking.  <H6>  * * * * </H6>   The results of the parliamentary elections were met in  Vilnius, Riga, and Tallinn with noticeable alarm. This kind of  anxiety is quite understandable. The success of the  nationalistic forces in Russia has put the world community on  guard. But the Baltics, it seems, are pursuing their own  egotistical interests. In contrast to other countries, the  anti-Russian notes have gotten even stronger here against this  background. Politicians of all ranks have again begun to speak  about the "Great Russian chauvinism and aggressive revanchism,"  which, they say, threatens the security of the Baltics. Some of  them have reached the point of calling on the West to take  extraordinary measures to isolate Russia. Demands can also be  heard to attract to their side states of the CIS to counteract  Russia, in particular Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. Prime  Minister of Estonia Mart Laar came out for the urgent  integration of the Baltic countries into the European Union and  NATO. All possible predictions are being made on the question of  the withdrawal of Russian troops and the maintenance of the  still remaining military facilities.    The impression is being created that the recent events in  Russia are being used by these politicians for the justification  of the tough line they are conducting both with respect to  Russia and the Russian-speaking population that resides in the  Baltic states. The elections that were held, as has already been  announced in Moscow, will not have an influence on the foreign  policy of Russia toward the Baltics, for in its essence it will  remain that of the president.</p>

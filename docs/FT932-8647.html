			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Observer: Liquid assets Surely something wrong with the City of London's sense of values? Of the 293 Square Mile banking jobs listed by Day Associates' latest pay survey, only three carry average salaries of less than Pounds 10,000 whereas 13 are above the Pounds 100,000 mark. There's no prize for guessing that the best rewarded is the big branch general manager, averaging Pounds 161,506 in salary which is typically boosted by bonuses to Pounds 192,518. But who, apart from newly recruited school leavers, d'you suppose is at the other end of the scale? The tea lady with an average salary of Pounds 9,450 plus a measly bonus of Pounds 160.65. That rates a general manager as worth more than 20 tea ladies whereas, measured by their respective effects on staff morale, the ratio is more probably the other way round.</p>

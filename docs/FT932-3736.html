			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Isosceles debt talks came close to failure THE CONCLUSION of the Pounds 1.4bn refinancing of Isosceles, the parent of the Gateway supermarket group, came close to failure, bankers involved in the deal said yesterday, when one party to the transaction refused to sign for more than 24 hours after the others had. Signing began on Tuesday morning and all parties had been signed up by late that afternoon except for the outstanding party, which is understood not to have been a senior lender to the group. That party signed on Wednesday evening, just meeting deadlines allowing Isosceles' banks, led by Midland Bank, and Isosceles' advisers Hill Samuel, to go through procedures necessary before the standstill agreement with banks expired. The restructuring, Isosceles' third since it completed a Pounds 2bn leveraged buy-out of the Gateway group in 1989, was its last chance to avoid receivership. One banker said yesterday that 'if the deal hadn't been signed on Wednesday night the shops would have been closed by now, and 40,000 jobs gone.' About 30 banks were involved in the deal which has been negotiated since the standstill agreement was signed just before Christmas. It will now be approved at a special meeting on July 2, where more than 90 per cent of shareholders have undertaken to vote in favour. While the deal was not as complex as other restructurings of the same size, it was completed relatively rapidly and the fees involved are expected to be about Pounds 15m. It had its fair share of dramas, though, with the Bank of England becoming involved when three French banks demanded preferential treatment. Under the deal Gateway is ring fenced from Isosceles and has taken on Pounds 500m of debt, a level of borrowings which Gateway should be able to service while also spending about Pounds 100m a year on capital investment. Isosceles' assets were transferred to the new Gateway company at a value of Pounds 525m. With operating profits for the year to end-April expected to total Pounds 100m Gateway can clearly pay an interest charge which would be about Pounds 37.5m annually. Gateway has no repayments to make for three years. At that point options will be reviewed again and there could be a sale of the business either in whole or in part to repay debt. Isosceles is keeping the rest of the debt, totalling Pounds 949m. That will have to be serviced from any surplus cash passed up to Isosceles from Gateway. Its assets, apart from its shareholding in Gateway, are minor and include a golf course in Hertfordshire. Of the Isosceles debt Pounds 256m is senior debt, and bankers involved feel there is a good chance that this can be serviced. However, there are doubts that the rest of the Isosceles debt, including a Pounds 400m zero coupon bond due to mature in 10 years, and certainly the ordinary shares, will ever have any economic value. Even so, some shareholders, notably Wasserstein Perella, the New York investment house, and the Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, the US food retailer, have agreed to swap for a share in a 10-year option to buy ordinary shares equivalent to 25 per cent of the company for Pounds 12.5m. This was said to be a face-saving formula, devised for example to allow WP to ascribe a value to its Isosceles stake held in an investment fund.</p>

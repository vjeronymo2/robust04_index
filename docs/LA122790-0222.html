			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> AIKMAN HOPES TO AVOID SURGERY  </P> <P> Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman says don't write him off just yet.  </P> <P> His separated right shoulder feels much better, and he wants a second opinion  about surgery.  </P> <P> Coach Jimmy Johnson, however, still expects to place Aikman on injured reserve  Friday.  </P> <P> Aikman, who was hurt in Sunday's loss at Philadelphia, put off a decision  Wednesday regarding surgery because he said the pain and swelling in the  shoulder had subsided and its mobility had increased. Aikman wants to get more  medical opinions and be certain there are not other alternatives before  agreeing to surgery.  </P></p>

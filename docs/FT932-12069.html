			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Ciampi changes the rules of the game: Italy's 52nd post-war government marks the switch to a new kind of politics ITALY'S new prime minister, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, has proved age is no barrier to innovation. The 72-year-old former governor of the Bank of Italy has ventured on to ground where no government has dared tread since 1947. He has persuaded three members of Party of the Democratic Left, the heirs of the once-feared Communist party, to enter the cabinet. This puts a formal end to the cold war divisions that have conditioned Italian politics for four decades. The era of Christian Democrat-controlled coalition governments and a communist-dominated opposition is over and this, the 52nd post-war government, is a transition towards a different political environment determined by fresh electoral laws and new alliances. Appropriately, one of the PDS cabinet members, Mr Luigi Berlinguer, the science minister, is a cousin of Mr Enrico Berlinguer, the communist leader who championed the idea of the historic compromise - a government of Christian Democrats and communists. The PDS has entered the cabinet only after months of agonised internal debate. Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS leader, has brought his party round by pointing out that Mr Ciampi is a non-partisan figure heading a government of limited duration, untainted by corruption and containing 11 first-time ministers. The three members were chosen by Mr Ciampi not by the party. Even with some PDS dissidence, the government's majority in parliament should go well beyond the slim 16-seat margin of Mr Giuliano Amato's four-party coalition. These parties remain represented in the cabinet but now, in addition to the PDS, Mr Ciampi can count on the Republicans and the Greens, who have the environment portfolio. The government can probably rely on the support of Mr Mario Segni, the leader of the referendum movement. Although he declined to join the government, Mr Augusto Barbera, the PDS minister in the new portfolio of parliamentary affairs, was a key figure in the referendum movement, which last week triumphed with an overwhelming vote for electoral reform. Five parties and groupings are absent from what is otherwise a government of national unity, mixing politicians with technocrats. These are the populist Lombard League, the neo-fascist MSI, the Radicals, the hardline communists, Reconstructed Communism, and The Network (La Rete), the Sicily-based clean government movement. Between them they account for just over 20 per cent of the seats in the Chamber of Deputies. Despite much talk of Mr Ciampi having established a precedent by choosing his cabinet over the heads of the party bosses, the Christian Democrats had a considerably say. Eight of the 24 are Christian Democrat politicians or allied to the party, and they still hold the key interior ministry, retaining the outgoing minister, Mr Nicola Mancino. In contrast the Socialists, heavily bruised by corruption scandals, have a diminished presence with only three members as ministers and one big portfolio - defence, held by Mr Fabio Fabbri. Mr Amato, the outgoing Socialist premier, declined to take the foreign affairs portfolio having announced last month he wished to step out of the political spotlight. The job has gone to Mr Beniamino Andreatta, the most distinguished economist in the Christian Democrat camp and a forceful figure, much needed in a ministry demoralised by scandal over the misuse of foreign aid funds and the patronage politics of former Socialist minister Gianni de Michelis. Besides balancing political sensibilities, Mr Ciampi's choice of ministers reflects the two main priorities of his administration - electoral reform and economic management. Electoral reform will be handled at the parliamentary level by Mr Barbera, and at the legislative level by Mr Leopoldo Elia, the former Christian Democrat head of the constitutional court. Economic management will enjoy the continuity of Mr Piero Barucci. He will be joined at the budget ministry by Prof Lugi Spaventa, a fellow of All Soul's Oxford who knows Mr Ciampi well and who since last year has been chief adviser at the treasury. At the finance ministry, the fifth minister in a year, is Mr Vincenzo Visco, the PDS shadow economy minister and a fiscal expert trained at Berkeley and York University. Their job will be to prepare immediately a mini-budget to balance the L15,000bn (Pounds 6.3bn) overshoot in 1993 spending. Another prong to economic policy will be to speed up privatisation, working in tandem with Mr Ciampi's former Bank of Italy colleague, Mr Paolo Savona, in the industry portfolio. Mr Savona, who has also been a director general of Confindustria, the industrialists association, is a firm proponent of privatisation. Although one of the referendums approved the abolition of the ministry of agriculture, Mr Alfredo Diana, the outgoing minister, has been retained. This underlines the impossibility of abolishing the ministry without some structural replacement.</p>

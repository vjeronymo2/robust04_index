			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Maxwell plans bankruptcy book MR KEVIN MAXWELL, who last month became Britain's biggest ever bankrupt, is planning to write a book on the difficulties of those facing personal bankruptcy. Mr Maxwell plans to co-author the book with a journalist. He said he had had expressions of interest from a number of publishers. The book would aim to help people survive the trauma of bankruptcy, and there would be only one chapter on his own experiences - what it has been like to be Britain's biggest bankrupt with debts of more than Pounds 400m. The book is partly a response to hundreds of letters that Mr Maxwell - who also faces criminal charges of theft and conspiracy to defraud - has received from bankrupts. Many were letters from people who said they were on the verge of suicide because of their experiences. A proportion of any money earned by the book will go to the creditors of the Maxwell empire - including the denuded Maxwell pension funds. Mr Maxwell has also decided to stop claiming unemployment pay from next week and try to set up work as a consultant. He recently attracted considerable publicity when he tried to sign on for unemployment - and went to the wrong place. One piece of consultancy work has already come his way and he will in future seek work in areas of the media and publishing and in restructuring companies - but he will not be involved in anything to do with financial ser-vices. Mr Maxwell believes consultancy is likely to be the only kind of employment he will be able to find until the charges against him come to court, which may not happen until 1995. He has abandoned as unrealistic attempts during the summer to raise Dollars 10m (Pounds 5.9m) to launch an international media venture partnership. Mr Maxwell is expected to appear in the High Court today seeking a judicial review on the duties and responsibilities of the Serious Fraud Office, which has been investigating the affairs of the collapsed Maxwell empire.</p>

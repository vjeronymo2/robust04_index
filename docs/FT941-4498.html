			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Bophuthatswana paralysed by poll strike Riot police fired at demonstrators in the South African black 'homeland' of Bophuthatswana for the second day running yesterday as a civil service strike paralysed the government of the increasingly embattled President Lucas Mangope. At least 32 people were wounded, witnesses said. The homeland government said a police officer was killed. Mr Mangope, who yesterday closed the broadcasting service and sacked its staff, rejected a request from the Independent Electoral Commission to allow campaigning and polling for South Africa's April elections to take place in the homeland. Bophuthatswana said earlier this week it would not participate in these elections. As teargas drifted toward the government offices from the nearby University of Bophuthatswana, Mr Ephraim Keikalame, finance minister, admitted: 'It is not possible to have an effective functioning government under these circumstances.' Almost the entire public service appeared to be on strike, but telephones and electricity continued to function. The capital's main hospital complex was deserted by staff. Outside the university, police armoured vehicles roared up and down throughout the day, firing teargas canisters and rubber bullets at students barricading the entrance gate. 'This is the kick of a dying horse,' said one student, weeping from the effects of the gas, while another vowed: 'We want to make Bop ungovernable.' Using rubbish bin lids as shields and brandishing sticks as spears, students did the toyi-toyi dance, the hallmark of the African National Congress, as they demanded that nominally independent Bophuthatswana, a creation of apartheid, be reincorporated into South Africa. The rioting provoked a threat of direct South African intervention, with the Transitional Executive Council, the multi-party body overseeing government in the run-up to elections, saying it would give Mr Mangope a week 'to change his attitude'. Meanwhile there was uncertainty last night over whether various rightwing South African parties would contest the April elections. Parties were due to lodge candidate lists by yesterday afternoon, but many - including the mainly-Zulu Inkatha Freedom party and the right wing Freedom Front - failed to do so.</p>

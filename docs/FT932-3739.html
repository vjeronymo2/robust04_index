			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / UK Company News: English China Clays calls for Pounds 113m - Second rights in 16 months will help fund Dollars 308m acquisition of Calgon ENGLISH CHINA Clays, the world's biggest producer of china clay, yesterday announced a Pounds 113.4m rights issue, a Dollars 307.5m (Pounds 202m) US acquisition and plans to hive off its building materials business into a separate company. The announcements mark a further stage in the reorganisation of the company which had previously announced it was pulling out of UK housebuilding. ECC is acquiring Calgon, the US speciality chemicals business, from Merck the US drugs group. To help pay for the deal ECC has proposed a 1-for-8 rights issue at 350p a share to raise Pounds 113.4m. The rest of the cash is to be provided from increased borrowings. According to Mr Andrew Teare, chief executive, this will raise the company's gearing from 24 per cent to 39 per cent. In addition, the company announced plans to demerge its UK and US quarry operations into a separate company. This was not expected to take place until next year. Mr Teare said the group wanted to concentrate its efforts on developing higher margin speciality chemicals alongside its mainstream business of supplying china clay, used mainly for coating and fillers by the paper industry. It is the second rights issue to be launched by the group in 16 months - in February last year it raised Pounds 209m to pay for the early redemption of Dollars 350m of of US auction market preferred shares (Amps). The company also announced yesterday that it planned to redeem its remaining Dollars 50m of preference shares. ECC's share price, despite the second cash call on shareholders, rose 9p to 425p. Calgon, which produces water-soluble polymers and biocides mainly for water treatment made unaudited operating profits of Dollars 24.1m on sales of Dollars 225.1m in 1992. Just over 85 per cent of ECC's profits of Pounds 105.6m (Pounds 95.5m) last year were generated by by its china clay operations. Operating profits from building materials, however, slipped from Pounds 24.6m Pounds 15.5m. Brokers to the rights issue, which has been underwritten by Schroders, are SG Warburg and de Zoete &amp; Bevan. The company yesterday renewed its pledge to at least maintain its 1993 dividend at 20p.</p>

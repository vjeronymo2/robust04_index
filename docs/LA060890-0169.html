			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> MANDELA WEARY, SAYS HE MIGHT HAVE TO CURTAIL HEAVY SCHEDULE  </P> <P> South African black nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela, whose grueling world  tour is giving rise to concern for his health, said today he is fine but that  he might have to cut his schedule.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day Mandela, who is set to visit the United States June 20,  abruptly canceled an appointment with officials of the International Committee  of the Red Cross for an unscheduled rest in his hotel room.  </P> <P> "I don't know how I look but I feel good," the 71-year-old activist told  reporters as he arrived at the headquarters of the World Council of Churches  later to thank its members for their militant anti-apartheid stand.  </P> <P> But he admitted he might have to cut down on his heavy schedule, which is to  cover 13 countries in six weeks.  </P> <P> "That is likely, quite possible, but it is different from saying I have done so  because I am ill," he said.  </P> <P> Mandela had surgery of an unspecified nature only last week.  </P></p>

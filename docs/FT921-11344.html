			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK market tighter THE UK money market faced a substantial liquidity shortage yesterday following easier conditions earlier this week, writes Simon London. The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 950m early in the session, revised up to Pounds 1.1m later. The main factor was maturing treasury bills and assistance, draining Pounds 758m from the market. Exchequer transactions resulted in a small net addition of funds, underlining that the tax payments which drained funds earlier in the month have now subsided. Faced with a larger shortage than in recent days, market participants moved early for funding and the Bank of England was able to inject Pounds 668m in early assistance. This was mostly made up of Pounds 650m paper purchased for resale to the market on February 12 and 13 at 10 7/16 per cent. This added to the Pounds 1.2bn paper already due for repurchase on these dates, storing up the potential for tight market conditions around the middle of next month. Afternoon assistance comprised the purchase of Pounds 40m band 1 and band 2 bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Late assistance was Pounds 210m, bringing the total liquidity injection for the day to Pounds 918m, around Pounds 200m less than the forecast shortage. The unsecured overnight money rate was steady at below 11 per cent for most of the day, climbing slightly above this level in the early afternoon before settling back to close at 10- 9/16 per cent. Longer rates were little changed. Three months interbank funds traded at 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent, just up on the 10 5/8 - 1/2 per cent seen on Wednesday; one month interbank money was 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent. The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange closed down on the day at 89.73, implying base lending rates of 10.27 per cent by the spring. In Frankfurt, call money rates moved higher again, continuing the trend which has prevailed all week. Call money traded up to 9.65/75 per cent, from 9.60/70 per cent on Wednesday. Analysts said that the squeeze was due to financial institutions moving to bolster reserves to meet month-end requirements. Borrowings by financial institutions at the Lombard rate of 9.75 per cent, the Bundesbank's emergency funding rate, rose to DM2.1bn, from DM700m on Tuesday.</p>

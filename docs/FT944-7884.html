			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / French aim for a 'revolution' France intends to use its forthcoming European Union presidency to start pushing for institutional reform in the 1996 constitutional conference, and to give Europe a stronger cultural identity. Mr Alain Lamassoure, EU affairs minister, yesterday told a Paris seminar that expansion of the Union to include three, and maybe four, new countries next year, and the perspective of future enlargement to the east, required 'an institutional revolution', particularly in foreign policy decision-making. The minister suggested that one way of speeding Council of Ministers' decisions would be to hive off its lawmaking function into public sessions, with open debate and votes. Its executive role of managing the Union would remain confidential. In this latter role, the Council 'must move further and faster in foreign policy and defence', as illustrated by its shortcomings in Bosnia. Mr Lamassoure reiterated a previous suggestion that the EU had to have some kind of body to define, propose and implement its planned common foreign policy, just as the European Commission did for internal Union policies. However, he stressed that while the government had decided on the broad outlines of its presidency programme - which Prime Minister Edouard Balladur is expected to unveil in early December - its plans had yet to receive the green light from President Francois Mitterrand. At last week's Anglo-French summit at Chartres, the president said the 1996 conference should first consolidate commitments of the Maastricht treaty before embarking on new initiatives. Separately, Mr Jacques Toubon, culture minister, said in an interview that France would pursue three priorities during its presidency. First, it would seek revision of the satellite broadcasting directive to place more control with countries such as France receiving English-language broadcasts and less with those countries, such as the UK, from which transmission took place. Secondly, France would try to interest its partners in committing themselves to an intergovernmental convention requiring the teaching of at least two foreign languages. 'The first foreign language taught would almost always be English, but the second might be French, Spanish or German,' he said. Lastly, Paris would urge the EU to increase funding for its 'Media Programme' to help the distribution and promotion of European films.</p>

Another  breakaway region, that of Dniestr, has eased its negative  attitude to elections.    President of Gagauz region Stepan Topal agreed to hold  elections to Moldovan parliament on the territory of the region  after talks with Moldovan Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli late on  Tuesday [15 February].    Earlier the Gagauz leadership conditioned the holding of  elections by receiving the status of autonomy, while Moldovan  President Mircea Snegur urged the Gagauz region to drop  preliminary conditions, join the new parliament which would then  solve the problem of the status.    It was agreed that polling stations will be open across the  whole of the Gagauz region, Sangheli told TASS on Wednesday.    "This will undoubtedly result in a stabilisation of the  situation, will strengthen mutual understanding bewteen various  nationalities in Moldova", Sangheli commented adding that the  final decision on the Gagauz participation in elections will be  adopted by the local parliament on Thursday.    Also on Wednesday authorities of the Dniester region said  they would not obstruct citizens wishing to take part in the  parliamentary elections in Moldova, but reiterated there would  be no election on the teritory of the region.    The press service of Igor Smirnov, the president of the  unrecognised Dniester Republic, issued a statement saying that  the Tiraspol authorities would continue to boycott the elections  and would not open any voting stations on their territory.  Nevertheless, they will not prevent citizens from crossing over  to the other side of the Dniester River on the day of the  elections in order to cast their ballots at voting stations  there.    The Dniester leader invited observers from foreign states,  including CIS countries, to come to the Dniester Republic and  see on the spot that this assurance is fulfilled.</p>

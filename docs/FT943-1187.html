			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (24): Benefits fuel growth - Electronic Data Interchange The integration of the office personal computer with telecommunications systems over the past decade has begun to make paper-free electronic trading, or 'electronic commerce,' a real possibility, writes Paul Taylor. Electronic data interchange (EDI) and electronic mail, both value-added network services (Vans), provide the basis for electronic commerce. EDI enables two organisations, usually customer and supplier, to exchange business documents such as orders and invoices using standard electronic forms and their own computers linked via a telecommunications service provider. The service provider acts like a central post office, routing the documents and messages to their destination and handling any 'data translation' needed between different computers or message standards. 'EDI improves the speed and accuracy of the business process,' says Mr John Thorpe, managing director of International Network Services (INS) which claims about 65 per cent of the UK market for EDI. Typically he says a company introduces EDI because it saves money on stock and administration. These benefits have fuelled growth in the use of EDI in the US, where it originated, and more recently Europe. Ovum, the technology consultancy, estimated last year that the EDI market in Europe, including customer software and support, will triple in size from just under Ecu200m in 1992 to about Ecu600m in 1997. The UK, France and the Netherlands are the most mature EDI markets in Europe although other nations including Austria, Italy and Spain are begining to catch up. Germany lags behind in EDI implementation, arguably because of its highly restrictive telecommunications regime. Among the service providers in Europe the market leaders are IBM and General Electric Information Services (Geis) which both have pan-European networks. Geis, which recently acquired the 50 per cent of INS which it did not already own, has about 35 per cent of the fragmented European market. In the UK, standards are not a big issue, but outside Britain most domestic EDI traffic has been based on industry-specific or proprietary application protocols. According to one estimate, there are 26 different versions of standards in the world, including 15 in Japanese. However, most new user-communities are basing their services on an international standard called Edifact  - and many existing communities using proprietary application protocols are moving towards Edifact. By 1997, Ovum predicts that 90 per cent of EDI traffic in Europe will be based on the Edifact standard, compared with less than 50 per cent last year. In the UK where there are an estimated 10,000 EDI users, the market is dominated by INS which was jointly owned by Geis and ICL until recently when Geis bought out its partner  - a move which industry analysts suggest signals the start of consolidation and internationalisation of the EDI market. 'We are experiencing very rapid growth in terms of documents,' says Mr Thorpe. INS provides three main EDI 'communities,' INS-Tradanet, the main service for retailers and their suppliers, Brokernet for the insurance sector and Fleetnet for the fleet leasing-management sector. The biggest, INS-Tradanet, handles more than 6m documents a month for customers which include most of the large high street retailers and their suppliers. Mr Thorpe says that companies which have implemented an electronic trading strategy are moving forward in two distinct ways. First, they are adding additional document types, second they are reaching further and further down the supply-customer chain. Nevertheless, there is still plenty of room for growth since research suggests that even among those companies which have signed up for EDI only a small percentage are trading with more than 100 companies and many are trading with fewer than 10.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By unidentified ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 19 Mar -- Representatives of the Islamic  Republic of Iran have started work at the site of the crash of  the Iranian C-130 Hercules military transport plane.    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic told an ITAR-TASS correspondent by telephone today that  the republic's authorities had expressed condolences to the  families of those who died and to the Iranian people. A state  commission to investigate the cause of the air crash has been  set up.    According to reports from other Karabakh sources, local  experts do not rule out the possibility that the Iranian plane  could have been shot down by the Azerbaijani side. In their  opinion, information about the radio intercept, which the  Karabakh side bears witness to, as does the fact that at the  site where the military plane came down near the village of  Noragyukh in Askerasnkiy [Askeran] Rayon, there are fragments of  five surface-to-air class missiles launched over the past 18  months from anti-aircraft missile systems in the Azerbaijani  towns of Mingechaur and TerTer.    However, Stepanakert is refraining from making any official  statements until the commission has given its findings. One  possible motive is said to be that the cause of the crash of the  military helicopter carrying several Azerbaijani leaders in  November 1991 in Nagorno-Karabakh has still not been  established. The Azerbaijani side placed the blame on  Stepanakert then without any proof, but the matter has still not  been cleared up.</p>

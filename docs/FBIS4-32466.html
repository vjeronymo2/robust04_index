			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, June 23 (CTK) -- On the eve of the  European Union (EU) summit in Corfu, Czech Minister of Industry  and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy visited the European Union Commission  today.    He talked to the Commission's Deputy Chairman Henning  Christophersen and the Commissary for External Economic Relation  Leon Brittan.    He told both of them about the economic situation in the  Czech Republic, giving them the latest information from the  statistical office of a 3.5 per cent growth in the gross  national product, and gave them details of the progress of  privatization.    Pavel Telicka from the Czech EU delegation said  Christophersen had told Dlouhy the Czech Republic's approach of  firs privatizing state companies and leaving their  restructuralization until later was the right one. Christopher  added that in countries which had proceeded in the opposite way,  privatization had not brought the results expected.    Dlouhy discussed specific questions concerning preparations  for EU membership, both from the point of view of the Czech  Republic and that of the EU. Christophersen assured him that the  EU was interested in Czech membership and that it was now  analyzing questions connected with the further expansion of the  Union.    With Brittan, Dlouhy discussed problems hindering trade  between the Czech Republic and the EU, and the rules of fair  economic competition. He pointed out to Brittan that the latest  anti-dumping investigations to be started by EU bodies with  regard to the export of Czech cement and foundry iron were  entirely ungrounded. He also said that although the Czech  Republic could not be shown to be carrying out a policy of  dumping, the very fact that investigations had been started  would do Czech companies economic damage. He therefore turned  to Brittan with a request for the reviewing of the EU  Commission's anti-dumping practice.    Brittan replied that he was already looking into the  question  of anti-dumping proceedings against countries of Central and  Eastern Europe. He pointed to the necessity of compatibility  between the Czech Republic's policy of economic competition and  the rules of economic competition in the EU, saying that these  policies had to be transparent. In the rest of the discussion  Brittan expressed interest in how the Czech Republic dealt with  the question of bankruptcies.</p>

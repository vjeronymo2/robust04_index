The  Pepsi-Cola Co., in announcing renovation of 10 neighborhood parks in the  county, chose 31 winning posters by children ages 5 to 12 depicting the  artists' designs for a park. At the city's Junior Arts Center at 4800 Hollywood  Blvd., a exhibit of the top 48 entries in McDonald's Hispanic Heritage Art  Contest opened. The free exhibit will be on display through Oct. 8, when it  goes on tour to other cities.  </P></p>

Kim Chong-u, deputy chairman of North Korea's External  Economy Commission, vowed in a conversation with a high-ranking  East European diplomat last month to attract foreign investment  through wider contacts with such countries, the source said.    According to the source, Kim said North Korea is willing to  develop ties regardless of their political systems, "as long as  these countries do not object to our political system."    "If we can limit our excessive military expenditure, which  is  a heavy burden to our economic development, North Korea could  quite quickly revitalize the economy and raise the standard of  living of its society," he was quoted as saying.    Kim claimed Pyongyang recently began talks with several  major  U.S. and Japanese auto manufacturers, pharmaceutical and oil  firms, the source said.    The deputy chairman, who also supervises the Nachin-Sonpong  Free Economic Trade Zone in the Tumen River Delta, blamed  military spending and the collapse of the "socialist camp and  socialist market" for North Korea's economic difficulties, the  source said.    Kim, 52, considered a strong reform-minded leader, said,  "North Korea would like to join APEC and benefit from the fact  that it is located in Asia, the fastest growing region in the  world."    Last December the nation's economic policy was declared a  failure at a plenary session of the Workers' Party and one based  on development of agriculture, light industry and trade, and  strong foreign trade was implemented.</p>

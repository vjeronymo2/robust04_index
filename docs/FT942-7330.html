			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Boost for coal sell-off: Non-mining activities set to raise more cash than pits The sale of British Coal's non-mining activities is likely to earn the government significantly more than its pits, it emerged yesterday as the corporation published details of nine activities, including subsidiaries, to be sold off by next March. The companies - which include Coal Products, the smokeless fuel manufacturer, and British Fuels Group, the distributor of coal, gas and oil  -last year recorded turnover of more than Pounds 700m and operating profits in excess of Pounds 40m. British Coal would not be drawn on what it expects the proceeds to be. Mr Charles Kernot, mining analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said the companies could fetch more than Pounds 500m, compared with as little as Pounds 130m for coal mines. In addition, British Coal's property portfolio, ranging from the lease on its Hobart House headquarters in London to miners' allotments, could raise between Pounds 300m and Pounds 1bn, according to some forecasts. Mr Ray Proctor, British Coal finance director, said most of the non-mining activities, which employ 4,800 people - a quarter of British Coal's workforce - would be offered by way of trade sales. He hoped privatisation of non-mining businesses would be largely completed by March 1995. British Fuels Group, with an annual turnover of Pounds 550m, is among the largest units being sold. British Coal plans to offer the three BFL arms - GB Coal, GB Oil and Cawoods, serving Northern Ireland - separately towards the end of the year. Coal Products, with turnover of Pounds 130m, may be attractive for its Phurnacite and Homefire brands and its 30 per cent of the UK solid smokeless fuel market. It will be offered for sale early in the summer. British Coal is considering options for the future of CIN Management (Cinman), investment manager for the industry's pension schemes and for the pension funds for Barclays Bank and British Rail. It plans to offer for sale next year its Centris Coal Benefits subsidiary which is taking over the activities, assets and staff of British Coal's pensions administration and insurance centre. More peripheral to the UK industry is German Creek, an Australian company with two deep mines and opencast activities producing between 4m and 5m tonnes a year. British Coal's 15 per cent stake, taken in the late 1970s to give it a testbed for mining technology, is to be offered for sale towards the end of the year. Other activities to be sold include: information technology activities including the Compower computer services bureau; technical and scientific services; and consulting and engineering services to the mining, minerals and energy industries. Several of these are likely to be the subject of management buy-out bids. Potential bidders are being told they can register an interest with Samuel Montagu if they wish to consider bidding for the activities other than Coal Products, on which Price Waterhouse is the adviser. Other organisations still under consideration include British Coal Enterprise, the job-creation arm, and the Coal Research Establishment, which carries out research and development into coal utilisation.</p>

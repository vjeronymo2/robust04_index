			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Management: Employers cast as partners in crime - Who is to blame for corporate misconduct When British Airways was caught last year waging 'dirty tricks' against Virgin Atlantic, its local arch-rival, many outsiders assumed its campaign had been authorised by top management. Others accepted BA's protestations that the offending actions - some of which are now the subject of a lawsuit in the US - were merely those of a small group of individuals who had overstepped the bounds of proper behaviour in their eagerness to foster BA's interests. A third group of observers felt that, whether or not the employees had really acted in isolation, the real rogue was BA's abrasive corporate culture, fostered by the airline's then chairman, Lord King. This view is given added credence by an article in the latest edition of the Harvard Business Review* which argues that corporate misconduct is rarely explained by the flaws of an individual employee. More typically, unethical business practice reflects the values, attitudes, beliefs, language and behavioural patterns that define an organisation's operating culture, says the article's author, Lynn Sharp Paine, a Harvard ethics professor. Paine's article is directed mainly at American companies, which are rushing to install 'compliance-based ethics programmes' in order to fall in line with new federal sentencing guidelines. But her conclusions apply to any type and nationality of organisation. The US guidelines, introduced in 1991, partly relate the size of fines for unlawful conduct to the extent to which companies have tried to prevent that misconduct. But Paine argues that providing employees with a rule book - as BA did last year with its hurriedly-introduced code of ethics - is inadequate on its own. To foster a climate that encourages exemplary behaviour, she says, organisations need to take a more comprehensive, 'integrity-based' approach to ethics management. Such approaches vary in design and scope, but they all foster guiding values, aspirations, and patterns of thought which support ethically sound behaviour, plus a sense of shared accountability between employees. Sharp cites several American examples where the lack of such a 'governing ethos', as she calls it, encouraged top, middle and junior managers to behave unethically. The most recent was in 1992, when a car service offshoot of Sears Roebuck was accused of misleading customers and selling them unnecessary parts and services. Sears' chief executive acknowledged management's responsibility for introducing pay and goal-setting systems which 'created an environment in which mistakes did occur'. In stark contrast, Paine says that decisions of thousands of employees at all levels of Johnson &amp; Johnson were responsible for the US drugs company's exemplary behaviour in the Tylenol crisis in 1982; they automatically withdrew all painkillers of that brand from the market after batches were found to have been poisoned. Without a shared set of values and guiding principles ingrained throughout the organisation, Paine says it is doubtful that J&amp;J's response would have been 'as rapid, cohesive and ethically sound'. Three years later, Martin Marietta, the US aerospace and defence contractor, established a comprehensive ethics programme, at a time when its industry was under attack for fraud and mismanagement and the company itself was under investigation. This programme comprises a code of conduct, an ethics training programme for the whole workforce, and comprehensive procedures for reporting and investigating ethical concerns within the company. An ethics network investigates anonymous complaints, and a corporate ethics office manages the programme under the supervision of a steering committee. * Managing for Organisational Integrity.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Providers have consented to certification and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> validation surveys and to complaint investigations by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> choosing to participate as providers in the Medicare or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid programs, or both. As indicated previously, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Supreme Court has long upheld warrantless searches of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closely regulated businesses, and the nursing home industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is no exception. Moreover, section 1128(b)(12) of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides for the exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs of an individual or an entity who denies access to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary or the State agency for the purpose of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey to determine a provider's compliance with Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters suggested that we require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coordination of complaint investigations with the State or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local ombudsman program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Act does not require the State to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coordinate complaint investigations with ombudsman programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, under the Act, each State is required to notify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State long-term care ombudsman of its findings of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance as specified on the HCFA&hyph;2567, with any of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements pertaining to provision of services, resident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rights, or administration and other matters. The State also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides the long term care ombudsman with any report of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse action (specified at &sect;488.406 of this rule) imposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a facility. We are including the requirement for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclosing such information to long term care ombudsman at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.325.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters believed that &sect;488.332 should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include procedures, including timing, evaluation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severity, and protocols, to be used in the investigation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaints of violations of participation requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These commenters offered a variety of specific procedures to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be included in this regulatory section. Also, commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that the State investigate all complaints  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received, while other commenters suggested giving States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility to determine whether there is a reasonable basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for an investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As explained fully in the preamble to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule, sections 1819(g)(4)(A) and 1919(g)(4)(A) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act require each State to maintain procedures to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigate complaints of violations of Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation requirements. Additionally, the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operations Manual has prescribed procedures State agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must follow if complaints involve Medicare and/or Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities. We believe these procedures, which are subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ongoing revisions, provide basic minimum instructions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with sufficient flexibility, for State agencies to follow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when investigating complaints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We do not believe that it would be reasonable or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economically feasible to require States, especially those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with remotely located facilities, to survey all facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for which complaints are received. The experience of State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey agencies has shown that many complaints are either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groundless or are not potential violations of requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for certification. This position, however, does not relieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the States from their responsibilities to properly evaluate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and investigate all complaints that may affect a facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure these responsibilities are properly carried  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out, &sect;&sect;488.318 and 488.320 of these rules and sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1819(g)(3)(C) and 1919(g)(3)(C) of the Act require that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary provide appropriate remedies when a State fails to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perform survey and certification responsibilities required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the Act. In addition, HCFA evaluates the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare/Medicaid survey and certification performance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State survey agencies with the State Agency Evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program (SAEP). The SAEP identifies, among other factors,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State actions with regard to the investigation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaints. In Federal fiscal year 1992, the SAEP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment of the State agency's timely processing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general certification related complaints indicated that on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national average between 90 and 99 percent of all general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification related complaints reviewed in the sample were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processed in a timely manner. The evaluation included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining if allegations which may involve immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardy were investigated within two working days of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt and also determining if non-immediate jeopardy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaints were processed in accordance with existing State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency procedures for prioritizing and investigating general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification related complaints. The SAEP data for fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year 1992 also confirmed that in the sample of complaints  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewed, which included general certification related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaints, complaints against accredited hospitals and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations of section 1867 of the Act (Examination and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treatment for Emergency Medical Conditions and Women in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Labor), between 90 and 100 percent of complaints were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collected, logged, referred and acknowledged in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the guidelines provided in the State Operations Manual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and specific policy memoranda. Any inappropriate State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions are discussed with State survey agency management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and reconciled accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

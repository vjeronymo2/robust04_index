			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: FOOD;  </P> <P> MAGICAL KITCHEN HELPERS FOR BAKERS  </P> <P> ONCE IN A WHILE something so simple and practical comes along that you wonder  how you ever got along without it. Take the Von Snedaker Magic Baking Set.  </P> <P> It consists of four non-stick, reusable pieces of Teflon-coated Fiberglas  pre-cut to fit an eight-inch-square utility pan, a 5x9-inch loaf pan and two  round nine-inch cake or pie pans. (There is also a Von Snedaker Magic Baking  Sheet, which measures 17 1/4x14 1/2 inches and fits most cookie sheets.)  </P> <P> No spraying or greasing is necessary when baking (up to 500 degrees) with these  pieces. Just place one in the desired pan, and cakes, pies and brownies turn  out with no sticking at all. The Magic Baking Set cleans easily with a damp  cloth and is microwave- and dishwasher-safe; and the pieces store conveniently  in their own 9 1/2x12 1/2-inch envelope.  </P> <P> The only prohibition for the magical baking pans is that you can't cut on them;  a cut scores the finish and makes food stick. But if that should happen, you  can simply turn the piece over and use the other side.  </P> <P>  The Von Snedaker Magic Baking Set is available at Lawry's Gift Shop, Lawry's  California Center, 570 West Avenue 26, Los Angeles, (213) 224-6800, and at  other area cook stores. Or telephone Von Snedaker, (213) 395-6365.  </P> <P> ROBIN TUCKER  </P></p>

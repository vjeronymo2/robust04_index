			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (12): Study reports and ask three questions - Kevin Goldstein-Jackson says he has made respectable profits from investment trusts, though one produced a dramatic loss, which has shaped the way he now assesses a trust As a private investor, my approach to investment trusts is to look for 'added value': what can a trust offer me that I could not otherwise obtain as a result of my own investment endeavours? The obvious answer is: an interest in a wide spread of investments. But there are now so many trusts, with such wide variations in their performance, that selecting the right one can be as difficult as choosing the right share in a trading company. However, there are three factors to which I pay particular attention: Are the investment trust's shares standing at a discount to net asset value? If so, then it offers an opportunity to acquire an interest in a share portfolio at less cost than buying those shares directly. Does the trust invest in areas where it would otherwise be difficult for me as an individual to invest? For example, in unquoted or very small companies in the UK and elsewhere; or in companies overseas, where the complexities of dealing make it difficult for a foreigner to acquire shares easily and keep track of their progress. Are the managers of the investment trust likely to out-perform others in the same sector? Over the years, I have made respectable profits from investing in a variety of investment trusts. However, one trust investment produced a dramatic loss, and it was this experience that shaped the way I assess individual trusts. In March 1991, I bought, for my personal pension scheme, 1,500 shares in Gresham House investment trust for 300p each. At that time, according to County NatWest Wood Mackenzie figures published in the FT's share price pages, the trust's net asset value was estimated at 751p per share. How could I go wrong with shares in a trust standing at more than 60 per cent discount to net asset value? Unfortunately, the share price drifted downwards until July 1, 1991, when the price plunged from 225p to 75p in reaction to the company's announcement that it had suffered an 82 per cent fall in net assets and would not be paying a final dividend. The shares subsequently fell still further, and at one time were less than 1p each, although they are now around 19p. Why had the company suffered such a collapse in the value of its assets? Because a number of the unquoted companies in which it had invested went into receivership, and there was also a downturn in the value of the company's property portfolio. This experience taught me to view with great caution the figures given in newspapers for trusts' net asset values - especially if the trusts invest in unquoted companies. I now always obtain a copy of a trust's annual report - and a copy of an earlier report - before I invest. Comparing the latest report with one for the previous year can often be instructive, especially with regard to assessing the trust on the basis of the three criteria mentioned earlier. For example, looking at the lists of the trust's major investments may show marked differences between the two reports. Some investments listed in the earlier report may not appear in the latest one, or be shown to have a much reduced market value. I examine the possible reasons for this: has the trust cut its losses on poorly-performing investments, or have the companies concerned been forced into receivership? If a number of unquoted companies are shown with reduced market values, does this mean that they may have fallen even further since the publication of the report, so that the trust's own shares may not be standing at a discount to net asset value but at a premium? Has the company (perhaps in the earlier report) listed holdings in quoted companies which have since got into difficulties - such as Queens Moat, Rosehaugh, Geevor, West Industries, Video Store and Doctus? Gresham House had reported an investment in Polly Peck, which ought to have acted as a warning sign to me, although every trust should be allowed at least one mistake, if only to show that its investment approach is not so 'play safe' that it will avoid taking a reasonable risk on a company that might produce spectacular gains. One hopes that the managers will also learn from any mistakes. I also look at the reports to see if there have been any changes in the management. If a trust has performed well but one or more of the managers named in the earlier report no longer appear in the latest report, will the trust continue to produce such excellent returns? Does the trust give details of any directors or managers with specialised knowledge relevant to the trust's area of activity: such as ability to read the languages of the countries in which the trust invests, or practical business experience, or professional qualifications useful in assessing, say, high-technology companies or mining/energy interests or some other area of specialist activity relevant to the trust? With trusts investing in emerging markets and other countries, I am particularly keen to see whether or not the trust has an office or a representative in one of the countries concerned, which might assist it in keeping a close watch on market conditions that may be more volatile than in some other countries. I hope that my cautious approach to trusts will continue to produce good returns.

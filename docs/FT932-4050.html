			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Burmese military to stay in power BURMESE have been told by their military government that it will never hand over power to a civilian government popularly elected in 1990. Lt Gen Myo Nyunt, chairman of the military-convened National Convention Commission, told a plenary session of the convention only that the regime would be willing to share power on terms designed to preserve the military's dominant role in national politics. And power-sharing in this manner is to be enshrined as a fundamental and permanent principle in a new constitution now being drawn up. Some 700 convention delegates will begin discussions today on the 'fundamental principles of state' to be written into the constitution. The general has proposed a presidential form of government where actual power is wielded, not by the prime minister elected by parliament, but by an executive president chosen by an electoral college. He has also suggested that the president should be experienced in military as well as political, economic and administrative affairs. Acceptance of this suggestion as a constitutional principle would mean that no one without military experience could be elected president. The new constitution will also provide for a parliament of two chambers, but as proposed by the chairman, the legislators will not be limited to those elected by popular vote but include a certain number (to be specified later) of those nominated by the defence service commander-in-chief, presumably from among military personnel. No mention was made of the basis on which the prime minister should be elected and on his role is vis-a-vis the president. But it is conceivable that only a nominated military member of parliament, or a civilian elected MP acceptable to and supported by military MPs, would be elected as prime minister. In the executive branch of the government, some posts would be reserved for military officers, with the defence services commander-in-chief having virtually unfettered powers in times of emergency.</p>

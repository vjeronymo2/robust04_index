			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Al Fresco Living: Where there's smoke, there's an American - The history and ritual of one of the glories of American cooking Not too long ago most everything a man ate was cooked outdoors over an open fire. But, while grilling food over a smoky fire has become a relic to most civilisations, barbecuing continues to be America's greatest gustatory glory, refined over centuries by both native and new Americans. In fact, the term barbecue comes from a Taino Indian word for a latticework grill, and true barbecue has more to do with long, slow smoking than it does with merely throwing meat on a grill. Open-pit barbecuing is still a primordial man's world in America and a lot of men will tell you barbecuing is an art form, like gear-shifting and VCR programming. Southerners, and Texans in particular, get very protective about what they consider integral to their history and they do not wish to see it compromised into a mere marketing tool. 'Down here (in Texas), barbecue is not a word, it's a cultural thing,' insists Robert Del Grande, chef-owner of Houston's Cafe Annie (713-840-1111) 'and you have to understand the depth of that. 'Too many chefs just throw spices on grilled meat and call it barbecue, which is like saying you are doing Indian food merely by adding some curry powder to a stew.' There are dozens of barbecue contests held around the US each year. Memphis, Tennessee, which claims to be the nation's barbecue capital - an idea scoffed at by every other state - stages a no-holds barred World Champion Barbecue contest each May composed of equal parts culinary wizardry and Mardi Gras ribaldry. One competitor transformed a Japanese sedan into a barbecue cooker while challengers from Federal Express rigged up a four-foot model jet aeroplane as a smoker. The two main forms of American barbecue are historically and geographically determined by the Mississippi River: in the east, pork is king; in the west, beef is preferred. The Indians showed settlers the basic techniques - they even barbecued a few settlers now and then  - and the basting sauce ingredients, chilli peppers and tomatoes, are indigenous to the Americas. After that regional distinctions can get positively byzantine. In North Carolina alone there are at least two principal styles of barbecued pork, which comes either in the form of ribs or as shredded butt meat (the hams) served on a hamburger bun. In the western part of the state, the basting sauce is ketchup rich and fairly sweet; in the east they favour a chilli-pepper-based sauce with plenty of vinegar in it. In Texas they prefer a dry ribbed seasoning rather than sauce on beef brisket, accompanied by nothing more than sliced white bread, cold beer and a raw jalapeno chilli pepper. Making a great American barbecue, of the kind you will find cooked up in a Quonset hut along a roadside in Alabama, is more a question of patience and ingenuity than it is of flawless technique. If you have got some form of covered, kettle-shaped grill and 12 hours to spend tending it, anyone can make reasonably good barbecue. The secret is in keeping the food away from the fire. That is, build a small fire of charcoal to one side of the grill, let it burn down so that there is no flame. Place some small pieces of seasoned fruit wood soaked for an hour in water on top, then place the meat on the other side of the grill. Cover it, and let the smoke work its slow alchemy. Meats may be basted, although you need not do so continuously if you intend to serve them with a good bottled barbecue sauce, which in the US have such evocative names as Mad Dog BBQ Sauce, Willingham's WHAM Sauce, JL Jardine's Killer Hot Texas Bar-B-Q Sauce, and Crazy Cajun All-Purpose Sauce. Perhaps Kentucky-raised Dean Fearing, chef at the superior Mansion on Turtle Creek hotel in Dallas, and cooking at The Lanesborough Hotel, London, until Friday, explains the mystique of barbecue best: 'From the first time I tasted true Texas barbecue, my fate was sealed,' he says. 'It was at Sonny Bryan's BBQ in Dallas, and it took me the next 10 years to achieve the kind of complex flavours really good barbecue must have. Barbecue is part cooking and part ritual, so when I die I want to have one hand wrapped around a Lone Star beer, the other around a rib from Sonny's, lying face down in a pool of his sauce.' TEXAS DRY RUB SEASONING In a mortar bowl crush together 1 tbsp black peppercorns, 1 tbsp salt, 1 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp cummin, 1 tsp coriander seeds, 1 tsp dried oregano, 1 tsp dried thyme and 1 tsp dried marjoram. When it achieves the consistency of salt and pepper, apply to meat and let stand for an hour or so before barbecuing TEXAS WET SAUCE In a bowl blend together 1 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp dried oregano, 1 tsp dried cumin, 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp ground black pepper. In a saucepan melt 1/4 stick of butter, then add 7 cloves of chopped garlic and 1 diced large onion. Saute until the onions become clear and the garlic begins to brown. Add  1/4 cup Worcestershire Sauce,  1/4 cup A-I Steak Sauce, 2 cups ketchup,  1/4 cup white vinegar, 3 tbs sugar, and the juice of one lemon. Cook until well blended, then add dry ingredients. Cook slowly over a low flame for at least 40 mins until reduced and thickened. Use as a marinade, basting sauce or side sauce with barbecued beef. NORTH CAROLINA EASTERN-STYLE BARBECUE SAUCE In a bowl combine 3 tbsp crushed red pepper flakes, 3 tbsp freshly ground pepper, 3 tbsp salt,  1/4 cup molasses, 4 cloves minced garlic and mash together. Add 1 quart of white vinegar and mix. Allow to stand for several hours. Use as a marinade or basting sauce for pork barbecue. NORTH CAROLINA WESTERN-STYLE BARBECUE SAUCE In a saucepan, melt 1 stick of butter. Add 1 chopped large onion and 6 cloves garlic and saute until translucent and starting to brown. Add 1 cup white vinegar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 2 cloves, 1 tbsp dry mustard, 1 tsp chilli powder,  1/2 cup brown sugar and  2/3 cup ketchup. Stir together, then add 1 cup water and blend again. Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer. Add salt and pepper to taste and remove from heat. Best used on pork shoulder. For measuring purposes in these recipes, a stick of butter is four ounces and a cup is eight fluid ounces.

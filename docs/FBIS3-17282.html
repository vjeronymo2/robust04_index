Upon his arrival Wednesday, he expressed hope that with  the mediation of Russia the talks between the authorities of  Tajikistan and the opposition leaders will lead to accord and  peace in this Central Asian republic.    Answering the questions put by Interfax, Grachev backed  further protection of the Tajik-Afghan border by collective  efforts of CIS peacekeepers.    He said though that he expressed the view of a military man  since the solution of the problem is solely within the  competence of political leaders of the CIS states.    The term of the Russian troops in the republic expires on  December 31, 1994, in line with the understanding between  Dushanbe and Moscow.    Grachev believes that the protection of the Tajik-Afghan  border meets the interests of Russia's security, as well as of  the 200,000-strong Russian-speaking population.    Grachev said that during his meetings in Dushanbe with the  Tajik leadership he intends to discuss the military-political  situation in the republic.    Grachev arrived in Tajikistan to take part in the military  exercises which are being held near the Tajik-Afghan border.  Taking part are units of the 201st Russian Infantry division,  Russian border guards, military units of Tajikistan and Uzbek  peacekeepers.    Grachev said that taking part in the exercises are about 50  warplanes, 300 units of various military technology, 100  artillery pieces and mortars, 60 air defence weapons and about  2000 servicemen.</p>

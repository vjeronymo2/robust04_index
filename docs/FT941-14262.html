			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / BT in talks with union over RSI British Telecommunications is negotiating with the National Communications Union to agree a compensation scheme for employees who suffer from repetitive strain injury. The scheme, if agreed, would include action to prevent RSI and a compensation scheme designed to avoid the delays, costs and uncertainties associated with legal claims. The union was active in supporting legal actions, settled in May, which led to out-of-court settlements for 11 BT staff.</p>

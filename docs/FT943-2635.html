			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (17): The sport of commoners - Investing in a racehorse / Michael Thompson-Noel bought two shares in a racing syndicate At York racecourse on August 17, the pulsating finish to the Gimcrack Stakes provided a textbook study of the dramas and uncertainties on which the sport  -and business - of horse racing are based. The Gimcrack is a race for two-year-old colts and geldings. It is a prestigious affair: the winning owner is invited to make a speech at the famous Gimcrack dinner later in the year. And it is well worthwhile financially: Pounds 61,537.80 to the winner this year, Pounds 22,690.20 to the second, Pounds 10,820.10 to the third, down to Pounds 568.65 to the sixth. As this year's Gimcrack boiled to a climax, the race seemed at the mercy of the well-fancied Fallow, which cost 26,000 guineas when bought as a yearling in Ireland last year. (At British and Irish racehorse auctions, prices are expressed, archaically, in guineas. A guinea used to be a pound and a shilling - Pounds 1.05 - so Fallow cost its owner IPounds 27,300 in the auction ring). Before the Gimcrack, Fallow had had six races, winning three of them and amassing prizemoney earnings of Pounds 36,885. In the Gimcrack, Fallow breezed into the lead authoritatively and appeared to have the race at his mercy. But then, with a burst of acceleration that the pundits found astonishing, another runner swooped and snatched first prize. This was Chilly Billy, which had cost 20,000 (English) guineas as a two-year-old at auction but lined-up for the Gimcrack with an inferior record to Fallow's. Before the Gimcrack, Chilly Billy had raced three times without winning. It had finished third once (admittedly at Royal Ascot). Its prizemoney prior to York: Pounds 3,245. Not surprisingly, Fallow started as a 5-1 co-favourite while Chilly Billy was out with the washing at 12-1. Not that Chilly Billy was totally unfancied. In the hours before the race he had been backed to win some large sums. Close to home, though, Chilly Billy looked squeezed for room on the rail and incapable of storming through. At that moment - say 150 yards from the finishing post - you might have concluded that Fallow was a star of the future, and might have been happy to buy him, in that split second, for Pounds 500,000 (let us say) or even more. Chilly Billy, on the other hand, might have struck you as an unlucky sort of horse worth (for the sake of argument) not much more than his purchase price last year. How wrong you would have been. A narrow gap suddenly opened for him and Chilly Billy flew towards the finishing line with such naked speed that it is Chilly Billy, not Fallow, that is now worth many times his purchase price. This often happens in racing, though it would be an unwise man who slapped down Pounds 20,000 or more at the yearling sales in the belief that racehorses are an everyday investment. They are a gamble. They are not an extremely long-odds gamble, like a lottery ticket, but they cost so much to buy, train and race that very few show a profit or come close to covering their costs. In Britain, annual training and racing costs vary from about Pounds 12,000 to perhaps Pounds 20,000 a year if your horse is stabled with a star trainer, while prizemoney is low (27 per cent of prizemoney is contributed by owners themselves, via race entry fees). But things are improving - a little. Prizemoney in Britain has perked up a bit recently. And - importantly for owners - VAT arrangements have been reformed, so that owners can claim back the 17.5 per cent VAT on horse purchases and other racing costs. To spread their risks, more and more owners are joining partnerships or syndicates. This lowers costs greatly, but it does not reduce the gamble. For instance, I could never afford to buy a Fallow or a Chilly Billy. But in the spring of 1987 I bought two shares in a syndicate called Newmarket Thoroughbred Racing and Chasing (NTRC), at Pounds 395 each. All told, NTRC raised Pounds 309,285 from the public. Of that, only Pounds 147,149 was spent on buying racehorses. From 80 races, our prizemoney was a mere Pounds 17,198. Training fees swallowed Pounds 69,017. Other biggish sums went on management fees, horse transport, entry fees, VAT, secretarial and office expenses, start-up and marketing costs, legal and professional charges - what have you. By the time NTRC was wound-up, there was very little money left. There had been a whirlwind of activity - horses coming and going, hopes rising and falling. Our horses had run 80 times, but none had been remotely in the class of Fallow or Chilly Billy. At the end, I received a tiny pay-off cheque from the syndicate's Newmarket organisers: so far as I recall, less than Pounds 40. Did I enjoy myself? The answer, quite inevitably, would have to be yes and no. Perhaps more no than yes.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur, high-ranking </F> Ba'th Party official, by Hani Ibrahim 'Ashur; place and date not  given: "Participants in the Russian Liberal Democratic Party  Convention Stood Up and Cheered for Saddam Husayn and the Iraqi  People"--first four paragraphs are AL-QADISIYAH introduction]    [Text] After more than three years have gone by since the  tripartite aggression against Iraq, the principles of the mother  of all battles are still shining and illuminating the paths of  our struggle as well as human civilization and freedom, and the  principles of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party still express the  depth of our commitment to the human principles and values that  have been the foundation of the course of human history.    It is on the basis of these truths that relations between  political movements and the principles of honorable men in the  world have united and adopted firm positions in order to hoist  the banner of truth and reject the system of Western trusteeship  and hegemony over the free and independent peoples of the world.    Part of the flowing river of live and battle-inspired  friendships has been the relationship of the Russian Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] to our Arab Socialist Ba'th Party. A  party delegation from Iraq, headed by Comrade 'Abd-al-Ghani  'Abd-al-Ghafur, member of the party's Iraqi Regional Command,  represented the Ba'th Party at the general convention of the  LDP, which was held during the last few days.    Our newspaper AL-QADISIYAH held this interview with Comrade  'Abd-al-Ghafur in order that we learn more about his recent  visit to Moscow:    ['Ashur] You visited Moscow after the UN Security Council  last month reviewed and discussed the subject of the blockade  against Iraq and after Russia announced its position calling for  lifting the blockade within the framework of this review [of  Iraq's situation]. How was this Russian position reflected in  your meetings with Russian political leaders?    ['Abd-al-Ghafur] Through our meetings with party leaders,  people representing political forces, and official leaders  during our visit in Moscow we discovered that there is a common  denominator among the opinions of the official leaders and some  of the party leaders concerning the necessity of lifting the  blockade against Iraq. This was summarized in the Russian  position taken in the Security Council during the last review.  The source of this position is the fact that Russia realizes  what its interest is. Official and party leaders have asserted  that continuing the blockade against Iraq would cause great harm  not only to Iraq, but also to Russia and its people. It is  sufficient for me to point out that Zhirinovskiy, leader of the  LDP, as well as the vice president of the Russian Communist  Party and Russia's first deputy minister of foreign affairs,  have all asserted that the Russian people have expressed their  support for the position taken by Russia in the Security Council  because of the fact that this position is in the interest of the  Russian people and expresses the adherence to the values of  friendship that binds the Russian and Iraqi peoples. The  expression of this fact came out clearly in our meetings,  through the common denominator that we referred to, and due to  the fact that Russia, at the official, party, and popular  levels, feels that its interest dictates that it work toward  having the blockade against Iraq lifted and achieving the  implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687. All this is in  addition to the fact that there are common interests between the  two nations. It is a known fact that there are extensive common  economic and trade interests between Russia and Iraq that are  governed by agreements that were in force before the tripartite  aggression against Iraq.    ['Ashur] Does this mean that Russian public opinion realizes  what Russia's economic and political interests are and is urging  Russia to move in the direction of taking a position vis-a-vis  the blockade against Iraq?    ['Abd-al-Ghafur] It is a known fact that one cannot totally  separate politics from economics because of the close connection  between them and the fact that they mutually influence each  other. Due to this fact, there is a feeling which predominates  among Russian circles--and which the Russian media, official  leaders, and party leaders have begun expressing in one form or  another--concerning the fact that Russia's international  position should not be ignored. They say that Russia is a  superpower and has international influence. These Russian  official and party circles are attempting to assert this fact by  means of taking some positions. At this point we could refer to  the recent Russian position taken in Security Council meetings  concerning the blockade against Iraq that shows a basic  departure from the position taken by the United States. This is  something that has happened for the first time. Russia announced  its position, resembling that of China and France, which  represents a positive development regarding the matter of  continuing the blockade against Iraq and requiring the Security  Council to honor its commitments within the framework of  Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687.    ['Ashur] In light of the present situation, what are your  expectations concerning the Russian position during the next  review to be held by the Security Council?    ['Abd-al-Ghafur] In light of the situation that has cropped  up in the international arena and Russia's attempt to define its  role, we suppose that there will be a more positive development  in the Russian position, during the next review, in the  direction of implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687,  or at least with regard to setting a so-called "probationary  period." Also, Russia has declared more than once that this  matter should not be left unresolved, in accordance with the  desire of Ekeus and the United States.    ['Ashur] During your time in Moscow, you participated in the  LDP convention as representative of our Ba'th Party. How do you  assess the results of this convention on the various levels both  inside and outside Russia?    ['Abd-al-Ghafur] As we know, decisions made by parties in  any  particular country are that country's internal affairs, and what  the LDP or any other [Russian] party decides is a matter that  concerns Russia. However, the matter that concerns us is the  LDP's position regarding the blockade against Iraq and the  influence of the steadfastness of the people of Iraq, due to the  leadership of our leader Saddam Husayn, on the direction taken  by the convention. The convention reached a clear decision to  undertake serious action to lift the blockade against the people  of Iraq by means of exercising its influence on its bloc in the  Russian parliament, the Duma, and by means of the ties of the  LDP to the various political forces and other parties both  inside and outside Russia. The LDP considers the people of Iraq  to be a live example of the human struggle [being waged in the  world], and the other parties and political forces also believe  this. They consider Iraq to be a model of steadfastness and  insistence, and they consider Saddam Husayn to be a symbol of  the human struggle being waged against imperialism and U.S.  hegemony. The LDP convention's final communique emphasized the  necessity of resuming trade and economic relations with Iraq and  breaking the unjust blockade being imposed on it, both because  of the benefit that this would bring to the Russian people and  because it would be in the interest of both the Russian and  Iraqi peoples, and because this would strengthen the values of  friendship existing between the two nations.    When the speech for the Ba'th Party delegation at the  convention was given, those present at the convention  interrupted the speech numerous times with applause and cheers.  They stood and cheered for Saddam Husayn. All the speeches by  the delegations from parties and political forces from Germany,  France, Bulgaria, and elsewhere saluted the positions taken by  Iraq which has been steadfast in the face of imperialist  hegemony, the delegations expressed how much they respect they  had for the struggle being waged by the Iraqi people and their  leader, Saddam Husayn, and they considered them to be an example  to follow when confronting the so-called "new world order."    Iraq's position, steadfastness, and progress in development  and construction in spite of the unjust blockade were a source  of admiration. Zhirinovskiy clearly referred to this in his  speech, and this admiration was also shown, without exception,  by those at the convention who represented the parties and  political forces participating in it. In addition to this,  support was shown by the remarks made by the members of the  convention who expressed their admiration for the position taken  by Iraq's leader and people.    ['Ashur] Numerous political movements and parties have come  up with a united platform that rejects U.S. hegemony over the  world. How has this rejection been reflected in Russian public  opinion, and did you find popular support for Iraq and for  rejecting the political program of the imperialists?    ['Abd-al-Ghafur] Party and official leaders in Russia have  expressed their independent political opinion by means of their  assertion of the fact that Russia was a nation that had strong  influence over the course of international politics even before  the emergence of the former Soviet Union. When they talked, they  referred to czarist Russia and its influence in international  politics and alliances. Then they would mention or try to assert  that Russia currently possesses the elements of influence in  international politics at least equal to the influence exercised  by the former Soviet Union. I believe that this trend in what  people are saying has been expressed by statements made by  Russian leaders concerning Russia's positions vis-a-vis many  international issues and positions and by means of what we have  referred to concerning Russia's position regarding the Security  Council's latest review of the blockade imposed on Iraq.    This is also being expressed by the Russian media within the  scope of the government and political forces, especially the  parliament.    ['Ashur] What is your assessment of the results of your  visit  to Moscow?    ['Abd-al-Ghafur] We believe that the party's visit to  Russia--which took place as a result of a resolution passed by  the party's leaders in which it was mentioned that continual  political momentum had taken place in the direction of lifting  the blockade against Iraq--achieved its aims in terms of  explaining and elaborating on Iraq's position and meeting its  commitments to Iraq in the effort to lift the blockade. Russian  leaders, both on the party and official levels, demonstrated an  understanding of and appreciation for Iraq's positions as well  as its responsiveness to Security Council resolutions. We hope  that the Security Council's next review will more fully reflect  the development and effectiveness in Russia's position with  regard to the effort to lift the blockade.    We elaborated on Iraq's role, the importance of its  location,  and its economic and cultural importance, since Iraq cannot at  all be ignored. We also conveyed the fact that the values of the  people of Iraq confirm Iraq's commitment to the positions of the  nations, peoples, and political forces that have stood by Iraq  in its struggle to lift the blockade. And we said that, with  regard to trade and economic agreements, we will be mainly  influenced by the positions taken by nations and companies  vis-a-vis the blockade imposed on Iraq and their contribution  toward lifting it.    ['Ashur] Thank you very much, Comrade 'Abd-al-Ghafur, for  giving us this interview.    ['Abd-al-Ghafur] And I thank you and your esteemed newspaper  AL-QADISIYAH.</p>

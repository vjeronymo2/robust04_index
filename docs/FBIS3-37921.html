			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] In a memorandum they submitted to President Boris  Yeltsin the personnel of the analytical center of the  socioeconomic department in his headquarters suggest ways to  overcome the payment crisis which, they believe, can lead to a  nation-wide social upheaval.    The document lists the causes of the crisis:    1. The government promised to much to pay and so had to  print more money, which is likely to trigger hyperinflation.    2. Factories transfer their own funds and credits into  deposits, foundation capital of joint stock societies and hard  currency reserves rather than use them to pay debts.    3. Factory managers cannot be made answerable for failure to  pay debts to their suppliers or to the taxation service.    4. The mechanism of putting businesses in order and  liquidating them under the Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Act is not  working.    5. There is no supervision of the transfer and use of  centralized credits.    6. The production continues to decline against a background  of high inflation.    The analysts suggest that the head of state should:    -- Set up regional commissions which would urgently check  the  financial health of debtor businesses. Local administration,  banks, taxation office and law enforcement agency officials must  be members of the commissions. The commissions would identify  debts which are attributable to failure on the part of the state  to honor its commitments to the factories; identify factories  which have hard currency accounts in the deposits in commercial  banks, notably abroad and still are not non-payers; determine  the export hard currency revenues of factories that failed to  reach Russia; identify hopeless debtors and enter them in a  special register to be handed over to the State Property  Commission.    -- Approach different kinds of factories in different ways.  The experts think that the state should pay its debts to the  coal mining and defense industries and to the farmers shortly.  Credits should be given to enable power stations stay in  business until the spring starts; after power stations should  discontinue supply of debtor factories. Managers of other  enterprises, notably of the gas and oil mining the president  should be made additionally responsible if the commission finds  that they failed to pay their suppliers by used the funds to  deposit them in banks, to buy shares of joint stock societies or  to buy equipment or if they have funds on hard currency accounts  but do not exchange them for rubles to pay their suppliers.  Factories must be compelled to pay their overdue debts from  their hard currency accounts.    -- Order the government to rule that every legal entity must  have a maximum of three ruble and two hard currency accounts.  The entity should submit data on all the accounts to the  taxation inspection. Those who fail to do so must be forced to  pay considerable sums. This ruling should be made consistent  with criminal responsibility for tax evasion. In this way funds  would be discovered that could be used for timely payment of  debts to suppliers and tax evasion would be prevented.    -- Order the government to introduce a procedure of mutual  payment of debts by using LC-contracts that are used  internationally. The essence of this procedure is that when a  contract on supply of products is signed, the bank freezes the  sum of the future payment in the payer's account. Once the  product has been shipped, the bank transfers the sum to the  supplier. In this way the customer cannot avoid payment of  debts under the pretext of having no funds on his accounts and  unreliable suppliers cannot cheat the consumers.    -- Order the Central Bank to credit chiefly the final  consumers so as to breath life into the chain of production  financing and product sales.    -- Tighten controls over use of appropriated budget funds  and  centralized credits so that they are used chiefly to pay debts.    -- Impose stringent sanctions for delaying the payment  documents going as far as withdrawing licenses from commercial  banks and levying administrative punishment on cashier center  managers.    -- Regard organizing circulation of promissory note a  priority task. Make additional organizational and material  resources available to the State Property Committee for this  purpose.    -- Sell some of the debts incurred by factories to  commercial banks, state financial institutions and foreign  customers. Exchange the debts in some cases for long term  liabilities of the state or state bonds at rates that vary with  the status of the factory and chances of recovering the debt  (the lower the chance, the lower the rate).    -- Following in the footsteps of Western Europe, attract  private firms for cyclic offsetting of claims (using the system  of clearings).    -- Hold an inter-agency conference of the State Property  Committee, the Supreme Court of Arbitration, the Economy  Ministry and the Finance Ministry with a view to working out a  program of specific steps designed to make the Insolvency  (Bankruptcy) Act work. No financial discipline is thinkable  without bankruptcies.</p>

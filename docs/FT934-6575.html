			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Thorn EMI In general, investors are paying far more for shares than trade buyers are prepared to offer for companies, as the current dearth of takeovers indicates. Thorn is a case in point. It is hard to argue that the stock market undervalues the company. The interim divided was flat and the annual pay-out may be raised only a little above the rate of inflation. Thereafter, it will take time to rebuild cover sufficiently to justify significant increases. Earnings will remain depressed by the horrors of Thorn's seemingly unsaleable defence business, which lost Pounds 14.7m in the first half. Meanwhile, the noise emanating from the investigations into its US rental arm and CD division will continue to drown out the vibrant underlying performance of both businesses. Investors may fondly imagine that other companies, with an urge to follow the multi-media fashion, could well place a higher value on Thorn's assets. With 22 per cent of the global music market, Thorn is undoubtedly a hot intellectual property. Like Paramount in film production, Thorn commands scarcity value. Yet the benefits of vertical integration in music production and distribution remain unproven. Moreover, with the diversified Thorn currently trading on a similar rating to the narrowly-focused Polygram, the market is already implicitly placing a sky-high value on Thorn's music business. It seems unlikely that any potential predator would be prepared to offer more.</p>

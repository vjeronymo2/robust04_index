Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's press secretary, told  INTERFAX that Yeltsin had listened to Ella Pamfilova's reasons  for resigning and found them convincing.    But Boris Nikolayevich voiced the hope that Pamfilova would  not abandon the social sphere and would continue to tackle the  problem as a deputy in the State Duma.    Ella Pamfilova has already, as INTERFAX recalls, tendered  her  resignation twice this year, following the the departure from  the government of Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov.</p>

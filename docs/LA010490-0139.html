			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> SHUTTLE LAUNCHING CLEARED FOR MONDAY  </P> <P> The shuttle Columbia was cleared for launching Monday on a 10-day flight, with  the countdown scheduled to begin today.  </P> <P> It is to put a Navy communications satellite in orbit and retrieve a school  bus-size satellite used to test the durability of potential spacecraft  materials. That satellite will drop back into the atmosphere soon if it is not  retrieved. Liftoff had been scheduled for Dec. 18, but the launch pad at Cape  Canaveral, Fla., that Columbia is using has been out of service for years, and  refurbishing took longer than expected.  </P></p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / People: Gap half plugged at Severn Trent Severn Trent has taken steps to fill the gap which will be left when the outspoken John Bellak retires as chairman today. However, the appointment was greeted by the City as something as a stopgap measure. Richard Ireland, deputy chairman since December 1992, was yesterday named as chairman 'until the appointment of a new chairman who will lead the company into the next decade'. Ireland, also finance director of Wolseley Group, has been a director of Severn since privatisation in 1989. Severn refused to elaborate on the oddly-worded statement. 'We are being up-front by saying that Richard Ireland will be chairman as from tomorrow, but the search for a chairman to lead us into the next century continues,' it said. The City speculated that Severn was hedging its bets. 'It is understood that Ireland had wanted the job, but the company was frightened of taking him on,' one analyst said. 'He is known to be very strict and . . . would pare the business down to what is sensible.' Severn has been widely criticised for the financing of Biffa, the waste management company it purchased for Pounds 212m in 1991. Analysts estimate that although profitable at the operating level, it could be some time before Biffa pays its financing costs.</p>

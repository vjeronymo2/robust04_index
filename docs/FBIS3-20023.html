Sampedro] After underlining the  political and economic importance of Kazakhstan for the  stability of Russia and its surrounding area, Prime Minister  Gonzalez outlined his support for the Cuban liberalization  process. He said Spain would continue to help. He was hopeful  that a free economy would herald a society with more freedom.    [Begin Gonzalez recording] I think a free economy leads to a  society with more freedom. I have always said that. I do not  say that there is a casual effect, because I never have said  that the market is a sacred cow. This is a process that has to  be treated with enormous respect and with considerable calm.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 18 Jun Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, asked at the House of  Councillors' Budget Committee on 17 June if Japan has the  capability or intention to develop nuclear arms, made a "cunning  remark" that could be interpreted as having meant "Japan has the  capability to develop nuclear arms."    Hiroshi Oki of the Liberal Democratic Party, discussing the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), said: "I think Japan has  the capability to possess nuclear arms, but it has chosen not to  possess them to cooperate (with the NPT). What do you think of  this view, prime minister?" To that question, the prime  minister replied, "I am completely of the same view." Later on,  he told reporters in the Diet, "Certainly, Japan has the  capability to possess nuclear arms, but has not produced them  because of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty."    The government so far has totally denied the possibility of  using nuclear power for military purposes, insisting that  "Japan's use of nuclear power is limited to that for peaceful  purposes." A person close to the prime minister admitted: "We  cannot help if someone claimed his remarks deviated from what  the government has said so far." As a result of the suspicions  regarding the DPRK's (North Korea) nuclear development, there  are now people in some circles in Asia and the United States  "talking about Japan acquiring nuclear weapons." That being the  case, the prime minister's office and the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs are trying to dampen the excitement arising therefrom,  saying, "The remarks can bring useless misunderstanding at home  and abroad."    Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai, in a news  conference  on the evening of 17 June, revised the remarks of the prime  minister, saying, "the prime minister's remarks were somewhat  inadequate. Japan's nuclear power is limited to peaceful use."  Frowning to the reporters, he said, "I must explain these  things to the prime minister properly."    The prime minister looked as if he were surprised by such  reaction within the government. Asked later in the evening by  reporters to give his view again, he said, "Did I really say  that? I do not remember." He then said emphatically, "What I am  stressing is that although we have the capability, we are  against nuclearization. I did not mean to say that we have the  capability but do not use it. [sentence as received] We will  never have nuclear weapons, from the standpoints of nuclear  non-proliferation as well as from the three nonnuclear  principles. There is no question about that." He thus in fact  retracted his remarks, but this matter is likely to make waves,  in a subtle manner, at home and abroad.</p>

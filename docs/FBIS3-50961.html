On Saturday, the organization had sent  a letter to National Defense Secretary General Antonio Riviello  Bazan and 31st Military Garrison Commander Gaston Melchaca,  informing them of the intention to make the visit based on  Articles 6 and 11 of the Constitution.    [Begin recording of human rights leader Martin Faz,  indentified by caption] If a legitimate and well-grounded  impediment exists which would keep us from carrying out this  objective, please, let us know as soon as possible at the Plaza  Domingo Hotel, telephone 8-19-27. The above statement is based  on Article 8 of the Constitution. [end recording]    About 16 of the organization's representatives, including  five from the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights  and other U.S. groups, as well as an Indian representative from  that country, left in two station wagons and headed toward the  military roadblock located on the road to Rancho Nuevo, followed  by a motorcade of 50 cars of reporters. At the roadblock, they  were told to return to San Cristobal to meet with CNDH [National  Human Rights Committee] Chairman Jorge Madrazo. The press was  advised to meet with Eloy Cantu Segovia, a senior official of  the Government Secretariat. These officials would inform them of  those places to which they are allowed access.    In view of this situation, and because they were unable to  locate Madrazo, the nongovernment groups left in the afternoon  toward the roadblock on the Tenejapa road. On the way there,  one of the vehicles ran over an Indian, but fortunately without  major consequences.    There are combat vehicles in midtown San San Cristobal de  las  Casas, which are reinforcing military surveillance. Cantu  Segovia and Madrazo issued no statement on Sunday afternoon. It  is worth mentioning that the area's military roadblocks do not  merely consist of tangible objects.</p>

			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Bosnia factions agree UN control of Sarajevo THE LEADERS of Bosnia's three warring factions last night agreed in principle to place Sarajevo under temporary United Nations control in an attempt to speed up a settlement of the 17-month conflict in the republic. This means Sarajevo's fate is being put 'on ice' while the feuding Serbs, Moslems and Croats negotiate a three-way carve-up of the rest of Bosnia on ethnic lines. The agreement, seen as a breakthrough for the international mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, came just hours after leaders of the warring parties met at the negotiating table in Geneva for the first time in two weeks. Under the pact, to be finalised by a three-member committee, Sarajevo would be demilitarised and become a virtual open city separate from the three proposed ethnic mini-states. UN control would extend to the airport and many of the strategic hills from which Serbs shell the city, but would not encompass the nearby Serb stronghold of Pale. However, the spokesman for the mediators, Mr John Mills, cautioned that many problems still had to be resolved. He said the committee would examine civilian policing, the setting up of a body to liaise with the 'UN co-ordinator' and the functioning of municipal and UN authorities. No limit has been fixed for the UN mandate, which diplomats said would have to be agreed by the UN Security Council. 'We are not talking about a final agreement here,' Mr Mills said. 'The devil is always in the details.' Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg earlier this month proposed such an interim settlement for Sarajevo in an effort to prevent deep differences over the capital delaying an overall peace package. Sarajevo is one of the most contested issues, as the Moslem-led government has fought to keep control while the Serbs want to partition the city. The three-member committee will comprise Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the Bosnian Serb parliament, Mr Mohammed Filipovic, a Moslem politician, and Mr Miro Lasic, a Croat member of Bosnia's collective presidency. The agreement coincided with UN confirmation that the last Serb militiamen had withdrawn from strategic mountains seized over a week ago. The Serb offensive had stalled the Geneva talks and raised the prospect of Nato air strikes to destroy artillery threatening the capital. Earlier yesterday Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem president, insisted that ending the siege of Sarajevo had to be at the top of the agenda of the latest talks. Further sessions of the talks are due today. Italy's offer of beds, Page 2</p>

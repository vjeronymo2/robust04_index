			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> MATSURI TAIKO GROUP AT BARNSDALL PARK  </P> <P> As those with broad cultural tastes know, the Southland is regularly blessed  with visits from performers hailing from every continent. But we sometimes  forget that there exists a cornucopia of international artistic talent right  here in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> To wrap up its Barnsdall Park series of "Music From Many Lands," the Aman Folk  Ensemble on Friday presented Matsuri Taiko, a locally based group committed to  maintaining the Japanese tradition of taiko drumming. (Taiko commonly refers to  any of a number of cylindrical or barrel drums in various sizes.) Combining  virtuosity, discipline and showmanship, the six members of the ensemble, joined  by guest artists, gave an exciting introduction to the art, which includes  performances of numerous rhythmic patterns that grow increasingly complex as  rhythmic strata are laid one on top of another.  </P> <P> And no matter how long the selection, how frequent the changes of pattern, or  how complex the rhythm, the ensemble -- led by Tokyo native Etsuo Hongo --  remained astonishingly tight, and created a dramatic momentum that completely  involved the listener. As drummers moved from one drum to another, they did so  with precise, rhythmic and stylized motion; it was a performance not only of  music but also of choreography.  </P> <P> Although most of the selections were traditional examples taken from the  repertory of well-known taiko groups, the 3-year-old ensemble offered some  original material, one selection of which combined contemporary and traditional  rhythmic patterns and used, in addition to the taiko, a snare drum, timbales,  suspended cymbal, cow bell and synthesizer.  </P> <P> To provide further contrast (and give the drummers much-needed rest),  shakuhachi (flute) player Masakazu Yoshizawa and shamisen (three-stringed lute)  artist Tateo Takahashi played examples of traditional Japanese music during  each half of the program.

			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Tinker Closes Division: GTG Entertainment, the joint venture between former NBC  Chairman Grant Tinker and Gannett Co., has closed its New York-based  syndication division and let go another 10 employees based at its Culver City  lot.  </P> <P> GTG had hoped to launch two shows in syndication this fall, but their fate is  now in doubt. Last week, Gannett said it would no longer finance GTG after  March 31. The independent producer employs about 250 people, of which 160 are  associated with the "Baywatch" series on NBC. A spokesman said Tinker has two  pilot commitments at CBS and expressed confidence that a backer could be found  if CBS decided to order the shows for next season.  </P></p>

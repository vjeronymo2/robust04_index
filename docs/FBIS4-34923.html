			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 23 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the  government announced the expulsion of Belgian citizen Frederik  Vandersteene for participating in Mexican political activities,  thus violating national laws.    The Immigration Services Sub-Secretariat of the Interior  Secretariat reported that the expulsion took place 16 days ago  after authorities demonstrated that Vandersteene participated in  political activities in Chiapas State, southeastern Mexico.    The sub-secretariat added that the Belgian citizen admitted  to active participation in Mexican internal political affairs,  thus violating the law, and recognized that "as a foreigner, I  am forbidden from participating in the country's political  affairs.    The Immigration Sub-Secretariat issued a communique  explaining that Vandersteene was in possession of a tactical  maneuvers manual which included instructions on how to act  before authorities to go undetected in case of an armed attack.    Vandersteene arrived in the country on 15 March 1993 as a  one-year visitor to work for the Suitable Technology for  Agricultural Development and Services Civic Association. On 1  June, he asked immigration authorities in San Cristobal de las  Casas, southeastern Chiapas State, for a permit to leave the  country permanently because he lacked immigration documents and  because it suited his plans.    The communique states that the permit was granted on 7 June,  but then Vandersteene said he wanted to visit Cancun, in eastern  Quintana Roo State, despite his request to leave the country  permanently.    When asked to show the documents granting him permanent  residence in the country, Vandersteene, who had a round-trip  Cancun-Amsterdam-Cancun ticket, showed a briefcase full of  papers detailing his political activities in Mexico.    The sub-secretariat said that the tactical maneuvers manual  and the papers demonstrating that he was in Chiapas carrying out  political activities forbidden to foreigners were among the  documents inside his briefcase. The Belgian citizen said the  manual was "a souvenir" he wanted to take to Belgium and  admitted he participated in internal political affairs.    In view of these circumstances, the Immigration  Sub-Secretariat turned Vandersteene over to the Quintana Roo  Attorney General's Office. The local court ruled there was  insufficient evidence to presume he had committed any crime.  The communique goes on to explain that immigration authorities  then proceeded to expel the Belgian citizen on 7 June.</p>

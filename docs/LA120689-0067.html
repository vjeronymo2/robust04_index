			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE KNOW CLOUT WHEN THEY SEE IT;  </P> <P> POLITICS: WITH HIS APPOINTEES AND FRIENDS AT THE CENTER OF THE LINCOLN S&amp;L  SCANDAL, DEUKMEJIAN CAN'T WASH HIS HANDS OF THE AFFAIR.  </P> <P> As the dust settled from the Oct. 17 earthquake, Gov. George Deukmejian  appointed a blue-ribbon commission to look into the seismic safety of  California's freeways. Most of the deaths caused by the quake had occurred when  a section of Interstate 880 in Oakland collapsed on rush-hour traffic.  </P> <P> A political-financial disaster of comparable proportions surrounds the collapse  of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. An estimated 23,000 Californians lost hundreds  of millions of dollars that they had unwittingly "invested" in junk bonds  issued by Lincoln's parent company, American Continental Corp.  </P> <P> The bonds were marketed because state regulators had determined that they were  backed by a financially sound organization. What those regulators did was  analogous to what state highway engineers did when they determined that I-880  could withstand a major earthquake.  </P> <P> Still, the I-880 situation, at worst, was a matter of miscalculation. No one  has alleged that anyone knowingly erred.  </P> <P> But in the Lincoln matter, just the opposite has become apparent. During the  months that have elapsed since Lincoln was seized by federal authorities, it's  become clear that huge amounts of political influence were brought to bear by  Lincoln, American Continental and their owner, Charles Keating Jr., to stave  off a close examination of questionable financial practices. And Deukmejian's  appointees and friends are at the center of the scandal, to wit:  </P> <P>  -- Two state corporations commissioners, Franklin Tom and Christine Bender,  approved sale of the junk bonds even though suspicions about the financial  integrity of Lincoln and American Continental already were being voiced by  lower-level regulators.  </P> <P>  -- Tom and Bender had moved into their regulatory jobs from positions in a law  firm headed by Deukmejian's friend, political adviser and chief political  fund-raiser, Karl Samuelian, who recommended them for the appointments.  </P> <P>  -- Samuelian was hired by Keating to lobby for approval of the bond sales, and  he and Tom personally pressed Bender for a favorable ruling.  </P> <P>  -- As Samuelian joined Keating's vast team of advocates, he began collecting  tens of thousands of dollars -- some estimates approach $200,000 -- in campaign  contributions for Deukmejian from Keating and associated firms and individuals.  </P> <P>  -- Deukmejian's savings and loan commissioner at the time, Larry Taggart,  approved Keating's acquisition of Lincoln. During his last weeks in office in  1984, Taggart allowed Keating to move $800 million in Lincoln's assets into  questionable investments, just three days before a federal rule barring such  investments took effect. He later acknowledged that "I suppose I did that to  beat the deadline."  </P> <P>  -- When Taggart acted, he already had agreed to become an executive of a  troubled San Diego investment firm called TCS Financial, headed by Tom Stickel,  the man who introduced Keating to Samuelian. Within weeks of Taggart's action  allowing Keating to transfer the money, American Continental pumped nearly $3  million into TCS, saving it from foundering.  </P> <P> The picture that has emerged from journalistic digging and legislative hearings  in Washington and Sacramento is that of a regulatory system run amok, more  concerned with helping Keating prop up his financial empire than with  protecting the public interest.  </P> <P> Deukmejian has maintained a detached attitude toward the affair, insisting that  he played no role in what occurred. That really isn't the point.  </P> <P> What is the point is that people he appointed to protect the public from  unscrupulous financial dealings didn't do their jobs and, from all appearances,  failed because of personal, political or financial connections to those they  were supposed to be regulating.  </P> <P> Samuelian says he never went through Deukmejian to serve the interests of  Keating or any other legal client.  </P> <P> But that isn't the point, either. When Samuelian represents a client before a  Deukmejian appointee -- and, in this case, one who had worked for him as well  -- he doesn't have to be explicit. People in such positions aren't stupid. They  know who Karl Samuelian is and what kind of political clout he represents.  </P> <P> Deukmejian may be concerned about public confidence in the highway system. He  should be equally concerned about public confidence in the political system.  </P></p>

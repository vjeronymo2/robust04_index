The slogan "Leader Apo [alias for Abdullah  Ocalan, leader of the Kurdish Workers Party, PKK]" was shouted  at the Nevruz celebration organized by the Democracy Party [DEP].    Party officials tried to suppress certain slogans and  behavior.    [Begin correspondent Aydogan Kilinc recording] In response  to  the request by DEP's Ankara provincial organization to celebrate  Nevruz, the Ankara governor allocated a wedding hall in Altindag.    Strict security measures were taken around the hall and  those  entering the premises were searched. The slogan "Resistance  Means Existence," written in Turkish and Kurdish, drew the most  attention. Many people wearing yellow, red, and green bands,  the PKK's colors, made victory signs.    A young girl wrapped in these colors danced and excited the  300-strong crowd and people started shouting extremist slogans.    When Imam Canpolat, leader of DEP's Ankara provincial  organization, said that there is no middle path, which means  surrender, the shouts of "Leader Apo" in Kurdish rose in the  hall.    DEP deputy leader Remzi Kartal got angry when he heard this  slogan and warned the gathering that Nevruz cannot be marked  under such conditions. He called on the crowd to act in  accordance with the DEP's program and principles. He reacted  strongly when his advice was not heeded. Remzi Kartal said that  efforts are under way to push his party, whose ouster from the  parliament is being sought, outside the legitimate system. He  said that all the laws in the country are being used to close  down the DEP. He added that the sole objective of the DEP is to  contribute to the democratic and political solution of the  Kurdish issue, which has become the country's main problem.    The crowd in the hall booed Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's  proposal that Nevruz be an official holiday.    The crowd then listened to songs in an attempt to calm  itself  and dispersed without incident. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas in Dollars 1.2bn Chinese venture MCDONNELL DOUGLAS, the US aircraft manufacturer, is to go ahead with the co-production of 40 narrow-body commercial jetliners with the China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation, following Chinese government approval of a Dollars 1.2bn joint venture contract. The Chinese deal, in which McDonnell Douglas managed to beat a rival proposal from Boeing, was being hailed yesterday by Mr John McDonnell, chairman of McDonnell Douglas, as a major victory. The deal calls for 20 147-seat MD-80 and 20 158-seat MD-90 twin jets to be assembled in Shanghai, with many parts manufactured in the People's Republic of China (PRC). The first deliveries are due to begin in 1995. But McDonnell Douglas was, meanwhile, seeking to play down reports that a key element of its planned Far Eastern expansion plans - its prospects of concluding a separate accord involving a strategic alliance with Taiwan Aerospace - was in jeopardy. The Taiwan alliance plans stem from a memorandum of understanding signed last November with Taiwan Aerospace in which the 29 per cent government-owned company would pay Dollars 2bn for a stake of up to 40 per cent in the Douglas commercial aircraft business. Last month, Taiwan Aerospace appeared to be seeking to scale back the planned accord amid concerns on the part of Taiwan legislators over the US company's financial position and declining share of the commercial airline market. Yesterday, McDonnell Douglas said: 'As far as we are concerned the proposition is very much alive. We expect to go forward with an agreement with people in Taiwan. We are going to continue to talk with potential Taiwan investors.' But the company did not say whether its discussions might include investors other than Taiwan Aerospace. It is believed that Taiwan Aerospace is seeking to play a lesser role in a possible deal with McDonnell Douglas, which needs cash from an equity sale to fund the development of it new MD-12 jumbo aircraft.</p>

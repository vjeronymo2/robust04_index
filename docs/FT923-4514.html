			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Housing boost fades quickly HOUSE SALES rose for 48 hours last month as buyers rushed to beat the deadline for the reimposition of stamp duty on August 19. Wilson Bowden, the Midlands-based housebuilder, has estimated that it earned almost 8 per cent of this year's expected turnover in two days. Other housebuilders have reported similar increases. In the week to August 19, Persimmon, the seventh-largest housebuilder in the UK, sold 92 homes - double its normal average. The rise was short-lived, however. The following week the group's sales slipped back to 24, or half its normal rate. Many builders, which are spending hundreds of millions of pounds on special offers and incentives in an effort to stimulate sales, report that sales have sagged again since the end of the stamp duty 'holiday' on homes worth up to Pounds 250,000. Housebuilders' advertisments in local newspapers are full of offers of part-exchange deals, low-cost mortgages, offers of removal and legal costs as well as money-off and holiday vouchers. Such offers provide the clearest evidence that recovery in the housing market is as far away as ever. Mr Duncan Davidson, chairman of Persimmon, estimates that selling costs had risen since the late 1980s - thanks mainly to increased sales incentives - from Pounds 1,500 to Pounds 5,000 a home. That was equivalent to an additional Pounds 8m a year off the company's pre-tax profits, he added. Sales would normally increase after the school summer holidays, but few builders expect any recovery before next spring. House prices, which have fallen by up to 30 per cent in East Anglia and 25 per cent in south-east England, will take even longer to recover and are unlikely to show any significant increase until 1994. Builders are unlikely, therefore, to reduce the level of incentives on offer to would-be buyers. That is in spite of a last-minute rush to take advantage of stamp duty concessions. Wilson Bowden, which this week announced a fall of 33 per cent in first half pre-tax profits to Pounds 10.1m, said it sold 100 homes worth about Pounds 8m during the 48 hours before the stamp duty holiday ended. Before that the group had been averaging about 25 sales a week. The gain, however, was brief, with the company selling only a dozen homes in the week after the end of the concession. Although other builders reported a short-lived increase in sales in the middle of August, the overriding view remained that there had been no let-up in the recession. Mr John Low, managing director of Ideal Homes, part of the Trafalgar House construction, property, shipping and hotels group, said: 'The end of the stamp duty holiday had virtually no effect apart from bunching-up of legal completions.' He appealed to the government to abolish stamp duty and raise mortgage tax relief to help the housing market. He said parts of the market in southern England and East Anglia had been in recession for the best part of four years. Builders fear that unless help is forthcoming, house sales will continue to languish in spite of the growth in special deals and offers. Construction sector preview, Page 8</p>

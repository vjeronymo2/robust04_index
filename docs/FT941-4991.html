			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Israelis in court over share scandal Three Israeli bank officials appeared in a Tel Aviv magistrates' court yesterday in connection with a share and bond price manipulation scandal on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. They are the latest in a line of brokers and fund managers to be interrogated since a big investigation of alleged insider trading and share manipulation was revealed last month by the Israel Securities Authority. Many more are said to be under investigation. The unfolding of what is potentially the biggest share manipulation scandal since the 1983 bank shares collapse has sent jitters across the stock market, which has plummeted this year. The worst affected stocks have been the smaller capitalised companies quoted on the Karam index, which are more easily subject to manipulation. Since the middle of January the Karam index - which had a powerful bull run last year  -has plunged about 27 per cent while the Mishtanim two sided index of the 100 heavily capitalised companies has fallen about 12.5 per cent. Mr David Rosenberg, a market analyst at Pacific Mediterranean Investments, said yesterday that in the short-term the investigation was having a marked downward effect on the market. However, he said the investigation would have a long-term benefit because 'it improves the credibility of the market. The key thing in any securities market is that traders feel they are operating on a level playing field. Enforcement by the Securities Authority will be especially good for foreign investors.' Israeli police said yesterday they had arrested four out of five leaders of anti-Arab groups wanted in a government crackdown on Jewish militants since the Hebron massacre, Reuter adds from Jerusalem.

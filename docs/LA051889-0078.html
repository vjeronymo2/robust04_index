			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MEDIA;  </P> <P> MURDOCH JOINS SPAIN INVESTORS IN TV VENTURE  </P> <P> Media magnate Rupert Murdoch has teamed up with Spanish investors to launch a  private television channel that may eventually beam programs to  Spanish-speaking audiences in the United States and South America.  </P> <P> Univision Canal Uno will be owned 25% by Grupo Zeta, the leading newspaper and  magazine publisher, and 25% by Murdoch's News International PLC, Zeta Chairman  Antonio Asensio told reporters Wednesday.  </P> <P> Asensio said Univision will have initial capital of $120 million and will  finance an array of films, sports, documentaries and news programs from  advertising revenue.  </P> <P> "In the future we hope to broadcast to Spanish-speaking audiences in the  Americas using Murdoch's satellites," he said.  </P> <P> The deal is Murdoch's second joint television venture in as many days. On  Tuesday, Murdoch's Sky Television satellite network joined with Robert  Maxwell's Cable TV network to take its four-channel Sky programs into 50,000  more British homes.  </P> <P> Murdoch made a last-minute entry into the Spanish broadcasting fray against  Italian media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi and French pay television channel  Canal-Plus. Both have separately joined Spanish investors to bid for three  private TV franchises.  </P> <P> Five consortiums have bid for the three national television franchises that the  Spanish government has put on the block. Madrid has until mid-August to choose  the winners.  </P> <P> Television broadcasting is limited to two nationwide state channels and five  regional stations, controlled by local governments.  </P> <P> Barcelona-based Grupo Zeta, publishing dailies and sensationalist magazines  such as best-selling weeklies Interviu and Tiempo, will be Murdoch's main  Spanish partner. Asensio said Zeta chose Murdoch over Tele-France 1, a leading  French private television channel that offered to present a joint bid with the  Spanish group.  </P> <P> Other leading investors include Madrid-based financier Jacques Hachuel, with  10%, and two leading Spanish banks, Banco Central and Banco Espanol de Credito.  Under controversial rules drawn up by Madrid, no single investor, Spanish or  foreign, can own more than 25% of a private channel.  </P></p>

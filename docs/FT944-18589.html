			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / First Choice falls out with German bank Relations between the British travel group First Choice Holidays and Germany's Westdeutsche Landesbank, which controls a 21 per cent stake in it, have been soured by a succession of cancelled strategy meetings and the failure of planned joint projects. Lazard Brothers, First Choice's financial adviser, is believed to be attempting to clarify the future of the relationship with Schroders, the merchant bank which is acting for Thomas Cook, itself 90 per cent owned by WestLB. Any attempt by the German bank to take control is likely to be resisted fiercely by First Choice. Thomas Cook's purchase of a 21 per cent stake helped First Choice - then called Owners Abroad - to fight off a hostile takeover bid last year from Airtours, a rival tour operator. Owners Abroad's management said at the time that the relationship would enable it to make substantial cost savings. These would be achieved through co-operation between Owners Abroad and LTU, the German travel company, in which WestLB had a 34 per cent stake. Owners Abroad said co-operation with LTU would allow it to cut costs through shared aircraft maintenance, fuel buying and spares purchasing. Owners Abroad said the link would also give it greater buying power in booking holiday accommodation. Owners Abroad said the tie-up with Thomas Cook would enable it to increase its sales through the latter's retail outlets. After successfully repelling the Airtours bid, however, Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad's chairman, and Mr Roger Allard, the managing director, resigned after disclosing that full-year profits would be only half of market expectations. The Takeover Panel later cleared them of misleading shareholders. Mr Michael Julien replaced Mr Klein as chairman last year. Mr Francis Baron was appointed chief executive. In August, they announced that they were changing the name of the group to First Choice. Travel industry observers say the new leadership at First Choice has been unable to establish a harmonious relationship with WestLB. It is understood that scheduled quarterly strategy meetings between the two sides have been cancelled by the Germans. Few of the planned benefits of the link between First Choice and LTU have been realised. Relations between First Choice and Thomas Cook have been warmer. Mr Christopher Rodrigues, Thomas Cook's chief executive, sits on the First Choice board. Industry observers believe, however, that the tie with Thomas Cook has hampered First Choice's efforts to sell holidays though other travel agents. First Choice is believed to have spent months repairing relations with Lunn Poly, Britain's largest travel retailer, after it expressed concern about the Thomas Cook link.</p>

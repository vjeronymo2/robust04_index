			<p>BFN     [Text] Guyanese President Cheddi Jagan expressed concern  over increased drug trafficking in Guyana and said that he was  visiting Colombia with a high-raking police official who has  been entrusted with learning how to fight this scourge.    "We are a little scared about the growing threat of drug  trafficking through Guyana, especially cocaine, which probably  comes from Colombia through Venezuela," Jagan said today. He is  on the last day of his visit.    Jagan yesterday signed with President Cesar Gaviria a joint  declaration agreeing to establish an official, private  binational council to develop various aspects of the  relationship.    The Guyanese president yesterday visited the Cementos del  Caribe cement factory on the Atlantic Coast and the sugar  industry in Valle Department. Guyana is interested in both  products.</p>

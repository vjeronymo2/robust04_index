			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> INFANT RESPIRATORY DRUG OKD  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration today approved a drug, Exosurf Neonatal, that  could help save thousands of premature infants born with immature lungs.  </P> <P> The drug, a powder mixed with sterile water, substitutes for a naturally  occurring foam that coats the inside of the lungs and keeps them from  collapsing when the infant exhales.  </P> <P> The infants receive the drug through a tube into their windpipes. They must be  on a mechanical ventilator to receive it.  </P> <P> About 250,000 infants are born prematurely each year in the United States.  One-fifth of them have respiratory distress syndrome, or breathing  difficulties, resulting from immature lungs. The problem is fatal in about  5,000 cases a year.  </P> <P> That makes respiratory distress syndrome the leading cause of death and  disability among premature infants, the FDA said.  </P></p>

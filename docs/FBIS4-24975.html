			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kerry Wong] </F>   [Text] China arms maker North Industries Corporation  (NORINCO) has set up a fund to be listed on the Irish Stock  Exchange to raise US$170 million (about HK$1.326 billion) [Hong  Kong dollars]. NORINCO is a wholly-owned subsidiary of China's  defence ministry, which has a number of investments that have  been transformed from military applications to manufacturing  civilian products. None of the money raised will be used for  military purposes.    The closed-end fund is being placed to both local and  European institutions and is due to list in Ireland next month.  NORINCO will issue 16.5 million units at US$10.30 (about  HK$79.50) each. H.G. Asia will act as arranger of the issue.  The proceeds from the issue will be used for joint ventures  under NORINCO. The corporation has a number of joint ventures  and subsidiaries, mainly industrial projects, such as the  manufacture of motorcycles and optical equipment.    One of its subsidiaries, Jialing Motorcycle Plant based in  Sichuan province, is a well-established motorcycle manufacturer  on the mainland. Other industries include optical equipment  manufacturing, with technology that was originally applied for  military use, such as in the production of telescopes and glass  for aircraft.    NORINCO will be carrying out fund-raising exercises in  phases. This is the initial phase, to raise US$170 million to  invest in enterprises engaged in the manufacture of cars. A  further fund-raising exercise is expected in the next couple of  years. NORINCO, which is directly under the State Council,  comprises 157 state-owned industrial enterprises with fixed  assets of 60 billion yuan (about HK$52.8 billion).    The corporation has been very active in car manufacturing  and  related industries. Last year, NORINCO signed a joint-venture  agreement with Hong Kong-based financial services and investment  company Pacific Group to set up car parts factories on the  mainland. They comprise three plants in Changchun, northeast  China, and eight in Chongqing, Sichuan province, which between  them produce brakes, clutches, starters, transmissions,  universal joints and other parts.    Merchant bankers said that there had been many fund-raising  activities by mainland companies in the last 12 months. These  funds may attract overseas investors as the demand still exceeds  supply. However, more Chinese enterprises are seeking funds to  finance their development and expansion, and the Chinese  Government placed controls on credit to curb inflation in the  middle of last year.    Given that it was almost impossible to borrow from banks,  many borrowers had to pay very high interest rates of between 20  and 30 per cent to get short-term funds, he said. [as published]  Apart from paying higher costs, however, these borrowers could  only temporarily ease their cash crunch, he added.    With more mainland enterprises seeking funds overseas, there  will be a large number of China projects available on the  market. "Investors tend to buy selectively on quality projects,  so China concept stocks may not be guaranteed a warm reception  now," he said. "The time spent on listing work is shorter and  easier, and the listing costs are cheaper in Ireland," said a  European fund manager.    The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong requires companies to  possess  a three-year track record and a minimum market capitalisation of  $50 million. There is a current proposal to raise  capitalisation requirements to $400 million.</p>

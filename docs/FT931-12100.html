			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Drink: For bottled beer, British is best FOR WINE drinkers, certain grape varieties become fashionable for a year or two, then fall from grace; while brands of spirits are favoured by drinkers who would be hard-pressed to tell you why. It is all to do with marketing - and beer is the most fashion-conscious of the lot. Take imported bottled beers. It is possible to draw up a sort of Chinese horoscope based on what has been the fashionable beer of the year. In 1992, American bottled lagers made great headway in the UK, although most are irredeemably dull. In 1991, it was Mexican beers with a wedge of lime (drunk, of course, from the bottle), while 1990 was the year of Japanese 'dry'. As for 1989, I seem to recall it was San Miguel. Whichever they were, though, we can be quite certain of one thing: flavour was unimportant. Last summer, I lived through a German heat-wave. So, I thought I would try out Weizen, or wheat beers. These sometimes are drunk in Germany with a slice of lemon but I cannot see why, as all of them have a strong lemony taste to start with. The best are the hefeweizen, which undergo a second fermentation in bottle with added yeasts; thus, the beer is cloudy and full of flavour. Comparing the hefeweizen available in Berlin, I found the best were Maisels from Bayreuth and Scherdel, although Thurn und Taxis was nearly as good. I have not seen any of these in Britain but I am sure they could take the market by storm. Spurred by all this, the Weekend FT decided to taste some of the bottled beers on sale in Britain. Apart from one made in London (which actually topped the league), and one from Scotland, all were imported. The tasters were myself; Iain Loe, from the Campaign for Real Ale; and Max Wilkinson, editor of the Weekend FT. The beers were scored out of 20 and are listed in descending order. 1: Very Special Christmas Ale (England), 16 points. This one English beer beat all comers. 'Excellent in its way,' said Wilkinson. 'Needs to be drunk at the end of a meal,' warned Loe, referring to its 8.9 per cent alcohol - stronger than many German wines. Equal 2: Hoegaarden White (Germany) and Liberty Ale (California), 15.6. The Hoegaarden is not quite a Weizen as it has less than 50 per cent wheat. On the other hand, it contains coriander and curacao and comes out slightly cloudy. There was considerable enthusiasm for this beer and its spicy bouquet, which sells from Whitbread pubs. The Liberty has a markedly fruity, hoppy character. 4: Brigand (Belgium), 15.3. This Belgian beer, with nine per cent alcohol, comes in a 75 cl bottle with a champagne cork. It has a lemony taste, which Loe put down to the yeast. Wilkinson called it 'rather nice'. 5: Alpirsbacher Hefeweizen (Germany), 14.8. Our first hefeweizen. I did not think it was quite up to my favourites in Germany and it seemed a little bright for the type. But Wilkinson thought it 'jolly good beer, almost the best here'. Equal 6: Coopers Sparkling Ale (Australia) and Regal Christmas (Belgium), 14.6. Coopers, from South Australia, has been a personal favourite since I first tasted it on High Eden Ridge near Adelaide. It is sold by Oddbins for 99p. The Regal is a strong Christmas ale the colour of cafe au lait and smelling of baked bananas, with nine per cent alcohol. 8: Chimay Red Label (Belgium), 14.3. Loe pointed out that this was the weakest of the Chimay beers, with seven degrees. A special yeast is used to give it its considerable character. 9: Traquair House Ale (Scotland), 13.6. This is made in the oldest house north of the border. It is a deep amber ale with 'great charm'. 10: Erdinger Dunkel (Germany), 13.3. A generation ago, Bavarians drank these dark malt lagers in preference to bright beers. The team admired its character and markedly hoppy finish. 11: Grolsch Bok (Holland), 13.0. This is the autumn 'Bock' version of the famous Grolsch - spelled 'Bok' in Dutch. Beer of this sort is brewed with extra strength for the onset of winter. The result is rather sweet: something to steel your limbs before going out to work in the fields. 12: Singha (Thailand), 12.8. This beer is surprisingly full of flavour and proved one of Loe's favourites. Wilkinson found it 'too bitter' and lacking in aroma. 13: Zambezi (Zimbabwe), 12.1. Again, this came as a surprise. A lager with real character. 14: Ostravar (Moravia), 11.6. A pilsner type. I was not keen, but Loe praised the after-taste and Wilkinson liked the 'agreeable bitterness'. 15: Kriek (Belgium), 11.3. This beer is called 'Mort Subite' (sudden death) and is made with spontaneous yeasts and macerated cherries. I liked it, but Loe detected added sugar and Wilkinson thought it no more than a curiosity. 16: Stella 'Dry' (Belgium), 10.8. Mixed views again on this Belgian-brewed Stella. Wilkinson liked it, Loe and I dissented. 17: Heineken Export (Holland), 10.6. The votes went the other way round for this Dutch-brewed Heineken. I liked a gentle whiff of honey. The other beers failed to make half-marks. We thought the Kaltenberg Pils would be better brewed in Bavaria, rather than our Whitbread-brewed sample. Tiger from Singapore, Cascade from Tasmania, a UK-brewed Stella and a San Miguel look-alike from Spain called (appropriately enough) Damm all seemed to lack character. The feeling among the tasters was that these brews were best drunk when it was very hot and you were too thirsty to notice. A Jamaican beer called Kalik smelled of manure. Having said that, it will almost certainly become this year's fashionable sensation. The speciality beers are available from the Beer Shop, 8 Pitfield Street, London N1 (tel: 071-739-3701) and Grogblossom, 66 Notting Hill Gate, London W11 and branches (tel: 071-792-3834). A number of gift boxes are available by mail order.</p>

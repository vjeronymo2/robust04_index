			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: BP finds will lift reserves by 600m barrels British Petroleum will add 600m barrels to its oil reserves from discoveries and appraisals completed this year, Mr David Simon, group chief executive, said yesterday. Mr Simon said the new reserves of oil and gas equivalent would more than offset this year's production of 540m barrels which compares with last year when BP only replaced 78 per cent of its production. A company's ability to replace its reserves is a key measure by which the stock market judges oil companies and BP has replaced only 80 per cent of its reserves on average over the past three years. Mr Simon said the new reserves would include an initial 225m barrels from the Cusiana field in Colombia and 115m barrels from improved recovery from fields in Alaska. The Cusiana find is important for BP which said yesterday that development plans were progressing well. Work on the first phase of full-scale production is expected to begin next year with output increasing to 150,000 barrels a day by 1995.</p>

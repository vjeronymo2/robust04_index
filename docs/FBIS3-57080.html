The Chairman of the Russian State Duma Believes:  `Black October' Must Not Happen Again. Ivan Petrovich Does Not  Intend Quarrelling with Boris Nikolayevich and Hopes for  Reciprocity"]    [Text] Ivan Rybkin, the chairman of the Russian State  Duma, is inaccessible to the majority of journalists for the  simple reason that they are not allowed into the hall of  sessions, so it is very fortunate that he is my neighbor -- the  windows of our buildings face one another. It seemed to me that  this was reason enough to meet one evening, have a drink, and  have a neighborly chat. Especially since Ivan Petrovich did not  object but only asked that we restrict ourselves to tea.  Therefore, when I went to visit him at his home I did not take  any champagne with me but took instead a jar of cherry jam.    The State Duma speaker met me in the entrance hall and  appropriately enough was wearing carpet slippers. When he had  brewed some strong, aromatic tea himself (it was late and his  domestics were already in bed) and poured some jam into the  dishes, I made the somewhat unfortunate gaff of saying rather  inopportunely that the last time I had met with a speaker was  also at night -- in the White House at the end of September.  Generally speaking we have not had much luck with speakers....    [Rybkin] Indeed, neither Lukyanov nor Khasbulatov had an  enviable fate. But as for my fears about my own future and  drawing parallels with my predecessors.... I can say only one  thing: In those parts where I was born -- the Khoper region --  they respect somewhat different qualities in people.  Consequently, when sitting in the chair of the leader of the  State Duma, I do not feel timid and certainly have no fears for  my career.    [Gamov] Ivan Petrovich, is it true that the Duma members  intend creating a special deputies' commission to investigate  the events of September and October?    [Rybkin] Let us not dodge the issue here -- clearly some  deputies do have that intention and with good reason. It was  Talleyrand who said: "In a revolution no one is innocent.  Everyone is guilty!" If it were up to me alone I would grant an  amnesty to the participants in the events of August 1991 and  September-October 1993. With the exception of those who  committed flagrant crimes. That would be a necessary  prerequisite for civil peace and accord, things which are very  necessary to Russia now.    Society suffered a very serious blow after the October  events, and so did parliamentarianism. In these conditions the  State Duma and the Federation Council simply must cooperate as  closely as possible with both the president and the government.  I personally am firmly in favor of that. After all, we were  elected not for our own sakes or for some ambitions that we may  have but so as to establish stability, calm, and order in the  country at last.    [Gamov] But how do you intend forming relations with the  upper chamber? People are already describing the State Duma and  the Federation Council as polar opposites....    [Rybkin] As of the present moment -- Vladimir Filippovich  Shumeyko and I have already spoken about this -- there are no  insuperable obstacles between the State Duma and the Federation  Council. In both chambers there are people from the same places  with similar habits and outlooks. Their views, opinions, and  convictions easily coincide with one another and I hope that  they will adapt just as easily to the kind of professional draft  laws that Russia urgently needs today.    Shumeyko and I also discussed the possibility of close  cooperation between deputies from the two chambers on questions  affecting the set of draft laws on the economy. Today the  legislative base is lagging behind events in the economy. For a  very long time we criticized industrialists for the fact that  they forgot which words are associated with the noun "industry"  -- earning a living, perhaps? Now they understand those words  -- but in what sense? Billions of dollars are still flowing out  of the country. Some people suggest resorting to tough  administrative measures to prevent that. But I think that first  of all we must give our industrialists an economic incentive to  keep their money in Russia so that it can work for the good of  the country. Although in those places where there is flagrant  theft going it is necessary to use authority, of course.    Generally speaking I support a strong authority in Russia.  But in my view that can only be achieved when all the branches  of power are working in conditions of mutual support. Even  those who consider themselves political opponents cannot live  without each other today. The time for a Russian version of the  Moncloa pact -- the pact which once dragged Spain out of the  most dire crisis and transformed it into a prosperous country --  passed long ago. In Volgograd we once managed to work out that  kind of agreement. KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA wrote about that, by the  way -- that pact of local significance is still operating there  today. But it was difficult to do that on a Russia-wide scale  -- the ability and desire were lacking. But I believe that all  is not yet lost.    There is a simple piece of what I would call peasant  philosophy which I find encouraging. It runs like this: Where  there is harmony there is prosperity, too. I know that the  overwhelming majority of members of the State Duma and the  Federation Council feel the same way.    [Gamov] Listening to you talk it sounds as though the  speaker's chair is the domain not of higher education professors  but of peasants from the land....    [Rybkin] It is best to ask Khasbulatov himself why things  did not work out for him in parliament. Especially since I do  not want to portray myself as a simple peasant. Our present  parliamentarians and leaders of the State Duma and Federal  Assembly have experienced something which neither the deputies  of the former parliament nor its speaker had experience of -- I  mean "Black October." I believe that it was a painful  experience for the president and the government, too. The  events which unfolded last fall are a grave warning to us all.  If we draw the correct conclusions from all that happened we  will of course benefit greatly. We are simply fated to achieve  accord!    [Gamov] You know, Ivan Petrovich, that I have attended  sessions of the Duma, I compared it with the previous Supreme  Soviet and it seemed to me that elements of buffoonery are  appearing in the Russian parliamentary system...    [Rybkin] That also worries and alarms me. But in the  present situation this is inevitable. Deputies are seeking to  make a statement about themselves, they are anxious and that is  why there is a somewhat tense atmosphere and a certain  eccentricity here.... But do not forget that in the old Supreme  Soviet there were 252 people working with 126 people holding  sessions in each of the chambers, whereas now there are 450  deputies. By the old standards that is a whole congress! And  trying to make this mechanism work efficiently and smoothly from  the very outset is very difficult.    Incidentally, I would like to make use of this occasion to  tell the representatives of the Russian and foreign mass media  not to take offense at us. We are not allowing Duma sessions to  be filmed at present and certainly not to be broadcast live  because we have the usual routine work to get through, the  running-in period, as it were. This is hardly of interest to  the outside observer. But I hope that this will not take long.  The factions and committees are beginning work....    [Gamov] But what then?    [Rybkin] Our program of legislative activity is very  extensive. The Russian President's Legislative Proposals  Commission and our deputies' commissions have worked hard to  draw it up and many Duma members came to Moscow with a whole set  of drafts and proposals. All these things are being processed  and considered.    Incidentally, I would like to warn people that it is  certainly not the frenzied activity of sessions in the Duma that  will decide the fate of draft laws. Factions and committees are  the main structural units of lawmaking, this is where we intend  to do the main "fine-tuning" work on documents. In this regard  our fundamental premise is that the factions express the  intentions of certain groups of voters and the ideas of  coordinating the interests of all strata of the population will  be implemented through them. But the Duma will have to meet in  session four to five hours a couple of times a week to adopt the  final decisions.    If you look at it closely you will see that we do not have  all that much time.    [Gamov] Indeed....    [Rybkin] The first month of our term as deputies is already  over, if you discount the three months spent on the new election  campaign at the end of the term that leaves us with 12 months.  Our task is to make the maximum use of that time so as to  highlight those top-quality draft laws which relate first and  foremost to the development of the economy. We must restore its  manageability as soon as possible and at the very least  neutralize the worst consequences of the crisis.    [Gamov] Do you also intend trying to influence the president  and the government as the Supreme Soviet tried to do?    [Rybkin] The situation in society is difficult, there is a  major social differentiation in progress: People have divided  into the very rich and the very poor, one-half of the country's  population is below the poverty line and around 10 percent are  in desperate conditions.    The president is right when he says that it was dire  necessity above all which brought people out into the streets in  the fall. We must remember that. Taking all this into account,  of course, we intend to influence the formation of the  government, its line of conduct, and the process of implementing  the economic program -- but within the framework of the  Constitution, nowhere else. I believe that far more significant  influence can be achieved through mutual understanding. After  all, if people insult one another and order each other about  there will be no progress.    The most important thing is not to cross the line where  opposition turns into enmity and opponents into enemies, when  people forget the reason why they began the argument in the  first place. That is the most dangerous thing.</p>

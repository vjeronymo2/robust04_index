			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Borrowing technology from the space program, a new computerized, implanted  insulin pump controlled by radio signals and computer chips appears to help  some diabetics avoid daily insulin injections, researchers reported. The hockey  puck-sized device is "a significant advance," said Dr. Christopher D. Saudek of  Johns Hopkins University, who helped test the device. Researchers said they  plan to test a slightly modified version before seeking Food and Drug  Administration approval, and noted it could be years away from becoming  commercially available. The pump was tested on 18 diabetics. Doctors said it  generally worked well, although four of the devices became blocked when tissue  grew over the catheter that releases the insulin. One also malfunctioned  because of a faulty microchip.  </P></p>

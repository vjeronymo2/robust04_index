			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> LOVE, LETTERS ENTWINED IN AFFAIRS OF THE HEART  </P> <P> A young man and a young woman unwittingly hire the same middle-aged scrivener  to write love letters to each other in Gabriel Garcia Marquez's "Letters From  the Park" (at 9 tonight on Channels 28, 15 and 24, in Spanish with English  subtitles).  </P> <P> The setting is Matanzas, Cuba, in 1913 -- an idyllic place for a love story, at  least when seen through the eyes of Cuban director Tomas Gutierrez Alea. But  not everything goes according to plan. The lovers like each other's letters  more than they like each other. And the letter writer himself (Victor LaPlace)  falls for the young woman (Ivonne Lopez) -- or at least with the idea of  falling for her.  </P> <P> Shades of "Cyrano de Bergerac." But this intermediary is no dashing leader of  men, but rather a melancholic widower who occasionally takes comfort in the  arms of a golden-hearted prostitute.  </P> <P> The story was inspired by a brief mention in Garcia Marquez's "Love in the Time  of Cholera," but the Nobel laureate created new characters to flesh out this  film, which he co-wrote with Eliseo Alberto Diego and director Alea (who is  best known for "Memories of Underdevelopment" and "Death of a Bureaucrat").  </P> <P> Concurrent with the human romance is an affair between the young man (Miquel  Paneque) and flying. He is clumsily trying to learn how to pilot a balloon, and  his efforts not only distract him from the would-be love of his life, but they  also expand the scenic dimensions of the film. Still, the essential spareness  of the story isn't violated. The performances are carefully understated --  which helps turn up the eroticism of the final scene.  </P> <P> The script doesn't hint at the "magical realism" for which Garcia Marquez is  widely known. It's simply a graceful and civilized film about the importance of  experiencing affairs of the heart firsthand.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> MORE WASPS IN THE IVY;  </P> <P> THE LADY OF SITUATIONS BY LOUIS AUCHINCLOSS (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $20.95; 275 PP.;  0-395-54411-4)  </P> <P> Stephen Hill, he of the "romantic good looks, with very pale skin and lustrous  raven hair" and "moist brown eyes," was having a discussion with his siblings  about his mother's love for his father.  </P> <P> "And looking at his sisters, he wondered if indeed any woman was capable of a  great passion. Was that why Averhill had seemed to him such a citadel of  romantic feeling? Precisely because it was a male monastery?"  </P> <P> Such is the stuff of "The Lady of Situations," another in the long line of  boys'-prep-school-as-male-monastery stories brought to us by the popular  author, Louis Auchincloss.  </P> <P> This saga is a romantic yarn set in the '30s and '40s about a socially striving  poor girl, Natica Chauncey, who grows up on the wrong side of a rich New  England community and sets her angry sights on conquering the white-columned  Averhill boys school in order to retrieve her Depression-ruined family  reputation.  </P> <P> It's the kind of upper-crust scenario that has made Auchincloss a minor icon  among prolific fiction writers, a man lionized at New York social functions for  his 40-odd works that often are set on the shelf next to Wharton, Marquand and  O'Hara.  </P> <P> One should pay attention to a new Auchincloss, for he has proved his literary  merit in the past. But "The Lady of Situations" is still another portrait of  the basically unsullied WASP world where its author (a Groton and Yale  graduate) chooses to linger. It is an arcane universe where the worst that  happens is a bit of polite adultery rocking the walls of the "monastery," plus  some milder breaches of honor.  </P> <P> Characters speak operatically. Aunt Ruth, for example, describes how a group of  mean boys are treating dear little Natica in the dining room at a fancy party:  "I had a horrid fantasy that I should soon be hearing, as in the second act of  Tosca, the cries from the offstage torture chamber." You get the picture.  </P> <P> Even if one embraced the fashion these days for non-involved "fun reading," and  decided to stretch out by the fire to engage in mindless pleasure, it simply  cannot be ignored that this kind of work is shockingly outpaced by some truly  intriguing current social essayists.  </P> <P> If you must look at upper-class private-school life, wouldn't you turn to  film-maker Whit Stillman's new portrait of Park Avenue preppies in  "Metropolitan"? Or watch "Dead Poet's Society" again?  </P> <P> Or pick up Robert Sam Anson's riveting nonfiction look at the racial horrors at  Andover? Or, for an earlier setting, re-read John Gunther's moving story about  headmaster Frank Boyden and life at Deerfield Academy, the graceful "Death Be  Not Proud"?  </P> <P> There's something vainglorious about struggling to keep the traditional novel  of manners alive in the style of William Dean Howells or Henry James at a time  when men's clubs and men's schools and ladies' clubs and schools are co-ed and  diverse, making prissy Turn-of-the-Century manners so uninteresting. With  ethical and moral struggles presented by AIDS, drugs, racial tensions and  modern greed, more vivid tales are available.  </P> <P> If Howells were alive today, he would be down at some public high school in the  South Bronx trying to beat Tom Wolfe out of the real story.  </P> <P> It is no doubt Auchincloss' fond hope that his work bridges time and that his  treatments of love, sex, religion, philosophy and the struggle to hold a moral  standard against the pressures of modernity holds up as a contemporary morality  play. Indeed, he pretty much managed this Jamesian feat once, in his 1964 work,  "The Rector of Justin." But, in "The Lady of Situations," a startlingly similar  story, he did not.  </P> <P> The books have virtually the same story line. The hero in the first (Brian  Aspinwall) enters life on the prep school campus (Justin), idolizes the  headmaster (the rector) only to doubt him and consequently resolve his doubt by  returning to school and the glorious chore of writing his hero's biography.  </P> <P> In "The Lady of Situations," our heroine marries into life on the campus of a  prep school she idealizes, becomes disenchanted, leaves, becomes a lawyer with  a rich husband and then sends her children to the fancy prep school, thus  demonstrating to the world her glorious end. In "Rector," there was the central  character of a headmaster, Frank Prescott. "Lady" is built around the dominant,  legendary headmaster, Rufus Lockwood.  </P> <P> In each, there are young and virtuous teaching masters. Each has at least one  beautiful, willful young woman who is smarter than the men to whom she is  subservient, a fact silently recognized by the aforementioned all-seeing Head.  </P> <P> Both books are structured as memoirs: "Rector" the shuffled journals of Brian  and "Lady" the memoirs of dear and hearty Aunt Ruth.  </P> <P> Disavow yourself of the notion that this "Lady's" version is differentiated in  any significant way by its attempts to spotlight women. While the heroine does  magically become a lawyer virtually overnight in the late 1940s, and does  subsequently find herself preparing the brief for a case involving separate but  equal schools, this is no feminist work. Natica Chauncey sees herself as a  Bronte sister, "without the moors and without the genius." She is clever in  that standard all-women-are-connivers way. Like other females in the book, she  marries her way to the top, which takes her three tries.  </P> <P> The other female characters hardly fill out the picture. There are the  requisite eccentrics, old bats with pretensions, like Estelle Knight, who would  have been "the divine Sarah" had she had a choice but writes poetry and  smuggles jewels instead.  </P> <P> Basically, "Lady" is another male-monastery book, and one cannot help wondering  about the repetition of "Rector," which was a complex, subtle and well-written  variation on the theme. The answer perhaps can be found back in the earlier  work, where Cordelia, the rector's daughter, wonders why Brian Aspinwall would  take the time to write a book about his headmaster. She refers Brian to her  shrink: "Perhaps you have what Dr. Klaus calls 'Peter Panic.' You want to be a  schoolboy again."  </P></p>

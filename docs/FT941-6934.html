			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Arts: 'Ariodante' updated The presence of Dame Janet Baker in the audience was a reminder of how Handel's public has widened since she made a name for herself singing his operas with specialist groups. Hardly a company wants to be without one of two of Handel's more famous operas, even if they rarely become a regular fixture. It is helpful to keep an eye on economy, if a production is unlikely to be revived often. Welsh National Opera is presenting Ariodante in a co-production with ENO, which should represent a small saving for two companies in need of a big financial boost. When David Alden's modern vision of the opera was first seen in London, it predictably caused a controversy, which no doubt helped sell a few extra seats. In Cardiff it looks stylish, colourful, well tailored to the size of the theatre. A baroque ceiling adorned with cherubs looks down on the stage, but the events that unfold below belong to the modern world. Alden wants to take Handel's 18th-century structure and fill it with the concerns and emotions of the 1990s until it is fit to burst - a process that he cannot resist following through to its explosive conclusion. Flunkeys set a table in slow motion; reptilian armed men stalk their prey; inmates from one of Hogarth's mad-houses creep around. Each group is a walking modern-opera cliche and does nothing to help understanding of the emotional issues, which Alden is well able to probe through his direction of the singers. After Orlando in Aix-en-Provence it was interesting to see Felicity Palmer again in an emotionally unbuttoned Handel production. Polinesso is a less interesting role, but the unabashed force of her performance is unmistakable. Altogether WNO has put together a creditable cast. There is a well contrasted pair of sopranos, Alwyn Mellor warmly lyrical in Ginevra's music of lament, Susannah Waters lighter and sharper of voice as Dalinda. Likewise the two tenors: Gregory Cross as the stronger Lurcanio, Philip Daggett the more sensitive Odoardo. Umberto Chiummo made a reliable King of Scotland. Decorations from all of them were inclined to be over-the-top. Otherwise musical matters were safe in the hands of conductor Marc Minkowski, who has only to get a bit more agreement on tempos from the WNO musicians. In Ariodante's showpiece arias Della Jones set a speed one notch slower than Minkowski had in mind, though still fast enough. For all her spirit not all the music shows this invigorating Handelian to best advantage these days ('Dopo notte', a favourite among Dame Janet's recordings, failed to clinch the evening). Where she did excel was in the deep feeling of 'Scherza infida', pensive, despairing, bitter, every word alive with meaning. This was one aria where WNO's decision to perform the opera in Italian was a bonus. New Theatre, Cardiff tonight; then on tour</p>

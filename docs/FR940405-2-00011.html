			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subsequent to publication of the notice of preliminary results, we discovered a few boxes labeled with the administrative proceeding number relevant to this case in an annex to the Department's Central Records storeroom. We notified the parties to the proceeding of our discovery and suspended the briefing and hearing schedule until the Department could thoroughly review all the documents contained in those boxes to determine which, if any, might be relevant to the instant period of review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The documents represented submissions from the original less than fair value (LTFV) investigation, and from the first and second administrative reviews. They contained information from other German producers as well as from Krupp. There were three computer tapes in the boxes. We were able to read two of the tapes which contained data relevant to the LTFV investigation. The third tape could not be formatted based on any of the formatting instructions provided in either the LTFV or first review questionnaire and supplemental responses, indicating that the tape did not pertain to the information contained in those responses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon its review of all of the documents found in the Central Records annex, the Department determined that the information either pertained to a different company, covered an irrelevant time period, or was not in a useable computer format for purposes of conducting a dumping analysis. On March 2, 1991, the Department contacted counsel for Krupp and counsel for the Petitioner to inform them of the results of our examination of the information. At that time a revised schedule was outlined to allow adequate time for comments and rebuttal comments. At the request of the respondent, we held a public hearing on April 14, 1992. The Department has now completed this administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of the Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Imports covered by the review are shipments of cold-rolled stainless steel sheet whether or not corrugated or crimped and whether or not pickled; not cut, not pressed and not stamped to non-rectangular shape; not coated or plated with metal, and under 0.1875 inch in thickness and over 12 inch in width.

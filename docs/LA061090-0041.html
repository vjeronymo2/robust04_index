			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESULTS OF PRIMARY ELECTION  </P> <P> When I was a child and went to the polls with my mother she always had to stand  in line to wait her turn to vote.  </P> <P> Now that I'm an adult things have certainly changed. I sail right into the  voting booth, I never have to wait.  </P> <P> Has some efficiency expert improved the voting process or is it that no one  shows up? I believe it's the latter.  </P> <P> JENNIFER BEMOWSKI  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

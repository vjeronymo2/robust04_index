			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Greek Government is satisfied with Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou's meeting with U.S. President Bill  Clinton at the White House. The prime minister described the  talks as especially useful. Tilemakhos Khitiris, the deputy  minister to the prime minister, said the visit was very  successful.    Athens News Agency reported today from Washington that  according to U.S. evaluations, the lengthy meeting of the U.S.  President with the prime minister gave the opportunity to the  two leaders to reconfirm the excellent bilateral relations and  analyze further the prospects of cooperation in light of the new  international conditions, particularly in the Balkans.    Washington is convinced--the U.S. President has made it  clear  to the prime minister--that the White House considers Greece the  most stable country in the region that can play an important and  leading role in the Balkans.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Kenyan President Daniel  T. arap Moi arrived here today after winding up his first two  days' state visit to China in Yunnan Province and Shenzhen,  Guangdong Province.    The president and his delegation, accompanied by Chen  Changben, chairman of the Chinese Reception Committee and  vice-minister of culture, were greeted at the airport by Wang  Changyi, assistant to Chinese foreign minister, senior officials  from other government departments and Beijing-based diplomats  from African countries.    Also arriving were other members of the delegation including  S.K. Musyoka, minister of foreign affairs and international  cooperation, J.J. Kamotho, minister of education, K. Kones,  minister of state in the president's office, and P.L. Lotodo,  minister of home affairs and national heritage.    President Moi arrived in Kunming Tuesday where he met with  local government officials and visited the ethnic minorities  village in Kunming and the Kunming pharmaceutical plant.    This morning, the president visited the industrial  exhibition  and the "miniature China" park in Shenzhen.

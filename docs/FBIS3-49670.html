			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Jan 12 (TANJUG) -- The Foreign Ministry of  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on Wednesday [12 January]  warned of an escalation of incidents on the Yugoslav-Albanian  border provoked by the Albanian side and in which the territory  of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has been violated. The  statement of the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry was published on the  latest incident which took place on January 10 and in which deep  in Yugoslav territory an Albanian citizen lost his life after  illegally crossing the border.    A similar incident occurred on January 3 when an Albanian  citizen was killed after he failed to respect the order of the  Yugoslav border patrol following an illegal crossing to Yugoslav  territory. The authorities in Belgrade accused Tirana of bearing  full responsibility for the incident. With the aim of realizing  its greater Albanian territorial aspirations towards the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia, the Albanian leadership in a calculated  manner incites illegal crossings of the Yugoslav-Albanian border  disregarding the safety of its own citizens, it was said in a  statement of the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry published on  Wednesday.    The statement assessed that the policy of the Albanian  government was being confirmed by the continual provoking of  border incidents. This policy is aimed at relativizing the  existence of the state border of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia, realizing greater Albanian pretensions and causing  tension and destabilization in the broader region of the  Balkans, the statement added. The Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia is strongly determined to energetically protect its  sovereignty and territorial integrity, it was underscored in the  statement which expressed Yugoslavia's readiness for development  of good-neighbourly relations with Albania.    The Yugoslav authorities have on a number of ocassions  warned  Tirana to strictly control its border and not permit illegal  crossings of Albanian citizens to Yugoslavia.</p>

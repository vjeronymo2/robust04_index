The courts would specialise in trademark and copyright violation cases. Since 1983 an array of courts in Shanghai hashandled more than 1,200 intellectual property rights cases. The number has risen in recent years as China moves to a market economy. The number of bank credit cards issued by China's four main banks will reach 7m by the end of this year, up from 4m today, the Economic Information Daily said, Reuter reports from Beijing. China's population last year grew at its slowest rate in more than three decades. Although the total population grew to nearly 1.2bn, the natural growth rate - the difference between the birth and death rates - was 11.45 per thousand, down from 11.60 in 1992, the Xinhua news agency said.</p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Observer: End of a family affair If Barclays' chairman, Sir John Quinton, has been told by his board of directors to give up his job, then the episode is more than a little ironic. He has done more than any of his predecessors to turn Barclays into a proper business, rather than a family-run bank, yet here he is being replaced by yet another member of one of the founding families. Sir John is already notably older than his two predecessors were when they stepped down. And while his time at the top has not been a great triumph, he hasn't acquitted himself any worse than the likes of Sir Timothy Bevan or Sir Anthony Tuke, the two previous chairmen, who got the job partly through their family connections. Indeed, Sir John's decision to step down from the board when he retires is admirable. It enables the new chairman to get on with the job without being second-guessed all the time by his predecessor. By contrast, when Sir John took over the Barclays' chair in 1987, he had to face across the boardroom table the two prior chairmen, the son of a previous chairman, plus three other members of the founding families. Apart from Sir John and Tom Fisher, another faithful retainer who kept the seat warm while the younger family members went to war, Barclays' chairmen have always been drawn from one of the founding families. There have been three Tukes, two Bevans, two Goodeneoughs, and one Barclay. It now sounds as if the Buxton end is going to be given a go. It is hard to imagine any other multinational institution which draws its chairmen from such a narrow family clique and with such consistency. It would not be so bad if they owned a large chunk of the equity. But Sir Timothy Bevan and Andrew Buxton, who make up the dwindling family presence on the board, own far fewer shares in total than Sir John Quinton.</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Arts: A mature achievers' gala - A multi-purpose arts centre with a difference 'THE FRIENDS of Raymond Kravis' sounds like the title of a Black Mask pulp thriller. Actually they are responsible for a different kind of fantasy, exposing the world to yet another multi-purpose arts centre, or rather Center. For the Kravis is in Palm Beach, Florida, which the Centre's managing director, Paul Beard, describes as 'frontier country for the arts'. And not smart Palm Beach, the narrow island where millionaires are vulgar and billionaires common, but West Palm Beach, on the mainland and very much the other side of the social tracks. It is even worse than that. With such a venture as the Kravis, a Dollars 55m investment, many deals needed to be made. One deal envisaged it as the centrepiece for an urban regeneration programme, rubbing a little of Palm Beach affluence into the West. A black shanty town was demolished. But then the developer's money ran out and the Kravis stands, like a marooned, cultural capsule stranded out of time, surrounded by scrub. There is also something other-worldly about the building. Architect Eberhard Zeidler has given it plenty of light and space, with vast public areas where the locals can indulge their favourite pastime - appraising each other. After too much reality, he lets them pass through to a traditional red-plush, 2,100 seat auditorium, which is something like a 1930's Odeon with Egyptian pretensions. But the Kravis is up and running. The friends of Raymond Kravis, a 91 year old retired Oklahoma oil man, put up Dollars 10m; the State of Florida and the County of Palm Beach found Dollars 17m between them; and the rest of the money just poured in from the locals, 15 of whom gave over Dollars 1m. It was a weird exercise. Most of the money comes from those fleeing the snow, who like to winter at Palm Beach during its short smart season. They were wooed by a Massachusetts electronics tycoon, Alex Dreyfoos, who is the driving force behind the project. His involvement was not totally altruistic, however. He found it difficult to tempt bright Boston men to work on his Florida interests because the place was a cultural desert. Dreyfoos, an arts lover, formed a local Arts Council and then mooted the idea of an arts centre. It was hard going. Then: 'I raised my sights. I said we were building a world class venue and wanted much more money. The rich responded to this larger budget. One man told me 'Alex, I know nothing about the arts but I don't want my children to say that''. Being Palm Beach the Kravis opened with a Dollars 1.5m gala, of which Dollars 500,000 went to the blossoming endowment fund and Dollars 1m towards recruiting a cast to match the audience - mature achievers. The star was undoubtedly Ella Fitzgerald. She is almost blind now; she is lame; she is wheeled to the centre of the stage where an audience, and almost 60 years of experience, jolted her into life. She still hits more beautifully rounded notes than any other popular singer; there is a poignancy to her performance of 'My ship has sailed' that is unmatchable. She was a brief interlude of grace amid the razzmatazz of Faith Prince, whose Miss Adelaide from Guys and Dolls is the current Broadway smash; the equally boisterous Isaac Stern, breezing his way through the Bruch violin sonata; Lily Tomlin, who performed her infuriatingly twee telephone operator party piece; and Leontyne Price, who can still belt out the Puccini. As galas go it went quite quickly, shooed along by the local boy made good, Burt Reynolds, who was laid back to the point of torpor. Many of the artists reappeared during the week in full flow. The Alvin Ailey Dance Theater may be in danger of severe stereotyping, as they wiggle and pout their way through the blues routine, shimmy and salaam in the gospel rousers and so on, but there remains a black intensity which holds the eyes. Leontyne Price beautifully scores - and almost as beautifully misses - in her well rounded recital of songs and arias, sounding better on the Handel than with American songs set to poems by Emily Dickinson, when her diction can be perverse. The Kravis was given its first major sound test by the Atlanta Symphony playing Beethoven under Yoel Levi. The acoustics were handled by Russell Johnson's company Artec, on a high after its success with concert halls in Dallas and Birmingham. The Kravis is rather dull in comparison. The sound hardly engulfs the audience, with the strings sounding better than the brass. Not that too many international orchestras will be playing the Kravis in the immediate future. The programming is sensible to the point of caution. During the winter months the rich transients get what they like - big names peddling memories: so welcome Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli, Julio Iglesias and Victor Borge. But in the summer things will be different. The Mayor of Palm Beach, Nancy Graham, is a great supporter of the arts. The Kravis will be used to bring a disparate community together. There have already been free performances for children and minority groups. The deserted High School across the road, Reynolds' Alma Mater, is planned to become Florida's School for the Performing Arts, feeding off the Kravis. Within five years the Kravis should be the nub of a new, mixed, neighbourhood, which looks to it for mental, cultural, and indeed spiritual, stimulation. At the very least the Kravis will anchor some of the local arts organisations - the Palm Beach Opera, Ballet Florida, the Florida Philharmonic - which will develop from this base. It will become an attractive magnet, along with new arts centres at nearby Fort Lauderdale and elsewhere in Florida, for touring international arts groups. Artistic director Judith Shepherd is moving slowly. For two years she will nurse her two suspicious audiences, the sceptical rich and the dubious poor, with an undemanding mix of the popular and the light classical. Then she will raise their cultural imaginations, adding more international orchestras and opera companies, and a late spring arts festival, which will build up to make the Kravis a force in the arts world. After the obstacles already overcome, it looks like a cakewalk.</p>

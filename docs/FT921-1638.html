			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / UK insurers may face liquidation PROVISIONAL liquidators are today expected to be appointed to two insurance companies under scrutiny by the Department of Trade and Industry for a series of financial transactions with companies connected to Mr Rupert Murdoch. It is believed partners from accountants Price Waterhouse will be be appointed by directors of Trinity Insurance and Bryanston Insurance, two companies owned by GFA International, a holding company controlled by Mr Grant Fowler, the Australian entrepreneur. The action comes as DTI officials consider a report from accountants Ernst &amp; Young submitted by the directors on the regulatory implications of a series of transactions since early 1990 totalling at least Pounds 20m. An official close to the investigation said yesterday these were 'not suitable or usual for an insurance company'. The report was commissioned by Mr John Winter, an accountant and company doctor brought in by directors of the two companies in January this year following the departure of Mr Fowler as chief executive. Mr Winter declined to comment yesterday, but the report is believed to document short-term loans worth Pounds 10m since 1990 to Trinity and Bryanston by Cruden Investments and Kayarem, two companies within the Murdoch family business empire which between them owned over 43 per cent of News Corporation at the end of the last financial year. It also shows outstanding loans of about Pounds 6m made in early 1990 by Trinity and Bryanston to Panfida, the Australia-based group which owned the Martin chain of newsagents and went into liquidation in January. News Corporation held a 29.9 per cent stake in Panfida and also made loans totalling Pounds 30m to Martin. The report highlights a further Pounds 4m in loans to offshore companies, most of which have been repaid. It says Mr Fowler is married to Penny Calvert-Jones, Mr Murdoch's niece. Trinity and Bryanston have become insolvent following large underwriting losses, a lack of investment income and high operating expenses. The directors of the two companies are seeking approval of creditors to propose a scheme of arrangement in the High Court under insolvency law. About 120 staff are expected to be made redundant.</p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLEMAN GETS 7-GAME SUSPENSION  </P> <P> Vince Coleman of the St. Louis Cardinals was suspended for seven games  Thursday, a day after he bumped umpire Ed Montague during an argument.  </P> <P> Coleman's suspension is effective today.  </P> <P> National League President Bill White also fined Coleman an undisclosed amount.  </P> <P> White ruled Coleman hit Montague in the nose with the bill of his batting  helmet and opened a cut as they argued face to face. Coleman continued to use  profanity and delayed Wednesday's game in San Francisco, White said.  </P> <P> The dispute began after Montague called out Coleman on a steal attempt in the  sixth inning. Coleman was ejected.  </P> <P> "I don't feel good about it," Coleman said. "If you look at it rationally, you  know I wasn't trying to butt him in the head.  </P> <P> "He reacted as if he wanted to fight. I think there should be a $500 fine for  the both of us and call it even," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Plan to keep two-tier Cornwall Cornwall County Council should remain intact when local government is reorganised, the Local Government Commission for England recommended yesterday. Its favourite option is to leave the two-tier system with a county council and six districts. As alternatives, it suggests one all-purpose authority for the county, or keeping the two-tier system but merging the districts into three.</p>

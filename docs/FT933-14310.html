			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Agencies exploit the secrets of 20m borrowers: The trade in credit references THE ASSERTION yesterday by Mr Eric Howe, the data protection registrar, that there is 'an established market' in personal financial information is on the face of it hardly controversial. Any applicant for a store credit card faces the disclosure of large amounts of personal data on the payment of just Pounds 1.41 by the store. This is the sum Infolink, one of the two largest credit reference agencies, charges its 10,000 users to examine a person's address, history of bankruptcy or arrears, and an array of information on how he or she has paid off other loans. Mr Howe's fiercest strictures yesterday were reserved for the apparent loophole in the law that allows a person holding the right codes to fool bank staff into disclosing account details. But this market is overshadowed by a larger and legitimate one - the market in credit references of about 20m borrowers, which is estimated to involve 100m inquiries a year. The market's buyers are banks and retail outlets offering credit - the sellers are the credit reference agencies. Tracing agents who specialise in debt collection and other private inquiries can also subscribe to this data. But the agencies insist that only those with appropriate licences can obtain financial data in addition to the standard public records such as county court judgments. The agencies - the largest are Infolink, CCN and Equifax - offer tiered access to data, and charge different amounts depending on the data disclosed: Infolink charges 53p per record for a check on 'black data' held against a person, including court judgments and bankrupcy rulings that indicate that a person is a very poor credit risk. This will also allow a check on whether the right address has been given. For Pounds 1.41, a user approved to receive credit data will get additional 'white data' on how the individual has handled other financial contracts. This will not include information such as bank account details and payment records unless the user has access to 'closed' data. Subscribers who have agreed to supply information such as payment records for their own credit card will receive detailed information from other subscribers' records. Mr Kevin Still, Infolink head of marketing, insists that the company constantly refines security to avoid hackers, or users gaining access to more data than they are allowed. 'By definition, any data system has to be very careful about unauthorised access,' he says. But the way credit reference agencies operate, and the use of customer data held by banks has led to a number of concerns. Two of these were raised yesterday by Mr Howe in his report, and are likely to remain controversial as banks review their code of practice for personal customers. First, Mr Howe questioned whether banks could legitimately supply 'white data' on how customers operate their accounts to credit reference agencies. Smaller banks such as Co-operative Bank supply such information in order to gain access to the closed 'user groups' in which sensitive data is held. Barclaycard has announced its intention to supply 'white data' to credit agencies about customers who give consent on application forms. Mr Howe says the argument that this is a legitimate exchange deal 'may be difficult to sustain' under the banking code. Mr Geoffrey Cooke, deputy director of the British Bankers' Association, says such disclosure 'accords with the code as it stands, but we are happy to discuss it'. Second, Mr Howe expressed concern about credit card numbers and bank account numbers being held by credit agencies on an individual's file. Mr Still says the possibility of misuse has already been eliminated by the credit agencies. Those with access to files which hold information about credit cards or bank accounts are only given basic details, without relevant numbers. No matter how secure and well-regulated are credit agencies' methods, the concerns raised by Mr Howe are likely to recur. And consumers may question whether there is a clear distinction between the black market trade in financial data, and the lawful trade done by agencies.</p>

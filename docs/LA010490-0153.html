			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW JURORS ASKED TO SOLVE SLAYING 'PUZZLE'  </P> <P> About four months after jurors deadlocked in the trial of a British national  accused of killing a family of four, a prosecutor today asked a new panel to  piece together a "jigsaw puzzle" of circumstantial evidence and convict the  man.  </P> <P> On Aug. 31, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury deadlocked 11 to 1 in favor of  convicting Harvey Rader on four counts of murder stemming from the Oct. 12,  1982, disappearance of the Saloman family of Northridge.  </P> <P> The bodies of Sol Saloman, his wife, Elaine, and their two children, Michalle,  15, and Mitchell, 9, have never been found.  </P> <P> Prosecutors contend that Rader, 49, a Reseda used-car dealer, killed the family  because of a business dispute with Sol Saloman, who owned a fire extinguisher  company. Rader, however, has steadfastly proclaimed his innocence.  </P></p>

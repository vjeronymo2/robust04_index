			<p>BFN     [Text] The ANC says that recommendations made by  international mediators in talks on possible amendments to the  constitution will not be binding. An ANC official who did not  want to be identified said the mediators would be here to  mediate, not to arbitrate. The mediators, including two former  foreign affairs ministers, Dr. Henry Kissinger of the United  States and Britain's Lord Carrington, are due to arrive in South  Africa this week. The ANC and IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] joint  working committee, which is meeting in Kempton Park today to  make final arrangements for international mediation, is expected  to meet the mediators later this week to suggest amendments to  the constitution.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] THE Karen National Union (KNU) will appoint a  five-man team to meet representatives of Burma's ruling State  Law and Order Restoration Council to discuss the possibility of  peace talks, a Karen guerrilla said yesterday.    "We are awaiting the Burmese junta's decision on whether to  meet with us, and on the place and the time of the meeting,"  said the guerrilla, who is a colonel.    However, the meeting should be held openly, he said. "The  meeting must be held outside the territory controlled by the  junta. If possible, it should be a neighboring country where the  mass media will be allowed to observe."    The Karen team will first sound out the Burmese junta on the  subjects to discuss at the peace talks. Initially, low-level  representatives from both sides could meet to prepare an agenda  for a meeting of higher-level officials, he said.    Gen. Bo Mya, the KNU's president will not take part in the  first talks.    Two months ago, the KNU appointed a team, headed by Brig.  Gen. Maung Maung, its joint secretary, to meet with Burmese  junta representatives. But a new team will be appointed when  the Burmese junta is ready for talks, he said.    The Karen colonel, who is a close aide of Gen. Bo Mya, said  the KNU regards the peace negotiations as very important to  settling its prolonged conflict with Rangoon.</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PUT PLUG ON WASTING OF WATER, AUTHORITY URGES  </P> <P> If you hosed off your back-yard deck or sidewalk this morning, members of the  San Diego County Water Authority forgive you. But, if you hose it off tomorrow  . . . well, shame on you.  </P> <P> Amid hoopla, flag-waving and a pledge by a contingent of Girl Scouts to  conserve water, Water Awareness Week officially kicked off Monday.  </P> <P> Although San Diego County has yet to face mandatory water rationing, as some of  its counterparts in Northern California have, water officials here are urging  residents to voluntarily cut back water use by 10% this week. Officials hope  the initial effort will become a habit.  </P> <P> The program, part of a statewide effort to inform the public about the scarcity  of water, runs through Sunday. On Saturday, residents will be asked to shut off  all water for one hour -- from 2 to 3 p.m. -- as a reminder of the need to  conserve.  </P> <P> Water officials don't want residents to stop showering or wash their dishes in  a bucket, but they do want people to curb water-wasting habits, said Dale  Mason, water authority chairman.  </P> <P> Mason said that, if residents don't curtail use now, they could find themselves  facing mandatory measures later.  </P> <P> Residents will be urged to stop running the water while brushing their teeth,  leaving the hose running while washing their cars and soaking their lawns when  not necessary.  </P> <P> Despite projections of an adequate water supply through summer, San Diego  County is far from certain to avoid a shortage, Mason said.  </P> <P> Water authority figures show that the average person uses about 110 gallons of  water a day at home. San Diego County imports about 90% of its water from the  Colorado River, via the Colorado River Aqueduct, and from Oroville, Calif.,  about 600 miles to the north via the California Aqueduct, Melton said.  </P> <P> "Without water, San Diego could return to its desert state that it once was,"  he said.  </P> <P> To help in the effort, a free water conservation kit is available by contacting  the County Water Authority. It includes a tip sheet on 25 ways to save water.  </P></p>

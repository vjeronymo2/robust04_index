			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by ``T.M.''] </F>   [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- The National Nuclear Energy  Commission (CNEN) has asked the United Nations for $500,000  (492.8 million cruzeiros) to construct a subterranean silo to  store the atomic waste produced by Angra-1 for the next 15  years, until the plant is dismantled.    This was confirmed on 7 April by Ayrton Cauby, the CNEN's  Licensing and Control superintendent. He indicated that the  United Nations has specific resources to help developing  countries like Brazil to resolve their atomic waste problems.    When dismantled, the plant itself will be stored in the  silo.  The atomic waste produced in the Rio de Janeiro-Sao Paulo axis  will also be stored there. The Angra-1 reactor will remain in  the Angra nuclear complex, wrapped in special layers of  concrete. Cauby reported that experts of the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- based in Vienna, Austria -- will  visit Brazil in May to help choose the site for the silo.    He said the CNEN also asked the IAEA for financial help. It  released $100,000 (98.5 million cruzeiros) for the initial work  that will be carried out in 1994 and 1995.    Cauby said the CNEN's top priority is to develop the  subterranean silo, which will not be constructed in Angra dos  Reis (RJ) [Rio de Janeiro State]. He said: ``IAEA experts and  technicians will choose the site for the silo to store the waste  produced in Sao Paulo.''</p>

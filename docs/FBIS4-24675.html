			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanjing, June 1 (XINHUA) -- Southern Jiangsu  Province, east China, has taken the lead in the country in  agricultural modernization.    Half of the output value created by farmers in the rural  areas has come from scientific upgrading.    Southern Jiangsu, in the Chang Jiang River delta, covers 12  counties and cities under the jurisdiction of the cities of  Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou. The gross domestic product in the  area has increased by 19.6 percent yearly since 1978, when China  started its rural reform featuring the contract responsibility  system with a family as the basic unit.    "Such a rate has exceeded the early economic development  stage of Japan and the Republic of Korea," a local official said.    According to international standards, southern Jiangsu has  entered the initial stage of modernization in agriculture, rural  industrialization and urbanization.    These 12 counties and cities have been listed by the central  government among the 100 counties in China with strong economic  power.    The official noted that the average living space per capita,  the expenditure on clothes, recreation and education and medical  care, and the life-span of the people in most of these counties  have surpassed the government-set quotas for a relatively  comfortable life in rural areas.    He attributed the rapid economic growth in these counties to  the popularization of science and technology.    A survey shows that more than 50,000 rural industrial  enterprises in southern Jiangsu Province have established  cooperative relations of various kinds with over 1,000 research  institutions, universities and colleges.    More than 10,000 scientists and technicians across the  country have settled down in these counties to help with  economic expansion.    "Such a huge project to invite so many highly-trained people  to work here was beyond the government's administrative  capacity," the official noted.    By now, every county or city in southern Jiangsu has set up  science development funds and agricultural development funds.    The annual amount of funds in science development allocated  by the county and township governments accounts for at least one  percent of the government's financial expenditure.    One example is Wuxi county, which spent 460 million yuan in  1992, 1.28 billion yuan last year and three billion yuan this  year on science and technology.    The county has contracted for 902 provincial and national  projects for the development of sciences and new products over  the past three years.    So far, southern rural Jiangsu has set up over 800  scientific  research institutions employing 200,000 scientists and  technicians.    These institutions turn out more than 2,000 new research  findings and products a year.    According to the official, the popularization of science and  technology has helped widen the general knowledge and skills of  rural laborers.    The nine-year compulsory education has been popularized in  the 12 counties, where at least 90 percent of the rural  industrial staff and workers have received technical training.    The official noted that a modern rural area with booming  economy, developed science, beautiful surroundings and socialist  civilization is being formed in southern Jiangsu Province.</p>

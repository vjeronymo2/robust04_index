The Japan Securities Dealers Association said the Shanghai  Stock Exchange will be designated as its 36th overseas bourse on  which Japanese investors will be allowed to trade in stocks.  The association said a formal decision on the matter will be  made at its executive session to be held next week.    The Chinese Government allows foreign individuals to sell or  buy designated issues on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which was  opened in 1990.    Shanghai authorities asked the association in January to  allow individual Japanese investors to participate in trading,  officials said. Shanghai will become the eighth stock exchange  in Asia to be designated by the association, the officials said.</p>

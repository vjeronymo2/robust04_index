			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Steven M. Gold, a 63-year-old West L.A. man, has filed a $1-million lawsuit,  claiming that while he was addicted to cocaine he was cheated out of his share  of a music production company by his ex-partner.  </P> <P> The name of the firm: Far Out Productions.  </P> <P> Two centers of movie-making in their respective countries -- L.A. and Giza,  Egypt -- are close to becoming sister cities. Visiting Giza Gov. Omar Abdel  Aakher, speaking through an interpreter, told the City Council he is optimistic  that such a relationship can soon be established.  </P> <P> L.A. has had an opening on its sister-city roster for 10 years now. It was  right after the Americans were taken hostage in Iran that L.A. disowned its  sister city of . . . Tehran.  </P> <P> First, demonstrators in Eastern European nations carry his big-earred visage  while declaring they want no "Mickey Mouse" government. Then a consumer group  demonstrating dangerous toys sets fire to a Mickey Mouse pillow at a Washington  conference. Heck of a birthday celebration to give the Hollywood-born rodent,  who turned 61 last Saturday.  </P> <P> Willie Sutton was once quoted as saying he robbed banks because that's where  the money is. The promoters of the Long Beach Auto Show are advertising eight  hours a day on the freeways 'cause that's where the cars are. Their vehicle is  a flatbed truck carrying a 24-foot-long sign. It's a mobile billboard, except,  of course, during rush-hour traffic jams.  </P> <P> If you want to have a really redundant experience, Sylvain Fribourg of Woodland  Hills points out that you could visit the La Brea Tar Pits ("the the Tar Tar  pits") and order a pizza pie.  </P> <P> The latter, Fribourg notes, translates as " 'pie pie,' or maybe 'pie squared.'  "  </P> <P> It's questionable whether Stanley or Livingstone could have found their way  from L.A.'s Hall of Records to its underground archives, where old court  documents are stored.  </P> <P> And that's even with the aid of a photocopy of hand-lettered directions  furnished to visitors by guards in the records lobby.  </P> <P> The tiny scrap of paper directs explorers to find an elevator and descend to  "B," where the adventure really starts.  </P> <P> Making the journey even more intriguing is the fact that the map once  instructed adventurers to follow the "blue" arrows through the shadowy  catacombs, but has been altered to say "red" arrows. Was white-out eraser fluid  from the office of the city treasurer used?  </P> <P> Great Moments in Doo Dah History, in honor of Sunday's edition of the  Tournament of Roses parody (or should that be, paradey?) in Pasadena:  </P> <P> "One year, we had a woman from Santa Barbara who was a cave woman in the  parade," recalls Doo Dah czar Peter Apanel.  </P> <P> "About six months later, she met her biological mother, who had given her up at  birth. And, by coincidence, it turns out the mother had been at the parade. And  she remembered seeing the cave woman. So, that means that the first time she  saw her daughter in 35 years, the daughter was swinging a bone and grunting and  carrying a dinosaur skeleton."  </P> <P> Far out.  </P></p>

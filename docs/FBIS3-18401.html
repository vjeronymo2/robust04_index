			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "G-7 Countries Call on Russia To </F> Accelerate Economic Reforms"; as released by Brussels Textline  database]    [Text] The slowness of the economic changes in Russia was  the main subject at a meeting in Kronberg, near Frankfurt, of  finance ministers and governors of central banks of the G-7 with  the Russian ministers for finance and the economy and the  governor of Russia's central bank, and representatives from the  IMF, the World Bank and the European Commission, represented by  its Vice-President Henning-Christophersen. In a report on the  debates by German Minister Theo Waigel, the Seven affirmed "with  insistence that energetic economic reform is the only path to  guarantee the advantages of a market economy." They stressed  their "concern over the lack of progress in stabilizing the  Russian economy." According to Mr. Waigel's text, the Russian  delegation assured them that the budgetary deficit would be  limited to around 5 percent of GNP in 1994 and that the monthly  price rises would be would be brought down to between 7 and 9  percent by the end of the year. The Seven said that they were  ready to unblock parts of the financial package of around $45  billion adopted last year but that the money which had not yet  been paid out could only be so "when all the conditions had been  met." The Seven however made some concessions to the Russians,  saying that they agreed with them in saying that special  attention had to be given to the consequences of the  transformation process. They believed that a credible social  accompanying program was required. The Seven are ready for a  "new wide recycling agreement" of the Russian debt "on the basis  of a program supported by the International Monetary Fund."  They recall that Russia's public creditors had granted it  further respite by extending by four months, until the end of  April, the recycling accord negotiated with the former USSR in  April 1993. After the meeting, Mr. Waigel told the press: "It  was a realistic discussion."    British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke added:  "We applied pressure on them over monetary policy." Mr.  Christophersen declared that the IMF which always called for  very strict reforms before releasing credits, could not make an  exemption for Russia. For his part, Mr. Alexander Chikhine,  Russian Minister for the Economy, said that the meeting with the  G-7 was a "specific moment", as it was the first one since the  Russian elections and the reshuffle of Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin's Government. The Kronberg meeting also served the  G-7 to make a relatively optimistic observation over the  situation in the world economy. This part of the talks was not  the subject of a communique. Italian Finance Minister Piero  Barucci said that the end of the recession was in sight, except  possibly in Germany. The Japanese ministers denied any  isolation of their country within the G-7. "Even if we did not  say so in the Communique, there was common agreement in  considering that fluctuations in parities are not desirable. We  confirmed that the G-7 would continue to cooperate," said  Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii. According to Mr. Hans  Tietemeyer, Bundesbank president, the monetary issues had not  led "controversy."    Recognizing that there "had practically been no discussion  on  currencies," Mr. Yasushi Mieno, Governor of the Bank of Japan,  considered that Japan's partners "understood that the strong  appreciation of the yen undermined the efforts the archipelago  is undertaking to assure economic recovery."</p>

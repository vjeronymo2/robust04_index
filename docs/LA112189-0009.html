			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISS MANNERS: YOUNG HOSTS HAVE DUTIES TO GUESTS  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS -- At some of our family holiday functions, there are  children -- including those of the host and hostess -- whose ages are similar  to my children's. Would you care to comment on the role that should be played  by these junior hosts and hostesses?  </P> <P> Is it reasonable of me to expect them to play a part in entertaining the other  junior guests? Is it appropriate for the children of the host and hostess to  leave the party, leaving the junior guests to stare at the wall while they go  off with friends they brought to what was supposed to be strictly a family  gathering, or sequester themselves in their rooms with stereos blaring while  the cousins make small talk with Aunt Bess and Uncle Homer?  </P> <P> Also, could you clarify the rules for seating arrangements at large family  dinners, where there is more than one table -- the second being used for the  dreaded dinner in the kitchen. Who is to be seated at the main table? Certainly  the patriarch and matriarch of the family. Host and hostess? Their offspring?  The oldest of each family, until capacity is reached, and then the rest seated  at the alternate site? The guests, even if it means seating their oldest son,  who is of voting age, with children in highchairs? This situation always brings  arguments and complaints.  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- Indeed, young people do have responsibilities as junior hosts  for guests of their age in their homes -- regardless of whether they invited  these people or even like them. They may offer activities as a  sub-entertainment while the adults are talking, or include these guests with  their own friends, but they cannot leave them to their own devices.  </P> <P> Miss Manners believes that your relatives are doing their children a sad  disservice by not using the occasions to train them in the ways of  consideration and hospitality. They will be anxious to know these techniques  when they are old enough to engage in business entertaining, Miss Manners  promises you. At that point, it will be harder for them to learn how to be  gracious to people they don't have much in common with.  </P> <P> For the very reason that the younger generation is supposed to play host to its  peers, the usual table division -- and precedence, when it comes to the dining  room over the kitchen -- is by age. (This may or may not correspond to  generations in the family.) Babies are excepted; it is well known that babies  who have trouble aiming their food into their mouths want to be near a  napkin-wielding parent.  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS -- I am enclosing a newspaper clipping in which the parents  of debutantes are listed as "John and Mary Doe," although the information was  sent in with the names as "Mr. and Mrs. John Doe." The columnist claimed that  her editor would not let her publish it that way.  </P> <P> Engagements, weddings and debutante presentations are about as formal as you  can get, and I have never seen such informal usage. Am I wrong? Has this become  the acceptable format?  </P> <P> If not, any suggestions as to how to correct this attitude would be most  appreciated, as it seems to be getting progressively worse.  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- Newspapers are as much caught as the rest of the society in  the turmoil resulting from the lack of standard usage for names. Miss Manners,  for one, can hardly wait until everybody settles down to one system of  nomenclature, whatever it is, so she can devote her attention to something more  challenging, such as rocking on the porch.  </P> <P> In the interests of standardizing at least their own usage, many papers have  made arbitrary decisions that are bound to offend at least some of their  readers. They would do well, in this period of transition, to follow Miss  Manners' rule of allowing people to call themselves what they like -- within  reason, of course.  </P> <P> An argument can be made that giving the parents' full names more nearly  fulfills the newspaper's job of providing full identities to their readers.  </P> <P> Miss Manners, who agrees with you that traditional social usage is best for  traditional formal occasions, would rather solve the problem by arguing that  such events, however delightful, are not really news and that one need not seek  or allow publicity to attend them.  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS -- I am angry at my sister-in-law because, when my mother  died, she did not extend condolences to me.  </P> <P> We are invited to her home for Thanksgiving. Since my family will be there with  me and possibly other guests, I am concerned about my behavior. If I act  naturally, which will be hostilely, I will appear to be cold and rude. I don't  want to remain at home, as that will upset my young son.  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- Ah, the opening of the holiday season. Miss Manners is always  so glad to hear that the spirit of the occasion moves people to anticipate  reunions with their loved ones.  </P> <P> She suggests that you act better than naturally, which is to say, politely.  This is a good occasion to cancel the year's grudges and give everyone a fresh  start.  </P></p>

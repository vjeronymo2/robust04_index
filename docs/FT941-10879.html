			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / US shares bounce back after Europe and Far East stumble: Rate rise aftershock felt around world - Fears of steeper falls unfounded US share prices rebounded yesterday after Friday's big declines but stock markets in Europe and the Far East stumbled as the aftershock of the rise in short-term US interest rates reverberated around the world. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 34.90 up at 3,906.32. The big European markets, however, suffered sizeable losses as investors caught up with the 96-point decline in the Dow Jones average on Friday, much of which occurred after European markets had closed. In London yesterday, the FT-SE 100 fell 56.3 points to 3,419.1, a drop of 1.6 per cent, although it had been down by 93.4 points at one stage. The broader FT-SE 350 index fell 28.8 points to 1,731.7. In Frankfurt, the Dax fell 58.85 points, or 2.75 per cent, to 2,079.4. In Paris, the CAC Index dropped 42.11 points, or 1.81 per cent, to 2,287.06. Asian stock markets suffered worst, with Hong Kong dropping 6.1 per cent and Thailand 6.9 per cent. Fears of a substantial setback proved unfounded, though, with European equity markets rallying in the afternoon after a calm opening on Wall Street. The mood in the markets indicated that Friday's drop in New York and yesterday's falls elsewhere were a one-off correction. For now, attention is likely to focus on the more vulnerable Far Eastern markets, although in early trading today the Nikkei average was up 325 points to 20,340 following Wall Street's rise and on hopes of a coalition tax reform agreement. Singapore stocks were also stronger. International markets were clearly jittery at the opening yesterday, but traders said there was little sign of panic. The timing of the Federal Reserve's move was a surprise, but a rise in US interest rates had been expected and does not necessarily presage a similar rise in Europe. Analysts said there was still scope for European rates to fall, given low inflation and the relatively depressed economies. However, analysts pointed to a number of issues that might yet disturb the markets: the Fed might increase rates farther and faster than anticipated; US private investors might redeem some substantial holdings in mutual funds, causing managers to sell equities; or the Bundesbank might decide not to cut German interest rates, to stop the D-Mark from weakening against the dollar. Mr Michael Hughes, managing director of BZW Global Economics and Strategy, said the latest changes marked an end to the 'emerging markets bubble'. He said markets such as Hong Kong, which had been buoyed by speculative flows from US investors, might suffer particularly. In the US, financial markets were restored to relative calm yesterday. Although share prices fluctuated erratically at the start of trading, it was not long before buyers had returned to the market. By early afternoon a series of computerised buy programs pushed stocks, especially those of big companies such as IBM, General Motors and Walt Disney, firmly higher. The US Treasury market was relatively quiet, although continued selling of long-term government securities, some of it linked to this week's auction of Dollars 11bn (Pounds 7.4bn) in new bonds, pushed the benchmark 30-year issue down less than half a point. In Europe, government bonds traded lower, with gilts down about  3/4 of a point. On the foreign exchange markets, the US dollar rose against the D-Mark in early trading, but by late afternoon in New York it was little changed at DM1.7587. The US currency weakened slightly against the yen.

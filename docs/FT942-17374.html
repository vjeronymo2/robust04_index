			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / UK Company News: Amey takes stock market road - Ex-Hanson construction group plans listing with Pounds 50m price tag Amey Holdings, one of the UK's largest private construction companies and the country's sixth biggest road builder, is expected today to announce plans for a stock market listing together with a placing to finance expansion. The exact amount to be raised has still to be decided, but the issue is expected to value the company at a minimum of Pounds 50m. Amey directors, who currently own 62 per cent of the company, may also sell some of their shares. Close Brothers holds a further 25 per cent of the shares on behalf of about 30 investment institutions. It will be the second former Hanson company to come to the market this year. Beazer, Britain's fourth largest housebuilder, was floated last month by the UK/US conglomerate raising Pounds 463.4m, of which Pounds 50m of new money went to Beazer and the remainder to Hanson. Amey, previously part of the ARC building materials and construction group, was briefly a Hanson subsidiary when ARC was acquired from Consolidated Goldfields by Hanson in August 1989. Amey, the construction arm of ARC, was acquired in November the same year for Pounds 6.5m by the company's four main directors - Mr Neil Ashley, executive chairman, Mr Eddie King, managing director, Mr David Cawthorne, finance director, and Mr Richard Douglas, managing director of Amey Building. After stagnating in the 1980s, Amey has trebled its turnover since the management buy-out. It has regained its position as a large UK road builder as well as carving out new markets in construction for water companies, housebuilding and developing a network of regional building companies by acquiring contracts and businesses from receivers. These purchases, in most cases, have been self financing leaving the group with net cash of Pounds 8.7m at the end of December. It also took over the staff of the former heavy electrical business of JM Jones which was lossmaking and was closed by Amey last year. The continuing businesses, however, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.7m last year on group sales of Pounds 210m. That compared with profits of just Pounds 300,000 on sales of Pounds 70m before the buy-out in 1989. Pre-tax profits including the discontinued business would have been Pounds 2.2m last year. The cash is needed to expand the capital base, with shareholders funds currently about Pounds 7m, to enable the group to expand its housebuilding operations from 40 homes a year up to 200 to 300 by the late 1990s and to make other strategic investments. A larger capital base will give potential customers greater confidence and enable the company to bid for a bigger range of construction contracts, including involvement in privately financed infrastructure schemes.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Personal View: Shut the stable door How to recover without inflating: that is the question. In every recession we conquer inflation and people say: 'We have dealt with that problem, so give us a recovery.' And every recovery then brings back inflation. The problem will be particularly acute this time, owing to the devaluation of sterling. Experience shows that the competitive gain from devaluation will soon be wiped out by higher wage inflation - unless this time we address the wages problem before it arises. The instinct of almost every businessman is against this, and the reaction is understandable. Most businesses feel that wages are now the least of their problems. Business has re-established productivity growth, and for the moment companies are less worried than usual about their unit labour costs. What worries them is the lack of demand and the high cost of servicing their debts. So they are calling for a recovery package based on infrastructure investment and lower interest rates. Many of them cannot understand why the government hesitates to give them this. But the government takes a longer view. It knows that the basic problem of the British economy is the wages problem. At present wage inflation is still falling as a result of increasing unemployment. But, once unemployment stabilises and then begins to fall, wage inflation will start creeping up again, exactly as it did in the late 1980s. Almost all our present ills stem from the steady rise of wage inflation at that time. The main reason for the present recession has been the need to reduce wage settlements. We needed to reduce average earnings growth from about 9 to 5 per cent a year. After three terrible years we have nearly got there but in the end the disinflation was just too late - leading to the national humiliation of a devaluation. We must not repeat this stop-go cycle in the years ahead. If we do nothing about our pay arrangements, it will be very difficult to expand employment at all without raising inflation above 4 per cent. The business community must exercise some foresight in its own collective interest. If business does not believe there is an inflation problem, the financial markets do. If interest rates are to be cut as much as we need, the pound will fall and inflation will rise - unless the markets believe pay is under control. The markets know that pay is the prime cost in the economy (though for individual businesses it is often minor, due to multi-stage production). As soon as the labour market improves, individual employers have an incentive to raise the relative pay of their workers. But the result is a process of pay leap-frogging. From this process all lose, since it is inevitably followed by another period of 'stop'. How can we avoid this? We have to institutionalise the common interest which all employers have in a low average level of wage settlements, while preserving the needed flexibility in relativities. In Germany and Japan this common interest has led to a degree of concerted action among employers, which helps to explain their good performance. Our system of pay determination has worked less well and we ought to consider some change. Given the present economic crisis, we should consider one quite small alteration, from which we could derive great benefits. The assumption must be that we shall have some kind of public sector pay limit. Business has rightly asked for something of that kind. But it is not a reasonable request unless we can expect that private sector pay (taken as a whole) will move roughly in line. Companies which are abnormally short of labour should, of course, be raising the relative pay of their workers. But, unless the private sector as a whole is more short of labour than the public sector, there is no reason why the relative pay of the private sector should rise. So if the public sector pay limit is x per cent, no private sector company should be conceding more than x per cent unless it is abnormally short of labour (or needs to reward an exceptional increase in the efforts of its workers). The government should therefore announce a recovery package as the CBI asks  -on one condition. The CBI should establish a committee which would comment publicly on any private sector pay settlement above x per cent. The committee would be expected to criticise all settlements which could not be justified on the above criteria. Even this arrangement would favour the private sector, for average earnings in industry usually rise by about 2 points more than wage settlements, which does not happen in the public sector. Some will say the monitoring procedure is unnecessary. If so, it can do no harm. And, if it is necessary, it will do good. Either way, nobody can reasonably criticise it. Too often we have claimed to have licked inflation. If we have any foresight, we should bolt the stable door now, rather than having again to grab inflation by the tail, once it has bolted.

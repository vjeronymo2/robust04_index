The nation's first  domestically made laser rapid prototyping machine--developed,  designed and made by Beijing Longyuan [7127 3293] Enterprises  Ltd.--was unveiled the other day in Beijing, and has been put  into formal operation. This new unit, model STILY-I, employs the  [stereolithography (SLA)] additive technique in which various  layers of material are selectively built up into the solid  prototype by a laser whose scan sequences are controlled by  CAD/CAM databases. The total process includes laser-heated  powder sintering [i.e. selective laser sintering (SLS)], induced  liquid photopolymer material [cut-out], and induced vapor-phase  deposition for gradually building up [and curing] the final  solid plastic, ceramic or wax model. [The wax models are then  used to create ceramic molds for fabricating final prototype  products--FBIS].</p>

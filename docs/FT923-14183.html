			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Hollas falls into losses in second half With poor trading conditions continuing, Hollas Group, the specialist textiles group, fell into losses in the second half of the year to March 31. Annual pre-tax profits were Pounds 223,000, against Pounds 74,000, struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 559,000. Interim profits were Pounds 235,000. Full-year turnover fell to Pounds 37m (Pounds 39.3m) reflecting the effects of the recession on retail and mail order sales. The garment distribution and yarn divisions were profitable but Hawkshead, the mail order and retail side, suffered significant losses. A partner is being sought to secure Hawkshead's future. Earnings per share came out at 0.2p (0.4p losses). A maintained final dividend of 0.6p is proposed for an unchanged total of 1.2p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Yang Qing (2799 7230) and Zhang Jinsheng (1728 </F> 6930 0524)]    [Text] Beijing, 6 Apr (XINHUA) -- At a meeting about the  Beijing First Light Industry Corporation's [BFLIC] experience in  trial comprehensive and coordinated reform today, Li Tieying,  member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and  minister in charge of the State Economic Restructuring  Commission, emphatically noted: The decision of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has drafted  the goals and blueprint of the reform; the most important thing  at present is to translate it into action, do a solid job, be  meticulous in operation, and establish new systems and  mechanisms through practical work. While learning from the  BFLIC, we should emulate their practice of "stressing the focal  points, doing a solid job, and bringing about concrete results."    The three-day meeting on the BFLIC's experience in trial  comprehensive and coordinated reform, which was convened by the  State Economic Restructuring Commission, closed today. At the  meeting, Li Tieying gave an important speech about the valuable  points in the BFLIC's experience which merit attention from  other regions and enterprises. He said: First of all, reform  must center on development and be carried out with a view to  tackling practical problems in economic life. The most urgent  problems and the cruxes of problems are the focal points of our  reform. The value of the BFLIC's trial reform lies in its firm  grasp of practical problems in Beijing's development and the  gradual resolution of them through reform to promote  development. For example, in moving against problems such as  considerable losses of state assets, difficulties in circulating  available capital, dull enterprise mechanisms, a shortage of  capital, obstacles to the mobility of staff and workers, and  heavy debt burdens, the BFLIC proposed the basic idea of  "increasing the value of assets, switching the industry's  production of products, changing functions, transforming  mechanisms, and reassigning staff and workers" in its trial  comprehensive and coordinated reform, and it integrated the  reform of the enterprise system with the readjustment of the  industrial structure. It started the industry all over again  for the second time through the establishment of a modern  enterprise system and comprehensively took in new systems step  by step on the one hand, and on the other hand it brought about  a switch in industries in its urban enterprises in order of  importance and urgency, vigorously developed tertiary industries  by redeveloping assets, and developed secondary industries to a  high level. In the meantime, it has resolved the problems  concerning the future of urban enterprises, the needs of  developing the rural economy, and the lack of suitable projects  for village and town enterprises as well as their upgrading by  supplementing urban areas with the supremacy of rural areas and  vice versa, and it has promoted the coordinated development of  the urban and rural economies.    Li Tieying said: Having developed to the present stage,  reform must be carried out comprehensively and in a coordinated  manner in order to proceed further. The BFLIC's experience in  trial reform is not the experience in a single trial reform by  an individual enterprise; it is the experience in a  comprehensive and coordinated reform for revitalizing the  state-owned economy. One of the important reasons why their  trial reform could show results within only one year is because  of the high attention received from the Beijing municipal party  committee and government. Since the inception of the reform,  they have proposed that the comprehensive and coordinated reform  should be supported by comprehensive and coordinated policies;  principal leaders of the municipal party committee and  government personally organized various departments to study and  implement the trial comprehensive and coordinated reform program  and demanded that all departments transform their functions,  improve their work style, and support the reform in a spirit of  reform. On the other hand, the reason why there are few  significant results in enterprise reform over the years is  mainly because individual enterprises judge things as they  stand, fall short of overall concepts concerning the  comprehensive and coordinated reform, and make no fundamental  change to their mechanisms. Enterprises are the bearers of the  movement of capital, and if they do not follow the internal  requirements of the law of value, establish a mechanism for  enterprises to consciously pursue an increase in value and a  modern enterprise system suitable for the changes in markets,  and carry out comprehensive and coordinated reform with a  greater view to revitalizing the entire state-owned economy, the  problem of revitalizing enterprises cannot be solved.    Li Tieying said: Properly handling the relations between  reform, development, and stability is an important prerequisite  for doing our job well. We must take a new path to development  and create new systems in reform. The deep-seated  contradictions and new problems cropping up in the course of  economic development must be resolved by means of reform.  Reform means a readjustment in the structure of interests and  involves all kinds of old and new problems; it will impair  stability if it is not handled well. The success of the BFLIC's  trial reform lies in its consideration to reform, development,  and stability. From the beginning, the corporation has  incorporated the arrangements for the staff and workers into the  reform program and has improved their quality and  competitiveness in obtaining new jobs through training in light  of market demands. It created new job vacancies to properly  reassign staff and workers through readjusting the industrial  structure. In addition, it considered a great deal of thorough  and painstaking ideological work to be an important part of the  reform.    Speaking on the problems that merit further study and  attention in learning the BFLIC's experience in trial  comprehensive and coordinated reform, Li Tieying stressed: 1)  It is necessary to properly handle the problem of state-owned  assets. The losses of state-owned assets currently are very  grim, and the problem cannot be solved without reform. But how?  Can we blaze a new trail for maintaining and increasing the  value of state-owned assets by relying on the state economy's  own strength, the redistribution of resources and essential  factors, and the transformation of the mechanism through reform?  The handling of state-owned assets is a very sensitive issue  which requires a strong policy; it requires a profound study in  the course of reform. 2) The problem concerning the compensated  use of land in coordinated reform -- land belongs to the state,  and the income resulting from the increase in its value should  go to the state. 3) It is necessary to proceed from reality in  doing everything. Each locality has its own economic structure  and level of development, and the problems it is facing may be  different from others' problems. While studying the BFLIC's  ways of conducting trial reform, we must avoid copying  everything indiscriminately without taking into account local  conditions, for otherwise we would acquire the form instead of  the essence. We should avoid doing things rashly on a mass  scale, because this will not only achieve nothing but will also  bungle the good opportunity for reform and development. The  BFLIC's experience in trial comprehensive and coordinated reform  is still preliminary; it should continue to probe further for  constant improvement.    Chen Xitong, member of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau and secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee,  also spoke at today's closing meeting. He said: The  outstanding feature in the BFLIC's reform is that in the course  of readjusting its industrial structure, it has consciously  redistributed the essential factors of production by means of  the mechanism of the market economy. In the course of  readjustment, we must pay attention to and properly solve the  problems of "brand, face, and position" and "yours, mine, and  his," consider the overall situation of reform and development,  break down the departmental selfishness, and reorganize in a  timely manner low-efficiency enterprises by closing them down,  suspending their operations, merging them with other  enterprises, or switching their manufacture of products. We  should emancipate our minds and find a new way for state  enterprises to extricate themselves from their predicaments and  improve their efficiency.    The meeting was presided over by He Guanghui, vice minister  in charge of the State Economic Restructuring Commission.  During the meeting, representatives of relevant local and  central departments from around the country discussed  enthusiastically and profoundly the BFLIC's reform experience  and reached a consensus on its basic ideas and experience in the  comprehensive and coordinated reform. The report entitled  "Comprehensively and Precisely Master the Beijing First Light  Industry Corporation's Experience and Promote State Enterprise  Reform Comprehensively and in a Coordinated Manner" delivered by  Liu Zhifeng, vice minister in charge of the State Economic  Restructuring Commission, systematically summarized the BFLIC's  basic reform experience in its six aspects and in its three  characteristics, highlighted six problems that all localities  should note in drawing lessons from the BFLIC's experience, and  drew the attention of participants in the meeting.</p>

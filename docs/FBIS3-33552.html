			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alejandro Arturo Flores in Santa Ana; from the </F> "YSU Radio News" newscast]    [Excerpt] The takeover of the western penal facility by  numerous inmates is into its fourth hour without any sign of a  solution. So far two people are reported dead and two injured.  We shall now hear from Gabriel Abraham Paniagua, president of  the political committee of Armed Forces prisoners, who was  wounded in his left arm.    [Begin recording] [Paniagua] Our people began to arm  themselves with pieces of sharp steel.    [Flores] What do the inmates want?    [Panigua] The problem is that the people up front saw the  soldiers fighting so the rest joined in. The other inmates  joined in, although they normally do not bother anyone, but they  were wounded so they joined in the fight against those from  Gotera. They want to kill them because the problem is that if  these people are left alive and we are transferred, then they  will kill us in the other jail. Do you understand? That is why  the inmates do not want to leave these types alive.    Regrettably, the National Guard troops only have to knock  the  doors down. We are a disciplined group who obey prison  regulations. You understand? When I get back, if things have  calmed down, just as we promised, those who have armed  themselves will turn over their pocket knives at the front door.  As you can see, we do not bother anyone. We live for our work  and our families. We would have preferred some warning  because... [pauses] [words indistinct] thefts and stabbings have  increased these past few days. Recently, seven inmates were  wounded. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

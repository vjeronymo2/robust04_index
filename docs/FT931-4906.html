			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Observer: In the family Whatever else the indebted First National Finance Corporation may lack, it is not short of bankers on its board of directors. Martin Mays-Smith, who took over as chairman a year ago, is an ex-Kleinwort Benson man, Tim Ingram, the new finance director, is a career banker, and three of FNFC's four non-executive directors are bankers. Indeed, whenever there is a vacancy on its board, FNFC's knee-jerk reaction seems to be to add another banker. George Cracknell, 59, deputy managing director of Barclays' banking division, is the latest recruit. He takes over from Roy Vine, a former vice chairman of Barclays Bank UK, who had been a FNFC director for 11 years. Vine was the man who conducted the post mortem on what went wrong with Barclays' lending in the previous recession. Will Cracknell get the job this time?</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Vicente B. Foz] </F>   [Text] The provision of the Uruguay Round to which the  Philippines committed, to convert quantitative restrictions on  agricultural products into tariffs does not amend Republic Act  No. 7606, known as the Magna Carta of Small Farmers.    This was the ruling made by Justice Secretary Franklin M.  Drilon in reply to a query of Trade and Industry Secretary  Rizalino S. Navarro. Drilon said "the Magna Carta provisions  cannot be amended by the Final Act of the Uruguay Round."    While the Philippines adopts the generally accepted  principles of international law as part of the law of the land  in consonance with the Constitution, Drilon said, it has been  said that a municipal law which is in conflict with a rule of  international law will often be given effect in municipal courts  since the latter are organs of municipal law and are bound by it.    Citing the Salonga-Yap book on Public International Law,  Drilon said, the fact that international law has been made part  of the law of the land does not by any means imply the primacy  of international law over national or municipal law in the  municipal sphere.    As retired Supreme Court Justice Edgardo J. Paras said in  his  work "International Law," in case of conflict between  international law and the municipal law of the tribunal deciding  the case, the municipal law shall prevail.    However, Drilon said, if the Final Act of the Uruguay Round  is subjected to the Senate ratification pursuant to the  Constitution, "our reply to this particular query might be  different if we are to consider and apply the American  jurisprudential rule that a treaty may supersede a prior act of  Congress in the same manner that an act of Congress may  supersede a prior treaty."    Navarro also asked whether "non-implementation by the  president or the secretary of agriculture of the trade provision  of the Magna Carta hold them liable for action by interest  groups."</p>

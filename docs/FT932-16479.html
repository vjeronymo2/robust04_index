			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Lib Dems 'living in sin with Labour' THE Conservatives yesterday opened a second front in their campaign for next month's county council elections in England and Wales by publishing their own survey of party alliances in local government which denounces the Liberal Democrats as 'Labour's stooges'. Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, described Liberal Democrat councillors as 'living in sin with Labour up and down the land'. There were, he said, no pacts between Liberal Democrats and Tories on county councils. Tory central office admitted, however, that there was a formal pact between Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in Wolverhampton borough council, and that there might be one or two informal arrangements in other non-county councils. Reflecting the emphasis on the cost of local government, which is already dominating the campaign, the Tory survey lists examples of Liberal Democrats' support for Labour budgets in Avon, Bedfordshire, Cheshire and Cumbria; and Liberal Democrats joining with Labour in Oxfordshire to defeat Tory budget plans. The Tories are also highlighting arrangements between the other parties occurred where Conservatives are the largest single party. Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, accused the Liberal Democrats of striking 'cosy deals with Labour regardless of the clear wishes of the local electorate'. With one eye on the Liberal Democrat challenge to the Tories in the Newbury parliamentary by-election - expected to coincide with the local elections - Mr Howard cited the position on Berkshire county council, where the Liberal Democrats had put Labour into power even though the Tories were by far the largest party. The Liberal Democrats are a focus of attack in these elections because they are bound to perform better than when the 3,500 county council seats were last contested. The 1989 local elections took place as the alliance between the Liberals and the Social Democrats was falling apart.</p>

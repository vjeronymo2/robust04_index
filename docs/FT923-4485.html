			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Collor fiddles while public opinion burns: Brazil's president remains impervious to demands that he quit NOBODY can fault Brazilian President Fernando Collor for determination. Since the publication two weeks ago of a congressional report accusing him and his family of receiving millions of dollars from an influence-peddling racket, Mr Collor has remained impervious to huge street demonstrations and demands for his resignation from lawyers, intellectuals, business organisations, bishops, trade unions, students and leading newspapers. Last week, as impeachment proceedings began, a poll indicated that 69 per cent of the population no longer trust him. The Brazilian Karate Association even wants to strip him of his black belt. Despite such isolation, Mr Collor remains ensconced in his office on the third floor of the modernist presidential palace, tenaciously clinging to power as if sheer force of will can save him. In the last 67 years, only one civilian president has ever finished his mandate. Such is Mr Collor's bravado that he is insisting on attending today's Independence Day parade even if he has to travel by helicopter and reach the platform through a tunnel to avoid contact with the public. So nonchalant does the 43-year-old former playboy seem that observers conclude that he must either be supremely arrogant or is failing to grasp or believe what is happening. Ministers say that he refuses to read the papers and last week he described the situation to Argentine television as 'absolutely normal'. Mr Collor's cabinet is less confident. The group of so-called 'ethical ministers,' led by Economy Minister Marcilio Marques Moreira, is now referred to as the 'Politburo,' having effectively wrested power, signing a pact of governability to ensure the running of the administration while the crisis continues. Mr Collor has formed a political team comprising a group of people frequently portrayed as gangsters by Brazilian cartoonists. They include Mr Ricardo Fiuza, a well known political operator and the social action minister, Mr Eraldo Tinoco, the education minister, and the presidents of the state-owned Banco do Brasil and the National Savings Bank. Their task is to win the support of 168 congressmen, the number Mr Collor requires to withstand impeachment in the vote expected to take place in the next six weeks. While the ethical ministers try to maintain a tight grip on treasury coffers, Mr Fiuza has been spending. Last month alone he directed Cr59.1bn (Pounds 6m) to projects in municipalities where congressmen are standing as candidates in next month's elections. With no new money available under the government's austerity plan, funds are instead being 'redirected' from other ministries. Economy Ministry officials admit that, in the last two months, Cr6,000bn has been redirected. There is little attempt to mask this strategy. At a dinner of congressmen last week, Mr Collor crudely promised to 'benefit later those who support me now.' His time is spent breakfasting, lunching, dining and cajoling the very type of porkbarrel politicians that he always said he detested. To avoid photographers they are smuggled in and out of Mr Collor's bunker in the palace through a side door or tunnel. Nearby, in the offices of the Attorney General,staff are sifting through 40,000 cheques and other documents, to decide whether a criminal process should be started. Perhaps the most important focus of attention is the Army Ministry. The current crisis is the first this century in which the military has not intervened, but the forces' insistence on sticking to a constitutional solution may be weakened if the crisis is prolonged.

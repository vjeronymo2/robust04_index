			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Saudi Arabia to urge one-year extension on oil output ceiling Saudi Arabia will today ask the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to extend the current production ceiling until the end of 1995 in order to bolster oil prices. A one-year rollover of the 24.52m barrel a day ceiling would be a sharp departure from Opec's policy in recent years of trying to balance world supply and demand through frequent changes in output. Analysts say it would also give a signal to world oil markets that Saudi Arabia, Opec's largest producer and the only one with large spare capacity, is prepared to forego possible volume increases next year in favour of a strategy that, if successful, could deliver higher prices. Other Opec ministers, meeting in the Indonesian resort of Bali, also favour a rollover, but it is not certain that all accept the need for such a long extension. Iran, one of Opec's persistent price hawks, said yesterday that it would consider all options. Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh, oil minister, said he would look at all rollover proposals, whether for '12, six or three months'. Iran had been thought to favour a three-month extension. But some Gulf Arab officials yesterday described it as unacceptable because it would have little market credibility. Saudi Arabia, however, might accept a six-month rollover if the one-year proposal meets stiff opposition. Saudi officials had publicly advocated the six-month option as late as last week. Some analysts believe current oil prices already discount a six-month extension. They claim a one-year rollover would send a strong bullish signal to world oil markets in the short term. The strategy assumes that non-Opec producers would not be able to increase output quickly to meet the full 1m b/d increase in world demand expected next year. Over the past year, a surge in non-Opec production, especially from Norway and the UK, has been more than adequate to meet rising demand. The Saudi plan also assumes that quota cheating by Opec states will remain at relatively modest levels. One Opec delegate said the Saudi strategy was not intended to produce a sharp jump in oil prices next year. 'I can't see Brent going above Dollars 23 a barrel,' he said - the benchmark Brent Blend currently stands at about Dollars 16.50. Instead, the aim is to put pressure on minimum prices, and to reduce frequent price swings.</p>

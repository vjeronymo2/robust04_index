			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Brasilia, 10 Jun (AE) -- Just one day after  receiving a report from the military ministers, in which they  warn of instability among the troops over low salaries,  President Itamar Franco ordered Federal Administration Secretary  Romildo Canhim to begin working next week with the Finance  Ministry on a timetable to implement the equal salary plan among  the three government branches.    This decision, which directly benefits the military and  civil  servants of the executive branch, was made during a nearly  two-hour meeting with the four military ministers.    "It is impossible to maintain the current salary scale,"  President Itamar admitted during the meeting that was requested  by the ministers who expressed total support for the equal  salary treatment law. [passage omitted]    Federal Administration Secretary Canhim said he has no idea  how long it will take to fully implement the equal salary plan.  "Everything depends on the revenue collection capability, which  we will now discuss with the Finance Ministry," he said.  [passage omitted]</p>

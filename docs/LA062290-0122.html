			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> GNP Revised Upward: The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy grew  at its second-slowest pace in 3 1/2 years from January through March. The gross  national product -- the nation's total output of goods and services -- grew at  a revised 1.9% annual rate in the first quarter.  </P> <P> At the same time, the department revised a price index tied to the GNP to show  an annualized inflation rate of 6.4% for the quarter. The department said half  of that increase was because of rising food and energy prices caused by unusual  winter weather. Analysts predicted that prices would decline during the rest of  the year. They said they expect only modest improvement in the GNP for the rest  of the year. The first-quarter GNP was up from the 1.1% annualized rate in the  final quarter of 1989. That was the slowest quarterly growth since a 0.8% gain  in the summer of 1986.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GNP  </P> <P> Source: Commerce Dept  </P></p>

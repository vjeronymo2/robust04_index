			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Seiko set back by poor market for watches SEIKO, a leading maker of watches and clocks, suffered a sharp fall in profits after being hurt by weak demand for its main line of watches and at its jewellery operations The company recorded a 26.4 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Y3.6bn (Dollars 27.9m) for the year ended March, its first retreat since the 1987-88 fiscal year. Seiko noted that consumer demand for high-priced goods had dropped precipitously during the current economic slowdown. Sales for the period dipped 2.3 per cent to Y298.7bn, while net profits advanced 7.6 per cent to Y1.5bn. Domestic sales were off 2.5 per cent at Y187.1bn, while exports fell 1.9 per cent to Y111.6bn. By division, sales of watches slipped 2.6 per cent to Y178.5bn and clocks 2.1 per cent to Y44.5bn. Jewellery turnover was off 4.6 per cent at Y26.7bn, although other items staged a 0.1 per cent gain to Y49bn. For the current period, Seiko expects the positive effects of price stability in Japan to be more than offset by continued weakness in corporate earnings and the stock market. Sales are expected to rise 0.4 per cent to Y300bn, while pre-tax profits are forecast to slip 2.6 per cent to Y3.5bn and net profits 1 per cent to Y1.5bn. Kandenko, Japan's largest electrical engineering company, reported solid gains in unconsolidated sales and profit for the year to end-March, Kyodo reports from Toyko. Net profit increased 14.1 per cent over the previous year to Y12.36bn, or Y105.82 a share, up from Y102.50. Pre-tax profit also rose 14.5 per cent to Y29.40bn on sales of Y520.23bn, up 8.2 per cent.</p>

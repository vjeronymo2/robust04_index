			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRIGHT EXPECTED TO RESIGN FROM OFFICE NEXT WEEK  </P> <P> House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) is likely to resign from the House next week,  even though he has ruled out further efforts to persuade the House Ethics  Committee to drop charges against him, a House leadership source said Thursday.  </P> <P> Wright, who has been charged by the committee with 69 violations of House  rules, signaled the end of his behind-the-scenes negotiations with the  committee by issuing a statement ruling out any plea-bargaining over the  charges pending against him.  </P> <P> "There is no deal now. There will be no deal in the future," he said.  </P> <P> But a knowledgeable source said that Wright is still seriously considering  tendering his resignation as Speaker and, simultaneously, ending his 35-year  House career next week after most of the chamber's 435 members return from a  Memorial Day recess.  </P> <P> He indicated that the Speaker, despite a strong desire to defend himself  against the charges, is fully aware of the growing sentiment among House  Democrats that his legal troubles are causing embarrassment to the party and to  Congress.  </P> <P> "He is a proud man," the source said. "He is torn between his desire to be  heard and his respect for the institution . . . . I believe the Speaker will  ultimately do what he wants to do when he wants to do it."  </P> <P> If Wright resigns, the Ethics Committee case against him would be dropped, but  he still would face a broad investigation of his finances undertaken recently  by the Internal Revenue Service as well as a possible Justice Department  inquiry.  </P> <P> Many House Democrats are convinced that Wright will step down, perhaps as soon  as next Wednesday. They noted that it would be very difficult for him to  withdraw the offer to resign that was implied in his negotiations with the  Ethics Committee.  </P> <P> "I think it's all over for him," said a prominent House Democrat, who declined  to be identified. "He can't un-ring the bell."  </P> <P> A Democratic aide added: "If Wright indicates he's willing to quit, he'll be  pushed out the door. A lot of support he's had up to now might go fast. People  are tired of being dragged down by leaders who can't keep their affairs  straight. They are taking a very hard line, saying: 'Enough's enough. Let's get  on with it.' "  </P> <P> If he resigns, Wright is virtually certain to be replaced as Speaker by House  Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.). House Democrats said the chances  that Assistant Majority Leader Tony Coelho (D-Merced) would succeed Foley have  been diminished somewhat by news that Coelho and Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley  are the subjects of preliminary investigations by the public integrity section  of the Justice Department in connection with their financial dealings with  Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.  </P> <P> Knowledgeable sources said that Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-Ga.) is considering  challenging Coelho for the position of majority leader, if it becomes  available. Jenkins declined to confirm or deny the report.  </P> <P> Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri was also reportedly considering seeking a  top Democratic leadership position.  </P> <P> The Speaker and other Democratic leaders are chosen by a vote of the party  caucus.  </P> <P> Common Cause, the citizens lobby, and House Republicans also are considering  filing a complaint with the House Ethics Committee against Coelho in connection  with his purchase of a $100,000 "junk bond" from Thomas Spiegel, chairman of  Columbia Savings &amp; Loan in Los Angeles, and his failure to report a $50,000  loan from Columbia to help purchase the bond. It was complaints from Common  Cause and GOP congressmen that led to the Ethics Committee's investigation of  Wright.  </P> <P> In his statement, Wright said that he had not initiated the negotiations  between his lawyers and committee members that took place Wednesday. He said  that the talks began, instead, at the request of unnamed friends in both camps  who wanted "to save the House from what they saw as a harsh and divisive  confrontation."  </P> <P> A House leadership source said that the settlement talks were initiated earlier  this week by Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Ethics  Committee, who enlisted Rep. Louis Stokes (D-Ohio) to make the initial contact  with Wright's principal defender in the House, Rep. Robert G. Torricelli  (D-N.J.). He said that the Speaker then agreed to permit Torricelli to carry on  talks on his behalf with Richard J. Phelan, special counsel for the committee.  </P> <P> The committee was anxious to settle the Wright case, according to this source,  because the members want to avoid a precedent-setting vote on the issue of what  constitutes "direct interest in legislation" under House rules.  </P> <P> "The committee wants out," the source said. "The committee suggested something  that was rejected out of hand. The Speaker from the very beginning was  unwilling to cut a deal." Wright is accused of violating the rule that  prohibits House members from accepting gifts in excess of $100 from persons  with direct interest in legislation. The charge stems from lucrative benefits  that Wright and his wife, Betty, received from their friendship and business  partnership with George A. Mallick Jr., a Ft. Worth real estate developer.  </P> <P> According to the source, the committee offered to clear Wright of violating  this rule before 1986 in exchange for his resignation from the House. It was  not until 1986 that Wright called upon Mallick to prepare a report aimed at  influencing legislation to recapitalize the beleaguered savings and loan  industry.  </P> <P> The committee never offered to forgive Wright on the charge of violating the  rules governing outside income by selling his book, "Reflections of a Public  Man," to special interest groups in lieu of honorariums. House rules limit  honorariums but not book royalties.  </P> <P> A leadership source said that Wright dismissed the offer not because he  objected to these terms but because members of the committee were insisting  that he resign immediately, a demand that he saw as unreasonable. He indicated  that Wright would rather wait until next week to tender his resignation so that  he can do it in a speech before the full House.  </P> <P> "The Speaker wants to do what he wants according to his timing," the source  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seen as Against Talks  </P> <P> In fact, the source said, Wright never felt comfortable about the negotiations  and viewed them only as a necessary step in the legal process of defending  himself. "He did not like the smell of a negotiated arrangement," he said.  </P> <P> A close associate reported that Wright and his wife -- acting on the advice of  friends -- are expected to leave town to spend a long, quiet Memorial Day  weekend together at an undisclosed location to ponder their future.  </P> <P> If he decides to resign, this associate noted, Wright, 66, would receive a  generous House pension and would be in a position to write a lucrative book  about his experiences in his 2 1/2 years as Speaker. Wright's predecessor as  Speaker, Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.), received a $1-million  publisher's advance for his memoirs.  </P></p>

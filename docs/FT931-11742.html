			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Lower interest costs boost Haynes LOWER INTEREST charges helped Haynes Publishing Group, which produces car and motorcycle maintenance manuals, jump by 34 per cent at the pre-tax level to Pounds 1.5m for the six months to November 30, compared with Pounds 1.13m. Mr Max Pearce, chief executive, said the result had been achieved 'with no help from either the US or UK economies'. Sales were ahead less than 2 per cent at Pounds 11.1m. There was a sharp reduction in debt from Pounds 1.3m at the end of the last financial year to Pounds 156,000 at the interim stage. Net interest charges fell from Pounds 240,000 to Pounds 86,000. Mr Pearce said the group expected to be cash positive by the end of the current year. Haynes aimed to build a cash pile for expansion into Europe, developing manuals for alternative markets such as home security and, in the longer term, for acquisitions. The interim dividend goes up 1p to 3.5p, payable from earnings per share up 33 per cent to 9.05p. The shares advanced by 15p to 288p. Meanwhile, costs were being controlled through a redundancy programme which resulted in Pounds 203,000 (Pounds 453,000) exceptional charges in the UK. About 10 per cent of the 200-plus jobs would be cut by the end of the year. A further Pounds 100,000 charge was expected in the second half. Trading continued to be most difficult in the UK, which was hampered by losses of some Pounds 250,000 from general publishing. Mr Pearce said these losses - which were Pounds 1.2m for the whole of last year - would total about Pounds 500,000 for the year. Operating profits in the UK, after exceptionals, were Pounds 830,000, compared with Pounds 619,000. In the US, Haynes recorded an 8 per cent increase in operating profits from Pounds 1.14m to Pounds 1.23m, with sales for the Chevy Pick-Up manual outstripping all others. Mr Pearce said the group had a 50 per cent share of the US market.</p>

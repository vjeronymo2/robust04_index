			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH LIED TO CONGRESSMEN, DEFENDS ACTIONS  </P> <P> Oliver L. North acknowledged Friday that he helped compose "factually  incorrect" letters to congressmen and later made untruthful statements to them  in a face-to-face White House meeting -- the main offenses on which he is being  tried.  </P> <P> But North, in his second day on the witness stand, defended his conduct by  contending that members of Congress had no right to know about his secret  activities in support of the Nicaraguan Contras, saying that they were covert  actions "I knew it wasn't right to tell the truth about."  </P> <P> Under questioning by his attorney, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., the retired Marine  lieutenant colonel said that he had reluctantly drafted misleading responses to  congressmen for his boss, National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opposed Any Response  </P> <P> North said he had opposed providing any information to Congress and had urged  McFarlane to invoke President Ronald Reagan's prerogative of "executive  privilege."  </P> <P> However, McFarlane decided that a flat refusal to provide information "would be  too confrontational," North said.  </P> <P> He gave North a letter from Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), who was chairman of  the House Intelligence Committee, and told North: "Give me a stab at answering  it," the ex-Marine testified.  </P> <P> "So I did a draft response," North said, adding that McFarlane sent Hamilton a  letter based on two paragraphs of North's draft.  </P> <P> Hamilton and another congressional witness, former Rep. Michael D. Barnes  (D-Md.), testified earlier at the trial that in September, 1985, they had  received letters from McFarlane insisting that North was complying with "both  the letter and the spirit" of congressional curbs on military aid for the  Nicaraguan rebels.  </P> <P> The letters specifically denied press reports that the National Security  Council staff officer was helping to raise private money for the Contras or was  giving them tactical military advice, two activities that more than a dozen  witnesses have said North conducted.  </P> <P> North testified that McFarlane used the same draft response to reply separately  to Barnes, who then was chairman of a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee. He  said he never wanted McFarlane to send either letter "because the answer he  wanted to give them was wrong, not accurate and factually incorrect."  </P> <P> McFarlane had to know that his draft answer contained lies, North said, because  "the answer basically denied the things that he (McFarlane) had had me do."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Told to See Lawmakers  </P> <P> In August, 1986 -- a year after McFarlane had sent the letters and eight months  after McFarlane had left government service -- North said, his new boss, Vice  Adm. John M. Poindexter, told him to meet with a congressional delegation that  wanted to question North directly about his activities.  </P> <P> "I didn't think it was a good idea," North said. "But Poindexter told me: 'You  can handle it.' I believe I raised with him that there were things that I was  doing . . . that should not be revealed. He said: 'You can take care of it.' "  </P> <P> North testified that he was under orders from his superiors not to tell  Congress or anyone else about the Reagan Administration's solicitation of aid  from other countries to help the Contras. He said he could not divulge his  efforts to resupply the guerrilla forces for fear of jeopardizing the lives or  reputations of many others who were helping him, including a number of foreign  government officials in Central America.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Wasn't Right to Tell Truth'  </P> <P> "Did you tell the truth at that meeting on Aug. 6, 1986?" Sullivan asked.  </P> <P> "No," North replied. "I knew it wasn't right to tell the truth about those  (confidential) things."  </P> <P> In a choked voice, he added:  </P> <P> "I had been raised to know what the Ten Commandments are all about, and I never  believed what I did was unlawful."  </P> <P> North, who is also accused of having altered or shredded many White House  documents just before the Iran-Contra scandal was disclosed in November, 1986,  blamed his actions on orders issued by McFarlane before he left office.  </P> <P> "McFarlane gave me a list," North said. "He said: 'Fix these documents so they  will be consistent with what we told the Congress.' They were his documents. I  had written them, but they were memos to him, and therefore his documents."  </P> <P> McFarlane last year pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor counts of misleading  Congress and has been sentenced to two years' probation and 200 hours of  community service and fined $20,000.  </P> <P> In testifying last month at North's trial, McFarlane gave a different account  of the events. He said he thought North was keeping in touch with the Contras  on an informational basis to try to keep up their morale until Congress  restored full funding for them. McFarlane said he was unaware of the extent of  North's activities in supporting the Contras.  </P> <P> Sullivan led North through a long recitation of repeated trips he had made to  Geneva, Cyprus and Beirut in the weeks before he was fired to try to obtain the  release of American hostages in Lebanon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Had Hopes for Hostages  </P> <P> North said that, on the eve of his dismissal, William J. Casey, the late CIA  director, felt that the Administration had opened up a promising "second  channel" to Iranian moderates that might prove successful in getting hostages  freed.  </P> <P> Sullivan had North show jurors a handwritten commendation from President Bush,  then the vice president, that North had received a year before his dismissal.  </P> <P> Bush's note, dated Nov. 27, 1985, praised North for his performance of duty  "under fire in tough situations," adding: "Your dedication to the hostage thing  and Central America gives me cause for great pride."  </P></p>

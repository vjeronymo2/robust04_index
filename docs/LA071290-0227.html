			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> FILMMAKERS GET DOSE OF REALITY  </P> <P> Nine college students with toy guns who were making an amateur cops-and-robbers  film got a scary dose of reality when armed officers came to the set and told  them to drop their weapons, authorities said today.  </P> <P> "We received a report that there were some subjects loading automatic weapons  onto a boat on a dock," said Lt. Brad Williams of the Florida Marine Patrol  about Wednesday's incident.  </P> <P> Two FMP officers went to the scene, followed by city police. They ordered the  students to drop their weapons and lie spread-eagled on the ground, then they  frisked them.  </P> <P> "I was shaking in my boots. It was wild," said Kenny Harris, 19, a student at  Florida State University. He recalled at least one officer telling the young  men not to make any false moves.  </P> <P> Harris and the other eight sophomores explained to the law enforcement officers  that they were using a 21-foot sailboat to film a movie called "Florida Force"  as a summer project. They were videotaping the opening scene at the Ft. Walton  Beach marina and had set off firecrackers to simulate gunfire. That apparently  prompted someone to call authorities.  </P> <P> All nine were released after a stern lecture.  </P></p>

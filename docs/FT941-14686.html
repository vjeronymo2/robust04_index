			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / British Gas issues first 50-year Eurobond British Gas yesterday issued the first ever 50-year Eurosterling bond, taking advantage of low long-term UK interest rates. The company's decision to issue extra-long bonds was motivated by its desire to offer a novel investment vehicle to yield-hungry investors while securing low funding costs for itself, according to Mr Arthur Burgess, British Gas's treasurer. 'Long UK interest rates are around their lowest levels for the last 30 years and we wanted to lock in those low rates for the long term,' said Mr Burgess. He believes long-term rates are close to bottoming, and while UK gilt yields may still slip further, 'issuing spreads (relative to gilt yields) will probably widen out, so corporates won't be able to issue much more cheaply than they can now'. He said the maturity was also chosen for its novelty value. 'We could have tapped the 25 or 30-year sector, but we preferred to go further out on the yield curve to distinguish ourselves from competing paper,' he said. The main buyers of the bonds were UK life insurance companies and pension funds which like to match their long-term assets and liabilities. Some overseas demand for the paper was also reported, with investors attracted by the relatively high yields compared with government and corporate bonds in other European markets, as well as scope for further sterling appreciation. British Gas issued Pounds 200m of 7 1/8 per cent bonds maturing in February 2044 via CS First Boston. Buoyed by the gilt market rally, but also by strong investor demand, the bonds ended the day at 99.40 bid, well above their 98.74 re-offer price, yielding 49 basis points over the long gilt due 2017. Many observers expect more long-dated bond issues in the near future. 'The risk for borrowers is that, if they wait too long, they may miss an opportunity to lock in low funding rates,' said a market analyst at a London investment bank. Following the successful British Gas issue, he expects to see 'a few more copycat issues from UK companies, though they have to be very strong double-A rated names'. British Gas is rated AA2 by Moody's and AA-plus by Standard &amp; Poor's. Lex, Page 20; Capital markets, Page 29</p>

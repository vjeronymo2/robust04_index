			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / France holds fundamentalists France yesterday detained nine Algerian Moslem fundamentalists in a demonstration of its tough stance following this week's attack on an embassy building in Algiers in which five French police and consular officials died. The radical Armed Islamic Group claimed responsibility for the attack, the latest in a campaign against foreigners, which is aimed at destabilising the military-led Algerian government. Yesterday's detentions, ordered by Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, came as France sought to pressure western partners, including the US, Germany and Britain, into taking stronger action against Algerian Moslem militants on their soil. The nine fundamentalists, arrested in a dawn roundup, were interned at a disused army barracks and six were served with expulsion orders. Seven other suspected fundamentalists had previously been detained. Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, condemned religious fundamentalism at a ceremony for the five French victims. 'An ideology cannot be built on hatred. One does not serve religion by mixing it with terrorism,' he said.</p>

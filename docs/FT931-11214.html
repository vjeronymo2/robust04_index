			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Sudden return to turbulence PRESSURES inside the European exchange rate mechanism intensified yesterday after the Danish krone fell to its floors against 3 of the system's currencies in a sharp burst of speculative selling, writes James Blitz. The comparative calm that followed the devaluation of the Irish punt was rudely shattered as the krone became the sixth currency in the ERM to be threatened with devaluation. The krone had spent the first two days of this week on its ERM floor against the Irish punt. Yesterday, in the most turbulent day on the foreign exchanges since the autumn currency crisis, the Danish currency fell to its floors against the Dutch guilder and the D-Mark, despite a rise in Danish interest rates and heavy central bank intervention. After ERM trading closed yesterday, the krone was trading at DKr3.8954 to the D-Mark, narrowly above its ERM floor of DKr3.9016. The outlook for the Danish currency looked grim last night, partly because Danish investors had sold their currency in large quantities, a sign of acute currency weakness. The Belgian franc's fall to third from bottom of the ERM grid also indicated how serious tensions in the ERM have suddenly become. The Belgian currency's fortunes are closely linked to the D-Mark's. But yesterday, 3 month Belgian francs were trading about 20 basis points above 3-month D-Marks, a sign that investors may be looking for a premium against the break-up of the ERM. The pound dropped to historic new lows against the D-Mark and the Japanese yen in European trading. It closed in London at DM2.3600, down 1 1/2 pfennigs on the day and at FFr8.0025 against the French franc. The pound also slumped during the day to a new 1993 low of Dollars 1.4255 against a dollar which itself reached a 9-month high against the D-Mark. The pound closed in London at Dollars 1.4340, down more than a cent on the day. Yesterday's selling of the pound appeared to be short-term interbank speculation rather than investment fund selling. Mr Mark Austin of Midland Global Markets said that sales had been 'sporadic.' 'I would be surprised to see the pound go down from here in the near term,' he added. Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency economist at UBS Philips and Drew, was extremely pessimistic about the pound because money market dealers have already discounted a 100 basis point cut in base rates by the summer. The fall, he said, could only be explained by a loss of confidence in the government's strategy and a belief that it was pursuing a policy of 'benign neglect.' towards the exchange rate. 'There is a risk of a vertical fall for sterling which would have a very serious impact on financial markets,' he said.</p>

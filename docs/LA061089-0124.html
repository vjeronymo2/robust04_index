			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALMANAC / BUSINESS FINANCES: MONEY-MANAGING NEEDS CHANGE WITH GROWTH  </P> <P> Money is not only the mother's milk of politics, as the late state Treasurer  Jesse M. Unruh once said, it is the lifeblood of small business. And while  every company has its own needs and characteristics, there are some rules of  thumb for money management that most follow. Kevin Sayer, a manager at the  Newport Beach office of the accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Whinney, and Ralph  Sabin, a partner with the firm as well as head of its emerging-business  practice, recently outlined for The Times the three basic stages of a company's  growth -- and suggested the goals that a company's treasurer should aim for in  managing the finances through each stage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PHASE ONE: EARLY DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> In the early development stage, spend money on product development and  marketing and distribution. Keep administrative costs at a minimum. Production  costs will be high and profit margins slim because volume is low. The goal:  operate lean and don't lose too much money.  </P> <P> Assets  </P> <P> Property, Plant and Equipment 25%  </P> <P> Cash 15%  </P> <P> Accounts  </P> <P> Receivable 25%  </P> <P> Inventory 35%  </P> <P> Liabilities &amp; Equity  </P> <P> Equity 40%  </P> <P> Long-Term  </P> <P> Financing 10%  </P> <P> Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses 50%  </P> <P> CHARACTERISTICS:  </P> <P> Cash is a big slice of the pie at this stage because a hefty reserve is needed  to cover the unexpected.  </P> <P> Inventory is mainly raw materials. Not enough sales to have a large stock of  finished goods.  </P> <P> Don't make a substantial investment in facilities at this stage. Lease a small  building and minimum equipment.  </P> <P> Accounts payable is the biggest liability because equity and debt financing is  still difficult to obtain. Negotiate good terms with vendors.  </P> <P> To minimize cash flow, lease equipment.  </P> <P> Equity will tend to consist of personal funds, including loans and retained  earnings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PHASE TWO: GROWTH  </P> <P> Sales should be increasing, and efforts should be aimed at exploiting the  market. Keep product development costs at about the same percentage as in  development stage. Personnel increases will be required, but keep it under  control. For most firms, office and management systems for record-keeping,  information processing and inventory control won't keep pace with growth. Cash  shortages are common, so good bookkeeping is critical. If new facilities are  necessary, don't go overboard. It is cheaper to move again than to pay for  unused space.  </P> <P> Assets  </P> <P> Property, Plant and Equipment 20%  </P> <P> Cash 5%  </P> <P> Accounts  </P> <P> Receivable 35%  </P> <P> Inventory 35%  </P> <P> Other Assets 5%  </P> <P> Liabilities &amp; Equity  </P> <P> Equity 35%  </P> <P> Short-Term Financing 15%  </P> <P> Long-Term  </P> <P> Financing 15%  </P> <P> Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses 35%  </P> <P> CHARACTERISTICS:  </P> <P> Cash is tight during growth. Reserves are almost gone.  </P> <P> Accounts receivable grow because emphasis is on sales rather than on cash  collection.  </P> <P> Inventory is a combination of raw material and work in progress. Stay alert to  avoid accumulating obsolete material.  </P> <P> Most funds are left in the business, not withdrawn by owner.  </P> <P> Banks are more willing to extend credit lines, collateralized by accounts  receivable and inventory.  </P> <P> Vendors continue to help finance growth with extended credit terms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PHASE THREE: PROFITABILITY AND MATURITY  </P> <P> The focus is now on profits rather than sales. Financial arrangements with  banks and vendors should be improved. Management systems should be brought up  to date. Tax planning becomes increasingly important. This is the time to start  a program to reward key employees who contributed to the firm's success. It  will become necessary to decide whether to push for more expansion, to maintain  the status quo or to sell the business and take profits.  </P> <P> Assets  </P> <P> Property, Plant and Equipment 25%  </P> <P> Cash 15%  </P> <P> Accounts  </P> <P> Receivable 30%  </P> <P> Inventory 30%  </P> <P> Liabilities &amp; Equity  </P> <P> Equity 45%  </P> <P> Long-Term Financing 15%  </P> <P> Short-Term Financing 20%  </P> <P> Accounts Payable and Accrued  </P> <P> Expenses 20%  </P> <P> CHARACTERISTICS:  </P> <P> Cash reserves increase because of retained profits.  </P> <P> Receivables and inventory are less significant because management systems have  improved and the customer base has stabilized.  </P> <P> Inventory is primarily mainly finished goods.  </P> <P> Property, plant and equipment costs remain the same, most equipment is  purchased rather than leased.  </P> <P> Vendors extend favorable credit terms because bank credit can be used to take  advantage of vendor discounts for early payment.  </P> <P> Personal funds can be drawn out of the company, replaced by equity from outside  investors. Depending on tax strategy, cash flow can be distributed through  dividends, bonuses or salary increases.  </P> <P> Source: Ernst &amp; Whinney Emerging Business Group, Newport Beach  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Business and the Environment: A big loss of energy - Bronwen Maddox explains why Britain's carbon dioxide emissions are lower than previously forecast Economic recession and the decline of the British coal industry are some of the most effective ways of combating global warming. Those are two of the messages tucked away in the UK government's latest models of how much carbon dioxide the country will pour into the atmosphere in the next three decades. According to Energy Paper 59*, published last week, the UK will emit around 10 per cent less carbon dioxide, one of the main greenhouse gases, than was feared two years earlier in Energy Paper 58. On its most cautious projections, the UK is on course to bring carbon dioxide emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2000, in line with international targets. That alone is not news: projections showing that future emissions could be much lower than was once feared began to trickle out last December. But the new report spells out for the first time the reasons for the new, lower numbers. It also sheds light on the future of the UK energy industry, casts doubt on some of the government's favourite environmental boasts and shows that transport is one of the toughest remaining environmental obstacles. Most greenhouse gas emissions come from the use of energy. The model takes the two factors which have the biggest impact on the UK's demand for energy  -fossil fuel prices and GDP growth - and plots different combinations of them, adding in non-energy sources of greenhouse gases at the end. The calculations reveal several main reasons for the new, lower forecasts. Recession. Although the central scenario is the same in both models - annual GDP growth of 2.25 per cent - the high growth path now assumes 2.75 per cent, not 3.25. Changes in the structure of the economy. The decline of the energy sector from 9 per cent of GDP in 1990 to 4 per cent in 2020, and the decline of energy-intensive parts of manufacturing such as bulk chemicals. Service industries, which use relatively little energy, are expected to rise from 50 per cent of GDP in 1990 to 54 per cent in 2020. Changes in methods of electricity generation. In 1990, coal-fired power stations produced 68 per cent of the UK's electricity and nuclear 21 per cent. Since then some have been closed, and other closures announced. By 2020 the new model suggests that coal's share of electricity generation will have fallen to 27 per cent and nuclear to 2 per cent, on the assumption that no new nuclear stations are built after Sizewell B. Gas, which produces lower carbon emissions, may then have a 57 per cent share. The radical revision of the numbers, within two years, is a lesson about the crudeness of some of the models which are the basis for wide-ranging and costly international directives. It also raises a few sceptical questions about the government's proud adoption last summer of the year 2000 as the target for stabilising carbon dioxide emissions at the 1990 level of 160m tonnes, rather than its previous target of 2005. Energy Paper 59 suggests that economic slowdown and structural changes have made the target of the year 2000 much more accessible than was previously thought. On the other hand forecasts of emissions in 2005 - between 166m and 201m tonnes of carbon - still look disturbingly high. It is those longer-term projections which still give cause for worry. Falling energy prices, which push up demand for energy, are a principal concern, as the report acknowledges. One of the messages of the recent World Energy Congress in Madrid was that prices are unlikely to rise as shortages are not imminent. Carbon taxes have been proposed internationally as a solution. However, the report makes clear that this may not solve the problems of transport and households - together they produce 47 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions and their demand for energy is the least responsive to a hike in prices. The model shows transport overtaking industry as the largest single polluter by 2000. This weekend the Department of the Environment (DoE) launches a three-year Pounds 10m campaign to encourage households to lag water tanks and turn off lights. Transport will be tougher - the DoE has already made clear that controversial initiatives such as road pricing must wait for studies from the Department of Transport, which are unlikely to be completed for another year. *Energy-related carbon emissions in possible future scenarios for the United Kingdom, Department of Trade and Industry, HMSO Pounds 9.95.</p>

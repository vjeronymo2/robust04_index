			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Kohl v Scharping ends in draw IT WAS a taste of things to come: the first public clash of party leaders, Kohl against Scharping, the two certain combatants for next year's battle royal in the German elections, meeting each other for the first time across the floor of the German Bundestag. For those with a fine eye and ear for the parliamentary scrap, it was a surprisingly dignified affair. Whatever divides the two gentlemen from the Rhineland Palatinate, they clearly share a mutual respect. The youthful Mr Rudolf Scharping, 45, barely 100 days in office as leader of the Social Democrats (SPD), delivered an hour-long onslaught on the record of his rival with only a handful of notes to guide him. He steered clear of personal invective, stuck to the issues of unemployment, social spending, and the soaring budget deficit, and his opponents were obviously impressed. As for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the charges against his government of incompetence, lack of vision and failure of leadership simply rolled off his broad back. He gave the occasional word of advice on how his young challenger might one day hope to fill his office. It was painfully condescending. However, Mr Wolfgang Schauble, parliamentary leader of Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, and the big man's heir apparent, showed he remains a street-fighter in spite of being confined to a wheelchair. He accused Ms Ingrid Matthaus-Maier, the SPD shadow finance minister, of spouting 'unutterable rubbish' in her budget speech, causing that normally unflappable lady to storm out of the chamber. Mr Scharping only put one foot wrong: he suggested that even if the chancellor had firmly squashed talk of curbing old age pensions at this stage, his party would surely come back to its nefarious plans 'after the elections in 1994', implying that the CDU would win. It was a small slip, on a day with honours even.</p>

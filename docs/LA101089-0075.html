			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> STORIES EXPLORE THE VARIETY OF RESPONSE  </P> <P> After You've Gone: Stories by Alice Adams (Knopf: $18.95; 220 pages.)  </P> <P> Though these stories are tenuously related by a preoccupation with themes of  parting, loss and separation, the ways in which Alice Adams' characters cope  with change, or sometimes with the mere idea of change, lends each one a  particular distinction. The author is concerned with the varieties of response  that similar circumstances can elicit, and while her people may seem to  confront analogous situations, their reactions range from stoicism to despair,  with stops at every emotional way station in between.  </P> <P> The title story effectively sets the mood. We're listening to a woman attorney  describing the first few painful months after her poet lover has decamped for  an Oregon houseboat with his latest young infatuate. The narrator's tone is  cool and composed, rueful but not self-pitying. She is, after all, a lawyer,  adept at making the best of unwelcome facts by setting them down and analyzing  the possibilities. For a while, she tells us, "I managed very well indeed,  coping with the house and its curious breakages" -- all the major and minor  appliances, from car to Cuisinart, disintegrating the moment the poet is no  longer in residence, as if love were the engine that ran them.  </P> <P> There's no logic in this, but the symbolism is inescapable. Their mutual  friends present another problem, either too eagerly sympathetic, altogether  indifferent, or noticeably partisan. Nights are bleak, even though she had  never believed the relationship would last forever, only that the first two  years were the test. Easily, she admits missing his creative cooking, not  flinching from the knowledge that "cooking" covers every aspect of domesticity.  </P> <P> Even so, she keeps her equilibrium until the letters from the new lady love  begin to arrive -- requests for advice on how to please the man she's charmed  away from the storyteller. The letters are pathetic and unsettling, coming just  as the lawyer is beginning to reassemble her own life. She's played the role of  deserted woman with dignity -- must she now be her successor's mentor?  </P> <P> "1940: Fall" is a fictional memoir of the year in which a high school girl  first becomes aware of the anguished world beyond the tranquillity of Madison,  Wis. Her consciousness is raised by a refugee boy whose anti-Nazi father had  been one of the earliest casualties of the war. The story briskly moves forward  to the present, when that Midwestern teen-ager, now a mature and respected  psychologist, is dining alone in a San Diego restaurant, the common fate of  woman authors on promotional tours. Of course the man at the next table is Egon  Heller, the refugee in her high school class. Like her, he's reached  distinguished late middle age, and with a bit of prompting, he recognizes her,  but not the crucial role he played in her maturation.  </P> <P> "What to Wear" is a remarkable tour de force, showing what a skilled writer can  do with the scenario of a woman deciding on an appropriate outfit for a special  occasion. Make the woman a professor of literature, the occasion her visit to a  lover in a mental hospital, and you've turned an apparently banal dilemma into  a psychological drama revealing everything relevant to these two people.  </P> <P> There's a perceptible feminist undertow to these stories, a slight but  noticeable pull that becomes apparent only when you're standing safely on the  shore. Adams specializes in admirable women hopelessly involved with unworthy  men; virtues and flaws taking sophisticated forms and shapes, appearing in  various degrees. The stories are non-judgmental, but there's no mistaking just  which party is generally left to cope, grieve and adjust after the defection of  the other. While Adams never actually disparages her male characters, she lets  them bare the less agreeable sides of their personalities, while the women glow  with courage, understanding and resilience -- sometimes only by contrast, but  that's enough.  </P></p>

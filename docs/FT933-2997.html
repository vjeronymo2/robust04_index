			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Cadbury delays measure by a year A REQUIREMENT for companies to comment on the state of their internal controls in their annual reports is unlikely to be in force before the end of next year, it emerged yesterday. Commentary on whether a company is a viable 'going concern' is also likely to be delayed at least until next summer, after an announcement yesterday by the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance. Draft proposals prompted by the committee for a third financial statement on companies' interim accounts will probably be considered by accounting standards-setters within the next six months. The delays come in response to growing concerns by companies that they are being expected to comply too quickly with excessive new demands for financial information. Big companies' concerns began with an initial requirement by the Stock Exchange that they comment on compliance with the Cadbury code from financial year-ends after June this year. Yesterday's statement said there would in future be proper consultation and adequate time for companies to implement guidance for compliance with Cadbury. It said proposals on internal controls would be published 'shortly', but are expected to be followed by a consultation period of at least six months. 'Going-concern' guidelines are to be submitted to the committee for consideration at the end of November, but are unlikely to be in place for financial year-ends next March. Interim accounts proposals currently being considered are to be recommended in the next six months. The statement followed a meeting on Tuesday between representatives from the 100 Group of leading finance directors, the Accounting Standards Board, the Financial Reporting Council, the Auditing Practices Board and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.</p>

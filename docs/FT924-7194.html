			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / All-out strike called on London Underground LONDON COMMUTERS could face chaos on the capital's Tube network after members of the RMT rail union yesterday voted 3-1 to take indefinite strike action from Monday night. The vote, by 55 per cent of the union's 11,000 members on London Underground, is a protest at the most radical plan to shake up pay and conditions on London Underground in 40 years. However, London Underground says it is not prepared to yield on the reforms and claims to have the full support of Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, for a showdown with the unions. It also says it has enough staff willing to run a strike-breaking service. Some passengers will be able to travel free as there are unlikely to be enough ticket staff. Earlier this week Mr Ian Arthurson, London Underground's director of passenger services, wrote to the leaders of all three rail unions and their members warning that strik-ers would risk dismissal. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said: 'The only way to deal with bullies is to stand up to them and that is what RMT members will do.' Some union officials privately admit their members may be intimidated by such tactics and seem less confident of victory than in 1989, when the Underground suffered 17 one-day strikes. Other union officials say they hope to be able to follow the coal unions in winning public support for a strike against redundancies. The union says the plan will cut 5,000 of the 21,000 Tube jobs and reduce pay for 30 per cent of staff, although earnings will be protected for three years. The RMT vote follows decisions by the TSSA white-collar rail union and the Aslef train drivers' union to ballot their roughly 3,000 members on strike action and action short of strikes. The unions say TSSA and Aslef members have overwhelmingly rejected London Underground's plan in internal consultations. However, the response by TSSA members was small and nearly 50 per cent of Aslef drivers who received the new contracts from London Underground have accepted them. Negotiators at TSSA and Aslef say members are not principally concerned about pay but rather about the effect on conditions - for example, withdrawal of cover for staff on meal breaks. London Underground said only 40 per cent of union members supported the strike call. 'On past performance that means they would have difficulty sustaining a strike. We believe the majority of Underground workers see the benefits that are on offer to them. We would be very surprised if there were to throw these benefits over board in a futile strike.' Mr Wilf Proudfoot, assistant general secretary of RMT, said: 'I am confident we will get the support of members. What London Underground want to do is unprecedented in modern Britain.'

			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (5): Opera, heritage and technology - Leisure: an international view A NEW opera house for the world-renowned Welsh National Opera Company will lie at the heart of Cardiff Bay. Grosvenor Waterside has provided a site facing the inner harbour for the Pounds 40m building; a financial package is being put together under the aegis of the Welsh Arts Council; government support, crucial to such a public scheme, is now (at least, unofficially) committed; and an architectural competition will be held to ensure that the building compares with the best in the world. The opera house will be a centre for the performing arts. This was always the intention of Lord Crickhowell, secretary of state for Wales between 1979 and 1987, who did so much to get the project moving, but it is also meant to be a statement that Cardiff bay, and the Welsh capital in general, represent an international arena able to play host to any event which is looking for a home. The opera house is not the only international centre planned. Long before the first curtain call on the opening evening, Cardiff bay will have National Techniquest, a hands-on science discovery centre, and a vastly enlarged industrial and maritime museum. Techniquest's new home, costing Pounds 7.5m, is now being built, and Professor John Beetlestone, its director, hopes the doors will be open by the autumn of next year. The industrial museum, an arm of the National Museum of Wales, was opened in 1977 and the extention - costing about Pounds 25-30m - is a longer-term project. If work starts next year it should be completed around the turn of the century. All three - opera house, Techniquest and museum - are part of the drive to internationalise the city. Techniquest was opened in November 1986, the brainchild of Beetlestone. Children - from 9 to 90 - can play with, or operate, the exhibits, and with 100,000 visitors this year it has become one of the leading attractions in Wales. The building now under construction will allow the centre to develop its full potential. 'The quality of our exhibits already has international recognition,' Beetlestone says. 'We have sold our exhibits to the similar facility in Toronto, one of the first to be set up in the world, to the Australian National Science and Technical Centre in Canberra, and to Eksperimentarium in Copenhagen. Canberra has 24 exhibits which originated in Cardiff. Professor Beetlestone believes there has to be harmony between the exhibits and the buildings in which they are housed, something which he claims is missing both in Canberra and in Helsinki's famous Eureka centre. 'Helsinki may have won awards for its architecture, but people there admit they are working against the building. In Australia, although the building is just 200 yards from parliament and next to the national library and the law courts, it does not work as an exhibition centre.' To overcome difficulties of this sort, Cardiff has commissioned an international architect, Paul Koralec, of ABK, to design a place in which there is natural harmony between shell and contents. Futuristic conceptions may be a little beyond the industrial and maritime museum, but Dr Stuart Owen-Jones, the keeper, believes he will be able to achieve similar results. Development at the industrial building in Cardiff Bay can now be considered because the Pounds 26m work on new galleries within the main building in the city's Cathays Park civic centre is drawing to a close, ready for its official opening in October. 'Development in Cardiff Bay is the logical next step,' Mr Alistair Wilson, director of the National Museum of Wales, of which the industrial museum is a part, says. Any industrial museum needs far more space than one devoted to pottery, paintings or small artefacts. By its nature, much of industrial machinery is large. The National Museum of Wales has many exhibits which it simply cannot display. Despite this problem, the industrial museum has doubled its attendance figures to around 70,000 over the past three years, as increasing emphasis has been put on a range of exhibitions and school programmes. 'Now that we know the infrastructure which will be put in pace in Cardiff Bay, we are in a much better position to plot our own future,' Dr Owen-Jones says. 'We know the industrial and maritime museum will be an integral part of the inner harbour and this allows us to plan ahead with some confidence. 'We intend to ensure that Cardiff's role as a leading coal-exporting port, and Wales's place as one of the most important coal-producing countries in the world, are fully reflected. 'But we shall not just be looking to the past. The museum will be about the industries that replaced coal and steel and slate and chemicals. Like Techniquest and the opera house, we intend to be a museum with international status.'</p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STUDENTS, STUDENTS EVERYWHERE AND NARY A PLACE TO SIT;  </P> <P> THE REAL TRICK IS FINDING MONEY FOR CONSTRUCTION  </P> <P> The challenge for school administrators in coping with growing enrollment is  not to accurately project class sizes so they can plan, on paper, enough  schools to accommodate the incoming students.  </P> <P> The tricky part is finding the money to pay for new schools -- which cost from  $10 million to upward of $30 million each, depending on the grade levels they  will serve.  </P> <P> The traditional source for the bulk of school construction money has been  property taxes and contributions from the state. But Proposition 13's passage  11 years ago effectively shut down that as a major source of funds, and the  state's kitty for school construction money is flat busted.  </P> <P> A number of school districts in San Diego County are successfully pursuing a  type of school financing called Mello-Roos, which essentially is a bond  authorized by landowners rather than voters.  </P> <P> Under Mello-Roos, if a particular land area has fewer than 10 registered voters  -- such as a large, undeveloped tract of property -- the property owners  themselves can approve the bond measure and promise to repay the  </P> <P> indebtedness through tax assessments on their property. Developers, however,  pass that tax debt on to the homeowners who will buy the property and homes  they are developing, thereby effectively passing on to future residents the  cost of providing schools for their children. A homeowner knows, going into his  purchase, that he faces the additional tax.  </P> <P> Typically, the school district will not authorize sale of the bonds until a  certain percentage of the homes are purchased, and then use that revenue to  build the schools needed to serve those new neighborhoods. Some districts -- as  was the case last year in Carlsbad -- negotiate with the developer to pay the  bond debt up front so school construction can begin that much sooner. The  developer then gets reimbursed when he sells the homes in subsequent years.  </P> <P> Some districts don't have the opportunity to pursue Mello-Roos financing,  however, because there are no large tracts of undeveloped land within their  district to tap as a bond-repayment source, and Mello-Roos isn't feasible on  smaller developments.  </P> <P> Other districts, if they have the support of the city councils that approve  new, large developments, sometimes win negotiated settlements directly with a  developer to donate a land site or, better yet, fund the construction of entire  schools as a condition of the approval of their development by the council.  </P> <P> That has occurred in the San Dieguito High School District, which, with the  cooperation of the San Diego City Council and the two major builders of North  City West, got more than $30 million from the developers to pay for a new high  school, said Eric Hall, director of administrative services for the district.  </P> <P> The San Marcos Unified School District won a similar agreement with a builder  developing a large, master-planned development near Palomar College who  promised to pay for a new elementary school out of his pocket to serve his new  neighborhood.  </P> <P> "It helps to have a City Council on your side," said San Marcos Supt. Mac  Bernd. "Our city fathers are buffeted by a lot of competing interests, but  schools are very important to them and they're doing all they can (with  developer agreements imposed by City Hall) to assist us. Ours is a City Council  that realizes that the infrastructure of a community goes beyond roads and  sewers and water mains and fire stations, and includes schools as an essential  part of a community."  </P> <P> By contrast in neighboring Escondido, the City Council has pursued no such  agreements with builders, and, in fact, ordered the school district to pay for  much of the public works improvements before it approved the construction of a  new campus at Kit Carson Park.  </P> <P> The San Marcos Unified School District found yet another way to finance an  elementary school that opened last year: It sold certificates of participation  through a brokerage house -- private bonds to investors that will be repaid as  other developer-impact fees trickle into the district.  </P> <P> "It's an expensive way to go because of the interest rates and brokerage fees  we have to pay, but it got us the money we needed at the time we needed it to  build a school," said Jeff Oken, facilities administrator for the district.  "The school district is the guarantor of the bonds, and we're counting on  developer fees to keep coming in to repay them."  </P> <P> In Carlsbad, a new elementary school completed two years ago was financed  through developer-impact fees collected over many years, and the kitty was  virtually drained, said Georgiana Kirby, manager of information systems for the  Carlsbad Unified School District.  </P> <P> Another new elementary school, scheduled to open in 12 months, was financed  through Mello-Roos bonds.  </P> <P> Carlsbad needs to build six more schools -- and is hoping to work a deal with  the city, now under study, in which a citywide assessment district will be  established to generate construction funds.  </P> <P> The Solana Beach Union (elementary) School District is counting on developer  contributions to finance the two schools it hopes to build -- one to serve  Fairbanks Ranch, the other for North City West.  </P> <P> "A developer donated a 10-acre site in Fairbanks Ranch, and we're hoping we can  apply that as our contribution so we can get the equivalent in matching funds  from the state to help pay for the school," said Supt. Raymond Edman.  </P> <P> The problem, though, is that the state is broke and faces a backlog of more  than $7 billion in requests for help to build new schools throughout the state.  </P> <P> Already, districts are queuing up to tap $1 billion in state funds that they  hope will be made available if Sacramento authorizes -- and voters approve -- a  bond measure next year.  </P> <P> While the state may have been considered for years as the bail-out funding  source for local school districts, voter sentiment and legislation in  Sacramento has undermined school districts in more recent years, school  officials complain.  </P> <P> The single worst blow was the passage in 1978 of Proposition 13, which limited  the increase of property taxes that had been a major source of school  construction money and that required a two-thirds voter approval for bond  measures -- a threshold that few districts can meet.  </P> <P> State law was changed several years ago and aggravated the problem. Prior to  the law, a city council or county board of supervisors, on behalf of school  districts, could assess whatever level of builder fees it wanted on new  construction to help finance new schools, and some districts were able to  collect upward of $4 on every square foot of new residential construction --  enough money to pay for new schools.  </P> <P> The state put a $1.57-per-square-foot limit on that developer-impact fee,  however -- and now, every time a new home is approved for construction,  districts receive less than half the amount of money needed from that home to  provide school housing for those residents. With every new home built, then,  districts are falling further behind in paying for new schools.  </P> <P> The law change also affected a school district's right to tell a city or county  that there is no school space available to serve a new development. Without the  assurance from a school that it could properly house new students, the  municipality or county in the past could reject new development. But the new  law forbids that protocol, saying that the schools effectively were making  land-use decisions on the basis of whether school classrooms were available.  </P> <P> Now a developer can build his homes without regard to the availability of  classroom seating to serve the new residents, and homes are being built with no  guarantee that the residents' children will have a place to go to school.  </P> <P> There is proposed additional legislation in Sacramento that will strike another  blow against schools. The proposed law by Sen. Bill Greene (D-Los Angeles)  would prohibit cities and counties from practicing their current option of  requiring developers to build schools as a condition of receiving zoning or  general plan amendments that would allow those new developments.  </P> <P> If that law were already in effect, the developers of North City West and in  San Marcos, for instance, could not have been required to fund new schools  there -- even though they were willing to as the cost of doing business and  providing classrooms for newcomers to the community.  </P> <P> Tom Robinson of the county's Office of Education suggests that dramatic changes  in law will be needed to give school districts a better future.  </P> <P> "We will live or die on the acceptance of continuing the philosophy of Prop.  13," he said. A bill that would amend that state constitutional amendment has  been proposed, he noted, "but it will be a very difficult task for it to be  approved."  </P> <P> "So right now, we're all hanging our hats on a billion-dollar bond measure next  June," he said. And even that would only be a Band-Aid fix.  </P> <P> The other options still remain: Mello-Roos financing, developer contributions  and year-round schools and double sessions, where half of a school's student  population attends classes starting in the early morning and the other half  stays in school until late afternoon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GROWING AND GROWING  </P> <P> The following is a list of some of the fastest-growing school districts in San  Diego County, showing the number of students who were enrolled 10 years ago, 5  years ago, last year and this year, and a projection to the year 2000.  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.32IN:2.11IN:2.11IN:2.11IN:2.11IN:2.11IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="6"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL>

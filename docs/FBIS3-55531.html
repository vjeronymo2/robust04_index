Members of the bloc's executive  committee and representatives of Russia's Choice in the deputies  commissions, who are members of the organizational committee to  prepare the State Duma's work, made this decision on Thursday  evening.    Commenting this decision for INTERFAX, Yegor Gaydar's aide  explained position of Russia's Choice bloc's leader on this  issue. He said that despite the unacceptability to cooperate  with the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, at the request of  small parliamentary factions the bloc had participated in the  negotiations because it believes that it should use any chance  for a constructive work of the State Duma.    However, as Gaydar's aide said, in the course of the  negotiations on the future chairman of the State Duma, his  deputies and chairmen of the parliamentary committees, opponents  of Russia's Choice bloc tried to prolong the time because at  every sitting they offered new candidacies to replace those  approved the day before.    It has become obvious, he said, that "a tripartite bloc,"  consisting of Liberal Democratic Party, Communist party, and  Agrarian Party of Russia, has formed in the process of the  negotiations which has started to divide the posts of  parliamentary committees' leaders. According to their plans,  representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party must head, in  particular, the committee on international affairs and defense,  representatives of the communist party -- committees on state  security and economic policy, and a representative of the  Agrarian party -- a committee on constitutional legislature and  legal reform.    Under this situation the Russia's Choice bloc has decided  that it will not participate in such a division of the State  Duma and make it legal as it is prematurely a non-constrcutive  one. Simultaneously Russia's Choice called the State Duma's  democratic factions, that is, all factions except the Liberal  Democratic Party, Communist party, and Agrarian party to hold  active consultations in order to adopt decisions which would  promote for the constrcutive work of the State Duma.    "It will not take much time if there is a mutual wish to  find  a coordinated decision," said INTERFAX interlocutor. In his  words, Russia's Choice views the principle according to which  representative of one of the small factions must become chairman  of the State Duma and representatives of Russia's Choice,  Liberal Democratic Party, Communist party, and Agrarian party -  his deputies as "rather doubtful because it does not take into  account interests of small factions."    According to Gaydar's aide, Russia's Choice would agree to  see either Alevtina Fedulova (leader of Russia's Women bloc), or  first deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin or Vladimir  Lukin, both representing Yavlinskiy's bloc, on the post of the  chairman of the State Duma.    Yegor Gaydar's aide also reported that in the course of a  two-day working conference held by the members of the bloc on  January 5-6, the Russia's Choice bloc had discussed the bloc's  tactics in the Duma and working documents to be submitted to the  parliament by Russia's Choice.    Russia's Choice wants to propose to the State Duma to go  through the organizational stage as soon as possible and to  concentrate its efforts on the law making work. However, "the  situation is being painfully worsening," said INTERFAX  interlocutor.</p>

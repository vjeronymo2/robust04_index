			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Records: Standard Joe is pick of the jazz TO DEFINE the 'best' jazz CDs of the year would be to exclude everything else that was worthwhile in a good year. It might be more useful to point up those discs which, had you spent the year in tank immersion therapy, you should go and buy, as soon as you are dry, to catch up. Thus, there are no re-issues here. Start with Joe Henderson's Lush Life (Verve 314 511 779) and The Standard Joe (Red 123248). Loathe as I am to follow popular consensus, Henderson's stately tenor sound has overshadowed anything else heard this year. His spaciously constructed treatment of the music of Billy Strayhorn has a dreamlike clarity. Vibrato-less and bone smooth, the tenor swoops and swings gracefully in trio, quartet and quintet settings, alongside and inside the golden tone of trumpeter Wynton Marsalis. Solo or in duet with young Christian McBride's bass, Henderson's matured improvisation is rich in melancholic detail, with 'Isfahan' and 'Lush Life' itself. The Standard Joe, an earlier date, contains similarly exquisite treatment of standards like 'Blue Bossa' and 'Round Midnight', this time with regular sidemen Rufus Reid (bass) and Al Foster (drums). To come up to date with what the younger, more impetuous jazz generation have been doing to the music, get hold of a copy of The Vibe (BMG/Novus PD90668), trumpeter Roy Hargrove's third date. Twenty-three years old and touring a tight young quintet, Hargrove gives hope to those who thought attacking jazz trumpet died with Lee Morgan. Unencumbered by diffidence, Hargrove's trumpet burns bright and long against the boppy pyrotechnics of pianist Marc Carey and drummer Gregory Hutchinson who uses a bass drum the size of a biscuit tin. Antonio Hart, a shooting star in his own right, weaves around Hargrove effortlessly with the alto. (Interestingly, Hutchinson also appears on Lush Life and both he and pianist Carey learnt their chops with singer Betty Carter.) Having found out what young Americans are doing, discover next the state of the art in the UK with tenorist Courtney Pine's To The Eyes Of Creation (Island 9998 514044). As 'commercial' as he is deep, Pine could tame an army of quickstepping cobras with the soprano and still have the breath to unfurl a measured reggae ballad on tenor. The definitive sound of London jazz, Pine moves easily between soul and the squeaky stuff and with this sixth album defies all those who said he done too much, much too young. Unlike Pine, who has been a part of the home jazz scene since the music was rediscovered by the big labels at the end of the 1980s, South Afri can pianist Bheki Mseleku seemed to drop out of the sky on to an unsuspecting public on a new label. In Celebration (World Circuit WCD 028) he is joined by the tenors of Pine and fellow World Circuit player Jean Toussaint, driven by the sophisticated poly-rhythm section of Marvin 'Smitty' Smith (drums) and Michael Bowie (upright bass). The swaying compositions are all his own and with his unhampered Bud Powell inflected playing he carries with them an uncut emotion that has become a trademark of South African jazz. Another surprise landing on the family welcome mat was Tee Vee (Warner/veraBra 2050) from Australian pianist Paul Grabowsky. A hideously conceived cover conceals an album of catchy Grabowsky compositions which combine Bill Evans' lines with a funky back beat. Well placed spaces in this extremely likeable debut are filled with furious scribbling from the tenor of Dale Barlow and the bristling 'bone of Simon Kent. But if on emerging from isolation you discover that it is still raining and Jazz FM is playing the same Sade song, you may wish to return whence you came. To help with the meditation take a handful of typically transcendental ECM discs such as Keith Jarrett's Vienna, John Surman's Adventure Playground or Hal Russell's Hal's Bells with you. As an alternative to the mainstream, this year's output from Munich has been exhilarating and eclectic as ever.</p>

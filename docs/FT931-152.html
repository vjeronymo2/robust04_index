			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Analyst fined over insider deal MR Thorold Mackie, a Scottish investment analyst, was yesterday found guilty of insider dealing at the Court of Session in Edinburgh. He was fined Pounds 25,000. The verdict, by a majority of the 15-member jury in Scotland's principal court, shocked people in the Edinburgh financial community, where Mr Mackie is a well-known figure. The trial, which lasted seven days, concerned a profits warning by the Glasgow-based waste disposal company Shanks &amp; McEwan. Mr Peter Runciman, chairman of SME, had told the court that in September 1991 he informed Mr Mackie in confidence that SME was shortly to issue a profits warning. Mr Mackie was accused under the 1985 Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act of 'counselling and procuring' two salesmen at Bell Lawrie White, the Edinburgh stockbrokers for which he worked, to deal in SME shares on behalf of clients. By selling ahead of the profits warning the shares realised Pounds 1.396m more than they would have done after the warning was issued, the court heard. Mr Mackie had told the court that Mr Runciman did not mention a profits warning at the meeting, but told him that there would be 'little by way of growth in earnings per share' for SME in the current half year. Temporary judge Sheriff Robin McEwan, QC, told Mr Mackie, 39, that 'insider dealing was a modern creation which nevertheless has to be regarded seriously. The probity of dealing on a public stock exchange and the confidence of the public are of great importance in this country.' He acknowledged that Mr Mackie's offence had not been committed for personal gain, but as a consequence of it Bell Lawrie White had transacted business for which it must have earned considerable fees. In mitigation Mr Donald Macfadyen, QC, defending, said that Mr Mackie had been suspended from membership of the Securities and Futures Authority when he was charged a year ago. This had prevented him from advising clients in a professional capacity, and his membership was now likely to be terminated, he said. Mr Mackie is understood to be considering an appeal.

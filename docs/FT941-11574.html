			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Northwest Airlines cuts routes to Australia Northwest Airlines, the fourth-largest US carrier, is to reduce sharply its south Pacific services to Australia, but will increase flights between the US and Japan. Northwest, which was the focus of a Pacific routes dispute between the US and Australian governments last year, is the latest airline to announce it is withdrawing or substantially reducing its US-Australia services. The carrier said it would suspend its thrice-weekly service between Sydney and Los Angeles, and cut its weekly frequencies from Sydney to Detroit via Osaka from three to one. Resources would be deployed instead in expanded Detroit-Tokyo and Los Angeles-Osaka services. Northwest's move follows Continental Airlines' decision to pull out of the Australasian market last autumn after 14 years. American Airlines abandonned the south Pacific route in 1992. United Airlines, the Chicago-based carrier, and Australia's Qantas have also restructured their services in this area in an effort to improve returns, although both carriers continue to provide services.</p>

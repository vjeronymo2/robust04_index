			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'REDUCING CRIME BY PREVENTION'  </P> <P> Your lead story (Times, July 27) dealt with the recently released independent  Long Beach study of the Police Department.  </P> <P> The study clearly shows that the city does not need the 25% increase in  officers (about $16 million per year) that Police Chief Lawrence Binkley and  the City Council have been asking for, if the present police force is used more  efficiently.  </P> <P> Yet, as your story reports, some council members are still calling for more  police. Do they seriously think the public will vote to raise their taxes to  subsidize an inefficiently managed Police Department?  </P> <P> Long Beach now has a golden opportunity to do something about reducing crime by  prevention, not simply by pouring more police on the streets.  </P> <P> What is needed is to apply all available -- and some new -- funding sources in  combating the causes of crime (through) programs such as drug rehabilitation  centers, parks and recreation, job training and jobs.  </P> <P> The city is considering placing a $6-million special tax on the ballot to  enhance recreational facilities. These are the kinds of crime-fighting programs  Long Beach needs.  </P> <P> SID SOLOMON  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P> <P>  Solomon is political action chairman of Long Beach Area Citizens Involved.  </P></p>

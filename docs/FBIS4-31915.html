			<p>BFN     [Text] The negotiations that were interrupted at 0130  between the government team, which includes State Ministers Dan  Mircea Popescu and Florin Georgescu, Viorel Hrebenciuc, general  secretary of the government, and Octavian Partenie, head of the  office in charge of the government's relations with trade unions  and employers organization, and counselors, experts, and  representatives of the Alfa Cartel and the National Trade Union  Block and delegations led by Alfa Cartel Bogdan Hossu, resumed  shortly before 1500.    In the first 15 minutes, the representatives of trade unions  explained that the minutes of the meeting, which were completed  last night but not signed, include the government's viewpoint  but, as far as the viewpoint of trade unions are concerned,  there are several controversial points. Romulus Nita, vice  president of the Alfa Cartel, immediately insisted that the  talks should focus on Government Ordinance Number 13 to find  ways to invalidate it. At this hour, the talks are in progress,  our correspondents informed us.    Meantime, our correspondent informed us on the phone that  Victoria Square continues to be occupied by Alfa Cartel trade  union members. Trade union representatives from Focsani and  Tulcea have joined the groups of demonstrators. The size of the  law enforcement units, as well as their technical equipment,  have also increased considerably.</p>

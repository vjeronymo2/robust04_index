The future of the United States is  closely related to the Asia-Pacific region, which is recording  the fastest economic growth in the world, so we must develop our  relations with this region." U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher also said: "In the 21st century, no other region  will be more important than the Asia- Pacific region to the  United States." All this shows that the United States has  substantially adjusted its diplomatic policy, which has become  noticeably inclined toward the Asia-Pacific region.    People made different assessments on the degree to which the  United States would adjust its Asia-Pacific strategy. One  opinion holds that the focus of U.S. diplomatic strategy had  shifted to the Asia-Pacific region. The other opinion holds  that the focus of U.S. diplomatic strategy as a whole remains in  Europe, and it will only be shifted to the Asia-Pacific region  in the future. It seems that both opinions are not completely  correct. As the Cold War just ended recently, U.S. diplomatic  strategy remains in a process of adjustment, and its strategic  focus still bears the characteristics of being "transitional"  and replaceable. One should not simply follow the conventional  concept of "only one focus." After the dissolution of the  Soviet Union, tremendous changes occurred in the world pattern,  and U.S. diplomatic strategy is also facing comprehensive  adjustments. In the process of adjustments, actual conditions  and objective contradictions did not develop to a degree which  required a comprehensive shift in focus. That is, the original  focus could not be removed immediately, and the new focus could  not be established in one single move. Instead, there would be  a period of transition and replacement. In such a period, there  would not be only "one focus"; instead, "two" different "foci"  would appear at the same time. This has been shown by the  speeches of U.S. Government leaders. Shortly after the Seattle  meeting, Christopher said that during the cold war, the United  States had naturally focused its strategy on Europe, because it  had to contain the Soviet Union. "Today, we are watching every  region of the globe at the same time. Due to our economic and  security needs, we have interests in Asia." When attending the  NATO summit meeting in Brussels, Clinton also said explicitly:  "The core of U.S. security remains in Europe." However, he  added: "It is beyond doubt that Europe is not the only key  point about which the United States cares." They made it clear  that the United States would "watch every region at the same  time" and that Europe would remain the "core of U.S. security"  but "not the only key point." All this means that there is more  than one key point in U.S. diplomatic strategy.    Europe remains the focus of U.S. diplomacy, because most of  the world's developed countries are in Europe. In the present  stage and for a fairly long time to come, Europe will continue  to be the center of international struggle, and the United  States must lay the focus of its diplomacy in Europe. Because  many allies of the United States are European countries and the  United States is trying to maintain its status as the leader of  the West and the world, it will have to first maintain its  leading position in Europe. Recently, extreme nationalist  forces have risen in Russia, and this cannot but cause concern  and apprehension to the United States. In addition, the United  States is still trying to keep more than 100,000 troops in  Europe after the end of the Cold War, and this shows that Europe  remains the key point of U.S. security interests. However,  because of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the direct  threat to U.S. security has disappeared, and the United States  has also adjusted and scaled down its European strategy. For  example, in order to lighten the European defense burden, the  United States has tried to let the European nations bear as much  of the defense role as possible. Therefore, although Europe  remains the focus of U.S. strategy, it is not quite the same as  in the Cold War period.    The United States not only has major security interests in  Europe, but it also has major economic interests there. At  present, the United States gains 60 percent of its profits  earned overseas from Europe, over half of its overseas  investments are in Europe, and 65 percent of foreign investment  in the United States is from Europe. Although Europe is so  important to U.S. economic interests, the United States has  begun to shift the strategic "focus" of its "economic security"  to the Asia-Pacific region, because U.S. investment in Asia has  been increasing faster than in other regions, and its bilateral  trade with Asia greatly exceeds that with Europe. According to  statistics, between 1989 and 1992, U.S. direct investment in  Asia (excluding Japan) increased by 56 percent, far higher than  the 26-percent growth in overall U.S. investment overseas in  this period. According to a survey conducted by the U.S.  Department of Commerce, the rate of return from U.S. investment  in Asia between 1989 and 1991 exceeded 23 percent, which was  almost twice as much as the average rate of investment returns  in the 24 major industrial countries in the world in the same  period. The annual volume of bilateral trade between the United  States and Asia exceeds $360 billion, which is more than four  times that of 15 years ago and nearly 40 percent higher than the  volume of bilateral trade between the United States and Europe.  Although it will still take time for U.S. economic interests in  Asia to exceed those in Europe in all fields, the development  tendency as a whole has already shown that the focus of U.S.  economic interests is being shifted to the Asia-Pacific region.    In short, it is still too early to say that the focus of  U.S. diplomatic strategy as a whole has been completely shifted  to the Asia-Pacific region, and it is also unrealistic to say  that the focus of U.S. diplomatic strategy as a whole remains in  Europe. In the post-Cold War transitional period and at the turn  of the century, adjustments in U.S. diplomatic strategy will  bear a transitional nature. At present and for a certain period  to come, there cannot be just "one focus"; instead, there will  be two different "key points." Concretely speaking, the focus  of political and military "security interests" in U.S.  diplomatic strategy remain in Europe for now, but the focus of  its economic interests has been shifted to the Asia-Pacific  region. Because the United States places economic policy at the  center of its diplomatic strategy, the development tendency  shows that the Asia-Pacific region will hold an increasingly  important position in U.S. diplomatic strategy.</p>

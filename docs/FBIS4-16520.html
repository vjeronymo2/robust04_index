			<p>BFN     [Text] VILNIUS, Apr 15, BNS - The Lithuanian Conservative  Party announced its intention to initiate a referendum aimed at  stopping illegal privatization and compensating devaluated  savings of the population.    On April 21, the party will start collecting signatures  under  a petition demanding a referendum to adopt a constitutional law  dealing with illegal privatization, devaluated savings and  company shares, as well as violations of the law.    The party's board made the decision at its meeting Wednesday  [13 April]. MP Gediminas Vagnorius, chairman of the board, said  he is certain that such a law will be adopted.    The conservatives expect the law to restore order in the  process of state property privatization, to compensate people's  savings, to stop artificial bankruptcies and the downfall of  production, as well as to enhance law and order.    300,000 signatures are necessary for the parliament to  announce a referendum. The conservatives intend to collect  signatures for two months and expect the referendum to be held  in September.    At a press conference Thursday, Vagnorius said other  questions may be included in the referendum, as well, but he  declined to specify any of them.    In Vagnorius' words, the property "privatized without  privatization" is worth some 8 to 10 billion lits.</p>

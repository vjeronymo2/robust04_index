			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ODD RACE;  </P> <P> NO CHOICE BEST CHOICE  </P> <P> The race for the 4th District seat on the state Board of Equalization is  between a man who cannot serve and one who should not serve.  </P> <P> Incumbent Paul Carpenter, a former state senator who currently sits on the the  board, was convicted last month on four felony counts, including extortion and  conspiracy.  </P> <P> If elected, he cannot serve. Inasmuch as America's political system was not  designed to fill public offices by default, we cannot make any recommendation  in this race.  </P> <P> Carpenter was convicted by a federal jury in Sacramento on charges arising from  a years-long FBI sting operation in which agents tried to buy votes of  legislators. By the time the verdict was delivered, Carpenter's name already  was on the Nov. 6 ballot and could not be removed.  </P> <P> California law forbids felons from holding elective office. But Carpenter may  win anyway; then the governor will have to appoint his replacement.  </P> <P> The Republican candidate is Joseph H. Adams, a senior tax auditor with 30 years  of service with the board of equalization. Adams is a pleasant person, but does  not have the broader background needed in effective public servants.  </P> <P> The Board of Equalization is responsible for assuring that taxes in various  parts of the state are imposed equitably. Of its four elected members, two  represent the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> Ideally, an election matches the two best candidates. In the 4th District, that  is not possible. Better perhaps to take the second-best way under the law than  have the office filled by accident: Let the governor make an interim  appointment.  </P></p>

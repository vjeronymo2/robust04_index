			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Arts: Japanese artists tune into the west A Cabinet of Signs, which runs at the Whitechapel Gallery until February 2, is the first time the huge Japan Festival, now drawing to its close, has provided an opportunity to see the work of contemporary Japanese visual artists. The opportunity is welcome. For the eight artists selected present work which embodies the complex intermeshing of western ways of thought and art with that eastern sensibility which, in exhibition after exhibition, the festival has attempted to lay before us. Cabinet, however, requires that we make an effort for ourselves. These are no pieces of interesting exotica, but works rooted in what has become an international vocabulary. While some Japanese artists have expressed concern about the lack of awareness and understanding of western artistic developments in their country, what seems most striking about this exhibition is just how attuned it is to international currents of artistic thought. Emiko Kasahara, for example, shows sculptural installations of large tiled boxes which recall the furniture, sculpture and minimalist preoccupations of many of her western contemporaries. Her boxes, however, with their ceramic flower details and mirrored interiors, have a richness of resonance, a romanticism, that this genre in western use conspicuously lacks. Shinro Otake shows collaged notebooks whose multiple images from trash culture sources have been used to make expensive printed books - a neat reversal of Pop Art practice. A version of the western, Beaux Arts model of art education is available in Japan, teaching students to draw from the cast and from life. Traditional Japanese art, Nihonga, is also taught, and artists are supposed to choose one school or another for their training and work thereafter exclusively in that style. Subverting this convention, Yasumasa Morimura works with both western and Japanese images, using computer technology to insert his own likeness into photographs of both traditional style Japanese paintings and also into some old western favourites. In a series of works specially made for this show, he becomes the heroine of several familiar Pre-Raphaelite paintings from the Tate collection, using computer techniques to open up these morbidly romanticised images of western women to a different gender, a different race and a different time. In Portrait, Fan as adapted from Rossetti, Morimura wears a kimono and has a Rolex on his wrist. The eponymous fan is decorated with images from the works of Gilbert and George. No lack of knowingness there, then, or of the confidence to subject such icons to rigorous, if witty, interrogation. The irony takes by surprise, while the infinite malleability of images such processes now demonstrate to be possible - 'I can become anything,' says Morimura - raises fundamental questions about an image's 'worth.' Transformations of the real, either by such elaborate or by more subtle means, are what Richard Francis, who with independent curator Fumio Nanjo organised the show for the Tate Gallery Liverpool, sees as the exhibitions's connecting theme. It is particularly notable in the work of Hitoshi Nomura, who has taken a series of photographs of the movement of the sun and moon across the sky, then assembled them to make large spiral constructions which form a three-dimensional record of their paths. Tracking the movement of the moon on computer, he has also transcribed these traces into the notes of a musical score. It seems a nice irony that this is not played, but displayed, in the form of a compact disc in a Perspex case. Hiroshi Sugimoto, who lives and works in New York, also uses photographs. His black and white studies were taken inside the display cases of the New York Natural History Museum. The diorama, captured in exquisite silvery tones, look like snapshots from the beginning of time. This is a show of subtleties, a show that takes time. It is also a show which helps to redress the balance, to remind us that the world of Japan which we have been encouraged to strive so hard to enter these past five months is, in many of its manifestations, a world rather more like than unlike our own. Those bullet trains and cute robots do not exist to amuse but to get people to work and to direct traffic. The quality of the exchange of artistic experience now is quite different from that of the French impressionists 'discovering' Hokusai. The genesis and creation of a work can now be transglobal. Morimura, already considered a 'world' artist, took part in 'Metropolis' in Berlin earlier this year. Tatsuo Miyajima, another of the eight, is showing concurrently at Anthony d'Offay - (until January 11). At the Whitechapel he has arranged an installation of digital number display units, and invites us to contemplate their endless activity. At d'Offay, the darkened space of the upstairs gallery glows with the red and green light from the displays which have taken over the gallery walls. They flicker silently, eternally registering from 1 to 99. Miyajima's installations reveal that their banal perfection, their stalwart, ceaseless counting becomes no less than a depiction of the infinite. If that seems unlikely, just take a look.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Swiss Banking (3): Biotechnology's new champion / Profile of Bank am Bellevue It was probably inevitable that Mr Martin Ebner's highly successful BZ banking group, in the headlines recently over its epic tussle with the board of Union Bank of Switzerland, would attract imitators. So far, the most conspicuous one is the Bellevue group, built around a small brokerage house, Bank am Bellevue, established a year and a half ago in Zurich. Like BZ, Bank am Bellevue's offices are in open plan on the top floor of a building that houses a downmarket department store. Like BZ, it operates with only a skeleton staff and concentrates on rigorous financial analysis of top quoted companies for a small number of large institutional clients. These similarities are not accidental. BB, as it has become known, was formed by Mr Ernst Muller-Mohl and Mr Martin Bisang, former directors of BZ, and Mr Jorg Graf, Mr Ebner's successor as head of research at Bank J. Vontobel. Their view was that there were still great opportunities for revaluation of many leading Swiss equities, partly as a result of the companies becoming more transparent about their affairs, partly because of an increase by Swiss institutions in their allocation of funds to equities and partly due to industrial restructuring. The Bellevue brokerage business, with a staff of 18, was an immediate success, achieving a net income of SFr6m in its first five months of existence to the end of 1993. Also like BZ, the Bellevue group has diversified into investment fund management and sees there its greatest potential. Indeed, it achieved international notice earlier this year when its BB Biotech fund disclosed that its stake, in Biogen, a leading US biotechnology company, had exceeded 5 per cent. BB Biotech was set up by Bellevue last autumn in response to its Swiss clients' demands for a vehicle that would give them exposure to the most exciting part of the pharmaceutical industry without having to take the more humdrum part as well. The fund's strategy - again similar to that practised by BZ funds - has been to focus on only a small number of pure biotechnology stocks. And Bellevue has used the limited company as a structure rather than an open or closed end trust. Mr Bisang, who now heads Bellevue Asset Management, the group's asset management arm, says the advantages of the limited company are that the shares can be listed and traded like those of any other company and there has to be a clearly identifiable responsible board. The main disadvantage, tax liability for income and capital gains, can be minimised, he says. The initial public offering of shares in BB Biotech attracted SFr325m and the fund raised a further SFr150m in February through a free warrants rights issue, making it one of the world's biggest funds devoted to biotechnology stocks. At the end of August, nearly two-thirds of its money was invested in only two US stocks, Biogen and Genentech, with the remainder in Amgen and a small new stake in Affymax, a California-based leader in combinatorial chemistry. In common with the whole biotechnology sector, the shares have weakened in recent months, but have remained well above both the average of US pharmaceutical shares and the CBOE biotech index, in spite of the strength of the Swiss franc against the dollar. Mr Bisang says BB Biotech will in future allocate up to 20 per cent of its funds to second tier companies, mainly through participating in private placements. Last summer, Bellevue Asset Management set up a second fund, BB Industrie Holding, showing its interest in Swiss industrial restructurings. Its first stakes were in companies specialising in textile machinery and office building controls systems, both sectors where the potential for consolidation among Swiss players is considerable. The Bellevue group does not object to comparisons with the BZ group, but likes to think of itself as a step or two ahead of its mentor towards investor friendliness and transparency. The identities of the investors in the group - all are directors or employees - are disclosed and both the boards and the management of the brokerage house and the asset management arm are kept separate. All the group companies have a single class share structure whereas BZ entities have dual class structures, giving the core shareholders greater voting power with less investment than other shareholders. Bellevue also has rather more distinguished external experts on its boards than does BZ. Mr David Baltimore, a Nobel prize winning biotechnology professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, sits on the BB Biotech board. Dr Ernst Thomke, one of the developers of the Swatch watch, sits on the BB Industrie board. Mr Bisang, who heads Bellevue Asset Management, says the group has many more ideas for funds, but is waiting until market conditions are more propitious.</p>

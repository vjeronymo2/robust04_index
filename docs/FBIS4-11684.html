			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, March, 29, IRNA -- The adoption by the  government of Saudi Arabia of a position against the interests  and profits of other member countries of the Organization of  Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has astounded petroleum  exporters.    While the belief of oil experts and also the position of the  other 11 OPEC members and the psychological atmosphere of the  market was favourable for reduction of the production ceiling by  1 to 1.4 million barrels per day, Riyadh disagreed with any  reduction in the production of its oil.    On the basis of these views such a reduction by member  states  could cause the price of oil to increase by dlrs 3.00 to 4.00  per barrel.    All witnesses and reasons indicate that the opposition of  Saudi Arabia with other OPEC members and especially Islamic Iran  as one of the countries that offered that proposal in the recent  OPEC meeting was merely political and was adopted without taking  into account the interests of other members.    Oil and economic experts emphasize on this point that the  responsible officials in Saudi Arabia should not relate its  dispute with Iran over the number of Mecca pilgrims to oil  issues.    The recent decision-making by the Saudi Government in the  area of oil issues has always created the suspicion that this  country prefers Western interest to the interests of Muslim  countries and other OPEC member states.    Although the OPEC secretariat had warned that if the  production ceiling was not reduced within the next two months  the oil price would fall several dollars from the present level.  Nevertheless Saudi Arabia remained stubborn on its strange  position without considering the realities.    Because Saudi Arabia is considered as the biggest oil  producing country of the world it has suffered more loss than  other countries due to the falling trend of the price of oil  during this past year. The income of this country has been  reduced at dlrs 2.5 billion for each dollar in the fall of oil  price.    Iran's policies has indicated the reality that the Islamic  republic has always considered the issue of understanding within  OPEC, the stability of oil market and the interests of other  members and as a result the interests of the Muslim world.    It should also be noted that for attaining these goals the  Islamic republic has at time even overlooked its own interests.    Saudi Arabia, by supplying eight million bpd [barrels per  day] of oil to the oil market has played an effective role in  reducing the price of oil and the perpetuation of this  unprincipled policy has always guaranteed the protection of the  interests of the West and the wealthy consumers of oil.    'Abdallah Bin-Hamad al-Attiyah [name as received], energy  minister of Qatar voiced his dissatisfaction in this regard in  an interview with the state news agency of Qatar.    He emphasized the importance of the reduction in oil  production of member countries with the view to improve the  situation of the market.    According to OPEC secretary general of OPEC, Sobroto,  Nigeria  and Indonesia, too, offered separate proposals for reducing OPEC  production at the level of 1 to 1.4 million bpd which also  includes the reduction of the quota of Saudi Arabia.    The oil minister of Oman, too, wrote a letter to OPEC on  behalf of eight non-OPEC countries saying these countries are  ready to reduce the sum of their output by 250,000 bpd.    In the opinion of a political expert in the present  situation  that many of the oil producing countries which, under the  influence of diferent factors including reduced oil prices, face  economic stagnation, any decision which should create hindrances  in the way of the determination of a just and reasonable oil  price will be in fact a measure against the interests of  developing nations and developing countries.    The same expert says Saudi Arabia, by creating a chaos in  the  adoption of a common decision in OPEC for reducing the volume of  oil production has caused considerable loss to the oil producing  countries and with respect to the warming temperature there is  now the likelihood that the crisis caused by the reduction of  oil prices will stretch its heavy shadow on the economy of many  oil producing countries including Saudi Arabia.    He also believed that the opposition of the government of  Saudi Arabia with the increase in oil prices is in fact some  sort of antagonism and opposition with the Islamic Republic of  Iran.    At any rate eonomic experts have a consensus of opinion in  one issue which is that the position of Saudi Arabia did not aim  at understanding, unity and solidarity of OPEC members and this  decision-making has deeply astounded and at the same time  angered producing countries.    It is said that in Geneva the officials of the Saudi  Government in their direct talks with the Iranian sides admitted  that their opposition to the increase in the oil price is a  reply to the position of Iran in relation to the issue of hajj  and reaction to the violation of Saudi Arabia of its previous  commitments.    Such reports, in case they are true, more than anything else  are indicative of the presence of political weakness, and there  is the expectation that the officials of Saudi Arabia will look  at issues with more realism and refuse to take a decision which  inflicts the biggest loss to this country.</p>

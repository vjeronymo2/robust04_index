			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Economy Shrunk by 0.3 Percent Last </F> Year"]    [Text] The recession in 1993 was comparatively moderate in  Austria: The gross domestic product [GDP] only shrunk by 0.3  percent. The main reasons for last year's performance of the  Austrian economy, which was better than expected, are to be  found in industrial production and exports, which decreased less  than predicted. Presently, the most important impetus for a new  upswing is currently coming from both industry and exports.</p>

			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / County elections battle starts early THE OPENING shots in this year's local elections will be fired today when Labour launches its campaign with a fresh assault on the impact of the government's economic policies and approach to local spending. Mrs Margaret Beckett, the party's deputy leader, and Mr Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, will lead the attack. For the Conservatives, the campaign will begin on Wednesday with the first of a series of London press conferences led by Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, and Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary. Only the Liberal Democrats are holding their fire until the middle of next month. The early start and extended campaigns planned by both main parties for the county council elections on May 6 shows how seriously they are being taken. This contrasts with the approach to last year's local elections, when the parties recognised that electors were suffering 'voter fatigue' after the general election, and to the last county elections in 1989, when the politicians were looking ahead to the European parliament elections. This time much higher profile campaigns are planned for what will be the first large-scale test of political opinion since April last year. Millions of voters will be electing some 3,500 councillors for the 47 counties in England and Wales. The main themes of Labour's campaign will be the economic impact of government policy in particular areas, for example the numbers of jobs lost or homes repossessed, and the effect of the tight control on public spending on local services. In spite of the relatively easy introduction so far of the council tax, party strategists have concluded that it is still worth focusing on how the replacement for the poll tax might be improved. The thrust of the Conservatives' campaign will be the value for money provided by Tory councils. County councils spend most of the Pounds 50bn-plus spent by local authorities in England and Wales, and the Tories will be developing the line that, apart from people's mortgages, the biggest 'purchasing decision' most families will take this year will be who they want to run the county council. Even though the government has faced strong criticism for centralising powers in some policy areas previously the preserve of councils, such as education, the party organisation is confident that these will still be valuable campaigning issues. The same is true of the police reforms announced this month by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary. Although they will reduce the responsibility of local councillors for the police service, tacticians at party headquarters believe they received a good enough reception to enable the Tories to highlight law and order. In general, the Liberal Democrats will focus on education and the environment. In the south-west, especially Cornwall, where much of their effort will be directed they will also concentrate on unemployment. All three parties are cautious about their prospects. The talk is more of 'consolidation' than of sweeping gains. After the 1989 elections there were 19 counties controlled by Conservatives, 12 by Labour, one by Liberal Democrats, three by independents and 12 were under no overall control. Labour will be targeting Leicestershire and Northamptonshire, where it is the second largest party, and Cheshire where it is the largest single party. It is also looking to improve its hold in Lancashire where it has a small overall majority. Lancashire is one of the four counties where it took control in 1989. Apart from the south-west, the Liberal Democrats will concentrate on the Home Counties, especially Berkshire, combining the county campaign with that for the Newbury parliamentary by-election, which could be on the same day.</p>

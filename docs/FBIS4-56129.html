			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 24 (CTK) -- Defense Minister Antonin  Baudys said today it had not yet been proved that there were  officers in the Czech Army who did collaborate with the former  communist state police (StB). In an interview with CTK Baudys  thus reacted to a statement by parliamentary Deputy Tomas Fejfar  who said that Baudys had confirmed that the lustration or  screening law had been violated in the army in the case of at  least two high-ranking officers.    Baudys told CTK that both he and Fejfar had been separately  briefed on the "suspicion that there are officers in the army  who though being found to have collaborated with StB were  granted positive or clear lustration certificates. "I have  ordered the checking of all documents concerning the lustration  law and nothing of the kind had thus far been proved," Baudys  said.    Nova television, which today broadcast an interview with  Fejfar, reported on Monday that the lustration law was being  grossly violated in the Czech Army High Command and that  positively lust rated officers produce negative lustration  certificates.</p>

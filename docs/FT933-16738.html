			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Recovery in west Midlands 'slows' THE PACE of recovery among west Midlands manufacturers and service companies has slowed over the past three months, the latest survey of 580 companies by the regional group of Chambers of Commerce shows, Paul Cheeseright writes. The growth in orders reported by companies in the first quarter of the year petered out between March and June, emphasising that the movement out of recession remains tentative. The survey, published today, shows that in June 32 per cent of manufacturing companies had more domestic and export orders than three months before. Yet this is scarcely changed from March when companies were reporting a marked upturn in orders compared with last December. The same trend is apparent with service companies, among which the proportion working at full capacity dropped between March and June from 22 per cent to 17 per cent. Among manufacturers, 86 per cent of companies are working at less than 80 per cent of capacity.</p>

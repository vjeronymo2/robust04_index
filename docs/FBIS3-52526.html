The foreign secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, said  that India is not resigned to the end of bilateral exercise and  it is committed to peace process without any precondition.  Talking to newsmen in New Delhi this evening, he said that the  long discussions he had with the Pakistan prime minister, Ms.  Benazir Bhutto, shows that she wants to give a signal to keep  the momentum of bilateral interaction at all necessary levels.    Admitting that the talks have ended in a stalemate, Mr.  Dixit  said the ball is, however, in the Pakistan court as they have  not agreed to a timeframe for the next round of discussion. Mr.  Dixit said while Pakistan insisted during the talks that Kashmir  should be the core issue to improve bilateral relations, India  asserted that the wide ranging bilateral issue should not hinge  on one problem.    The foreign secretary disclosed that he had offered specific  proposals to improve bilateral ties and his Pakistan counterpart  Mr. Shaharyar Khan had agreed to consider them.    Mr. Dixit rejected reports in Pakistan press that India has  agreed to resume bilateral talks on Kashmir because of pressure  from abroad and the problem has become unmanageable. He said  New Delhi has the capability to tackle the problem and there is  no question of succumbing to pressures in areas where the  nation's fundamental interests are involved.</p>

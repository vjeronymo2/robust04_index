			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Euro Disney close to visitor target EURO DISNEY said yesterday it had come close to achieving its first-year target of 11m visitors to its theme park, but that hotel occupancy and spending per head were still below expectations. Mr Philippe Bourguignon, who was appointed chairman last January, said the company still expected to make a loss this year. Euro Disney made a pre-tax loss of FFr339m (Dollars 60.3m) in the year to September 30 1992 and announced a deficit of FFr492m for the first quarter of the current year. However, Mr Steve Burke, executive vice-president, said, that the park would achieve 11m visitors by the end of next month, only a few weeks after its first anniversary on April 12. After a slow start, Euro Disney had been expected to fall 500,000 visitors short of its first-year target. Mr Burke said the improved attendance figures were the result of intensive marketing in France, where interest in visiting the park had been below expectations. Analysts warned that the financial impact would be limited by discounted tickets and the cost of extra staff to cope with the increase in visitors. The company had offered residents of the Paris region 20 per cent to 30 per cent discounts on entrance prices from January to the end of March. Even more effective, Mr Burke said, were sales visits to companies and schools throughout France. Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, European leisure analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, revised her forecasts for Euro Disney's second-quarter loss to FFr650m from FFr750m following yesterday's announcement. She expects Euro Disney to produce a profit of FFr375m in the second half, reducing its total loss to FFr769m in the full financial year to September 30. Euro Disney's financial performance has been affected not only by its initial operational difficulties, but also by unexpectedly high financing costs. It has been hit by the rise in French interest rates and a shortfall in capital gains.</p>

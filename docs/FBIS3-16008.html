			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A statement by the Russian Embassy in Lithuania was  received by ELTA which reads:    As reported by ELTA on 22 February of the current year,  Nikolay Obertyshev, ambassador of the Russian Federation to the  Republic of Lithuania, was summoned to the Lithuanian Ministry  of Foreign Affairs. His attention was drawn to the unsanctioned  -- in quotation marks -- passage of a Russian train carrying  armored transport vehicles through the territory of the Republic  of Lithuania on the night from 19 to 20 February. It was  requested that Russia should take measures in order that such  incidents are avoided in future.    On the basis of the explanations received from Moscow, the  Embassy would like to report through ELTA to the Lithuanian  public that the armament was being transported according to the  procedure which was coordinated in 1992 by the Russian Defemse  Ministry and the Lithuanian National Defense Ministry, which  does not want to register officially a separate agreement or a  protocol.    Lithuania has not until now been informing the Russian  representatives either about the procedure of informing the  competent representatives of the Lithuanian authorities six  hours before the arrival of trains to the border stations when  this concerns military transit through the territory of  Lithuania, or about the conditions of the armed guards  accompanying transit military cargos through the territory of  Lithuania.    There is no doubt that situations such as this could be  avoided in future if the negotiations started as soon as  possible and the relevant agreements were prepared on military  transit which would regulate in full the rights and obligations  of both countries.</p>

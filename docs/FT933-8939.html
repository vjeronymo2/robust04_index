			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US Midwest crop losses estimated at Dollars 2.5bn MR Mike Espy, US agriculture secretary, said yesterday his country's maize and soyabean harvest would be adequate to meet world demand, despite summer floods that had devasted large portions of some of the most fertile crop land. The US Department of Agriculture conducted its most extensive survey ever of crop conditions during the first week in August, and yesterday released the results. Tha agency said crop losses due to flooding and drought in Midwestern states amounted to Dollars 2.5bn. And it revised its estimate of the maize crop to 7.423bn bushels, down 22 per cent from last year's harvest and below private forecasters estimates of about 7.5bn. Despite the drop, Mr Espy said he expected little movement in maize prices today. Although this year's crop will be short, there are ample maize supplies in storage to meet customer needs. The US has 2.124 billion bushels of maize carried over from last year's bumper harvest, and export orders for delivery after harvest have been lagging. The agriculture department put this year's soyabean harvest at 1.902bn bushels, about 13 per cent smaller than in 1992. Soyabean traders had been anticipating a figure closer to 1.857bn and are expecting soyabean futures prices to fall by about 10 cents a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade today. Soyabean futures for November delivery closed up 10 cents at Dollars 6.83 in anticipation of the report yesterday. Soyabean prices have been declining in fits and starts since the high of Dollars 7.56 1/2 on July 19. Traders said any shortfall in the US crop would be eagerly replaced by Brazilian production, a negative prospect for US soya farmers. In a survey of the nine Midwestern states hit hardest by Mississippi and Missouri river floods, the department said farmers would harvest 145.6m acres, 7.8m less than expected in June. About 2.8m acres were never planted because of wet conditions, and about 5m were planted but cannot be harvested. The agency said production figures were also cut by hot, dry weather in the US southeast this summer. Pointing out that the government crop survey was completed last week, Mr Daniel Basse, analyst at the Chicago research company AgResouces, said: 'The real focus now will be how many bushels we can add to these figures as we head into harvest.' Mr Basse said that sultry conditions in the western maize belt during the past week had been ideal for maize and soyabean development, but the crops were still racing an early frost and actual production figures were far from certain.</p>

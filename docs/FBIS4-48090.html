			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 10 SAPA -- Pan Africanist Congress  [PAC] Secretary General Benny Alexander on Tuesday [10 May]  night confirmed he had requested to be relieved of his position  to concentrate as the sole PAC provincial assembly  representative. "It will not be possible for me to carry the  workload as sole PAC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]  provincial assembly representative and the workload as secretary  general. I will, however, remain a member of the National  Executive Committee and remain a loyal and disciplined member of  the party," he said in a statement. He said the matter had  still to be discussed by the National Working Committee. "I  must express surprise at reading of my confidential  correspondence to the president in the media, especially as the  matter has still to be discussed by the National Working  Committee," he said.</p>

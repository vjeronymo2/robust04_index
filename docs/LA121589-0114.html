			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WEDNESDAY'S GAMES;  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BIRD SHOWS HE'S BACK: 40 POINTS  </P> <P> For the first quarter of the season, Larry Bird's shooting touch has been  missing. Back after being out of all but the first six games last season  because of surgery on both heels, he is playing without pain but with- out his  accustomed shooting success.  </P> <P> Through 20 games, he was making only 46% of his shots.  </P> <P> The magic touch came back Wednesday night at Boston, and Bird scored 40 points  in leading the Celtics to a 109-97 victory over the Seattle SuperSonics.  </P> <P> As the Celtics ended a two-game losing streak and improved their record to  12-9, Bird was 17 for 27 from the field. He also had 11 rebounds and 10 assists  for his fourth triple-double of the season.  </P> <P> Bird, playing all but two minutes, had 23 points in the first half to help  build a 51-42 lead and the SuperSonics never threatened in the second half.  </P> <P> The performance by Bird, who reached 18,391 points to pass Julius Erving and  become 21st on the all-time scoring list, spoiled the return of K.C. Jones.  </P> <P> Jones, who was coach when the Celtics last won the championship, is an  assistant coach for the Sonics. He was given a standing ovation by the Boston  fans.  </P> <P> Cleveland 99, Milwaukee 93 -- The return of injured Larry Nance has given a  lift to the Cavaliers, who have won all three games since he came back.  </P> <P> In this victory at Richfield, Ohio, Nance showed no ill effects from the major  surgery on his ankle last season. He had 31 points, 10 rebounds and two blocked  shots.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 112, Atlanta 103 -- Hersey Hawkins and Johnny Dawkins of the 76ers  put a stop to the Hawks' seven-game winning streak in this game at  Philadelphia. Hawkins had 27 points, and Dawkins had 23 points and nine  assists.  </P> <P> Atlanta's Dominique Wilkins had a game-high 38 points.  </P> <P> Golden State 134, Denver 114 -- Chris Mullin had 33 points and a career-high 18  rebounds to lead the Warriors' romp at Oakland. Mullin had a lifetime rebound  average of 3.3 per game.  </P> <P> Dallas 90, Minnesota 87 -- The Timberwolves continue to play tough games, but  they also continue to lose.  </P> <P> The Mavericks, although they scored only nine points in the fourth quarter at  Minneapolis, held on to hand the Timberwolves their 15th loss in 20 games.  </P> <P> Utah 102, Phoenix 95 -- John Stockton had 22 points and 15 rebounds at Salt  Lake City and the Jazz rode a 11-0 run late in the game to victory.  </P> <P> Eddie Johnson's basket with 3:38 left gave the Suns an 88-83 lead. But they  failed to score for 2 1/2 minutes and fell behind. Karl Malone's jump shot with  1:38 put Utah ahead to stay. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

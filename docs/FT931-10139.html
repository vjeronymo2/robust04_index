			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Arts: Today's Television Tomorrow's World (BBC 1, 7.30) asks who is going to pay to prop up Angkor Wat, the vast temple built in Cambodia (at about the time of the Norman Conquest), which is now badly in need of restoration. Indian archaeologists have been working away on the structure during the years that Cambodia was closed to the rest of the world. Unfortunately, some claim their techniques have done more harm than good. Migraine sufferers should cast an eye over Food File (C4, 8.30). The series begins with an item on managing one's diet to alleviate migraine. The moral majority may not have much say in controlling what manner of art-works and performances we see in this country, but nevertheless, the American experience is one which has an impact over here. Organisers of shows with sponsorship by US companies have found their freedom for manoeuvre curtailed. So - there is all the more reason to catch the second showing of the documentary about censorship which itself caused a furore, Damned in the USA (C4, 11.20).</p>

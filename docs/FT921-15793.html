			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Appointments: Silver-plated service Leslie Silver has resigned from KALON Group after nearly 45 years at the head of the paint business, which he founded after leaving the RAF with Pounds 250 savings. His retirement, at 67, will leave him to devote most of his energy to Leeds United Football Club, top of the English Football League, of which he is chairman. He also chairs the board of governors at Leeds Polytechnic. Silver built up the paint business as the privately owned Silver Paint and Lacquer Company, which in the 1950s was one of the first producers of emulsion paint. In the 1970s it started supplying own label paint to supermarkets and DIY chains and joined the stock market in 1985 by reversing into Leyland Paint and Wallpaper. The Silver family holdings are now down to to less than 29 per cent.</p>

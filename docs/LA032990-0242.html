			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: MAN OF NOTE IN L.A. MUSICALS  </P> <P> Longevity seems to smile fondly on those in the arts. Despite the stresses and  strains of creativity, and quite possibly because of the way the challenges  keep the blood pumping, the men and women of the lively arts have a way of  staying lively.  </P> <P> Hal Roach, who teamed Laurel and Hardy and launched the "Our Gang" comedies,  recently celebrated his 98th birthday and remains feisty as ever. Adolph Zukor,  who founded Paramount, famously lived to be 102, nourished by a taste for  goulash so spicy it made strong men weep.  </P> <P> Young conductors are now the fashion but the Toscanini-Monteux tradition is  that they don't really hit full stride until they pass 70. Luis Bunuel made  several of his finest films in his 70s. Bertrand Russell was writing eloquent  and often angry prose into his 90s. George Burns at 94 has made a new career  out of old age.  </P> <P> In a sense Edwin Lester, who will be 95 on Friday, has outlived his monument.  The Los Angeles Civic Light Opera, which he founded in 1938 and from which he  retired in 1977, has only a fraction of the 260,000 subscribers it had at its  peak here and in San Francisco, and it no longer offers a San Francisco season  at all.  </P> <P> Yet in its day and at its best, the CLO was a kind of cultural bridge between  the Los Angeles that was and the Los Angeles that emerged in the postwar era  and is indeed still emerging.  </P> <P> Lester, who is frail of step but sharp of mind and memory, said the other  afternoon that "The mere fact of being 95 is utterly silly," adding that he had  accomplished nothing of consequence in the last 10 years. At 95, that's an  allowable vacation, of course, but Lester continues to dispatch a stream of  letters to his friends in the press, keeping the record straight about the CLO  and its contributions to the cultural growth of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The Civic Light Opera, most notably, was a significant factor in the birth of  the Music Center. "The important thing was our agreement to occupy the Pavilion  for the six worst months of the year. That was what sold the county  supervisors. The Stanford Research Institute had done an analysis for them and  we were what was required." The CLO also contributed $250,000 to the Music  Center. "It wasn't much compared to some of the other donations, but it  helped," Lester says. When finances were tight in the early days, the CLO  sometimes advanced the rent, Lester remembers.  </P> <P> In his 39 years with the Civic Light Opera, Lester produced 90 shows himself,  and there were another 50 or 60 he didn't produce. Critics often complained  that as lavishly mounted and starry as the CLO productions were, they  represented musical theater as it had been rather than as it was coming to be.  </P> <P> But Lester argues that he knew his subscribers and there is evidence that he  was right. When he booked "West Side Story," not without trepidation, 200  subscribers canceled. When "Kiss Me Kate" was imported, Lester spotted some  risque lyrics he thought would not sit well with his customers. The New York  producer Saint Subber was aghast at the idea of asking Cole Porter to change  the lyrics. "I called Porter directly and he couldn't have been nicer," Lester  says. "He said he understood and would make some changes, and he did."  </P> <P> Lester, born in New York, raised in Providence, R.I., and in Detroit, came to  the founding of the CLO by a long road that began with piano lessons. "My  problem has always been laziness," he says, unconvincingly. "I wouldn't  practice enough, and someone said that I played the piano but I wasn't a  pianist, and that was about right."  </P> <P> Still, he got a job at $15 a week as intermission pianist at the Cafe  Frontenac, a huge Detroit restaurant that had two orchestras. On his opening  night, Lester made a grand entrance through the front door in a new-bought set  of tails and white kid gloves and wearing a monocle ("which was useless"). He  was 19.  </P> <P> "Moebs, the manager, said, 'You're a showman!' " He made Lester the talent  booker on the spot, quadrupled his salary and gave him a magnum of Champagne.  Lester kept the job, playing the piano and booking singers, for four years.  </P> <P> When that palled, he tried his hand at vaudeville, working smalltime circuits  as a singing pianist. He married ("a beautiful singer, naturally"), served  briefly in World War I but did not get overseas. Afterward, he moved to Los  Angeles because of his wife's failing health; she had tuberculosis.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles he talked his way into producing prologues for Sid Grauman's  Million Dollar Theater. Then he became a wizard piano salesman, earning upwards  from $10,000 in commissions when that was significant money.  </P> <P> His success as salesman led Carl Laemmle to hire Lester as a sales manager at  Universal Studios, but Lester didn't stay long. "Didn't like the movies," he  says. In the early '30s, Lester began to manage singers; Nelson Eddy was  briefly a client. To keep them busy, Lester started arranging events for them.  </P> <P> He produced a Light Opera Festival, doing four shows for a week each. "I didn't  know any better," says Lester. He persuaded 10 friends to guarantee $500 apiece  against losses, but he managed to end the season with $2,500. Emboldened, he  did another season and ended up $10,000 in the red.  </P> <P> "I learned a lesson," he says: "Los Angeles demands stars. Just doing musicals  wasn't enough."  </P> <P> He raised fresh capital, persuaded John Charles Thomas to appear for the  unprecedented sum of $7,500 a week, announced four shows for the price of three  for subscribers, the four being the operettas "Blossom Time," "The Student  Prince" and "The New Moon," and, as the added started, "Roberta" with its new  star, Bob Hope, directly from a triumphant run in New York.  </P> <P> The Civic Light Opera was off and running. In 1957, Mary Martin did both "South  Pacific" and "Annie Get Your Gun." In 1965 there was a 700,000-seat advance  sale for a season that included Ricardo Montalban and Florence Henderson in  "The King and I."  </P> <P> There were some bombs along the way, including "1491," the Meredith Willson  musical about Columbus getting ready to sail, and "Magdalena," a CLO original  operetta based on the music of Villa-Lobos.  </P> <P> "I still think it's the finest thing we ever did," Lester says, "and after all  these years it's just come out on a new CD. But it may have been ahead of its  time."  </P> <P> The musical scene was changing. Rising costs have made it increasingly  difficult to break even on the limited runs that were the CLO's custom. The  Schubert, with unlimited runs, could outbid the CLO on the big hit musicals.  The CLO patrons, with their conservative tastes, were declining in numbers.  There simply weren't many new musicals coming along except the megaproductions  and even the revivals are more expensive all the time.  </P> <P> Like a good showman, Lester bowed out at right time, leaving himself and his  audiences with some fine memories.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Andrey Konstantinov] </F>   [Text] At a briefing for Russian and foreign  journalists held yesterday in the St. Petersburg and oblast GUVD  [City Administration of Internal Affairs], militia staff spoke  about business and private entrepreneurship security  problems.    Sergey Sidorenko, chief of the regional administration for  combating organized crime, pointed out that when business and  private entrepreneurship reemerged in Russia in the mid-1980's,  structures feeding on it began to grow and develop; as a result,  extortion, debt repayment "enforcement," kidnapping, and  contract murders have become ordinary events.    Sergey Sidorenko noted that currently only state law  enforcement organs can realistically help entrepreneurs.  According to the data he quoted, of 120 private security  companies registered in Petersburg, about 40 live by openly  criminal notions. Organized crime structures also are attempting  to penetrate banks with the purpose of using them for their  needs. Sergey Sidorenko told the journalists the names of four  Petersburg banks in which, in his opinion, the possibility of  the presence of organized crime structures is absolutely  precluded. They are: Promstroybank [State Bank for Industrial  Development], Sberbank [State Savings Bank], Sankt Peterburg  bank, and Petrovskiy bank.    Foreign entrepreneurs also encounter Russian bandits in  Petersburg. About 20 percent of all joint companies and Western  enterprises actively cooperate with our mafia. For instance,  some Finnish enterprises pay bandits 100,000 Finnish markka a  month. The only advice he could give to entrepreneurs in the  current situation is not to be afraid to turn to law enforcement  organs for help, because even setting up their own security  services does not solve the problem for businessmen and  entrepreneurs. Only the militia can realistically help them.</p>

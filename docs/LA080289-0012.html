			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTION REFORMS  </P> <P> Concerning the current discussion of campaign reforms, I would like to make a  suggestion. Ban paid political advertising on television. These commercials are  becoming increasingly less informative and more emotion-seeking. Isn't it  better for voters to base their decisions based on facts, rather than emotions?  Let's reduce the dependence on media consultants and advertising executives.  </P> <P> Since television advertising is a major expense of a large campaign, its  elimination would reduce the amount of money needed to enter a campaign and/or  allow more money to be spent on campaign methods of more substance. Reducing  the amount of money needed to run a campaign would also be a very effective way  to limit political action committee influence, which seems to be what everyone  wants nowadays.  </P> <P> TIMOTHY J.

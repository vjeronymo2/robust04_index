			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by 'Abd al-Jabbar Muhsin: "Contribution to the </F> Question of Lifting the Blockade"]    [Text] During the roundtable discussion on lifting the  blockade that aired on Youth Television, several valuable  opinions were expressed on the subject. So there may not be  anything new in this article. Still, I will try to highlight  some of the points of that discussion. We will observe that the  Mother of Battles began essentially as an economic aggression  manifested by an undeclared embargo on several commodities and  technologies. They then plotted against the oil prices in a  deliberate attempt to reduce Iraq's revenues when it was in dire  need of foreign currencies. This was accompanied by a  conspiracy against the value of the Iraqi currency.    Needless to say, the first to point out that these measures  constituted a real war against us was our leader Saddam Husayn,  may God preserve him, at the Baghdad Arab summit. After the war  and its outcome, the West, led by the United States, persisted,  in harmony with Zionist aims, to use different excuses to  prolong the blockade in the hope of achieving by economic war  what they could not achieve by force of arms.    With this simple introduction, I now go straight to the  topic  and propose the following:    1. We should declare that trade with any country wishing to  deal with Iraq after the removal of the blockade will not be a  favor to Iraq, or a friendly or fraternal stand, but a fait  accompli stand.    2. Thus, our dialogue with the big powers and neighboring  states should follow two courses: First, the course of  intimidation, which, in short, means that there will be no  special relationship, trade benefits, priority in debt payments,  preference in oil supply, commodity and expertise exports to  Iraq, or job opportunities for companies with regard to any  country not currently adopting a just and equitable stand.  Second, the course of temptation, which means that every  country that says it has changed its attitude about Iraq and is  actually endeavoring in international forums -- by word, action,  and stand --to lift the blockade, will enjoy most favored nation  rights regarding oil supply, and possibly with regard to  preferential prices and debt payments. It will also benefit  from an Iraqi market that hungers for foreign commodities, and  in the opportunities given to foreign companies. We could, in  this regard, sign immediate agreements.    3. Since hostile circles are now diverting the blockade from  diplomatic and media attention in order to clamp a blackout on  this exposed crime and to prevent the formation of supporting  public opinion, nationalist forces, social figures, professional  organizations, and men of religion who took part in the popular  forces conferences and the Islamic conference in Baghdad should  take action in two directions: First, form a public pressure  group against the aggressors in support of Iraq by all available  means, including pulpits, statements, demonstrations,  declarations, solidarity strikes for several hours, fasting for  a whole day or part of a day, roundtable discussions, and news  conferences. Otherwise, there is little use in resolutions  issued in Baghdad and then shelved here and forgotten there.  Second, use these methods in calling for the boycott of  American goods and interests in the Arab and Islamic states. I  believe such calls will find a response even among our people in  the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf states.    4. The enemies are betting that the phenomenon of the rising  price spiral that some merchants cause from time to time will  exhaust people's patience, deepen their concern, and destroy  their morale. All I am asking is for these elements, whether  they are individuals or groups, to be singled out and punished  on the basis of the revolutionary code of fairness in punishment  and reward. Leaving matters unattended has given these elements  the opportunity to continue their despicable behavior in  defiance of the people and the revolution.    5. These proposals require active support on the diplomatic,  media, party, and professional levels. We know decisionmakers  at all these levels are truly strong and competent, and the  outsiders have weak excuses. Therefore, until the blockade is  lifted, we should choose elements with a high sense of  responsibility and on the basis of competence and sincerity, not  favoritism.    Finally, these proposals may not be the right ones, but they  are suitable as a basis for discussion.</p>

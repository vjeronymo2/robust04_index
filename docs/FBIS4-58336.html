			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Mohammad Sarafraz: "Obstacles to Cooperation </F> with Germany"]    [Text] There are very clear reasons to broaden relations  between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Germany. The latter  does not have a colonialist past and now that it is entering the  international arena, it is seeking a reliable partner in the  Middle East.    In order to resolve its economic problems, Germany uses its  own distinctive policy which is not necessarily affiliated to  U.S. policies. Germany is Iran's top trading partner and has  assisted in the training of experts in various fields.    However, there are some obstacles that, if eliminated, would  clear the path for better cooperation between the two countries:    1. The balance of trade between the two countries is not  equal, Germany's exports to Iran far exceed Iran's exports to  Germany. In 1993, Iran experienced problems due to a drop in  its foreign exchange earnings. Germany's exports fell to 4  billion marks and Iran's exports were only worth 1.5 billion  marks.    German officials complain of the increase in the volume of  trade between Iran and the United States in their meetings with  the Iranian press. Our response is that we have also complained  about the increase in American exports but one must note that  the balance of trade between the two countries is to Iran's  benefit. This means that the sale of Iranian oil to American  companies is far greater than our imports from American  companies. If the Germans are complaining about this state of  affairs, it would be better if they increased their purchases of  Iranian oil and steered the balance of trade between the two  countries toward a more equitable level.    The Germans contend that the purchase of oil is in the hands  of private companies and that the government has no control and  no policy in this regard. If this is merely a propagandistic  allegation, it is not right to make these remarks regarding such  a serious matter. If this is true, then is it to be believed  that European governments do not have any jurisdiction on such  basic decisions? This matter will be assessed at a later date.    2. The German Government has abandoned some of its valid ,  but uncompleted, contracts, such as the Bushehr nuclear power  plant and its affiliated fertilizer project after 90 percent of  the work was completed. Germany's reasons for such a breach of  contract are not acceptable. Iran is a signatory of the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] and IAEA [International Atomic  Energy Agency] inspection teams have repeatedly visited Iran and  endorsed Iran's performance in this regard. Meanwhile the  Israeli regime has not signed the NPT and has proclaimed that it  has nuclear weapons but no one dares complain to them. Thus,  Germany's breach of bilateral contracts will remain a dark spot  on Iranian-German relations.    3. Germany's conduct has not been very just or humanitarian  in some cases in the Middle East. For example, during the Iraqi  war against Iran, the Germans supplied chemical weapons to Iraq  and its experts assisted Iraq in extending the range of its  missiles, resulting in greater casualties for the Iranian side.  The Germans did not pay any reparations to Iran, but when  similar missiles were fired upon occupied Palestine during the  Iraqi war against Kuwait, the German foreign minister himself  went to Tel Aviv and paid 200 million marks as reparations.  Such conduct is unacceptable.    In response, the Germans say they were the first European  country to condemn Iraqi aggression against Iran, and this is  true, but it does not compensate for Iran's losses in the war.    4. The Germans display sensitivity regarding terrorist  groups but do not pay much attention to the fact that they are  nurturing an anti-Iranian terrorist group in their midst. In  1986 Mas'ud Rajavi admitted to the killing of 15,000 Iranians in  an interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE. The Germans say that  their criterion is that they should not commit terrorist actions  on German soil. This is while the Monafeqin [pejorative term  for Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization, MKO] recruit members from  German soil and carry out terroristic operations in Iran through  the Iraqi government. In addition, Germany is not prepared to  treat all terrorist groups which are active against European  governments in the same manner and refuses to grant them asylum.    As far as the controversy on human rights is concerned,  Europeans take the liberty of interfering in the internal  affairs of other countries except in the case of terrorist  activity, when they say as long as terrorist actions are not  committed on their soil, it does not matter. Everyone knows  that terrorist actions are carried out in that particular  country. These double-sided policies are not acceptable for the  broadening of Iranian-German relations.</p>

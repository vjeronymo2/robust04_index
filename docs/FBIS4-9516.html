			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "dz": "The Government Approved 1993 Budget </F> Closing Statement"]    [Text] Prague--In its session yesterday, the government  approved the draft 1993 government budget closing statement.  The statement shows a surplus of 1.1 billion korunas.  According to Deputy Prime Minister Josef Lux, 200 million of  this surplus is to be used for the region program, 87 million  for additional payments on the Bilina mine credit, 339 million  for the internal revenue computer system, and 454 million to  increase reserves for dealing with social problems. The  government described last year as successful. "It was the first  time that a growth of labor productivity could be registered--by  3.1 percent--and the foreign currency reserves reached their  maximum in the history of our state--$6 billion," Lux  emphasized. The government acknowledged the Czech National Bank  report on the balance of payments and monetary development for  1993. "The debt of the Czech Republic increased by $1.8 billion  to $8.7 billion, 76 percent of which are long-term obligations.  Overall, we are creditors, but a great part of our claims is  difficult to collect," Lux commented.</p>

The agreement came after hours of closed-door talks here  between Sudanese President 'Umar al-Bashir and the presidents of  Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda, who also met leaders of two rival  factions of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).    "The government of Sudan and the SPLA factions have stated  their readiness to immediately embark on peace negotiations,"  Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said.    The six-nation regional organisation, the Intergovernmental  Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD), has named Kenya,  Ethiopia, Uganda and Eritrea to spearhead a new initiative to  bring peace to famine-hit Sudan.    The agreement stopped short of declaring a ceasefire in  southern Sudan, where the government has taken advantage of  tribal divisions in the SPLA to launch a new offensive aimed at  crushing the southern rebellion.    But the IGADD presidents said in a press statement that the  warring parties had agreed to "desist from esclating hostilities  ... in order to create a conducive atmosphere for the  negotiations."    "The root causes of the conflict are so complex that  previous  peace conference have failed to arrive at a peaceful solution,"  Moi told his fellow heads of state and rebel leaders in a brief  open session after the meetings.    "We must be prepared to give peace a chance," Moi said,  stressing that Africans had to play a more active role in  solving their problems instead of waiting for outside  initiatives.    He said the forthcoming negotiations would try to reach "a  comprehensive negotiated settlement and urged all sides to allow  relief supplies into southern Sudan, where millions depend on  food aid.</p>

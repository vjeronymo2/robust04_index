			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOBACCO INDUSTRY WINNING MANY BATTLES;  </P> <P> HEALTH: DESPITE SOME VICTORIES BY ANTI-SMOKING FORCES, THE POWERFUL LOBBY IS  ABLE TO FEND OFF MOST OPPOSITION LEGISLATION.  </P> <P> It's increasingly fashionable to knock the tobacco industry, but the salvos  from public officials and consumers have yet to seriously threaten its  political health.  </P> <P> Both sides in the battle over cigarette smoking agree the tobacco lobby is  losing few fights on Capitol Hill and winning significant victories at the  state level.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't feel sorry for them yet," said Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.),  chairman of a House health subcommittee. "They still have a formidable amount  of power in the Congress and influence around this country. They still have  economic clout."  </P> <P> One of the most powerful industry trade groups is the Tobacco Institute,  representing the nation's cigarette makers. The institute has nine field  offices with three employees each, plus lobbyists in all the state capitals and  some key cities. Its political action committee raises about $200,000 for  federal candidates during each two-year election cycle, and it has Political  Action Committees in many states.  </P> <P> On the other side are anti-smoking groups, growing in both size and  sophistication, making their case with lots of passion and not much money.  </P> <P> The two major national groups are the grass-roots Americans for Nonsmokers'  Rights and the Coalition on Smoking OR Health, which represents the American  heart, lung and cancer associations and other voluntary health groups.  </P> <P> Reinforcing their efforts is Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W.  Sullivan, who does not miss a chance to slam the tobacco industry.  </P> <P> He has attacked campaigns to market new cigarette brands to inner-city blacks  and undereducated young women, and reported that smoking costs the country $52  billion a year in bad health and lost productivity. He's also asked advertising  agencies to reject tobacco accounts, TV stations to warn viewers against  smoking and athletic associations to reject "blood money" from tobacco  companies seeking to sponsor sporting events.  </P> <P> And that's just this year.  </P> <P> The tobacco lobby lost a big one when Congress passed the smoking ban that took  effect last month on nearly all domestic airline flights. Its only comparable  defeat came in 1983, when the federal excise tax on cigarettes was doubled to  16 cents.  </P> <P> After the airline ban took effect, some congressmen said they would turn their  attention to railroads. Last week, Amtrak announced that it would eliminate  smoking on some trains and in some stations effective April 1.  </P> <P> While keeping damages to a minimum in Congress, the industry often has  prevailed on the state level. Its latest project is to win statewide preemption  laws that impose some smoking restrictions but bar cities or counties from  passing anything more severe.  </P> <P> Such laws are a pivotal industry strategy as more and more localities enact  smoking ordinances. One of the strictest took effect this year in Greensboro,  N.C., a key tobacco state.  </P> <P> "When you have 95,000 local units of government in this country and you have a  finite amount of resources, then the smart thing to do is to try to limit the  potential for mischief," said Walker Merryman, a spokesman for the Tobacco  Institute.  </P> <P> Mark Pertschuk, director of the Berkeley-based Americans for Nonsmokers'  Rights, said his group is getting its best results at the local level. That's  where 90% of anti-smoking activity occurs, from protecting nonsmokers to  banning vending machines and free samples, Pertschuk said.  </P> <P> Preemption laws are thus "an extraordinary victory" for the tobacco industry,  he said.  </P> <P> A preemption law recently passed in Virginia placing limitations on public  smoking. What worries Pertschuk more is tobacco interests winning in states  where their crop never has been king, such as Pennsylvania, Florida and  Illinois.  </P> <P> But if some state capitals still are in the grip of the tobacco lobby,  Pertschuk and others believe the industry's hold on Capitol Hill is weakening.  </P> <P> As evidence, they point to the airline smoking ban and a barrage of  anti-tobacco proposals pending or soon to be introduced.  </P> <P> Some of the plans would ban advertising, one would limit ads to text only, and  another would give states the power to limit cigarette billboards.  </P> <P> Others would raise the cigarette excise tax, eliminate tax breaks for business  expenses associated with cigarette advertising, tighten federal regulation of  toxic cigarette ingredients and create a public health agency for tobacco  research and education.  </P> <P> Proponents say they have momentum from the flight ban victory and expect to  achieve at least some of their agenda this year.  </P></p>

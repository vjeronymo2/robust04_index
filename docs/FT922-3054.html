			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Account closes with further setback A RENEWED wave of bad news from the corporate sector brought further losses in the UK stock market as the two week trading account closed yesterday. Trading was dominated by an interim trading report from Fisons, the pharmaceutical group, where the chairman said profits for the first half year would be below the comparable figures; the shares fell by Pounds 1.00 in heavy turnover which convinced some traders that a would-be predator had shown his hand again. The Fisons blow fell on a stock market already unsettled this week by repeated signs from leading British companies that the recession in the UK economy continues to bear down heavily on corporate earnings. In the second half of the trading session, London almost gave up hope and share prices backed away in spite of a firm start on Wall Street; the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 20 points up when London closed only a couple of points above its low point for the day. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,603.7, for a net loss of 10.4. The Index touched 2,601.4 earlier but traders drew little encouragement from its success in holding on to the Footsie 2,600 mark. Yesterday's setback brought the loss in the Footsie over the two week trading account to 103.8 points, or 3.8 per cent. The reaction from the strength which followed the re-election of the Conservative government in the UK general election last April has been prompted by uncertainty over prospects for the Maastricht treaty, following its rejection in the the Danish referendum, and also by concern over UK corporate earnings. While genuine investment business has declined, intra-market activity has increased as marketmakers have grown uneasy ahead of the expiry of the June futures contract on the FT-SE Index. Seaq turnover remained high yesterday at 497.7m shares, although there was no repetition of the trading programmes which boosted turnover on Thursday to 597.7m shares. The London market was also depressed by a sharp fall in BP shares after US sources turned determined sellers. Such was the stock market's concern with the flow of disappointing company news that little heed was paid to the May Retail Price Index, showing an unchanged annualised rate of 4.3 per cent; government bonds ended little changed after the announcement of a new issue of Pounds 500m Index-linked bonds. Customer, or retail volume in equities continues to struggle to recover from nervousness over prospects for the Maastricht treaty.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Despite a growing sense that  Japan's economy is hitting bottom, "many minus factors still  remain," Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said Tuesday [24  May].    Mieno told the House of Representatives Budget Committee  more  time is still needed to judge if bright spots in the economy  will overtake the bad ones and spread to a general recovery.    He said more "conditions for recovery" are falling into  place  now than a year ago, when hopes for a turnaround were dashed by  the surging yen, bad weather and political turmoil.    Mieno cited such improving conditions as companies' progress  in stock adjustments, the effects of government fiscal and  monetary stimulus measures and increasing robustness in the  world economy, especially the United States.    But he expressed continued concern over the effects of trade  friction, the high yen and balance-sheet adjustments, such as  the mountain of bad loans that financial institutions are trying  to clear off their books.    He repeated that each country's monetary policy must be  based  on a "comprehensive judgment" of the economy and not such single  factors as exchange or real interest rates.    As the U.S. has raised rates and Germany cut them, Japan's  central bank has led money market interest rates to repeated  record lows through generous market funding. Many market  players infer the moves are coordinated and designed to curb the  yen and prop up the dollar.</p>

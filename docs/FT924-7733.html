			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Accounts that yield anger: Britain's banks face rising customer protests As befits a man with a shiny metal hook where his right hand used to be, Mr Chris Joseph has a colourful tale to tell. It contains lurid accusations of treachery and betrayal by a high-street bank, culminating in the alleged plundering of the logo designed by his advertising agency. Mr Joseph, a former Benedictine monk and nightclub bouncer who lost his hand in a foundry accident, is unperturbed by bankers' private mutterings that he is a crank. 'You talk to anyone, and they have a horror story about their bank. We cranks are the ones they used to call customers,' he says. This week saw the launch of his latest effort to embarrass Barclays Bank over its treatment of himself and other small business people. The Struggle Against Financial Exploitation (Safe) campaign group was unveiled at Methodist Central Hall in Westminster in a meeting packed with disgruntled bank customers. The other founder of Safe is no less interesting. Mr Brian Jones is a property developer embroiled in a row with Barclays over a Pounds 393,000 loan. He has protested by detonating 400 stink bombs in 87 Barclays branches, and towing a mobile poster bearing his complaints past the bank's head office in the City. Messrs Jones and Joseph started their campaign by calling for all Barclays customers to withdraw their money from the bank on a single day to test its solvency. They also want to get shareholders of the high-street banks to force inquiries into their management under the Companies Act. Safe is not alone in trying to marshal the resentment of small businesses against big banks. Lloyds Bank has been faced by the Bank Action Group (Bag), formed by Mrs Patricia Griffiths, a small business owner from Preston who was charged Pounds 14,000 too much interest on her loans. The emergence of a nascent consumer movement in banking comes at a sensitive time for the clearing banks. They are getting squeezed between their unhappy customers and shareholders dissatisfied at falls in pre-tax profits as they make large provisions for bad loans from the 1980s. As they struggle to regain their standing in the eyes of investors by being more conservative about lending, they are reducing overdraft facilities and not fully passing on base rate cuts to the interest rates they charge on loans. The result has been discontent. There are signs that public protest is an effective weapon. Safe's tactics - such as selling T-shirts with abusive slogans about banks - expose it to accusations of eccentricity. But in some cases it has also encouraged banks to offer to write off bad loans, providing such arrangements are secret. The precedents are not good for the clearers. Similar grumblings by the banks about the tactics of third-world countries which threatened to default on loans in the 1980s proved ineffective. They were forced to reschedule payments, and have continued to make large provisions against problem loans. Nor is it easy to dismiss the small business protests as just loud noises made by a few eccentrics. It is questionable how many customers Bag and Safe represent. But it is hard to deny the broader growth of consumer resentment that is increasingly pushing the banks on to the defensive. The growth of dissatisfaction among personal customers is already clear. The Consumers' Association last week published a survey of 3,700 members which found one in 10 thought they had been incorrectly charged on personal accounts, and one in five reported mistakes in standing orders and direct debits. Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the association, says rising levels of discontent partly reflect the general growth of confidence among consumers. But she thinks they also stem from banks adopting a harder line as they try to raise income from fees. Personal customers' gripes are proving hard to stem. A Code of Banking Practice was introduced in March after two years of negotiations between banks and consumer groups. However, complaints to the banking ombudsman, which rose from 3,915 in 1990 to 6,327 in 1991, have increased further this year. Yet small business dissatisfaction is fast becoming an even trickier matter for the banks. Both the code of practice and banking ombudsman scheme are limited to personal customers. Small businesses have not been given an independent forum for complaints, and have resorted more to public protest. The banks have tried to counter the wave of unhappiness by producing their own codes of conduct in dealing with small business. Lloyds Bank is mailing copies of a revised 'small business charter' to 350,000 customers this month, and has promised them advance notice of account charges. The banks say they are paying the price of not telling customers clearly enough about loans and overdrafts. 'We have learned that communication is important, and we are trying to establish a much closer dialogue,' says Mr Phil Nunnerley, assistant general manager for retail banking at Lloyds. Talking more, and apologising for mistakes more promptly, may help. But no matter how open they are now, the banks are stuck with many poor loans. Barclays has been writing off loans from its Pounds 13bn portfolio with small businesses at a rate of Pounds 1m a day for 18 months. 'There were clearly cases in the late 1980s where we were not conservative enough about loans,' says Mr David Lavarack, Barclays' head of small business services. The banks now have to balance caution with keeping a healthy asset base. 'There is no question of us turning off the tap,' he says. One result of these woes is that banks may be more firm in asking small businesses to take out fixed-term loans rather than the overdrafts they have tended to prefer. The flexibility of an overdraft facility in the 1980s has been painfully balanced by the abruptness with which some have been curtailed in the 1990s. A second result is that banks are being careful not to provoke the wrath of small businesses where they can avoid it. National Westminster and Barclays both reduced their minimum lending rates for small business loans this week to allow them promptly to respond to Thursday's base rate cut. But nerves are likely to stay tender for some time. Mr Joseph tells an apocryphal story about the loss of his right hand. 'Some people think Barclays have got my arm, and now they are after one of my legs.' It is not the sort of joke that provokes much mirth among bankers these days.</p>

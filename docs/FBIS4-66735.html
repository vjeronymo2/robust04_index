			<p>CSO     [Text] Economics Division. One of the important points that  was emphasized under the First Five-Year Plan was turning  affairs over to the people, privatization, and reducing  government expenses. Unfortunately, implementing this policy was  not successful in the year 1372. A selection of reports on the  government's policy, the efforts made and the existing obstacles  can well illustrate this conclusion.    Ninety percent of distribution activities were turned over  to  the private sector.    Economic liberalization was considered a focus of government  activity.    Minister of Commerce, 1/30/1372 [19 April 1993]    The government, in turning work over to the people, must  avoid trivial executive problems.    Speaker of the Majles, 2/8/1372 [28 April 1993]    The goal of privatization is to set economic activity in  motion.    Dr. Nurbakhsh, 2/19/1372 [10 May 1993]    The shares of the companies affiliated with Iran Shipping  are  being sold to the people.    2/21/1372 [12 May 1993]    The failure to do privatization quickly has created problems  for heavy industry.    4/23/1372 [14 July 1993]    The executive affairs of the Ministry of Roads and  Transportation and its affiliated organizations are being  transferred to the private sector.    Administrative Council, 5/5/1372 [27 July 1993]    The Ministry of Industries has not taken the necessary steps  to expedite the transfer of units to the private sector.    Stock Market Council, 5/16/1372    The minister of heavy industries criticized the way the  government organizations are dealing with private sector  investors.    6/9/1372 [31 August 1993]    The petrochemical industry can develop only via the private  sector.    Executive Director of Petrochemicals 6/21/1372 [12  September 1993]    In the year 1373 the shares of 60 companies under the  National Industries Organization were turned over to the people.    8/17/1372 [8 November 1993]    The nation's economic structure has prevented turning  affairs  over to the people.    Minister of Commerce, 10/9/1372 [30 December 1993]    The government organizations are not willing to do extensive  sales of the shares of their companies on the stock market.    General Manager of the Stock Market, 11/4/1372 [24 January  1994]    Sixty percent of the shares offered for sale on the stock  market this year were purchased by government banks and companies    11/30/1372 [19 February 1994]</p>

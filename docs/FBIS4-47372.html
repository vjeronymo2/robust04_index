I. Gershenzon, M. B. Gokhberg, Unified </F> Institute of Earth Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences; UDC  550.385.46:550.343]    [Abstract] Variations of the geomagnetic field at 0.01-10  Hz recorded at the epicenter of the Loma Prieta earthquake (M =  7.1) may be explained by a set of electric dipoles which appear  due to a change in the pore liquid pressure near faults 0.1-10 m  in size. It is sufficient for these sources to arise in a narrow  water-bearing stratum (about 10 m) near the surface (10-100 m  deep). The magnitude of the effect depends heavily on the size  of faults, frequency, and the depth of bedding of the layer, and  to a lesser extent, on the expanse of the layer, conductivity,  and the number of faults. Anomalies were recorded more than a  month before the earthquake, but the most powerful anomalies  began three hours before the earthquake in the 0.01-0.4 Hz range  and exceeded the background by two orders of magnitude. The  model presented here is based on pulse processes of fault  formation in the Earth's crust, which cause disturbances in a  wide range of frequencies, including he ULF range. In this range  electrokinetic and piezomagnetic effects are predominant.  However, the piezomagnetic field does not match observations in  magnitude or frequency. Electrokinetic effects agree  satisfactorily with experimental data. The model presented  here can determine parameters of the fault formation process,  the size distribution of faults, and the rate of appearance.

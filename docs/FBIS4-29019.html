			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- The Citizens Coalition  for Economic Justice on Wednesday asked the United States to  stop making acts of fomenting a "war atmosphere" on the Korean  peninsula for the sake of its own national interests.    In a statement it issued in connection with the North Korean  nuclear question, the coalition stressed that the Untied States  should refrain from making provocative remarks such as "military  sanctions being considered."    "In particular, the United States should not take any  military actions that could be regarded by North Korea as the  provocation of a war," it said.    Emphasizing that no fratricidal war should recur between the  same people, the coalition said the South Korean Government  should display the intent of resolving the matter through  dialogue while North Korea should ensure nuclear transparency  under the basic South-North agreement.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Positive vote for a bigger club: The entry of Sweden could prove a turning point in the fortunes of the European Union Sweden's Yes to membership of the European Union in Sunday's referendum vindicates the EU's enlargement strategy. With the people of Austria, Finland and Sweden having voted in favour of membership of the club, pressure will mount on the Norwegians to follow suit in their November 28 referendum. Whether or not Norway follows its immediate neighbour, there is now the prospect of a new Nordic dynamic for the EU that will offset the tug towards the Mediterranean which took place with the entry of Greece, Spain and Portugal in the 1980s. The entry of Sweden - the most powerful of the newcomers - could prove a turning point in the EU's fortunes after two years marked by recession, monetary instability and divisions over the conflict in former Yugoslavia. 'It shows that Europe is still attractive,' said Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing president of the European Commission. Mr Delors was worried that a No vote in Sweden would have emboldened Euro-sceptics in Denmark, the UK, perhaps even his native France. It would also have sunk hopes of coaxing fish- and oil-rich Norway into the fold. Finland would have been left isolated, and a Sweden outside the EU might have provided a focus for deeper Nordic co-operation in competition with the EU. Instead, three - possibly four - wealthy, industrious states are on schedule to enter the Union in January 1995. Each agrees, broadly, on freer trade, tighter budgets, stricter environment rules and greater openness in decision-making. Sunday's vote in Sweden means that the Scandinavians and Austrians have finally come in from the cold. For most of the post-second world war era, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway kept western Europe at arms-length, cherishing their neutrality and viewing the political aspects of the (then) European Economic Community with suspicion. All four joined the UK-led drive in 1959 to create a free-trade rival known as the European Free Trade Association. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 left the EFTA states facing instability to the east and caught in a political vacuum. With the EU entering its most dynamic phase with the creation of a single market and plans under way for a single European currency, the Union suddenly looked an attractive option. Mr Delors, fearful that premature enlargement could dilute the forces of integration inside the Twelve, proposed a half-way house called the European Economic Area. The EEA offered the benefits of the single market but not full membership. Businesses in the non-EU countries were forced to accept dozens of regulations and decisions over which they had no influence. 'We were silent partners,' says President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland. Such commercial considerations were important in the applications by Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway for full EU membership. But there was also a hard-nosed political calculation: EU membership looked a safer bet than limited regional co-operation or relative isolation within the EEA. 'We need to be part of the political processes which have great impact on Norway's future,' said Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister. The first impact of enlargement will be to prod the Union into looking less inward and more outward, especially towards the east. The Nordic countries want Brussels to pay more attention to environmental disasters in the former Soviet Union; and they are committed to anchoring the Baltic states in western Europe. The newcomers share a goal of early EU membership for the central and east Europeans. In rough sequence, enlargement might begin with the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary, followed by Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania, and the Baltic states. Second, enlargement will affect the union's trade policy. In the Council of Ministers - and inside the European Commission - a delicate balance exists between the EU's northern liberal wing and the more protectionist 'Club Med' countries often led by France. In future, the balance is likely to tilt toward a more liberal regime. The Nordic countries are also expected to line up behind Britain, Denmark, the Netherlands and, usually, Germany in opposition to over-generous state aid. Similarly, the addition of net contributors to the EU budget may give extra weight to the Anglo-Dutch-German campaign to control spending at the expense of the 'Poor Four' - Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal - which benefit from extra regional aid. Third, enlargement is bound to further erode the neutrality of Austria, Finland and Sweden (Norway is a member of Nato). The three are expected to be drawn progressively into the Western European Union, the EU's fledgling defence arm. But partly out of sensitivity to domestic public opinion and to Russia, the process will be slow. On the surface, expansion of the EU looks like a victory for UK-led arguments in favour of 'widening' Europe rather than 'deepening' integration. The newcomers are not centralisers and support the principle of subsidiarity, the principal of devolving decision-making from Brussels where appropriate. But enlargement is double-edged from the UK's standpoint: the Austrians and Scandinavians enjoy generous welfare state provisions and are determined to strengthen the EU's social policy which is such an anathema to the UK. Moreover, all four newcomers accepted the Maastricht treaty in their accession negotiations. They show little inclination to follow the British policy of seeking treaty opt-outs in areas such as the planned European monetary union. They are likely to be in the vanguard of moves towards greater integration. Finally, enlargement means that institutional reform is back on the agenda. Decision-making is hard enough with the present 12 member states, each with veto power in areas such as fiscal policy. Sixteen member states means more working languages, more European Commissioners and, possibly, more paralysis  -and adds to the pressure for streamlining at the 1996 Inter-Governmental Conference to review the Maastricht treaty. The question is: how much? With one eye on the next enlargement to central and eastern Europe, Germany's ruling Christian Democratic Union has already floated ideas for organising a Union of between 20 and 25 member states, built around a Franco-German 'hard-core' committed to faster political and economic integration. But France is hesitant about a further surrender of political sovereignty; the UK remains unremittingly hostile. This is a complex subject upon which the finest minds in Europe have only just begun to ponder. The tendency so far appears to be towards a minimum set of rules and obligations, with no member state having the right to stop others able and willing to move at a faster pace. This is a message that suits the Austrians and Scandinavians. They have spent 30 years on the outside looking in. They have had a vigorous debate on the merits of membership. Now they are committed to making it work.</p>

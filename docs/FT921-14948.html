			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / International Company News: Maxwells under TV scrutiny - Their parliamentary meeting We're not political dentists - I can't get their mouths open and make them speak' says Mr Frank Field, MP. Today at 2pm he will interview the sons of the late Mr Robert Maxwell in his role as chairman of the parliamentary committee that is trying to trace hundreds of millions of pounds missing from the pension funds of the publisher's collapsed empire. If Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell agree to answer the Social Security committee's questions, it will be their first public comment on how the money disappeared. Today is a hectic day for Mr Kevin Maxwell's lawyers - at 10.30am, unconnected with the committee proceedings, his court battle over his right to refuse to answer questions about the missing millions goes to the Court of Appeal. Although the brothers are obliged to attend the Social Security committee, it cannot force them to answer its questions, and attention will be on the degree of their co-operation. However, Mr Field pointed out yesterday that the committee would be televised 'and silences will be recorded. In the days when the proceedings were just recorded in Hansard, the importance of silences was not obvious'. Mr Field added that he would open the committee by reminding those attending that it was not a trial, but that he had suggested to the Maxwell brothers that they could bring their lawyers if they wanted. The Social Security committee has ordered the brothers to submit trust deeds, accounts and financial statements on Maxwell family trusts and foundations. It is now clear that some of the missing pension fund money - which could be as much as Pounds 700m - was used to shore up the tottering private Maxwell companies. However these businesses, now in administration under insolvency regulations, are ultimately owned by companies registered in Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Gibraltar, and the committee is hoping to shed light on whether pension fund money has been diverted there. The committee has said that with 16,000 Mirror and Maxwell pensioners involved the case is of major public interest. Its demand was submitted to the brothers in mid-December after they failed to attend an earlier committee hearing into the loss of pension funds from publicly listed Maxwell companies. In a separate move today, the Court of Appeal will consider whether Mr Kevin Maxwell can rely on the common law right against self-incrimination as a ground for refusing to answer questions. He is not obliged to turn up in person. Mr Maxwell is appealing against Mr Justice Hoffman's decision on December 24 that he must comply with an order on December 8 requiring him to disclose on affidavit his knowledge of transactions from October 1989 onwards involving property funds or assets of Bishopsgate Investment Management, which was manager of most of the pooled pension funds for Maxwell companies. The basis for Mr Justice Hoffman's decision was that the order was made in Companies Court proceedings under the 1986 Insolvency Act, which does not entitle him to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination. The court will also hear a separate cross-appeal from Mirror Group Newspapers, one of the publicly-listed Maxwell companies, which has brought an action for damages for breach of trust, fraud and conversion against Mr Kevin Maxwell, his brother, and the personal representatives of their late father. MGN is appealing against Mr Justice Hoffman's decision that Mr Kevin Maxwell should be excused from some of the disclosure requirements in an order on December 12 as the order was obtained in ordinary proceedings by private writ.</p>

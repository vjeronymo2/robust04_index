			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / World Trade News: China expects sharp rise in oil imports China expects to be importing 100m tonnes of crude oil annually by early next century, to sustain its continued rapid economic expansion. Mr Li Boxi, a senior official of the State Development Research Centre, forecast an explosion in demand for crude imports if China failed to bring on stream big new fields. 'The situation can hardly change for the better if no new big oil fields are tapped,' he was quoted as saying by the official China Daily newspaper. Mr Li expects China's crude imports to reach 50m tonnes by the end of the century and 100m tonnes by the year 2010. China's planned annual average economic growth rate is 8 per cent to the year 2000. China, which averaged 13 per cent economic growth for the past two years, became a net importer of crude last year, but Chinese officials are cagey about the volume. Mr Wang Tao, president of the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), said the 'export volume of crude oil was larger than imports' last year. He did not give details. But China has been preparing for a closer oil trading relationship with Gulf states. Mr Li Lanqing, a vice premier, visited the Gulf last year to discuss the possibility of long-term arrangements. China imported 15.65m tonnes of crude in 1993 and 12.8m tonnes of refined products. Output reached 143.7m tonnes from both onshore and offshore fields but China is struggling to maintain these production levels. Mr Wang predicted that China's output would rise this year, but not enough to meet rising demand. Most of China's oilfields are mature and require substantial investment to maintain production levels. China is continuing to open onshore and offshore fields to foreign explorers, but results have been disappointing. Hopes are pinned on the Tarim basin region in the country's far west, but exploration and development is at an early stage. Oil officials say China should cast its net wider in the search for oil. Last month China announced plans to invest Yn100bn in its outdated petrochemical sector by 2000, with much of the funds coming from abroad, including equity participation. It is negotiating investment deals with several big oil producers and refiners, including Aramco, Saudi Arabia's state oil company, to establish joint venture refineries. China's need for additional refining capacity is underscored by the fact that with 20 per cent of the world's population, it has just 3.7 per cent of world capacity for crude oil processing.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: WTC agrees sale of HK office complex to China WORLD Trade Centre (WTC), a company in the Tomson Pacific group headed by Macao casino entrepreneur Mr Stanley Ho, has agreed to sell the Hongkong World Trade Centre to Resourceful River, a mainland Chinese concern, for HKDollars 2.5bn (USDollars 323m), Reuter reports from Hong Kong. Mr David Lee, WTC general manager, said the deal to sell the shopping and office complex in Hong Kong's Causeway Bay district would bring a net profit of about HKDollars 650m. Shareholders have yet to approve the deal. In May, Hongkong Land sold a central district block to a Chinese consortium for HKDollars 3.8bn. Mr Lee said: 'The proceeds will be used to repay debts, finance the company's various projects in China, and for strategic investment in Hong Kong and south-east Asia.' On September 1, the Hong Kong government appointed an inspector to probe the affairs of WTC and Tomson Pacific after a Securities and Futures Commission investigation into certain share deals by the two companies.</p>

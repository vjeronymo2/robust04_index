Rawlings,  has appealed to all whose interests are at stake in land  disputes in parts of the country to exercise restraint. He said  they must also avoid provocations and confrontations which only  lead to loss of life and property. These were contained in a  speech read for him by the presidential adviser on chieftancy  affairs, Nana Akuoko Sarpong at the grand durbar at Abetifi to  round off the Afahye [traditional festival] of the people of the  Kwahu traditional area.    Flight-Lieutenant Rawlings assured the people that all such  land cases will be thoroughly investigated by government to  enable peace to prevail. The president said Ghanaians have  centuries-old institutions to settle communal differences. But  lately, violence threatens to break the country apart. He  therefore emphasized the need for peace in all communities. He  said all must have the will to talk and stay at the talking  table until agreement is reached. President Rawlings advised the  people of Kwahu to use their rich business experience to promote  the export trade in the country. [passage omitted]</p>

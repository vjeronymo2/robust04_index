			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ROSTENKOWSKI TO SEEK TAX HIKE, GIVES UP CUT IN CAPITAL GAINS  </P> <P> The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee has given up the idea of  cutting the capital gains tax because of Democratic opposition, according to a  published report today.  </P> <P> Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) said he plans to file a $5.3-billion tax  increase bill with revenue-raising provisions instead of coupling a temporary  reduction in the capital gains tax with expansions of tax breaks for low-income  people.  </P> <P> Rostenkowski told the Wall Street Journal that he encountered stronger  resistance than expected from Democrats on his committee to reducing the tax.  </P> <P> "I never anticipated there would be as much resistance to capital gains as  there was," he said.  </P> <P> Democrats had argued that the tax break would be too large a benefit for  wealthy people and also probably would cost the government revenue in the long  run.  </P> <P> President Bush supports the idea of cutting the capital gains tax, and  Rostenkowski said his plan came after the President suggested to him, "Why  don't you try to put together a package?"  </P></p>

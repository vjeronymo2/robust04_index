			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / People: Direct move for Lloyd The Direct Marketing Association has a new chief executive, Colin Lloyd, 51. Lloyd founded the highly successful direct marketing and sales promotion public company KLP group, which he then sold in 1990 to the Paris-based international advertising network RSCG for Pounds 34m. He stayed on for a while as chairman of RSCG UK but in 1991 turned to serious golfing and consultancy work. That semi-retirement was not to his taste and he is delighted to return to running the DMA, which has a role both for the industry and the consumer. Lloyd's predecessor, Richard Genochio, stayed the course for just nine months. Since he left at the start of this year, Juliet Williams has been running the DMA. Lloyd says he has two core missions: 'To ensure the DMA's educational programme operates on the highest levels, and to make sure that the consumer understands that companies belonging to the DMA really do adhere to our code of practice. We are a vigilant authority and really do clamp down on abuses.' Lloyd has more than 25 years' experience of direct marketing and sales promotion and wants to provide what he calls an 'ambassadorial role which leads the industry forward'.</p>

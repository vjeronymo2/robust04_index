			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PREVIEW: BEHIND THE MASKS OF 'AFRICAN FOLK TALES' HIDE PARABLES OF FRIENDSHIP  </P> <P> The Actors for Children theater troupe usually performs in elementary school  classrooms and at assemblies. But Wednesday, the group will make a rare public  appearance at the Thousand Oaks Library, which means parents will be able to  see the show too.  </P> <P> The theater troupe, which just finished a four-performance series at the Los  Angeles Children's Museum last weekend, has toured the Ventura and L.A. areas  since its inception in 1984.  </P> <P> "We've done everything from traditional fairy tales to a play based on the  'Guinness Book of World Records' -- once we even did an anti-war play done with  broad strokes of mime and vaudeville," said Naomi Monroe, the group's founder  who produces and directs all the shows. "I always look for language in the  scripts that is not condescending. We don't want the kids to feel that some  authority figure is stuffing something down their throats."  </P> <P> At Wednesday's show, five actors -- Michael Lee Jones Jr., Toni Frish-Beery,  Eileen McLoone, Ann West and Larry Woods -- will perform "African Folk Tales,"  a series of four stories written by Anita Gustafson. The central figure in the  tales is a mouse who becomes a storyteller to help him make friends in the  jungle.  </P> <P> What makes this show special for Monroe are the masks the actors will wear in  the production. They were created by Barbara Bouman Jay, a Newbury Park artist  who lived in Africa for 1 1/2 years. "They're really works of art," Monroe  said, "but they're functional too. It took her all summer to create them."  </P> <P> The actors always make a point of putting the masks on in front of the  audience. "We want to make it clear that these are actors," Monroe said. "We  don't want the kids to be frightened."  </P> <P> African instruments -- a drum from Rwanda, a flute from Kenya, Pygmy goat bells  and other shakers and noisemakers -- are used to enhance the authenticity of  the stories. At Wednesday's show, there will be an exhibit of African  artifacts.  </P> <P> Monroe, who runs a casting service for commercials, doesn't limit her theater  work to children. She is also the artistic producing director of the Xanadu  Theatre Company. During the summer, the group performs at Cal Lutheran  University; other times they can be seen at the Conejo Community Center and  other venues -- the group has no permanent theater.  </P> <P> But she believes that her work for children's audiences is especially  important. "I found there was a tremendous ned to introduce children to quality  theater," she said.  </P> <P> It wasn't hard to find others interested in her project. "At first I leaned on  my contacts in the business to find actors," Monroe said, "but now that our  reputation has grown, actors have been calling me.  </P> <P> "But I think it takes three times as much energy to perform before a children's  audience. Kids have such short attention spans; to keep their interest you have  to be physically more active and more mentally alert than you would before an  audience of adults."  </P> <P>  The Actors for Children troupe performs "African Folk Tales" by Anita  Gustafson Jan. 18 at the Thousand Oaks Library, 1401 E. Janss Road, Thousand  Oaks. Performance begins at 7 p.m. Admission is free but reservations are  required. Call (805) 497-6282.  </P> <P> LAURIE OCHOA  </P></p>

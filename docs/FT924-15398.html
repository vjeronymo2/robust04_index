			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Wall Street Friday's US employment report may have shown enough strength to convince the Federal Reserve to delay an interest rate cut. But given the continuing deceleration of the US economy, that delay is unlikely to last much beyond tomorrow's meeting of the Fed's open market committee. Even if the equity market may be supported by a rate cut, it has yet to come to terms with the possibility of Mr Bill Clinton winning the election. The recent sell-off in healthcare stocks was some indication of the likely knee-jerk reaction of the markets to a Democratic victory. Third-quarter earnings figures due in the next few weeks may also be disappointing, with the notable exception of banks, which are thought to have made over Dollars 1bn on the foreign exchanges recently. But there are reasons for optimism. Employment in small businesses is rising. So is capital spending. There is just the hint that companies are substituting technology for labour and that the US may eventually experience that rare event, an investment-led recovery.</p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Survey of International Capital Markets (4): Painful reassessment - Japan share price fall ends flow of funds THE SHARP fall in Japanese share prices has choked off the flow of cheap funds, generated by the bull market of the late 1980s. The activities of Japanese financial institutions and corporations, which grew into leading lenders, investors and borrowers in the international capital markets, have declined sharply. Japan's leading banks, the big lenders of the 1980s, have shifted their strategies from expanding internationally in search of overseas projects to a more conscientious stance. The financial institutions have also been hit by the increase in bad loans and investments, especially in the international real estate markets. 'Japanese banks are assessing risks more carefully, setting higher margins, and curbing international activities by focusing lending to domestic companies,' says Sakura Bank, a leading Japanese commercial bank. The banks are feeling the effects of the capital adequacy standards set by the Bank for International Settlements, and many are cutting back on lending, weeding out unprofitable business, and favouring old-established blue chip Japanese companies over other customers. Because banks count a portion of their stock portfolios as capital, the fall in portfolio values reduced their capital reserves. Losses on securities portfolios, which amounted to Y828.7bn at the end of last March, were 11 times higher than the previous fiscal year. Sakura says it has restructured its international corporate lending division so that it can comprehensively review a company's relationship with the bank, its profit prospects and the profitability for Sakura. However, the bank says it has not consciously cut back on corporate lending. 'The number of companies which we could lend to declined due to the setting of higher standards for lending,' says a Sakura official. He admits that in the financial boom of the late 1980s, lending habits at Japanese banks became 'abnormal', and many banks were 'dumping' loans. 'Things are back to normal now.' The slowdown in the Japanese economy has depressed demand for funds and, together with the slump in the stock markets, has depressed the financial activity of Japanese companies in international capital markets. Japanese companies raised a total of Y5,976bn in the fiscal year to March in equity-linked issues in domestic and overseas markets, down 68 per cent from two years ago. However, demand for funds from companies facing repayments on equity-linked issues launched in the height of the bull market is expected to rise later in the year. According to Daiwa Securities, Japanese companies will see a total of Y6,950bn equity-linked debt mature in the year ending March 1993. The amount is expected to rise to Y9,000bn in the year ending March 1994. An alternative means of funding is through straight bonds. More companies are dipping into the straight bond market, and last fiscal year, companies raised Y6,303.8bn, which was 3.4 times more than in fiscal year 1989. The government has indicated it is ready to ease limits on corporate bond issuance, allowing a broader range of companies to raise funds. The dismantling of the barrier between the banking and securities industries will allow banks to enter the underwriting business, currently dominated by leading securities houses. The commission-bank system, in which every issue has a bank that acts as an agent representing investors, is also set to be abolished. Corporate bonds with shorter maturities are expected to lead to a larger and more liquid corporate bond market. Loans by life insurance companies are also an option for companies. The monthly outstanding loan balance has continued to grow sharply. According to the Bank of Japan, the amounts of loans extended by 27 life insurance companies at the end of February rose by 11.5 per cent to Y51,290bn. Life assurers are trying to increase their lending activities, and some hope to allot over a quarter of new money this fiscal year to corporate loans. Meanwhile, as investors, Japanese institutions have started to take a cautious stance toward international activity. The sharp falls in the stock market have eroded gains on portfolios, and new money for investment has declined due to falls in profits. Last year, Japanese investors bought a net Dollars 3.6bn in equity investments, down 80 per cent from 1989, while a net Dollars 68.2bn was purchased in bonds, a 27 per cent fall. However, Mr Robert Feldman, economist at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, points out that, despite heavy selling of US stocks and bonds by Japanese institutions, the treasury bond market and stock markets have rallied. 'There's less impact than most foreigners worry about,' he says.</p>

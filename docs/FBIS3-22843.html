			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] On 3 March, Seoul vernacular newspapers  react to Tom Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state,  who expressed the hope that the "ROK would abolish the National  Security Law."    The conservative CHOSON ILBO on page 3 carries a 1,000-word  editorial entitled "United States and the National Security Law."    It first says that abolishing the National Security Law is  not a matter that a third country can intervene in, and adds  that, unlike what he has said, the law does not exist to hinder  the promotion of human rights in the ROK, and that he should  have been cautious in commenting anything on the ROK because he  is a leading member of the U.S. delegation to the scheduled  third round of North Korea-U.S. talks. Noting the possibility  that North Korea persistently raised the issue concerning the  National Security Law during the recent North Korea-U.S.  negotiations, the editorial suspects that in a hasty effort to  make North Korea accept nuclear inspections, the United States  may have agreed during its negotiations with North Korea that it  would later say something about the National Security Law. The  editorial then concludes: "Hubbard made such remarks at a time  it has been learned there may be some conflict or disharmony  between the ROK and the United States concerning the North  Korean nuclear issue. Such remarks may possibly make us an  `uneasy spectator.' This is the problem."    The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,000-word  editorial entitled "True Intention of Hubbard, Who Hoped for the  Abolition of the National Security Law." The editorial  questions why he made such remarks at a time when North-South  dialogue is about to resume. The editorial concludes that before  expressing the hope that the National Security Law would be  abolished, the United States should ask North Korea to "stop  suppressing its people and abolish its criminal laws" which bear  a resemblance to those of the Stalinist era.    The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,000-word  editorial entitled "What a U.S. Official Should and Should Not  Say." The editorial first says that his remarks are  "inappropriate" and "undesirable." The editorial even suspects  that the National Security Law may have been a topic in the  negotiations between the United States and North Korea. The  editorial concludes: "An ROK- U.S. cooperation system must be  further strengthened to prevent a similar confusion in the  future."</p>

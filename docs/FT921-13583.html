			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Unwelcome approach for Wilkes JAMES WILKES, the world's largest supplier of beer mats, has received an 'unsolicited and unwelcome' approach which might lead to an offer being made for the Sheffield-based mini-conglomerate. Shares in Wilkes, which has most of its business in engineering, closed up 30p at 189p, for a market value of Pounds 33m. Mr Stephen Hinchcliffe, chairman, refused to identify the prospective bidder, but said a further announcement would be made. While the company continued to trade profitably, it has been pursuing a policy of reducing borrowings in light of the general economic outlook. Mr Hinchcliffe declined to give a gearing figure. But he agreed the company had stretched its balance sheet last year paying Pounds 3.6m for the outstanding 25.8 per cent stake, held by Record Holdings, the Sheffield-based hand and power tools manufacturer, in Easterbrook Allcard, the cutting tools concern Wilkes acquired in 1990. The company also said that Mr Arthur Watt had been made group managing director on January 14, and a second non-executive director would be appointed shortly.</p>

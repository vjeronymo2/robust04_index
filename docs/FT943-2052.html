			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / NFC forced to cancel third scrip dividend: Company will have to pay shareholders another Pounds 545,000 in cash The cancellation of one scrip dividend is unfortunate, but to do so for the third time in a row - as NFC did yesterday - could appear to smack of carelessness. The cancellation follows the transport and logistics group's recent indignity of losing its place in the FT-SE 100 index. NFC's shares have underperformed the index by 40 per cent in the past year. The value of the scrip alternative to NFC's second interim dividend, under which investors could opt for shares in lieu of cash, was fixed at 198.2p in July. By yesterday, after the departure of chief executive Mr Peter Sherlock and a profits warning, the shares had fallen to 163p. The cancellation will cost NFC Pounds 545,331, as 21,500 shareholders had already opted to take up the shares. They will now receive the 1.5p per share cash payment. The two previous cancellations, in March and June, cost it close to Pounds 1.5m in cash, turning NFC's declining share price into a meaningful expense. In the past year, Ladbroke Group and Albert Fisher Holdings have cancelled scrip offerings, and volatile stock markets can clearly wreak unforeseeable havoc on such offers. In NFC's case, a weak market has been exacerbated by disappointment at the aftermath of last year's Pounds 263m rights issue. High hopes of the benefits of Mr Sherlock's rationalisation blueprint, that accompanied the rights, have been dashed, and his departure raised further concerns over NFC's strategic direction.</p>

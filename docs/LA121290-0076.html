			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: RADIO  </P> <P> Operation Mark and Brian: KLOS-FM (95.5) morning drive-time duo Mark Thompson  and Brian Phelps will broadcast their top-rated show from Saudi Arabia on  Tuesday.  </P> <P> They'll make the 18-hour flight Monday on MGM Air as part of Operation Desert  Cheer, which is transporting 15 tons of gifts for the servicemen. A satellite  hook-up costing an estimated $15,000 will enable Tuesday's show to be heard  live in Southern California. The pair hope to be able to broadcast telephone  calls between servicemen and their families in the Los Angeles area. The  usually irreverent deejays grew serious on the air Tuesday discussing their  impending trip. "It's absolutely mind-boggling for us, a great honor," said  Thompson. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

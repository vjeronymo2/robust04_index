			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "National News </F> Hookup" program]    [Text] The 1994 Beijing International High-Level Economic  Forum closed today. At today's meeting, Wu Yi, minister of  foreign trade and economic cooperation; Liu Zhongli, minister of  finance; Helmut Schmidt, former chancellor of the FRG; and  Ernest Stern, managing director of the World Bank, delivered  speeches on, respectively, reform of China's foreign trade  system, taxation and financial systems, relations between the  Chinese economy and the world economy, and China's socialist  market economy.    Commenting on the meeting, Li Tieying said:    [Begin Li recording] I believe that this meeting is a  success. This is the first large, high-level international  economic forum of its kind ever held in Beijing. A China that  is undergoing reform and opening up needs to know the world  better and we also need to make the world understand us better.  That is the purpose of this meeting. [end Li recording] [video  shows li seated on a couch, talking into a microphone held by an  unidentified correspondent seated beside him]    While the forum was in session, station reporters  interviewed  Helmut Schmidt, former chancellor of the FRG; Ernest Stern,  managing director of the World Bank; Goodman, chairman of the  Committee for Development of U.S.-China Trade; and Richard  McLean, chairman of the INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE.

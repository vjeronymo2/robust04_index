			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Producers prepare for coffee pact push COFFEE PRODUCING countries will meet tomorrow and Sunday in London to try to tighten up their plans for a new international coffee agreement before meeting consumers next week. The proposals agreed at a meeting of producers late last month were described by one anaylst as 'deliberately vague'. They envisaged a global export quota of about 62m bags (60 kg each), incorporating selectivity between different types of coffee and shared out between producing countries on the basis of export performance in the free market since the collapse of export quotas in July 1989. Mr Nestor Osorio, Colombian delegate to the International Coffee Organisation, said yesterday that with prices at 20-year lows there was urgent need for market regulation. 'Producers are completely committed - we shall be trying over the weekend to agree concrete proposals to take before the consumers.' Among the problems the producers will be trying to untangle are quota allocation and a viable control system. Colombia, the second biggest coffee producer after Brazil, has been the main driving force behind moves towards a renewed pact. Mr Osorio believes if the political will is there, movement towards a new agreement could be quick. 'I think we have already lost a lot of time.' Consumers do not appear to be in so much of a hurry. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures broker, points out that the willingness of the US, the biggest consumer, to tolerate an agreement is based on solely on the political motive of fighting the Colombian drug barons. In any case they may not agree to such a low overall quota as 62m bags, which is 10m bags below consumption and would force them to draw down their stocks. Market observers are not optimistic. Last week Mr Mark Dumas, managing director of ED &amp; F. Man, the big London trade house, told a coffee conference: 'My personal view is that unfortunately there will not be a new agreement with powers to control the market'. The Economist Intelligence Unit said yesterday in its World Commodity Forecasts that it did not believe the producers will succeed in their aim of activating a new agreement from October as the issues are too complex.</p>

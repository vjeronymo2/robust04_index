			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian tea production bounces back IN THE first six months of this year the Indian tea crop was up 26m kg to 263.11m kg. Except for Cachar in Assam, where production in the first half declined by 1.35m kg to 13.16m kg, all the other tea growing centres in the north and the south registered higher output. At 121.74m kg, total Assam production was up nearly 5m kg, while West Bengal's output of 54.77m kg showed a remarkable improvement of 10.34m kg. Darjeeling, which grows some of the finest teas, recorded a production rise of 761,000 kg to 4.21m kg. Last year Darjeeling production fell by 24.4 per cent to 9.9m kg. South India, which suffered a production setback of 26.5m kg last year because of a prolonged drought bounced, back in the first half of 1993 with a rise of 10.57m kg to 85.33m kg. The Tamil Nadu crop of 52.17m kg was up 5.16m kg. Kerala registered a crop rise of 5.21m kg at 31.07m kg, while at 2.09m kg, Karnataka's output was 201,000 kg ahead of the corresponding period last year. The monthly Indian tea crop, however, suffered a setback of about 4m kg in June to 81.29m. Industry officials expect the country's tea planters to grow about 740m kg of tea in 1993, up from 703.9m kg last year. In 1991 production amounted to 741.7m kg. It now appears that the export target of 210m kg for 1993 can be achieved. Up to June export licences for 95m kg had been issued and the country has been particularly successful in stepping up tea exports to the UK. The industry is happy that in spite of the rise in production, prices at the auction centres are much higher than last year's. At the Calcutta auction, the average price realised for CTC (cut, tear and curl) tea to the middle of August was Rs52.77 (Pounds 1.11) a kilogram, compared with Rs41.46 over the same period last year.</p>

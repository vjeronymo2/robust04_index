On Saturday, Armenian  forces supported by 15 tanks tried to launch an offensive some  15 km north of the Sarsan water reservoir but were contained by  Azeri troops. However, there was further fighting there on  Sunday.    The source said the Armenians lost two tanks and one  artillery piece in Saturday's battle close to the towns Geranboy  and Ter-Ter. However, nearby Azeri villages came under heavy  artillery fire from Armenian forces on Sunday morning.    Last night, a number of Azeri villages in the Belagan region  were brought under rocket fire by Armenian units. But no word  is given of casualty or destruction.    President Geydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan on Saturday issued a  decree to award a large group of officers and men for  "successful defense operations," the defense ministry said.</p>

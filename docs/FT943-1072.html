			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / The Markets: No hiding place - Global Investor The risk that the US economy is not slowing sufficiently in response to eight months of monetary tightening is the greatest threat to current levels of US bonds and equities. The markets' anxiety that Federal Reserve open market committee, meeting tomorrow in Washington, will choose to put up interest rates again, brought the Dow Jones industrials index down by 100 points last week. Whatever the outcome of tomorrow's meeting, however, it is hard to see equities progressing much in the short or medium term. If rates do rise tomorrow, it is possible that bond yields, already at 8 per cent, would not rise much further. But it is unlikely that bond yields would decline steadily and stay down until domestic demand has slowed for several quarters. Even then, the risk remains that the strength of recovery in other countries will boost US exports and drive commodity prices higher, producing inflationary pressures in 1995 and 1996 despite the slowing of domestic consumption. There are, certainly, reasons why the Fed might want to wait rather than raise rates again so soon. Recent indications of an upturn in consumer spending have owed a good part to car purchases; meanwhile, the build up of inventories has raised fears that demand in some sectors is slowing. But even if the Fed does not move tomorrow, it is too early for markets to yet assume that its tightening has finished. Some brokers, such as Goldman Sachs, have been arguing that fears about the strength of the US economy have been overstated, and that markets are now set for a 'relief rally'. It is hard, though, to find grounds yet to think that any such rally will be prolonged. European cyclical stocks US nervousness has spread to European markets, already jittery on expectations that the European interest rate cycle has turned and that earnings expectations are too high. Nonetheless, ahead of this week's batch of half-year results, which includes figures from benchmark European companies, the markets appear determined to salvage some cyclical stocks from the implications of rising interest rates. In periods, such as the present one, where rate rises are triggered by higher than expected growth in output, cyclical stocks can continue to generate earnings surprises, so the case goes. The attempts are valiant, but remain vulnerable to anything but a limited rise in rates. Fiat Fiat, which declares half-year figures on Thursday, is a case in point. Advocates of the Italian automotive and industrial group have caused the price to outperform the Comit index by 2.5 per cent in the past month, by 8 per cent in the last quarter and by 52 per cent in the last 12 months. They are right to point out that in the group's recovery from last year's worst-ever losses, it has restructured and cut costs rapidly. Its balance sheet is also less vulnerable than that of many Italian companies to a sharp rise in interest rates. Its capital spending has peaked, while the pickup in cash generation and its rights issue have brought debt down to some 30 per cent of shareholders' funds. However predictions of a rapid and sustained upturn in profits are based on assumptions about strong growth in sales, particularly of the new Fiat Punto. Those hopes rest heavily on Fiat's performance in markets outside Italy which make up 40 per cent of its automotive division. In its drive for market share, Fiat has benefited from the lira's weakness, which has helped it fight off domestic competition as well as penetrate foreign markets. But analysts suspect that this sales drive has squeezed profit margins. If that is right, Fiat may find it hard to push up prices while European consumers fear higher interest rates. Moreover, with high operational gearing, the group remains vulnerable to a sudden slackening of demand. Given those factors, the special circumstances of its recovery seem inadequate to detach it from the fortunes of a volatile and precarious Italian market. UK building materials Similar questions can be posed about the argument that some UK building materials companies are worth buying because their wide spread of businesses will prolong their earnings growth beyond the sector's normal cyclical slowdown. Half-year results from Tarmac tomorrow and Redland on Thursday are expected to show that the collapse in demand for building materials between 1989 and 1992 in the US and UK has sharply reversed. But by now, that improvement is well in the price. If they can do no more than confirm that pattern, their attractions are limited, and in Redland's case, rest principally on its 6 per cent yield. However Redland, more than many in the sector, derives its earnings from a wide spread of countries. These results will help show whether it can keep its German profits rising fast, and can also drag its French profits back towards the level it expected when it bought Steetley. Within those two factors is a plausible story that the company should be distinguished from the sector. But it is not a robust one if European interest rates continue to rise for an extended period. The case in favour of Redland depends - like the arguments in favour of Fiat - on a sustained upturn in many countries, but one that does not prompt renewed inflationary pressures. That is a narrow window through which to try to thread an argument in favour of even the most resilient cyclical stocks.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 Total return in local currency to 22/9/94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   % change over period                      US     Japan  Germany   France    Italy       UK  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash Week                0.09     0.04     0.09     0.10     0.16     0.10 Month               0.40     0.18     0.41     0.46     0.69     0.42 Year                2.47     2.47     5.88     6.19     8.56     5.72  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year Week               -0.61     0.26    -0.27    -0.31     0.49    -0.54 Month              -0.28     0.48    -0.62    -0.43     1.83    -0.24 Year               -1.94     1.91     1.84    -0.06     2.24     0.13  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year Week               -1.12     0.47    -0.62    -0.96     0.58    -0.66 Month              -1.11     1.23    -1.40    -1.63     1.69    -0.89 Year               -6.15     1.33    -3.17    -6.51    -3.40    -3.11  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities Week                -2.8      0.2     -1.8     -4.0      0.5     -2.8 Month               -0.1     -2.9     -2.1     -3.4     -0.8     -4.6 Year                 3.8     -1.1      8.9     -3.2     12.4      4.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

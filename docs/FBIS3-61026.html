			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by military commentator Aleksandr </F> Zhilin: "Investigation"; "Black Sea Fleet: Actors and  Prompters"]    [Text] The political crisis that has shaken Russia and  Ukraine has somewhat dampened the dispute over the future of the  Black Sea Fleet. But as the presidents deal with their  parliaments, it seems that "third forces" have joined the  struggle for the Black Sea Fleet.    The two presidents' agreements on the Black Sea Fleet have a  strange quality: It has become clear with time that each side  has its own understanding of the accord that was reached. After  the September meeting at Massandra, where "appropriate  documents" were signed, it was said, Boris Yeltsin hastened to  declare that Ukraine was turning its part of the Black Sea Fleet  over to Russia as payment for accumulated debts. However, Leonid  Kravchuk unexpectedly declared that he had signed no documents  on the Black Sea Fleet and considered any bargaining to be  inappropriate altogether.    Such clashes on the political stage do not arise by  accident.  When the main actors, waving goodbye to the agreed-upon  scenario, begin to improvise, it is not hard to guess that each  is trying to please his own "audience." And if the situation  starts to become awkward, it is best to leave the game for a  time.  <H6>  Interests </H6>   The problems associated with the Black Sea Fleet have now  been taken up by state delegations. Their mandates and  responsibilities are unclear, since the presidents never agreed  on explicit criteria for dividing the Fleet. Nevertheless,  certain progress has been made in efforts to solve the problem.    On 29-30 September in Moscow, the Russian side insisted on  drafting an agreement under which the entire Black Sea Fleet  would be used by Russia. At the same time, Russia expects to  acquire the part of the Fleet that, under the previous accords,  was supposed to pass to Ukraine.    The Ukrainian delegation proposed its own solution: Russia  would lease individual Fleet installations, pay compensation to  Ukraine for environmental damages caused by the Black Sea  Fleet's activities, and foot the bill for developing the social  and economic infrastructure. In addition, Ukraine would like to  maintain joint command of the Black Sea Fleet, while Russia  would bear virtually the entire burden of financing and  supplying the Fleet.    The latest round of talks was held on 13 October in Kiev.  Russia did not alter its terms. Ukraine made concessions: It  agreed to set up working groups that would devise an agreement  under which Russia would use the entire Black Sea Fleet. This  could be a mere tactical move designed to allow the Ukrainian  side to gain time. In any case, this is the view of several  experts, who point out that as the political delegations debate,  the military and intelligence services are beginning to step up  their activities.  <H6>  Behind the Scenes </H6>   Strictly speaking, the Ukrainian Security Service and  Ministry of Defense have never been passive observers in the  debate over the Black Sea Fleet. According to MOSKOVSKIYE  NOVOSTI's information, the Ukrainian Security Service has  repeatedly informed Kravchuk of possible "provocations" in  Sevastopol being organized by Russian intelligence services. In  response, Lubyanka has been forced to issue a denial to the  Ukrainian president and to assure him that it is not interfering  in the Crimean conflict. In order to avoid unnecessary  complications, the Russian Ministry of Security has even agreed  that in the Black Sea Fleet military units under Russian  jurisdiction, the special departments (military  counterintelligence) could be Ukrainian; in other words, that  could belong to the other state. This is unprecedented, since  counterintelligence officers control classified information,  attend all official conferences, have their own informers in  subunits, and so forth.    Until recently, military counterintelligence in the  Ukrainian  Security Service was headed by General Aleksandr Skipalskiy, a  notorious figure in chekist circles. In 1982-1984, while serving  as deputy chief of the military counterintelligence department  of the Pacific Border District, he become so preoccupied with  "informal activity" that Japanese smugglers began to classify  him as a "window-bureaucrat"--their name for officials through  whom they could smuggle contraband. His Moscow patrons were able  to protect him from major unpleasantries by sending him to serve  in the Transbaykal region.    The exile ended in 1987, and Skipalskiy was "redeployed" to  Ukraine as deputy chief of the army military counterintelligence  department. He befriended Vasiliy Durdinets, chairman of the  Ukrainian Republican Party, and soon became his deputy. When  Durdinets was elected first deputy chairman of the Supreme  Soviet, he installed Skipalskiy as chief of the Ukrainian  Security Service's military counterintelligence division.    Working hard to justify his high appointment, Skipalskiy  actively exposed "subversive activities" by Russian intelligence  services in Ukraine. In 1992, through Durdinets, Leonid Kravchuk  received Skipalskiy's first report to the effect that the  Russian Chief Intelligence Administration was "preparing  measures to activate intelligence groups in the Black Sea Fleet  and special reserve intelligence agents and reactivating secret  caches of weapons and radio equipment in the Crimea for actions  against Ukraine." Under this pretext, the Ukrainian Security  Service dispatched sizable forces and equipment to the region  "to step up counterintelligence." Skipalskiy was soon promoted  to general.  <H6>  Documents </H6>   To assume that Russian intelligence services are as innocent  as a child would be to question their professionalism. But the  Ukrainian Security Service wasn't born yesterday either.  Documents in MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI's possession indicate that  Ukrainian intelligence is devoting considerable attention to the  Crimea.    A closed collegium meeting was held in the state  administration building in Sevastopol on 27 July. It was  attended by Kuntsevskiy, the Ukrainian Security Service's chief  for the Crimea and Sevastopol; Rear Admiral Obishchenko, chief  of the military counterintelligence administration; and Cherniy,  chief of the counterintelligence administration. They approved a  plan of measures that merits detailed quotation. It calls for:    "1. The establishment in the city of Sevastopol of a  coordinating council for work in pro-Russian structures, to  include officials of the military and territorial  counterintelligence administrations. Major-General Cherniy and  Yermakov (the president's representative) will be charged with  immediate supervision of the council. The council's activities  will be overseen by Mr. Marchuk (chief of the Ukrainian Security  Service--A. Zh.), who will report on the council's work to the  Ukrainian president.    "2. In order to exert active pressure on pro-Russian  structures in Sevastopol and to encourage the initiative of  Ukrainian patriotic forces in the Crimea, to hold a general  plenary meeting of Ukrainian structures by 15 August; to begin  forming resistance columns. Groups of Ukrainians displaying  national symbols are to put up resistance to demonstrations by  the Russian population of Sevastopol, in order to create the  impression of a struggle against an `occupation regime.' The  responsible officials are Mr. Obishchenko and Mr. Kuntsevskiy.  The operation will be overseen by Mr. Cherniy.    "3. In carrying out day-to-day efforts to discredit  Russian structures in Sevastopol and in the Crimea as a whole,  especially during rallies and demonstrations, fighting groups  consisting of UNSO-UPA [Ukrainian People's Self-Defense] members  are to be set up in the resistance columns; their mission will  be to end a state of calm at such demonstrations and meetings.  It is especially advisable to carry out actions with respect to  specific individuals (activists), and to assign responsibility  for possible consequences on Moscow forces. In order to carry  out this decision, a group of 150 reliable UNSO-UPA fighters are  to be sent from Kiev prior to 1 September. Mr. Obishchenko will  be charged with framing the mission and providing accommodations  for and working with the UNSO-UPA fighters.    "4. To direct the mass media to organize a systematic  effort to discredit Russian policy in the Crimea and in the  nearby foreign countries. This work will be organized by  Yermakov and Generak Cherniy.    5. To set up close surveillance of leaders of  pro-Russian structures and members of the Black Sea Fleet  Military Council."  <H6>  Motives </H6>   Who needs such questionable actions, and why?    "Ukraine's political and military leaders know that if they  unable to obtain a sizable sum for the Black Sea Fleet from  Russia and at the same time maintain joint command as a formal  sign of Ukrainian ownership of part of the Fleet, they will have  to get rid of the latter at any price. The current financial and  material-technical state of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense  allows it to maintain, to at least some extent, a maximum of 25  percent of the republic's total armed forces. Things are so bad  in our republic that the collapsing Army is simply starting to  pose a danger to society," an officer of the Ukrainian Ministry  of Defense central staff told a MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI  correspondent.    In his opinion, if efforts to bargain for as much as  possible  from Russia fail, there will be just one alternative: To create  a situation in the Crimea such that the presence of Russian  sailors there will become impossible in both political and  moral-psychological terms. Then the "humiliated and insulted"  crews of Russian ships, raising the Andreyevskiy flags, will go  home on their own.  <H6>  Intrigues </H6>   The actions of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry fit into this  scenario quite well. Former Defense Minister Konstantin Morozov  issued a number of orders aimed at seizing individual units and  installations of the Black Sea Fleet. As a result, a major  conflict was provoked when ship commanders raised the  Andreyevskiy flags and were prepared to issue an ultimatum to  officials of both countries.    After the presidents' Massandra meeting, a new scandal broke  out in Sevastopol. Rumors swept the city that the Ukrainian  Ministry of Defense and Navy were planning a provocation aimed  at "torpedoing the latest agreements on the Black Sea Fleet."    According to confidential information from the central staff  of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, the plan was as follows. A  "political-criminal incident" would be provoked in the  Sevastopol garrison--with casualties, if possible. This would  create a compelling pretext to impose a state of emergency in  Sevastopol. The sailors' response would be clear: The  Andreyevskiy flag would be raised on Black Sea Fleet warships.  Then Ukraine would accuse Russia of scuttling the accords and  demand the immediate withdrawal of the "mutinous" ships of a  foreign power from its territory.    Unlike the Security Service's "plan of measures," this  project was not put down on paper. It exists only in recordings  of telephone conversations between high-ranking military  officials. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense denies these  reports. However, the facts lead one suspect that rumors of  impending provocations are not groundless. The attacks on  Russian units by Ukrainian naval infantrymen, the arrival of  additional Ukrainian "Berkut" special units in Sevastopol, the  sending of armored equipment and weapons to the city, including  flame-throwers, which are designed for combat operations in  residential quarters, not at sea, and so on--this chain of  events can hardly be seen as a string of random events. And the  hasty removal of Defense Ministry Konstantin Morozov and  Ukrainian Naval Commander Boris Kozhin from their posts and the  transfer of Ukrainian Security Service counterintelligence chief  Aleksandr Skipalskiy to a new post tend to support this view.    The official explanations for the resignations are  different,  needless to say. However, observers think that in reality the  personnel shuffles stem from the fact that the  "Morozov-Kozhin-Skipalskiy" triumvirate had tried to play an  independent role in the Crimean region. In addition, experts  call attention to General Morozov's desire to establish close  ties with Ukrainian nationalist forces behind the president's  back and to assume the role of "savior of the republic's  sovereignty and national interests."  <H6>  Outlook </H6>   The personnel of the Black Sea Fleet are tired of constant  scandals, provocations, and uncertainty. Speaking at a session  of the Military Council, the Black Sea Fleet Commander, Admiral  Eduard Baltin, said bitterly that young officers are leaving  military service. Twenty-two lieutenants who graduated from  schools have refused to serve in the Fleet this year alone.    According to MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI's information, officers who  have five or six more years before retirement do not intend to  leave. But they are also unwilling to remain hostage to  political ambitions. The question of whether to issue a stern  ultimatum to Yeltsin and Kravchuk and to force the two  countries' leaders to finally solve the problem of the Fleet is  being discussed once more. This is a dangerous symptom, because  the Black Sea Fleet has enough military power to draw the  presidents' attention. On the other hand, Yeltsin and Kravchuk  have utterly exhausted the sailors' confidence, and this is  greatly fueling aggressive sentiments among the latter. If  another "ship mutiny" occurs, Eduard Baltin will hardly be able  to neutralize it the way he did the last time. The commander,  who has himself become a hostage to the political game, will  have no more arguments.    The protracted Black Sea performance changes genres from one  act to the next: From a comedy, to a drama--to a tragedy?  <H6>  * * * </H6>   MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI Dossier: As of October 15, 1993, the  Black Sea Fleet had received a total of 89,277.7 million  karbovantsy in credits, including 67,410.7 million karbovantsy  from the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense (75.5 percent of  the total), and 21,867.0 million karbovantsy from the Ukrainian  Ministry of Defense (24.5 percent).    The provision of credits to the Fleet by Ukraine has  declined  in recent months. The Ukraine's share of Black Sea Fleet  financing stood at 8.7 percent in August, 6.8 percent in  September, and 0 in October.    The Black Sea Fleet is incurring considerable expenses in  maintaining Ukrainian military units. In the first nine months  of this year, 26 Ukrainian military units were given free food  products valued at 2,668.0 million karbovantsy. The pay for  compulsory-duty servicemen conscripted from Ukrainian territory  and serving in the Black Sea Fleet under oath to Ukraine totals  almost 500.0 million karbovantsy each month.    The Black Sea Fleet has appropriated 12,169.7 million  karbovantsy for construction of housing and social, cultural,  and consumer-service facilities (including fuel provided to the  construction administration), while the Ukrainian Navy has  appropriated 5,965.0 million karbovantsy.    The cost of maintaining the Fleet is increased by amounts  levied by the Ukrainian tax and customs inspectorates. The land  tax, including an upcoming payment for the second half of the  year, will amount to almost 13,000.0 million karbovantsy.  Customs duties on equipment and supplies imported for the Fleet  amounted to 39,053.6 thousand karbovantsy, including 9,941  thousand karbovantsy for food, 5,000.0 thousand karbovantsy for  various supplies, 23,289.3 thousand karbovantsy for fuel, and  823.3 thousand karbovantsy for motor vehicles. The quarantine  inspectorate has charged 3,740.0 thousand karbovantsy to inspect  imported food products. Officers and naval warrant officers  arriving from Russia are charged 300.0 thousand karbovantsy for  customs inspection of each container of belongings.    The Fleet has paid 13,900.0 thousand karbovantsy in various  road fees, and 6,300.0 thousand karbovantsy for railroad  services.    The naval engineering service has spent 9,900.0 thousand and  4,500.0 thousand karbovantsy to maintain Ukrainian motor roads  and railways, respectively.    A $10 fee (or an equivalent sum in karbovantsy at the bank  exchange rate) is charged for each flight by airplanes from  Russian territory to the Black Sea Fleet. Five dollars are  charged for each customs officer who comes to inspect an  airplane, and that amount is doubled on weekends and holidays.    In addition, there are a number of other, smaller duties and  payments that are impossible to tally. (From a report by the  chief of the Black Sea Fleet financial service.)</p>

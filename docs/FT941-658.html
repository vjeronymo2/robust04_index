			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Latin performance boosts Nelson Hurst A strong performance in south-east Asia and Latin America helped Nelson Hurst, the insurance broker listed late last year, lift 1993 pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.41m to Pounds 5.31m. Earnings per share rose from 3.4p to 16.6p. Mr David Woodward, chairman, said the results exceeded forecasts contained in the listing particulars. Brokerage revenues increased by 17 per cent to Pounds 36.7m, with revenues from the Middle East and south-east Asia up by 43 per cent to Pounds 5.9m. Brokerage from its Latin American network also increased, by nearly 40 per cent. The increase also reflected the appreciation of the US dollar, a currency in which Nelson Hurst obtains 40 per cent of its revenues. Dollar income was booked at an average exchange rate of Dollars 1.50 compared with an average of Dollars 1.75 in 1992. On an underlying basis, revenues were up by 11 per cent. Other operating income rose by 3 per cent to Pounds 3.1m, despite a 19 per cent drop in investment income because of lower dollar and sterling interest rates. The increase reflected a foreign exchange gain of Pounds 300,000 (Pounds 1m loss). Expenses were 6 per cent higher at Pounds 32.7m. The expense ratio fell by 10 points to 88 per cent. The company's first dividend as a public company will be this year's interim, payable in October.</p>

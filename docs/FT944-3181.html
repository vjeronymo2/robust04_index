			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / International Bonds: Argentina returns to yen sector with three-year issue A dull day in the eurobond market yesterday was brightened by a flurry of structured offerings and the appearance of a number of sovereign borrowers. The Republic of Argentina launched a Y20bn issue of three-year bonds with a 6 per cent coupon, the country's second foray into the yen market. The Republic launched a debut Y12.5bn offering of four-year bonds via Daiwa at the end of November. The bonds for the latest issue were all pre-placed with Japanese financial institutions and corporate investors, lead manager Nomura said. Traders said that Argentina was still set to make its debut in the French franc market this week, with a FFr1bn issue of three-year bonds. HSBC Markets launched a Dollars 272m offering of two-year floating-rate notes on behalf of a special-purpose vehicle backed by direct obligations of the Kingdom of Saudia Arabia. The bonds offered a coupon of 15 basis points over three-month Libor but a discounted margin of 26 basis points over Libor, HSBC said. The offering met with significant interest from investors in the Gulf, Europe and the Far East, the lead manager said. 'The issue gives investors exposure to Saudia Arabia for the first time in a securitised form,' an HSBC official said. Traders expect eurobond primary activity to remain subdued for the remainder of this year with no significant issues expected to come to the market. They are already looking to January, a traditionally busy month, when they expect activity to accelerate but doubt that there will be a marked improvement in market conditions from this year. 'But there will still be a rush of sovereign borrowers trying to get ahead of the pack,' said one trader. Meanwhile, however, Pakistan is rumoured to be set to make its long-awaited euromarket debut this week, with a Dollars 200m five-year transaction. Traders said the offering, which could come as early as today, is likely to have a spread of around 350 to 400 basis points over US Treasuries. Last night, lead manager Bear Stearns was unavailable for comment. Treasury Corporation of Victoria launched a ADollars 100m issue of two-year bonds offering a discounted coupon of 5 per cent. The issue was notable only because it continues a recent trend of Australian dollar offerings targeted at the Japanese market. These issues offer a coupon similar to that currently available on Japanese yen bonds, but come at a significant discount and offer a play on the currency. The Government of Barbados launched a Dollars 30m five-year tranche of guaranteed global registered notes via Bankers Trust. Investor demand meant that the offering was changed from an original two-tranche issue to a single-tranche deal.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Toshiba and Fujitsu back General Magic Fujitsu and Toshiba, two of Japan's leading electronics companies, plan to invest in General Magic, a US company developing communication software for multimedia. The decision will help General Magic's software become the industry standard for multimedia companies. Matsushita and NTT have already invested in General Magic, hoping to be key players in the market for products that combine the functions of computing, telecommunications and data transfer. The US company's telescript is a next-generation communications software that allows users to send and receive data and computer programs, while Magic Cap is a system software that provides an easy-to-use interface in personal computers. Last week Motorola became the first company to announce a product that will use Magic Cap and Telescript. Fujitsu plans to introduce its first product using the software in a year or two.</p>

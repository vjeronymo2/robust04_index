			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: BARS WANT TO TAKE IT, SO NETWORKS COULD DISH IT OUT  </P> <P> The NFL, scrambling for a solution to its television-signal scrambling problem,  is beginning to see a clearer picture.  </P> <P> The sports-bar business isn't the enemy -- it's an ally.  </P> <P> Most sports-bar owners say they would gladly pay a rights fee to be able to  show NFL games legally via their satellite dishes. But they've never been given  the opportunity.  </P> <P> That may change.  </P> <P> "Sure, the obvious solution would be to sell subscriptions to bars much the way  HBO sells subscriptions to viewers at home," said Greg Aiello, the NFL's  director of communications.  </P> <P> "Although that has not been part of the thinking in the past, it's an option we  are looking at now. But it's a rather complicated issue."  </P> <P> John Morris doesn't see it as complicated.  </P> <P> He has a plan, just as he did when he and former Ram Dennis Harrah opened  Legends, a bar in Long Beach, in 1979. Morris' plan then was to install a  satellite dish on top of his new bar-restaurant so he'd be able to show sports  events people couldn't get at home.  </P> <P> His plan now, he says, would allow the NFL to make millions off the sports-bar  business without much effort.  </P> <P> He recently sent letters to NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, other league  officials, the heads of CBS Sports and NBC Sports and advertising executives of  Anheuser-Busch, Inc., and the Miller Brewing Co.  </P> <P> Here's what Morris has in mind:  </P> <P>  -- Set up a telephone number for bar owners interested in subscribing.  </P> <P>  -- Establish a fee, say $3 a person, based on the fire-code capacity of each  establishment.  </P> <P>  -- Allow each bar owner to decide how he recoups the fee, either by a cover  charge or simply by food and drink sales.  </P> <P>  -- And, most important, have the bar owners police each other.  </P> <P> "When you subscribe, you'd get a list of other bars in your area signed up,"  Morris said. "If you've paid and your competitor down the street hasn't but is  still showing games, you would simply call the 800 number to report it.  </P> <P> "The league would then take appropriate action -- probably a warning at first."  </P> <P> Morris says this system could be implemented almost immediately because it  doesn't require the expensive and complicated process of scrambling and  de-scrambling TV signals.  </P> <P> And, Morris points out, when scrambling does go into effect, subscribers would  already be in place. All they would need would be a decoder.  </P> <P> There would be problems, such as appeasing network affiliates, but Morris  believes the money that could be generated would more than compensate.  </P> <P> "Let's say you've got 50,000 bars and other establishments across the country  paying an average of $500 a week," he said as he scribbled some figures.  "That's $25 million a week, and about $500 million for the entire season,  counting playoffs and the Super Bowl."  </P> <P> Those kinds of numbers might get the NFL's attention.  </P> <P> It appears that the NFL, as well as CBS and NBC, underestimated the furor that  scrambling would cause.  </P> <P> At first, the league's posture was to take on the sports-bar business head-on.  "Let them squawk," the NFL said.  </P> <P> But then Anheuser-Busch and Miller aligned themselves with the sports bars and  their patrons and for good reason.  </P> <P> It didn't take them long to realize what scrambling would do to sales. Morris  said Legends sells about 100 cases of Budweiser on an NFL Sunday. Without pro  football, it's about 30 cases.  </P> <P> So, once the beer-makers, who pour millions of dollars into NFL commercials,  started doing the squawking, the NFL and the networks started listening.  </P> <P> And they postponed scrambling.  </P> <P> Scrambling is still coming. But apparently it has been learned that, first,  there needs to be a system for de-scrambling signals that go to sports bars and  homes equipped with satellite dishes.  </P> <P> Among the NFL's reasons for wanting to scramble is its tentative pay-per-view  plans after the 1993 season, when the current TV contract expires.  </P> <P> According to the NFL's Aiello and network officials, the thinking is to  continue showing games on the networks, but also make a smorgasbord of other  games available for something like $10 a game.  </P> <P> Thus, the viewer would have the choice of watching any game -- some for a price  -- either at home or at a sports bar.  </P> <P> For years, boxing fans have had that choice for pay-per-view fights, and the  plan has worked.  </P> <P> It also should work for pro football.  </P> <P> The NFL season opens Sunday with Los Angeles limited to two network games,  because the Raiders, at last check, are playing at the Coliseum.  </P> <P> At 10 a.m., it's the Rams against the Packers at Green Bay on CBS, with Verne  Lundquist and John Madden reporting. Pat Summerall is at the U.S. Open.  </P> <P> At 1 p.m., the NBC game is the Pittsburgh Steelers at the Cleveland Browns,  with Don Criqui and Bob Trumpy.  </P> <P> For those with cable, TNT will televise its first regular-season NFL game, the  Philadelphia Eagles vs. the New York Giants, at 5 p.m., with Skip Caray and Pat  Haden.  </P> <P> ABC's college football schedule begins Saturday with Oklahoma vs. UCLA at the  Rose Bowl at 12:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Keith Jackson, who will work the game with Bob Griese, is back for his 25th  season at the helm.  </P> <P> "I've had my ups and downs, but it's been a great run," said Jackson, 61, who  has whittled his work schedule to 26 weeks.  </P> <P> "I've now got the greatest job in the world. I get the spring and summer off to  recharge my batteries, then I get to do something I love, college sports."  </P> <P> About Saturday's game, Jackson said: "If Oklahoma can't throw, UCLA should win  the game."  </P> <P> About quarterback Bret Johnson, who left UCLA after losing the starting job,  Jackson said: "I think his leaving is a positive thing for UCLA. I don't know  what's going on in his head, but it appears he doesn't want to compete, and  you're usually better off without those kinds of people."  </P> <P> TV-Radio Notes  </P> <P> After the UCLA-Oklahoma game on Channel 7, there will be a nicely done one-hour  NFL preseason special, produced by GGP Sports, with Dan Dierdorf as host. It  repeats Sunday at 4 p.m. . . . The UCLA-Oklahoma game will be repeated on Prime  Ticket Saturday at 6 p.m. . . . On Sept. 15, the Bruins' home game against  Stanford at 3:30 p.m. will be nationally televised over the Prime Network,  which includes Prime Ticket. On Sept. 22, USC at Washington will be the Prime  Network's Pacific 10 game of the week.  </P> <P> For the second consecutive week, CBS is ignoring the baseball races to cover  the U.S. Open. There's nothing wrong with tennis, but does CBS really think  it's more popular than baseball? . . . Attention, history buffs: "This Week in  the NFL," on Channel 2 Saturday at 4:30 p.m., there will be a segment on great  opening-day performances. Highlighted is Norm Van Brocklin completing 27 of 41  passes for 554 yards and five touchdowns in a 54-14 Ram victory over the old  New York Yankees on Sept. 28, 1951.  </P> <P> Sunday won't be an NFL day without Brent Musburger, after all. He'll be ESPN's  guest on "SportsCenter" at 8:30 a.m. and later at 8 p.m. and on "GameDay" at 9  a.m. . . . "GameDay" has moved from 8:30 to 9 a.m., but CNN has a new pregame  show at 8:30 a.m., with Vince Cellini and Ken Stabler. . . . Geoff Witcher has  replaced John Rebenstorf as Cal State Fullerton's football play-by-play  announcer. Rebenstorf, now the UCLA radio football commentator, will return to  Fullerton for basketball.  </P> <P> Spanish-language baseball broadcasts are commonplace, and now there is a  Korean-language broadcast. Sunday's Dodger-Cincinnati game will be broadcast  over Radio Korea USA and can be heard in Los Angeles on KAZN (1300). Moon Il  Lim will handle the play-by-play, and also taking part will be Jong Hwan Park,  assistant to the commissioner of baseball in Korea.  </P></p>

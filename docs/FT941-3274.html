			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Rail union calls strike vote over sell-off The RMT rail union is calling a strike ballot of its 55,000 British Rail members over their terms of employment after privatisation. The union wants a series of 24-hour stoppages to force BR to continue agreements that protect workers from redundancy. 'Job security features high on the list of fears for the future our members have,' Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, says in a letter circulated yesterday to union branch secretaries. The union is concerned to protect members' existing terms on job promotion, transfer and redundancy after privatisation, which begins next month. 'From day one,' Mr Knapp says of privatisation in his letter, 'we have known we can expect attack after attack on members' conditions of service.' Ballot papers calling on RMT members to back a series of 24-hour strikes on the rail network are to go out on March 29. Under collective agreements, BR workers have access to promotion or job transfer between different parts of the company. That will no longer be possible after April 1 when Railtrack, the new wholly state-owned undertaking responsible for maintaining the track, comes into existence. The RMT estimates that between 11,000 and 12,000 BR staff will then be transferred to employment in Railtrack. 'All signal men and women, crossing keeps, some operational supervisors, plus control and electrical staff and about 700 station (workers) will no longer be part of BR,' Mr Knapp says. 'This means anyone in BR who has an eye on a job in any of these grades will not be able to apply for one  - except as a new entrant.' Demands for interchange arrangements to be continued after April 1 'have met with a flat refusal from BR', Mr Knapp says, 'and therefore if we are to pursue the existing rights . . . we will have to fight for them. We have reached a stage where BR are saying they will no longer honour a major agreement.' Leasing industry attacks transport policy, Page 8</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / French Socialists face censure FRANCE'S conservative opposition parties will attempt to bring down the government by tabling a censure motion after tomorrow's one-day parliamentary session, writes Ian Davidson. The motion condemns the handling of a political crisis provoked by the brief hospitalisation in Paris last week of Palestinian leader George Habash. The opposition motion is likely to fall short of the absolute majority required to bring down the government, but the debates will give the opposition a platform to attack the government's performance. President Francois Mitterrand has called the special session hoping it will finally put to rest the crisis over the Habash affair, in which the government has been battered by indignant protests from both the opposition parties and from leading members of its own Socialist party. In a hurriedly scheduled TV interview on Tuesday evening, Mr Mitterrand did his best to play down the significance of the incident. 'The affair is not serious', he said. 'There was an error of judgment which I punished. I dealt with the problem in 48 hours, and there is no longer a Habash affair.' However, the terms of tomorrow's parliamentary session show that the president feels the need to play safe. The government is not expected to table its own vote of confidence, as it is not sure it can rely on the backing of its normal supporters. Instead, it is leaving the opposition to table a censure motion as it believes it can rely on Socialists and the Communists for support.</p>

Concluding her contacts in  Turkey, Suessmuth returned to her country. Suessmuth and  Husamettin Cindoruk, speaker of the Turkish Grand National  Assembly, held a joint news conference at Ankara's Esenboga  Airport.    Stating that very useful exchange of views were conducted,  Suessmuth said that primarily the PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] terrorist organization issue was discussed.  Explaining that views were also exchanged on Turkey's cultural  mission in the Asian countries, the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue,  and the situation of Turks living in Germany, Suessmuth said  that there was agreement on the PKK terrorist organization  issue. Recalling that the PKK was banned in Germany, Suessmuth  added that terror and violence cannot achieve political aims and  that the development of cultural identity can be achieved only  after bloodshed is stopped.    Suessmuth explained that during her visit, the two  countries'  parliaments had established working groups to put into order the  citizen and voting rights of the Turks living in Germany.    Cindoruk, in turn, said that Turkey's aim -- since Ataturk  --  is to unite with Western democracies thus becoming a European  country. Explaining that Turkish and German parliamentarian  workings groups were established during the guest speaker's  visit, Cindoruk stated these groups will make every effort to  solve the problems existing between the two countries.    Cindoruk further stated that Turkey is not only a country  which aims at democracy but it is a country which is getting on  with democracy and added that this gives his German colleagues a  feeling of security.</p>

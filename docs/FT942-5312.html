			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Germany-Sweden defence link-up Germany and Sweden will today agree to work together on future defence projects, a step expected to clear the way for a tank deal worth at least DM1.2bn (Pounds 480m). The agreement comes just as Sweden is nearing the end of talks to buy 120 Leopard II tanks and Germany is understood to have made the deal more attractive with offers to include Swedish companies in future defence projects. Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, and his Swedish counterpart, Mr Anders Bjorck, will sign an agreement outlining future co-operation in the development of unspecified defence-related projects. While about 75 per cent of Germany's arms building programmes are already undertaken in co-operation with several Nato allies, the closer links with Sweden are the first such initiative with a non-Nato member. As part of a programme to re-equip its mechanised brigades the Swedish army will buy 120 Leopard IIs from Krauss Maffei, the Munich-based company, in a deal worth about DM1.2bn. Another 80 tanks are likely to be bought later, an official said. To complete the overhaul the Swedes are considering leasing another 160 used Leopard IIs which Germany needs to take out of service. An official said the deal was likely to be completed this year but could give no further details. The Swedes preferred the Leopard II to the US-made M1 Abrams and the French Leclerc and will become the third army to use it as its main battle tank, after Germany and the Netherlands.</p>

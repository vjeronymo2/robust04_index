			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> EXPOSE AT UNIVERSAL: YOUNG GIRLS IN LOVE  </P> <P> Expose put on an hour-plus, no-frills show on Friday at the two-thirds full  Universal Amphitheatre. No fancy backdrops, no smoke bombs or lasers. The only  attention-getting device the Miami-based trio utilized was skin-tight stage  wear that almost diverted attention from the lightweight nature of their  teen-dream songs.  </P> <P> Ann Curless, Gioia and Jeanette Jurado sport better-than-average voices, but  there aren't many tunes or arrangements in their repertoire that fully  capitalize on them. So all the audience had to focus on was the group's  tough-girl attractiveness, and dance steps that occasionally bordered on the  ambitious, street-savvy maneuvers of the Paula Abdul School.  </P> <P> That seemed to be worth the ticket price for the group's fans, who were  predominantly young and Latino on Friday. Long on down-to-earth charm, Expose  sang their hits with young-girls-in-love conviction and pointed out their  family members, who filled a good portion of the orchestra seats. Expose has  racked up several hits in the last couple of years, but the best and most  distinctive songs are still the early ones: the wistful, gently harmonic  "Seasons Change" and the dance-oriented "Let Me Be the One," both of which  Curless delivered with real verve.  </P> <P> The group was scheduled to play Anaheim's Celebrity Theatre on Sunday.

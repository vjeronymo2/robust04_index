			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> REORGANIZATION OF PANEL WINS 1ST VOTE  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday gave first approval to a major  committee reorganization designed to increase council supervision over such  issues as housing, redevelopment and the environment.  </P> <P> The vote on the proposal by Council President John Ferraro sent it to the city  attorney's office, where it is to be drafted into final form and reshaped  slightly to meet objections voiced during the debate.  </P> <P> The main objection came from Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who felt Los Angeles  International Airport, which is in her district, should be under the  jurisdiction of the committee in charge of transportation. Under the Ferraro  plan, it is lumped together with the harbor and the Department of Water and  Power.  </P></p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Universal private pension plan has powerful support Sir, You report ('Pensions body wants saving to be compulsory', November 18) the support the National Association of Pension Funds has given to a reform which Matthew Owen and I proposed 18 months ago (Private Pensions for All, Fabian Society). The initial reaction to the idea of instigating universal private pension provision was met by two substantial criticisms. Those politicians who ideologically opposed the idea never answered the question we posed. Large numbers of people are in private schemes. How then can we equalise opportunities? The only sensible way forward is to have universal private provision, and the only way to do this is through a compulsory scheme. We are pleased that this approach has been backed by the Social Justice Commission. Some members of the National Association of Pension Funds made practical criticisms. Our 10 per cent combined contribution was too low for adequate pensions. We therefore proposed that employers and employees should contribute 18 per cent of the salary bill. Now the NAPF has backed our original figure. Why? To what extent is the NAPF's decision a soft-sell approach to employers, or a belief that a voluntary top-up would naturally occur? What range of pensions would be produced from these savings running alongside the state scheme? Barry Riley highlights ('Waking up to the pension scheme threats', November 23) concern about the underfunding of pension schemes. We have tried to cover this point too. Taking Joel Joffe's idea for a new savings scheme, we suggested it should be made universal by establishing a National Pensions Saving Scheme. This would be separate from the state, would form a new kind of collective action, and would allow savers to own their own savings. Our suggested reform could not lead to underfunding as in final salary schemes. In addition, mobile employees would gain a level playing field, knowing in advance the minimum pension contributions they would be expected to make and would not, as many of them now do, enter detailed negotiations to see whether the pension scheme of the company they hoped to join might produce pension benefits equal to their current scheme. Support for the idea of universal private pension provision to run alongside the state scheme, and to make contributions to both schemes compulsory, has won powerful allies over the past year. But the debate is not an academic exercise. I hope that before the next year is out your columns will be reporting that both Labour and the Liberal Democrats are backing this proposal. Voters will then have a clear choice on reforming one of the big areas of welfare reform at the next election. Frank Field, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA.</p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Bank shares set to shake off their dowdy reputation: Why the banking sector is now seen as a bet on recovery British banks have three audiences to please: customers, staff and shareholders. In the past 18 months, they have angered customers by raising charges, and dismayed staff by cutting jobs. But these failures have been balanced by a remarkable resurgence in how shareholders regard them. As the banks' full-year results season opens today with Lloyds expected to announce increased pre-tax profits of about Pounds 700m, the banks are close to shaking off 20 years of share underperformance. The sector may hit parity with the FT-A All-Share this year for the first time since 1976. This is partly because of the addition of HSBC Holdings to the sector following the takeover of the Midland Bank by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation last year. Brokers calculate that the sector's ratio to the All-Share would drop from yesterday's 93 per cent to about 83 without HSBC. But it also reflects a feeling that the worst of the bank's poor profitability since their peak in 1988 is behind them, and they are largely recovery stocks. Banks are expected to benefit further if Britain has entered a period of low interest rates, because loan risks will be reduced. Shares have risen strongly since the interim results on hopes that full-year operating profits will reflect concerted efforts to cut costs, and raise income from sources other than loans. Banks' profitability has also been helped by the widening of loan margins as base rates have fallen. This optimism seems strange in view of the size of provisions for bad and doubtful debts on lending in the 1980s. SG Warburg Securities expects a total bad debt charge of Pounds 6.3bn for Barclays, Lloyds, National Westminster, HSBC, Abbey National and Standard Chartered. But Mr Nick Collier, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, says bad debts are largely on a downward cycle while rises in pre-tax profits this year will reflect a long-term strengthening of operating profitability. Banks are expected to approach their 1988 level of return on capital by 1995. Results will depend on the two factors. A shrinking balance sheet is expected to cut profits before provisions at Lloyds, but also to reduce its bad debt charge. Barclays is expected to disclose a rise in operating profits on March 4, but is set to be taken into loss by a higher debt charge of more than Pounds 2bn. Barclays' bad debt charge will attract the most criticism. The bank has suffered from appearing not to make provisions early enough compared with National Westminster. Mr Julian Robins, an analyst at BZW, argues that it could still be underprovided by about Pounds 1bn despite the rise. Abbey National's bad debt charge is expected to double to around Pounds 320m because its lending is still largely based in the depressed residential housing market. Abbey's provisions will also reflect bad loans in France and Spain - a common theme in continental lending. For other banks, operating income and costs will be the focus of attention. The most important element of income is likely to be charges. Because loan demand is not expected to recover rapidly in the depressed economy, such non-interest earnings are vital to medium-term profitability. 'There will be pretty sluggish growth in interest income because of low lending volumes, and non-performing loans,' says Mr Hugh Pye, an analyst at Robert Fleming Securities. But banks are expected to have improved non-interest income by raising charges, and selling more financial products. Mr Terry Smith, an analyst at Collins Stewart, says banks have achieved 'astonishing' rises in charges on business such as small corporate lending because of their customers' lack of bargaining strength in recession. NatWest's non-interest income is expected to rise by 9.5 per cent. The other side is costs. Banks have made strenuous efforts to reduce overheads through branch closures and staff cuts. Those that took longer to make cuts had more scope last year. Mr Robins says Lloyds' headcount is already 18 per cent below its peak, compared with only 9 per cent below for Barclays. In the longer term, share performance may depend as much on the strength of balance sheets - showing the banks' capacity to expand loans in recovery - as the profit figures. British banks are still well-capitalised, but they have been somewhat weakened by low dividend cover in the past two years. Although they would remain comfortably within Basle capital ratios given anticipated levels of loan growth over the next two years, stronger expansion could strain ratios. Standard Chartered has strengthened its core tier 1 capital ratio by disposing of Pounds 200m of properties in Asia. This has led to strong speculation about one of the banks making a rights issue soon. But most analysts believe this is unlikely until next year because of market disenchantment at the manner in which previous issues such as Barclays' Pounds 922m issue in 1988 went to poor-quality lending. 'I am sure they would like issues, but whether they could get away with them is another matter,' says Mr Ian Poulter, an analyst at Yamaichi International. Market sentiment is also affected by the fact that Barclays could cut its dividend this year to reduce an anticipated retained loss of Pounds 600m. Uncertainties of this kind mean bank shares are far from guaranteed to continue their outperformance. An unexpected rise in provisions, or poor performance in reining in costs, could easily disturb the market's confidence of the past six months. Such uncertainties aside, the market appears to think the results will mark a break with the problems of 1989-91, and a phase of steadier profitability. The banks can at least take comfort in this new-found popularity among shareholders amid the chorus of criticism from others.</p>

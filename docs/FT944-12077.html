			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Which? hits at high bank charges High street banks and the Consumers' Association have clashed over the latest Which? survey on the cost of borrowing, Alison Smith writes. The association says that a combination of charges on unauthorised overdrafts and interest levied on such accounts for even short periods can be equivalent to millions of per cent if translated to an annualised percentage rate basis. It argues that the high levels of interim profits reported by the banks intensifies the argument that they should cut their charges. It says there are sharp differences in the range of charges imposed by banks and building societies that offer current accounts, and urges customers facing high charges to move. The British Bankers' Association said the banks' interim results showed that providing banking services for personal customers was 'one of the most unprofitable activities which banks undertake'. It emphasised that more than three quarters of personal customers do not pay charges.</p>

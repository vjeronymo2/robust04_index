Repulsive phenomena considered  by young people are ranked in descending order as bureaucracy,  seeking profit through the abuse of power, bribe-taking and  corruption, dissipated living and other unspecific items.    The survey was conducted by a teenage research centre and an  institute on politics for the youth and took the form of  questionnaire between October, 1992, and May, 1993. The  respondents were aged between 18 and 35 years and were from  Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shandong, Liaoning, Sichuan and  Guangxi.    When comparing the process of reform of the political system  and that of the economic system, about 57.7 percent of the  respondents said that political reform lagged behind economic  reform. A total of 50.3 percent of the youth considered the key  to political reform lay in the elimination of corruption and the  establishment of decision-making and a supervision mechanism  based on democracy.    A mere 7.7 percent of respondents said they had a solid  belief in socialism while 14.2 percent gave a "no" answer. Most  of the young people believed in socialism but were also puzzled  with it. Items the youth feel worried about the most were in  descending order too little income, lack of housing, poor  inter-personal relations, inability to use one's learning in  one's career, love and marriage problems, no chance to use one's  talents and difficulties in going abroad.</p>

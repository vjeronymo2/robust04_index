			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PRUDERY TUMBLES IN EAST BERLIN  </P> <P> East Germany's wall of Stalinist prudery fell today as the first editions of  the Western men's magazines Playboy and Penthouse went on sale in an East  Berlin hotel.  </P> <P> The glossy girlie magazines stood out among a new selection of West German  newspapers and weeklies the exclusive Grand Hotel has started importing from  West Berlin.  </P> <P> A strict ban on racy publications was one of the pillars of communist  asceticism that East Germany's disgraced former leaders imposed on the people  while they themselves lived in luxury homes.  </P> <P> But the democratic upheaval shaking the country has swept away much of the old  system, including a bureau controlling the import of Western publications. It  has quietly stopped work.  </P></p>

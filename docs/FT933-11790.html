			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Government seeks bids to run local careers services BIDS to run career services were yesterday invited in 14 'pathfinder areas' by the Department of Employment. Under new legislation, the government has taken responsibility for careers services from local education authorities, and over the next few years bids will be invited throughout England and Wales. The programme will be phased to prevent disruption in advice. Bids were invited yesterday from areas including Avon, Bedfordshire, Surrey, Cumbria, Birmingham, Oldham and Wigan. No bids were invited from the London area because ministers are still considering whether there should be a single service to cover London and, if not, how many constituent parts there should be. Miss Ann Widdecombe, the minister in charge of the service, said she envisaged bids from a wide range of organisations. A local education authority could bid on its own or with a local training and enterprise council - the bodies repsonsible for delivering government-funded training schemes. Some larger recruitment organisations might also want to bid. Miss Widdecombe moved to calm fears on career officers' job security. 'I would be amazed if somebody put in a successful bid without involving the existing providers,' she said. The current service is free to people under 21 in or just out of education or training. Miss Widdecombe said new providers could supply other services and charge for them.</p>

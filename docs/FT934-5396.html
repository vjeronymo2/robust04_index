			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / France and UK split over airlines crisis France and the UK will today set out widely opposing views on how the European Union should respond to the financial crisis in Europe's airlines. Paris will call for capacity-sharing and an EU-backed plan to reduce capacity, while London will insist on an end to state aid. Both members are expected to present papers at a ministerial debate in Brussels preparing the ground for a report due in January on the future of the airline industry. As losses among Europe's flag carriers grow, pressure is increasing to roll back some of the deregulation measures put in place over the past seven years. The European Commission is firmly opposing any return to the old cartel structure of European air transport, with carriers colluding on setting fares and sharing passenger loads. But Brussels still has to adjudicate on a queue of member government requests to inject finance into national airlines, including Air France. The French paper says Europe is in danger of losing control of the industry in 'a downward spiral of lower fares and ever-increasing losses' - over Ecu3.5bn (Pounds 2.7bn) on international business alone in the past three years. European carriers have seen their share of international air traffic fall from 38.8 per cent in 1972 to 32.2 per cent last year. The number of flights using French airports increased by 54 per cent in 1987-92, but passenger numbers rose by only 33 per cent. The percentage of total capacity filled by airlines - the load factors - fell from 64 to 57 per cent in the same period, the French paper says, 'substantially below break-even level'. Paris therefore wants immediate moves to allow more capacity-sharing between airlines and a freeze on all air traffic fees. In the short term, France is seeking an EU-wide crisis plan to speed up the pace at which older aircraft are taken out of service. France calls for a better balance between competition rules and the long-term objective of creating a 'powerful and prosperous air transport industry'. The UK paper, by contrast, points to the return to profit of airlines in countries with more liberalised markets - Lufthansa in Germany and KLM in the Netherlands - arguing for effective management rather than protectionist measures.</p>

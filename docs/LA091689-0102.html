			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ECONOMY;  </P> <P> WHOLESALE PRICE INDEX DECLINE MASKS INFLATION OF 6%  </P> <P> Wholesale prices fell for the third consecutive month in August, the government  reported Friday, but economists noted that plummeting energy prices masked a  continuation of moderate inflation for most wholesale goods.  </P> <P> The Labor Department said its producer price index dipped 0.4% last month,  following an identical drop in July and a 0.1% decline in June. The index of  wholesale prices is considered a good indication of where consumer prices are  headed.  </P> <P> The August decline was attributable in large part to a 7.3% plunge in energy  prices, which have fallen for several months after a sharp run-up in the  spring. Food prices, another volatile component of the index, increased 0.3% in  August.  </P> <P> Excluding energy and food, producer prices rose 0.5%, indicating that the  "core" rate of wholesale inflation is running at an annual rate of more than  6%. For that reason, economists were somewhat less than ecstatic about the  August figures.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Inflationary Psychology'  </P> <P> "This looks better on the surface than in detail, because inflation at more  than 6% is no bargain," said Donald Straszheim, an economist with Merrill Lynch  in New York. "The key here was the decline in gasoline, but energy prices have  now turned around again. We could get a hike in gasoline next month."  </P> <P> Other analysts echoed Straszheim's concerns.  </P> <P> "With core inflation at a 6% rate, we're getting close to the point where  consumers and producers alike begin to fall into an inflationary psychology,  where a fair amount of inflation is expected," said Dirk Van Dongen, president  of the National Assn. of Wholesaler-Distributors in Washington. "We've had core  increases for three of the past five months, so we can't simply declare victory  and hang it up on inflation."  </P> <P> Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State  University in Atlanta, said, "This was probably the last PPI drop for a while.  And energy has probably done its last hurrah for now."  </P> <P> Ratajczak noted that of about three dozen categories of finished goods,  excluding food products, only five declined in August. Of those, three were  energy products: gasoline, natural gas and fuel oil. The other two were  household glassware and costume jewelry, hardly major factors in the nation's  economy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Weakness Feared  </P> <P> Since energy prices are expected to rebound in the months ahead and other  wholesale products are unlikely to decline significantly, Ratajczak said he  expects wholesale prices to increase in September, with consumer prices soon to  follow.  </P> <P> Even so, analysts said the likely uptick in prices will not signal another  inflation scare such as the one earlier this year because the economy is  growing too slowly.  </P> <P> Indeed, Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover in New York,  said that he is concerned that the economy is weaker than many analysts think.  </P> <P> "We've seen the PPI down three months in a row and the last time that happened  the economy declined," Kellner said. The previous three-month decline was  January through April of 1986. The economy subsequently declined at an annual  rate of 1.8% in the second quarter of that year.  </P> <P> Kellner noted that while the volatile ups and downs of energy prices often are  discounted, they exert a "ripple effect" throughout the economy. "In fact," he  said, "it was a collapse in energy prices that killed the economy in the  Southwest in 1986 and caused that near-recession."  </P> <P> But few economists, including Kellner, expect an outright recession now.  Straszheim reflected the apparent consensus in predicting relatively sluggish  economic growth of about 2% and manageable inflation of about 5% for the next  year or two.  </P> <P> "There's no reason for people to celebrate about this report," Straszheim said.  "But no reason to panic, either."  </P> <P> With August's figures included, inflation as measured by the producer price  index has settled down to a manageable 4.4% annual rate for the year so far.  </P></p>

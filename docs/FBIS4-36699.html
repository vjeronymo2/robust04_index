			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nabil Sha'th, PLO adviser and head of the </F> Palestinian delegation to the international coordination  committee of donor states, in Paris by Sa'id Mu'addi in  Jerusalem; date not given; from the "With the Midday Events"  program--recorded]    [Text] [Sha'th] Meetings were held yesterday with all  members of the coordination committee of the donor states,  including the World Bank delegation. I believe they were  important meetings on the road to translating the obligations  and promises made by these donor states into quick and direct  financial aid, which can contribute to pushing things forward to  establish the new central administrations, to respond to the  needs of thousands of Palestinians and their families who have  suffered for a long time under the occupation, and to respond to  the needs of economic development to create jobs for the  Palestinians, particularly in the Gaza Strip, who are suffering  from severe unemployment. The donor states are called upon to  extend all this aid in a form of specific material aid during  today's meeting, God willing.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, of course you have reviewed the  difficult economic situation for the participants in these  meetings, as well as the need to immediately delivering funds in  order to implement the self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. What  approach are the participants states taking?    [Sha'th] Undoubtedly, there is an awareness of the pressing  need for this international aid, which should be in the form of  quick cash, and not merely commitments and promises. There is  also a realization that the peace process is completely reliant  on the Palestinian National Authority's [PNA] success in turning  this [self-rule] agreement into a tangible thing for the  Palestinian people. It must let them realize the benefits of  peace and the other meanings of freedom, dignity, independence,  and the building of the homeland and economic development. I  believe that there is a realization of all this. However, we  are waiting today to see if this realization has been  transformed into quick aid.    [Mu'addi] Are there any reservations by the donor states  which could obstruct the transferring of funds to the  Palestinians?    [Sha'th] I cannot see true reservations in this sense,  particularly after the Palestinian Economic Council for  Development and Reconstruction has been established, after the  new budget has been prepared, and after the PNA has assumed  powers in Gaza and Jericho. However, these states should move  from the state of realization, feeling, and interest into a  state of paying funds. These states have rules, laws, and  constitutional institutions, and therefore, we should encourage  them to move quickly to the stage of implementation.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, what is today's agenda, and when do you  expect the decision will be made?    [Sha'th] Today, there will be a meeting to be attended by  all  states. These states' members will make statements, beginning  with the Palestinian delegation. The meeting will end at 1700  with a news conference. So, we should expect practical results  before 1700.    [Mu'addi] A final question, what are the sums of money we  are  talking of, Dr. Nabil Sha'th?    [Sha'th] We are talking about translating promises of more  than $2 billion into specific sums to be paid during this  period, or next month and the months which follow, in order to  rectify the deficit in the budget, and to allow funds to pour  into economic projects. So, we are talking about $100 million,  at least, at the beginning.</p>

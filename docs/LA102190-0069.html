			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A CRITIC'S FRIENDS  </P> <P> There are many good-to-excellent restaurants in the greater Los Angeles area  that deserve more than a narrative of the reviewer's disgruntled friends.  Critic Ruth Reichl is getting too big for her brioche.  </P> <P> When I read a review, I want to hear an educated commentary on the food, I want  to know that the reviewer has researched the goals of the restaurant and I want  to get a feeling of the ambience. What I don't want is to read about miserable  friends talked into ugly dining experiences, boring stories, cute quips about  reluctant gourmets and a reviewer with an overwhelming ego (a reviewer should  be anonymous).  </P> <P> To top it off, in her Oct. 14 review of Lunaria, her friends ask her to cook  for them at home next time, implying that the reviewer herself is a much better  chef than the one she is reviewing.  </P> <P> When is your real restaurant critic returning from sabbatical?  </P> <P> RICHARD MARTINO  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

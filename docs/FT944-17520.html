			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Building from a local base / A look at BICC's strategy for winning work in Asia - Tackling Asia's Tigers Few UK companies could have been more relieved by the recent lifting of Malaysia's controversial ban on public contracts than BICC, the cables and construction group. As a result of the ban, BICC's Balfour Beatty construction arm and Trafalgar House, its consortium partner, failed to win the Pounds 30m project management contract at the new Kuala Lumpur airport. However, Mr Ian Thomas, Balfour Beatty's director for international business development, is confident the company can make up lost ground. Even with the placing of the Pounds 1bn main terminal contract, there is as much work again still to be awarded, building everything from the runways to the control tower, he says. Then there is a planned airport rail link and other opportunities in Malaysia. Fortunately for BICC, its other business, cables, was unaffected by the ban. The UK company has 40 per cent of Power Cables Malaysia, the rest of which is owned by Bumiputra interests. Mr Roy Allen, responsible for planning how BICC can develop its cables business in Asia, says: 'It is a model for our expansion in the region.' And rapidly industrialising countries, such as Malaysia, remain crucial to BICC's Asian strategy. Sales in the Asia-Pacific region jumped from Pounds 127m in 1989 to Pounds 281m last year, if all of PCM's Pounds 40m sales are included. Mr Thomas believes Balfour Beatty can raise its turnover in the region from the Pounds 100m to Pounds 110m achieved last year to Pounds 300m over the next three to five years. In cables, BICC could treble its sales in the region to Pounds 500m by the end of the decade, according to Sir Robin Biggam, chairman. The two sides of BICC may be very different, but there is common ground in the need to have a good local presence in Asia. Up to the mid-1980s, says Mr Thomas, Balfour Beatty's Asia-Pacific business had benefited from the UK's aid-for-trade programme. However, the slowdown in aid, along with the recognition that individual markets in the region differed widely, increased the need for the company to 'think local' if it was to benefit from the expansion of the region's infrastructure. Some of the local contractors were just as good as Balfour Beatty, he says. But the UK company realised it had the extra skills needed to put together complex infrastructure projects along with local and foreign partners - and in particular the expertise to exploit the region's fast-growing market for private infrastructure projects. So joint ventures, such as the successful 49 per cent owned Balfour Beatty Sakti Indonesia and the joint venture with the Thai Sahaviriya Group, were a necessity. 'It's the only way to obtain business, and do it profitably,' says Mr Thomas. Over the past two to three years, the UK group has also beefed up its regional management. The aim is to have a senior manager for Balfour Beatty in each country, to whom the operating subsidiary managers report. So far Balfour Beatty has stopped short of creating an overall business chief for Asia, although Mr Thomas is spending most of his time in that role. Such a move has recently been announced, however, in the sister cables business, which is forming a new company, BICC Asia-Pacific Cables, to manage the manufacture and marketing of power and communication cables in the region. The new company, owned jointly by BICC and Metal Manufactures, its 61 per cent owned Australian subsidiary, will be based in Singapore under Mr Nigel Taylor, its managing director. Mr Allen, who has been based in London, acknowledges: 'You can direct and give advice, but you can't 'think Asian' from London.' The venture will be chaired by Mr Glenn Dudley, managing director of MM, which is paying BICC between ADollars 65m and ADollars 75m (Pounds 30m to Pounds 35m) for taking part. MM, which also makes copper tubes and plastic pipes and has electrical wholesaling interests, has lifted its exports to neighbouring countries from ADollars 20m to ADollars 235m over the past five years. The link-up will enable MM to benefit from its UK parent's longer involvement in the Asia region. By working together, the two companies will be able to 'open up more fronts more quickly,' says Mr Dudley. BICC is already the biggest exporter of cables into the region, but the venture's key task will be to oversee the development of a much bigger manufacturing base. Inevitably, PCM sees China as the biggest prospect for the cable business, either through new investment or co-operation with existing companies. BICC is involved in discussions with China's Shanghai Cable Works on a possible manufacturing joint venture. In Vietnam MM is taking the lead. It is refurbishing a small telecommunications cable plant owned by Vietnam's main post and telephones company. Payment could form part of the equity in a joint venture which Mr Dudley hopes to negotiate over the next 12 months. Both BICC and MM see Indonesia as a good opportunity, and a joint venture is a distinct possibility. In the Philippines, tentative talks have been held with a big local group. Both men stress that choosing the right local partner is crucial and that they will not be rushed into making investments. 'The market is great, but you've got to do it right to make money,' says Mr Dudley - a view with which all the companies 'tackling Asia's tigers' would concur. This concludes the series.

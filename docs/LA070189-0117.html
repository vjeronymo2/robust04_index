			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PALM DESERT PROJECT WENT BANKRUPT;  </P> <P> HUD AIDED PLAN TO SELL THE POOR $85,000 CONDOS  </P> <P> Philip Drell wondered why the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,  which is supposed to promote affordable housing, was subsidizing a luxury  country club and condominium development in the California desert a few miles  from Palm Springs.  </P> <P> "We always thought it was a curious sort of project for HUD to be involved in,"  Drell, senior planner with the City of Palm Desert, said in an interview  Friday.  </P> <P> Members of Congress wondered the same thing. In 1983, then-Sen. William  Proxmire (D-Wis.) asked HUD whether a project in which condominiums for  low-income families cost $85,000 and $15 million was being spent for a golf  course and clubhouse met its affordable housing guidelines.  </P> <P> On Thursday, HUD announced that it planned to terminate the loan guarantee  program under which the project had been subsidized, a program that has  guaranteed $500 million in loans in the last 16 years.  </P> <P> HUD Secretary Jack Kemp said the program was "riddled with abuse," had suffered  enormous losses and had failed to benefit the needy. Kemp, who had been lobbied  to keep the program alive by a former HUD official who represents developers it  aided, said losses so far total $90 million.  </P> <P> The guarantee program is the latest chapter in an unfolding saga of  mismanagement and allegations of favoritism at HUD.  </P> <P> Two months ago, Kemp suspended another housing program that was designed to  renovate buildings for use by moderate-income people after there were charges  that politically connected consultants had received funding for questionable  projects.  </P> <P> Consultants were also involved as intermediaries in more than half of the  projects under the loan guarantee program, called the Title X Land Development  Mortgage Insurance Program, according to a 1986 report by HUD's inspector  general.  </P> <P> Title X was established to provide loan guarantees for developers of vacant  land who might encounter difficulty with local financing. In exchange, the  developers were supposed to set aside a certain percentage of the units for  families with low and moderate incomes.  </P> <P> The HUD inspector general's report, obtained under the Freedom of Information  Act, declared that Title X had failed to accomplish its goal of increasing  affordable housing. The report said 16 of the 17 projects examined provided no  housing for moderate-income families, and none offered units for low-income  families. Half of the 32 projects in the program at the end of 1985 were in  default, the report said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Housing at Acid Pit Aided  </P> <P> Among the projects that benefited from the program were three housing  developments near the Stringfellow Acid Pit in Riverside County, which the  Environmental Protection Agency has categorized as a hazardous waste site.  Previous reports to HUD had suggested that the ground water in the area near  the three projects was contaminated.  </P> <P> Singled out for particular criticism in the audit was the Desert Falls Country  Club project in Palm Desert, which went bankrupt in 1985 and cost HUD $13.6  million. Since then, the project has come under control of new owners and has  become successful without government assistance.  </P> <P> According to the HUD report, the project was originally planned to include  1,111 residential units surrounded by a championship golf course, a  34,000-square-foot clubhouse, 17 tennis courts and two swimming pools.  </P> <P> Drell, the Palm Desert planning official, said the proposal was approved by the  city in 1979 without any HUD backing. The lead developer was Oscar A. Wiggins,  who at the time was head of a Santa Ana firm called Pacific Coast Builders.  </P> <P> The project languished for about two years until Palm Desert officials got word  that HUD was going to guarantee part of the loan to finance the project. The  guaranteed loan was to be used only to develop the residential units and  related streets and common areas.  </P> <P> In exchange, the developer was required to set aside 20% of the units for  families with moderate to low incomes. The price for the units was to be  $75,000, but it later went up to $85,000.  </P> <P> However, HUD's regional office in Los Angeles raised questions in late 1981  about the eligibility of the project.  </P> <P> Rather than increasing affordable housing, the report said, the project was  "recreation-resort oriented" and "would not increase the supply of anything  other than high-priced housing."  </P> <P> The report said the recreational facilities, part of the justification for HUD  assistance, would be available only to residents who paid a one-time $15,000  fee and monthly dues.  </P> <P> There were other problems. The environmental impact statement required as part  of the HUD package uncovered a threat to the fringe-toed lizard, a desert  resident that became an endangered species in 1980.  </P> <P> According to Drell, the Desert Falls developers tried to satisfy environmental  concerns by designating the sand traps on the golf course as habitats for the  lizards. Instead, they were assessed $600 an acre to help acquire land for a  nature conservancy in the Coachella Valley to protect the lizard.  </P> <P> The HUD inspector general's report says the project was approved despite the  objections after an unidentified assistant secretary at HUD said the $75,000  condos were "within the spirit of our guidelines."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cost HUD $13.6 Million  </P> <P> In April, 1985, the project went into default and HUD wound up losing $13.6  million, the report said. Attempts to reach Wiggins were unsuccessful, but  several people familiar with the project said that his company has gone out of  business.  </P> <P> Shirley M. Wiseman, former deputy assistant secretary for housing at HUD, said  in an interview Friday that, after taking office in 1983, she rewrote the rules  for the loan-guarantee program.  </P> <P> "We rewrote those guidelines so if there was no affordable housing there'd be  no Title X," said Wiseman, who left the agency in 1985 and is now head of the  National Assn. of Home Builders, a trade group in Washington, as well as being  a builder and developer in Lexington, Ky., for over 20 years.  </P> <P> Wiseman was identified by Kemp as one of the consultants who assisted  developers in obtaining Title X guarantees. The others were identified as  Maurice Barksdale, another former HUD official, and Tricia Canzeri, wife of a  former Ronald Reagan Administration official.  </P> <P> Wiseman acknowledged that she lobbied Kemp soon after he took office this year  to keep the program. She defended the program, contending that it had provided  essential affordable housing.  </P></p>

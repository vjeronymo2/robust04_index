			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance  Movement -- AWB] said in a statement this morning that it was  disappointed by General Viljoen's decision to participate in the  election. The statement, which was issued before the news of  Gen. Viljoen's resignation, said that the AWB was forced to  concede that those who had called Gen. Viljoen a political Judas  -- I suppose sent by the ANC [African National Congress] and the  South African Communist Party alliance -- had been correct.</p>

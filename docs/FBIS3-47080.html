The government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will  start  working on the package as early as Monday, the sources said.    The pump-priming package is expected to feature, among other  things, an additional 3 trillion to 4 trillion yen in spending  on public works implemented by the central and local governments.    The government will also raise the ceilings on housing loans  extended by the governmental Housing Loan Corp. and on loans  supplied by Japan Finance Corp. for small businesses to promote  restructuring of smaller firms, the sources said.    These measures will be incorporated into a third  supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 that ends March 31.    In addition, in the national budget for fiscal 1994, the  government intends to ease tax burdens to reactivate real estate  deals which have remained lackluster due to the bursting of  bubble economy of the late 1980s.    Moreover, it will take steps to promote house purchases by  consumers, they said.    On tax cuts, the sources said the government is considering  implementing income and residential tax cuts of 6 trillion to 7  trillion yen retroactively from January.    The government is coordinating views with the ruling parties  over ways to finance the planned tax cuts, bearing in mind the  possibility of raising the 3 percent consumption tax in the  future.    Late last year, Prime Minister Hosokawa came up with a  six-point proposal to rev up the stagnant economy, calling for  deregulation of government controls, the drafting of a 15-month  budget -- made up of a third supplementary budget and the fiscal  1994 budget -- and taking measures to help smaller businesses  and farmers.    He also proposed safeguarding jobs, adding liquidity to land  transactions and reducing the income tax.    On the third supplementary budget, the government is  planning  to boost the central government's spending on public works by 2  to 3 trillion yen and local governments' projects by 1 trillion  yen, the sources said.    In the fiscal 1994 budget, the government intends to put  emphasis on ways to improve the quality of life and promote  scientific research.    In order to expand public works projects, it will also study  the possibility of revising upward a 10-year public investment  plan which calls for spending 430 trillion yen over 10 years  from fiscal 1991, the sources said.    Moreover, the government will set aside an additional 500  billion to 1 trillion yen for the acquisition of land for public  use and consider extending interest subsidies to local housing  supply corporations to help them acquire land lots.    Other stimulative measures now being considered by the  government and ruling parties include an easing of tax burdens  on land acquisitions for commercial and cultural facilities, and  replacements of houses.    The government is also expected to lower the consumption tax  on motor vehicles from the present 4.5 percent to 3 percent in  response to strong requests from the auto industry, the sources  said.    In addition, it is likely to remove a special tax on  business  corporations and allow businesses to buy their own stock in a  bid to stimulate the faltering securities market, they said.</p>

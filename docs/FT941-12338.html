			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / People: Riverso decides to fly Alitalia Eyebrows were raised last March when Renato Riverso, the outgoing chairman of IBM Europe, accepted a post on the slimmed-down board of Eni, Italy's state-owned energy and chemicals giant, only to change his mind a couple of days later, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. Few were convinced by Riverso's explanation work commitments prevented him from taking up the job at Eni, desperately trying to shake off the stigma of politicised appointees to its senior ranks. At the time, Riverso's volte-face was attributed to second thoughts about working for a company which has been deeply tainted in Italy's political corruption scandal. However, his acceptance last week of the chairmanship of Alitalia, Italy's troubled state airline, suggests he may have already sniffed something better was in the wind. Riverso, 60, who is succeeding Michele Principe, due for retirement, will be flanked by Roberto Schisano, Alitalia's new managing director. Both these Italians recruited from the information technology sector have decades of experience with big multinationals under their belts. Riverso has been with IBM since 1957, while Schisano, 50, is currently chairman of Texas Instruments in Europe, the US components and information technology group he joined in 1971. Their mission is to bring Alitalia back on course after deepening debts and heavy losses under Giovanni Bisignani, the 47-year-old executive who took on the managing director's job in 1989. Though obviously talented, Bisignani, the former head of international relations for the IRI holding company which controls Alitalia, had little managerial experience. He has been found a new berth as chairman of Tirrenia, the ferry line which is controlled by IRI's Finmare shipping subsidiary and links peninsular Italy with its offshore islands. Friends hope seabound crossings will prove easier going than the obvious turbulence at Alitalia.</p>

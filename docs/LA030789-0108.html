			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 6-MONTH EVALUATION OF SHERYL MASSIP'S MENTAL STATE URGED  </P> <P> A confidential report recommends that Sheryl Lynn Massip be confined to a  psychiatric institution for at least 6 months to evaluate whether she has  recovered from a psychotic illness that contributed to the killing of her  infant son, officials said Monday.  </P> <P> The report, completed last week by county health officials, will help Superior  Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald determine how best to proceed when the  24-year-old Massip returns to his courtroom on Friday, almost 2 years after she  ran over her son in the family car.  </P> <P> The report's conclusion may hurt efforts by Massip's attorney, who contends she  is now sane, to spare the former Anaheim housewife any further confinement.  Massip was evaluated on an out-patient basis last month by county specialists.  </P> <P> Massip said in an interview that the prospect of 6 months in confinement  "doesn't scare me. I've learned to try and take each day one at a time, because  I've had to live that way now for a while."  </P> <P> Last year, Fitzgerald threw out a jury's verdict that found Massip guilty of  murder and ruled that she was not guilty by reason of insanity. The judge held  that she was suffering at the time from postpartum psychosis, a temporary  disorder that is thought to cause delusions, hallucinations and even violence  in about 3 of every 1,000 new mothers.  </P> <P> Massip testified that she heard voices telling her to "put (her 6-week-old son)  out of its misery" shortly before she first tried to throw the child into  oncoming traffic, then hit him over the head with a blunt object and finally  ran him over with her car on April 29, 1987. She then stuffed the body in a  trash can and told police that the boy had been kidnaped.  </P> <P> Under Fitzgerald's finding of insanity, Massip would routinely be ordered to  undergo a 6-month examination, probably at Patton State Hospital, to determine  whether she should be incarcerated for up to 11 years in a mental institution.  </P> <P> But defense attorney Milton C. Grimes argued in a recent interview that the  unusual nature of Massip's case -- which has drawn national attention to the  issue of postpartum psychosis -- justifies abandoning standard criminal  insanity procedures.  </P> <P> "Sheryl is not crazy today and I see no reason why she should have to be  punished any further," Grimes said.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Borris, pleased by the county's preliminary finding,  said: "This is a favorable recommendation because (county personnel) followed  the penal code.  </P> <P> "But as far as what's going to happen Friday, I've learned not to expect  anything in this case. All I know is what the law says -- that she should be  sent away for 6 months of tests."  </P> <P> Although Massip could under Fitzgerald's ruling be confined to a mental  facility for up to 11 years, both the prosecution and the defense agree that  her actual incarceration will likely be far shorter than that because of her  improved mental condition today. Massip's family members say that they have  seen a dramatic improvement in her mental health in recent months. Her bouts  with depression are far more infrequent, they say, and hormonal treatments and  counseling have helped her eating and sleeping patterns, as well as her  physical condition.  </P> <P> County health professionals, while making no finding on Massip's overall  sanity, noted in their report to Fitzgerald that she now appears neat and  well-groomed and her thought, speech and judgment all appear normal, according  to an official familiar with the report who asked anonymity.  </P> <P> Frank Madrigal, program manager for the county's correctional mental health  division, refused to discuss the county's findings, except to confirm that the  report on Massip's case had been completed.  </P> <P> Borris said he believed the county's recommendation was mandated by its  understanding of the law, rather than based on an analysis of Massip's current  mental state and the need for future treatment.  </P></p>

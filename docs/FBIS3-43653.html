			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Split Emerges in Freedom Alliance -- Johannesburg THE STAR  in  English on 12 January in a page 12 editorial says: "Afrikaner  Volksfront [National Front -- AVF] leader Constand Viljoen is  whistling in the dark. Faced with Ciskei's decision to join the  TEC [Transitional Executive Council], contribute 250 troops to  the National Peacekeeping Force and participate unconditionally  in the election, he insists that this does not presage a split  in the Freedom Alliance." Since the alliance was formed to  consolidate opposition to the TEC and to make participation in  the election conditional on fulfillment of demands for  amendments to the Interim Constitution, "commonsense exposes  Viljoen's stance as futile and stonewalling." The AVF is warned  that opinion polls conducted under the auspices of the Institute  for Multiparty Democracy show that "white support for the CP  [Conservative Party] -- the cornerstone of the Volksfront -- has  dropped from 30 to 20 percent in recent months." The CP's  decline shows that "whites are becoming increasingly resigned to  the pending changes. Unless the Volksfront makes a major  tactical shift towards participation in the next few weeks, it  will lose further support and be pushed ineluctably to the  sidelines."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Options for Freedom Alliance Partners -- Johannesburg  BUSINESS DAY in English on 12 January in a page 6 editorial  believes it would "be wrong" to interpret Ciskei's decision to  join the TEC as "a signal that the other components of the  Freedom Alliance are also about to yield to the pressures to  join the political mainstream" since Ciskei is "the weakest and  least significant member of the alliance." However, the other  Freedom Alliance members' options "are dwindling." "As the poll  conducted by the Human Sciences Research Council and the  Institute for Multiparty Democracy shows, SA's electorate has  not taken kindly to the boycotting of negotiations or extremist  policies. Despite the messy and violent political process of  the past few years, the white right wing has stagnated -- in  electoral terms if not in volubility. Even more dramatic is the  news for Buthelezi -- the poll shows he has lost some 40 percent  of his black support in Natal over the past year as he  increasingly withdrew into isolation in Ulundi." But should  Buthelezi discard his "'spoiler'" reputation and commit himself  and his party to contesting the election, "a top post in a  coalition regional government, either with the NP [National  Party] alone or with the ANC too, is well within the realms of  possibility. That decision will determine whether history  judges him as an important regional leader, or the Savimbi of  South Africa."  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   IFP Urged To Join Negotiations -- Johannesburg BEELD in  Afrikaans on 10 January in its page 8 editorial hopes "common  sense will prevail" and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] will  decide to return to negotiations despite the recent decision by  its Central Committee that Inkatha would not join in the  election, nor participate in any structures of the TEC. "The  IFP has perfected the art to sound hopeful and then destructive  in quick succession. As part of the Freedom Alliance, it is  still part of the negotiations. Its statement should be  therefore seen as negotiation rhetoric." It should be clear  within the next few days whether the process can reach finality  without the IFP. One can only hope that "healthy minds and  compromise will be the victors." The step not to obey  Transitional Executive Council structures has serious  implications. The IFP will be directly challenging the authority  and powers of a structure instituted by Parliament should it  offer resistance. "This could lead to serious confrontation with  tragic consequences."    ANC Candidates -- A second editorial on the same page  criticizes the ANC for placing names on its election candidates'  list without prior consultation with, and obtaining permission  from the candidates involved. "The ANC, which aspires to assume  a leading role in the country's government, will have to cut out  such impetuosity and opportunism in future."</p>

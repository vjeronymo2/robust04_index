			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / British Gas warns against break-up BRITISH GAS has warned that it would be severely weakened in its competition with large utilities overseas if it were broken up. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which is reviewing British Gas, is considering the break-up of the company among other options as a way of encouraging more competition in the market. Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, is pressing for British Gas's pipeline business to be hived off so that true competition can be achieved. Executives at British Gas stress that the company is not afraid of competition in the market, 'but we passionately believe the UK needs champions overseas'. It is seeking to diversify into gas markets overseas which are opening up as other countries privatise their national utilities. Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, said: 'We've been able to use our financial strength to expand abroad and generate a numerous amount of jobs and opportunities, not only for British Gas, but for a 100 other companies.' The company has stressed in its evidence to the commission the levels of efficiency it has achieved. A recent study by Arthur D. Little, the consulting group, showed that, on average, British Gas has about 25 days-worth of gas stored. That is an important measure of efficiency - the lower the number of days' gas stored the better the system can balance supply and demand. The same study showed Germany to have 40 days' gas usage stored, the US 70 days' and France more than 100 days'.</p>

After a meeting on Sunday in Ulundi, the policy-making  Central Committee said not enough progress had been made in the  trilateral talks to warrant participation in the election since  its recent special conference. "The progress made in  negotiations since the meeting...does not yet make it possible  for the IFP to enter elections," the committee said in a  statement.    The meeting resolved to instruct its negotiators to "further  negotiate...on the clear understanding the constitutional  concerns of the IFP hang together as inter-related and  interlocked fundamental issues."    It added failure to negotiate the Freedom Alliance's  proposed  amendments to any one clause of the constitution, would have  adverse implications on all other IFP concerns.    Further trilateral talks will take place on Monday in the  last round of talks ahead of registration of parties for the  election.</p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): A school reunion of ideas What does a Franco-Polish joint venture in waste disposal have in common with a British-Belgian marketing alliance in translation services? The answer is that the entrepreneurs behind both initiatives were participants in the 1992 Euroleaders programme, an annual three- to four-week project funded by the European Commission which provides practical help and training to 20-25 innovative companies. Euroleaders was designed to equip small and medium-sized businesses with the skills to operate on the European stage. But as Giles Trentham, managing director of the London-based translation company Wordbank, says, it is often the cross-border contacts developed on the course which can be most valuable. Inspired by his experience, Trentham has established the Euroleaders club, a network of alumni which holds its first reunion in London this weekend. His vision is of a 250-strong group in five to 10 years' time. The two tangible examples of co-operation are Wordbank's own alliance, to promote its translation service to international companies based in Belgium, and the Franco-Polish venture aimed at converting rubbish into fertiliser. The latter requires about Pounds 500,000, expected to come from local government sources in Poland and the EC. The 1993 Euroleaders programme, sponsored by PA Consulting, KPMG, Publicis, Ceran and the Financial Times, attracted more than 1,000 applicants. Two sessions have already been completed in Belgium and Italy, with preparation of a business plan on the agenda for the final meeting in Brussels in September. EC officials hope to run two programmes in 1994. Information on the programme can be obtained from the Euroleaders Secretariat, EBN, Avenue de Tervuren 188A, Brussels B-1150.

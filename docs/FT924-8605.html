			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Investment downturn hits Omron OMRON, a leading Japanese electronic systems manufacturer, yesterday blamed a virtual freeze on investment by Japanese companies for an 80 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the first half of its financial year. Omron said the sharp downturn in the Japanese economy over the past six months had created a drastic situation, with industrial investment grinding to a halt after the boom of the late 1980s. Omron, which makes factory, traffic and office computer control systems, reported an 80.2 per cent drop in net profits to Y1.28bn (Dollars 10.4m) in the six months to September from Y6.47bn in the same period a year earlier. Turnover fell by 10.8 per cent to Y169.7bn from Y190.4bn. Omron is suffering from the same pressures that are hitting many Japanese manufacturers. Its heavy investment programme in the late 1980s, when Japanese demand was growing rapidly, has left it carrying high depreciation costs as economic growth is slowing. The company said the high burden of fixed costs from its modernisation programme had left its profit margins vulnerable to a fall in turnover. Sales of its main products - control components and production systems mainly for factories - fell by 11 per cent to Y112bn. Sales of traffic control systems were 28 per cent down at Y4.4bn, while sales of office automation systems dropped by 20.4 per cent to Y11bn. Omron said it expected to report a 48 per cent drop in full-year net profits to Y7bn.</p>

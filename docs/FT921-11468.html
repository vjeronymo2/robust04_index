			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Appointments: Insurance moves LOWNDES LAMBERT, the insurance broker which went public in July, has taken steps to strengthen its senior management team with the appointment of William Wilks as its new finance director. Wilks, 51, is new to the insurance scene. An FCA, he was previously finance director of Channel Three Wales &amp; The West, a company which recently lost out in the bidding for the Wales and west country TV franchise. Until then he was group finance director of John Laing and has also had a lengthy spell, as finance and development director, at Reed International. Wilks' appointment leaves Stewart Wilson, who had combined the finance job with management of the group's overseas holding company, free to concentrate on expanding Lowndes Lambert's interests abroad. ***** HAYTER BROCKBANK, the Lloyd's agency, is to appoint Henry Engelhardt to head its new motor insurance subsidiary, which will sell motor insurance directly to the public over the telephone. Engelhardt, now in his mid-30s, comes from Chicago, where he worked on the stock exchange. He joined Churchill, the direct motor insurer set up by Switzerland's Winterthur, in 1989 and spent two years there as head of marketing and sales. ***** George Willman is promoted to senior vice-president and general manager for the UK of CONFEDERATION LIFE on the retirement of Kenneth Hilton, who remains a non-exec of the UK subsidiaries. ***** William Petzold is promoted to deputy chairman and Raymond Dumas, Tony Taylor and Tom Busher directors of WELLINGTON Underwriting Holdings. ***** Philip Britton is broking director at ALSFORD PAGE &amp; GEMS. ***** George Moore has resigned as a director of STEEL BURRILL JONES Group but remains a director of Steel Burrill Jones Ltd and chairman of SBJ North America.

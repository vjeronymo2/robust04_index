			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vector 21" newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] The U.S. trade representative [Mickey Kantor]  and the Canadian minister of international trade [Roy MacLaren]  agreed at a news conference that the Mexican Government alone  must resolve the armed conflict in Chiapas State by acting  wisely to restore social peace. MacLaren said the Mexican  Government must be cautious to achieve a peaceful solution.    [Begin MacLaren recording] I hope the Mexican Government's  good sense and wisdom will lead to the prompt resolution of the  conflict in Chiapas. [end recording]    Mickey Kantor said his government has no reason to meddle in  the internal affairs of other nations, but nothing can prevent  the United States from observing the events that take place in  other nations. [passage omitted]    Jaime Serra Puche, Mexican Secretary of Commerce and  Industrial Development, was also present at the news conference  and said that a society can progress only if there is social  peace.    [Begin Serra Puche recording] Every sector of Mexican  society should try to create a harmonious atmosphere that will  allow our society and economy to operate in peace and stability  and sufficiently free from concern so we can enjoy continued  progress and growth and improve the distribution of our  country's wealth. Every Mexican must make this effort. [end  recording]    Aside from political issues, the commerce secretaries  announced that this was the first meeting held since NAFTA went  into effect and that it marked the inauguration of the Free  Trade Agreement Commission, which will be headed by the Mexican  commerce secretary, the U.S. trade representative, and the  Canadian international trade minister. The commission will be  based in Mexico. Plans for opening other commissions were also  set into motion.    Serra, Kantor, and MacLaren agreed to meet on 15 April in  Morocco within the framework of the conclusion of the GATT  Uruguay Round.    The officials also discussed the possible participation of  other nations in NAFTA, but no conclusions were reached.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- The ruling coalition stepped  up efforts Wednesday [2 February] to break a deadlock over a  proposal to raise the rate of the 3 percent consumption tax to  offset planned income tax cuts, coalition officials said.    Most coalition partners agreed to back a proposal by the  Finance Ministry to offset the tax cuts of 6 trillion yen with a  4 percentage point raise in the tax rate to 7 percent, the  officials said.    However, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan]  [SDPJ],  the largest of the seven coalition members, balked at the  proposal to balance an expected revenue shortfall from the tax  cuts with an increase in the tax, imposed on sales of most goods  and services in Japan, they said.    The coalition partners also expressed support for a Finance  Ministry proposal to legislate a provision that would oblige the  government to raise the consumption tax after a moratorium of  one year, they said.    The SDP voiced its objections to the proposal. The SDP has  many opponents of the consumption tax as it bolstered its  parliamentary strength in the 1989 election on an  anticonsumption tax platform.    The non-SDP coalition partners are trying to persuade the  SDP  to accept the revenue-balancing plan, they said. The coalition  tussle has intensified nine days before Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa flies to the United States for talks with President  Bill Clinton.    Hosokawa, whose administration is under U.S. pressure to  revive the floundering Japanese economy by stimulating stagnant  consumer spending, is expected to mention some pump-priming  fiscal package featuring a tax cut at the meeting with Clinton.    The non-SDP coalition partners are trying to alleviate the  SDP aversion to the tax by putting forward a proposal to change  the name of the tax to "welfare-purpose tax" from "consumption  tax," the officials said.    As the coalition's political schedule obliges it to adopt a  comprehensive stimulative package by Thursday, Hosokawa may have  to use his leadership to decide on the tax hike even at the risk  of antagonizing the SDP, they said.    Earlier in the day, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a  meeting of coalition leaders, "The SDP will absolutely not  tolerate a raise in the rate of the consumption tax." However,  other coalition partners are calling for the raise to be  implemented by the end of 1994, saying they do not want to  antagonize voters before a House of Councillors election  expected in the summer of 1995.    Meanwhile, Hosokawa may step up cooperation with the  opposition Liberal Democratic Party in working out the details  of the economic package aimed at balancing the income tax cut  with the consumption tax raise, even if it alienates the  socialists, coalition sources said.    Hosokawa, in a meeting earlier in the day with LDP President  Yohei Kono, asked for an opportunity to hold consultations after  flying back from Washington, the sources said.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said, "It is  quite  natural for the premier who represents the coalition and the LDP  president who leads the main opposition party to hold  consultations over crucial issues whenever necessary." However,  Ichiro Ozawa, the chief coalition strategist and co- leader of  the No. 2 ruling party Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party),  expressed displeasure with the Hosokawa-Kono meeting.    An SDP official warned the prime minister against  approaching  the LDP, saying the implications of the day's meeting with Kono  were "different from ceremonial talks between the LDP and SDP  when we were in opposition." The official, speaking on  condition of anonymity, said, "I suspect that Hosokawa and  Takemura are now in favor of severing ties with Shinseito and  the SDP, if it helps form an alliance with the LDP."    After wrapping up the eleventh-hour compromise on political  reform last Friday, Hosokawa told a news conference in an  apparently conciliatory tone he had long sought a meeting talk  with Kono.</p>

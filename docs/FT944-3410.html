			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norwegian government approves Pounds 1.75bn upgrade plan for ageing Ekofisk oil field The Norwegian government yesterday announced approval of Phillips Petroleum's NKr19bn (Pounds 1.75bn) upgrade plans for the ageing Ekofisk field in the North Sea, ending two years of uncertainty over its future. The field is the hub of the world's largest oil transportation system. In 1992 the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the oil industry watchdog, threatened to close the 250,000-barrels a day field by 1996 for safety reasons. The industry and energy ministry said the upgrade would comprise the construction of two steel well-head platforms to house drilling and production facilities. The development is also expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the field by an estimated 1m tonnes. The government estimates the sales value of the crude oil to be produced from the field between 1999 and 2028 at NKr130bn, based on a price of Dollars 15 a barrel. The ministry confirmed plans by the state to take a direct 5 per cent stake in the field separate from that of Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, which has a 1 per cent shareholding. The state also decided to increase its shareholdings in the Norpipe oil and gas pipelines to 70 per cent from 50 per cent from respectively the years 2005 and 2007. This would mean a reduction to 30 per cent of private shareholders respective stakes in the pipelines. The oil pipeline runs from Ekofisk to Teesside in England while the gas pipeline runs to Emden in Germany. The ministry also confirmed that it would waive a 16 per cent production tariff for the new facilities during the 1999-2028 period. Earlier the ministry said the extension of the licence combined with the production tariff waiver would mean cost savings of NKr900m.</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CHEVRON TO SKIRT COASTAL CHANNEL, BOWING TO LAGOMARSINO'S CONCERNS  </P> <P> Chevron said today it will re-route tankers around the Santa Barbara Channel in  response to a request made by Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura).  </P> <P> The congressman and Chevron made the announcement at a joint news conference  here.  </P> <P> Chevron said the move will cost about $500,000 a year because tankers sailing  up and down the coast will have to cover greater distances to avoid the  channel.  </P> <P> "We recognize that the public is tremendously concerned about tanker operations  in light of recent events," said Thomas Moore, vice president of operations for  Chevron Shipping Co. "We believe that re-routing our tankers can be done  relatively easily."  </P> <P> Lagomarsino on April 11 introduced a bill in the House banning Alaskan oil  tankers from the channel unless they have a destination in the channel. He also  sent letters to six oil companies asking that they voluntarily stop shipping  oil through the channel. Chevron, he said, is the first company to respond.  </P> <P> "Chevron deserves our appreciation for agreeing to our request," Lagomarsino  said. He urged other companies to follow its example.  </P> <P> "The channel is both a productive fishing ground and a productive oil-producing  region. The islands themselves have been designated as a national park. . . .  We should not risk our rich environmental resources to the damage of a possible  accident when there are alternate routes available."  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LO-TEC TO GIVE ALL-MALE CONCERT, FOR A CHANGE;  </P> <P> DANCE: THREE DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO MODERN DANCE WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED BY THREE  NEW YORK PERFORMERS.  </P> <P> The title of this weekend's Lo-Tec concert is "Made in New York." But a better  description of the two performances scheduled for Three's Company's Hillcrest  studio this weekend might be "Man-Made in New York."  </P> <P> Men have been conspicuously absent from most of Three's Company's Lo-Tecs this  summer. And even on those rare occasions when men were around, they were  heavily outnumbered by women.  </P> <P> Not so this weekend. Ron Brown, Albert Reid and Richard Haisma are flying in  from New York City to perform Saturday and Sunday at 8:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Brown will perform his provocative solo, "Next," and a new one he calls "The  Gift."  </P> <P> Haisma has a suite of popular solos to showcase.  </P> <P> Reid will make two solo appearances and perform with a trio of Three's Company  dancers in "Corral."  </P> <P> A two-week workshop at Three's Company brought Brown to San Diego earlier this  month, and he found himself inspired.  </P> <P> "It was a complete surprise to me that I would do a new piece while I'm here,"  he said in a break from teaching class, "but the two Terries (Terry Wilson and  Terri Shipman) are so beautiful I'd like to use them in New York when I do the  piece, if they could come."  </P> <P> Brown will introduce "Next," the dance that provoked Deborah Jowitt of the  Village Voice to say, "You watch his body the way you listen to someone saying  something important and true." The respected dance critic praised Brown's  choreography as well -- for its "strong yet variegated movements."  </P> <P> The dancer himself described "Next" (a piece that culminates with a nude image  at the far end of the stage) as "so contemporary, it doesn't pull any punches.  It's about a character not having control of his death or his destiny."  </P> <P> Brown -- an emotion-charged, Jose Limon-based dancer -- peels off layers of  clothing during the dance as a metaphor for "stripping away, as we feel there  is nothing left to lose. The image is very stark," he said, "but I've never  shocked anyone, because the character is so vulnerable."  </P> <P> Haisma, who performs one-third of the program, wasn't planning to arrive in San  Diego until dress rehearsal, but he talked about his role in this  male-dominated program by telephone from New York last weekend.  </P> <P> "Actually, we're all independent artists," Haisma said. "I've never worked with  the other two before, and our work stems from different traditions."  </P> <P> Though Haisma's modern dance background springs from the Murray Louis line, his  own choreography is more theatrical.  </P> <P> "My work is much more emotional and much more musical. Some of it is very  sensual, but I can't separate myself from my ideas."  </P> <P> As a result, Haisma's "Six Short Dreams," will incorporate "political elements,  dark elements and absurd elements -- a whole range of ideas," as Haisma  described the suite. "I've done the concert several times. I just did it in New  York Friday night, and the response was wonderful."  </P> <P> Reid, the third link in this disjointed chain of male choreographers, made a  detour to Santa Barbara on his way to this week's Lo-Tec concert. But, in a  telephone interview earlier this week, he confided his misgivings about being  teamed up with dancers he doesn't even know. "I don't generally (share a  program)," Reid said. "This could be terrible, but I'm gambling that it will be  interesting for the audience to see a wide range of modern dance."  </P> <P> Reid is doing his part to ensure variety on this weekend's triple bill. The  long-time Cunningham dancer-teacher will perform two Cunninghamesque solos --  tailored to his own idiosyncratic taste.  </P> <P> "My work is like Cunningham's, but more lyrical. I like to dance with the  music, and I don't use chance," he assured, distancing himself from two of his  mentor's trademarks.  </P> <P> "I'm using three dancers from Three's Company for another piece," Reid noted.  "Dancers who studied with me three years ago when I taught a workshop in San  Diego."  </P> <P> As Reid noted, this kind of mixed bill has built-in risks. But one way or the  other -- by putting the accent on men -- the event should fill a void on the  local concert dance scene.  </P></p>

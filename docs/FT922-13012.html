			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Takeover put spark into battery maker: Maggie Urry examines the 'Hansonisation' of the Ever Ready group It would be simple to characterise Hanson's sale of the UK part of Ever Ready as yet another example of the conglomerate's habit of buying and selling businesses. Certainly Hanson is now selling for Pounds 132m a slice of a business bought for Pounds 95m in 1981. It sold the European subsidiaries for Pounds 37m in 1982, and is keeping the South African operation, which makes slightly higher profits than the UK business. The anti-Hanson camp could use the disposal to argue that Hanson is a churner and not a developer of businesses. If Hanson was really a long-term investor, they might say, it could have taken the Ever Ready business to the next stage of development. Ever Ready has often been held up as one of the successes of the 'Hansonisation' process. Under Hanson it has invested, launched new products and increased profits. But the crunch has come 10 years after its acquisition. Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman of Hanson, agrees that Hanson must now sell Ever Ready UK if its full potential is to be realised. Ralston Purina, the buyer, is the world's largest battery maker and, the argument goes, Ever Ready UK will be better off joining it. The question remains - does the Hanson method work in the long term? When Hanson acquired Ever Ready just before Christmas 1981, the company was in trouble. Its old management had changed the name to Berec, throwing away a well-known brand. It had failed to move into the alkaline battery sector of the market, the fastest-growing area. And its management was burdened with layers of people contributing nothing. Mr Bob Nevitt, managing director of Ever Ready UK was national sales manager at the time of the takeover. He joined the business in 1959 and was promoted to his present job by Hanson. He was delighted when Hanson arrived, he says. 'There were umpteen layers of management between us and the decision makers. We were being taken apart by Duracell (the leading alkaline battery maker) at the time and had no response.' The change since Hanson took over has been revolutionary. For example, Mr Nevitt says that he, the sales director, the marketing director and the finance director share a secretary. 'She is an incredibly busy lady,' he admits. More seriously, he says that when Hanson moved in it discovered a 'commercial department' of 40 people. When asked what the department did, there was no real reply and it was abolished. Head office numbers were slashed from 550 to 75 and the office was relocated. The company's research and development facility employed 250 people. But, says Mr Nevitt 'they were generating nothing for us and costing a huge amount of money'. Hanson selected the 55 or 60 people it wanted to keep and moved them from north London to be near the main manufacturing plant in the north-east of England. An advanced projects facility near Oxford was sold, while the German research and development establishment, which was working on alkaline batteries, went when the European businesses were sold - ironically to Duracell. Hanson's well-known financial rigour did not stop it investing in the company, Mr Nevitt says. Hanson was 'prepared to listen to sensible propositions requiring millions of pounds,' Mr Nevitt says. The first thing Hanson did was bring back the Ever Ready name. Then it turned to correcting the failure to attack the alkaline, long-life, battery market. In less than two years from the takeover Ever Ready launched Gold Seal, now the largest rival to Duracell in the alkaline market. Mr Nevitt claims that Gold Seal has a 21 per cent share of that sector of the market compared with Duracell's 55 per cent, figures Duracell has disputed. Ever Ready still has half the zinc carbon sector - with Silver Seal and Blue Seal - giving it a 36 per cent share of the market as a whole, worth Pounds 350m a year. Now, Mr Nevitt says, Ever Ready and Duracell just about match each other in marketing spending, at about Pounds 7m a year each. As well as increasing the marketing spend, Ever Ready invested in high-speed production lines, enabling it to cut costs. Meanwhile, the slimmed-down R and D department developed Gold Seal batteries, the Silver Seal brand which is a longer-lasting zinc carbon battery, and worked on reducing the mercury content of batteries. So why is Hanson selling? Mr Nevitt says, and Mr Taylor agrees, that Ever Ready UK needs to become part of an international business, which it was when when Hanson acquired it. As well as selling the European businesses back in 1982, Hanson closed the loss-making Hong Kong arm and its Nigerian operation. Exports have also fallen as a proportion of Ever Ready UK's sales. Perhaps it was short-sighted to have got rid of most of the international business? Hanson argues that the European and Nigerian companies were barely profitable at the time, the Hong Kong business was loss-making, and, in any case, Hanson's focus was on the UK and North America. The international businesses - aside from that in South Africa which is run entirely separately from the UK - did not seem to be ones capable of being developed. The obvious answer now is to reunite Ever Ready UK with Ralston's battery operation, which has the Eveready name in the US. The two were divided in 1914 when the original company, the American Electrical Novelty and Manufacturing Company, floated the UK business and sold the US side to National Carbon, which later became Union Carbide. The logic of putting the two together was not lost on Hanson. It had tried to buy the US business when Union Carbide sold it in 1986, but lost to Ralston. Hanson again tried to buy the business from Ralston, but Ralston refused. In the end the only answer was to sell to Ralston.

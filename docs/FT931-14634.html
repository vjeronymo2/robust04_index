			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Britain's editors: sad victims of royal scandal - How the meek tabloids have been manipulated by scheming royals BRITAIN'S newspapers are under threat from a force so powerful that none has been able to withstand it. We know this because the editors themselves have told us how this mighty power has manipulated them, consistently, and over a long period. Strangely, it is just one person. She is a woman. She has no organisation: indeed she has been compelled to share an office with her estranged husband. She is no great intellect, without a single 'O' level to her name. She is not a newspaper proprietor, indeed she has no power of any kind to decide what shall appear in any newspaper. But this, apparently, is all irrelevant: the press, innocent dupes to a man, have been consistently manipulated by her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales. That, at least, is what they have been saying all week. Cynics might argue that this was merely a ruse, to ensure that they would enjoy the sympathy of their readers at a time when the government was contemplating whether or not to implement Sir David Calcutt's proposals to set up statutory controls over the press. But that would imply that tabloid newspaper editors would stoop so low as to manipulate their readers' emotions - a disgraceful slur. What is the basis of the newspapers' allegations about the Princess of Wales? They must, surely, have hundreds of examples of her manipulation. Well, as a matter of fact, they don't. It is all based on a single leaked letter from Lord McGregor, the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, to Sir David Calcutt. According to McGregor: 'I was told by Mr Andrew Knight, executive chairman of News International, that the princess was participating in the provision of information for tabloid editors about the state of her marriage.' Knight's anxiety to put this opinion to Lord McGregor was understandable. News International in its various guises was busily serialising Andrew Morton's book on the Princess of Wales. Lord McGregor, acting quite outside his remit, since his commission had received no complaint, took it upon himself portentously to denounce the reports of Morton's book as 'odious exhibition of journalists dabbling their fingers in the stuff of other people's souls'. Perhaps, if Lord McGregor had taken the trouble to ring up Knight beforehand, he could instead have issued a statement denouncing the Princess of Wales. For he subsequently appeared to take the hardly disinterested words of the News International chairman as gospel, even though Morton himself, who ought to know if anyone, has categorically stated that the Princess did not co-operate with his book. Instead, Lord McGregor merely complained, with breathtaking effrontery, that 'The Princess of Wales in this situation seriously embarrased the Commission.' The media could not believe their luck: they could use McGregor's gibberings to blame the Princess for all their own intrusions. The Times, in attempting to back up Knight's claims about the Princess's manipulations, stated with absolute assurance that the Prince Charles / Camilla Parker Bowles taped telephone conversation was leaked to the Daily Mirror (where it was first reported) 'by the Princess's friends'. Richard Stott, the then editor of the Daily Mirror wrote to complain that this was completely untrue, that the tape 'was offered to us at one of our branch offices and it was recorded by a very ordinary member of the general public. If you are looking for a plot you won't find it here.' No, indeed. The only plot has been by powerful men to pretend that they have been manipulated by one woman, when they have at all times had complete freedom and discretion to publish what they want, when they want, how they want. It is called the freedom of the press. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

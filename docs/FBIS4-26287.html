			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 20 (XINHUA) -- South Korean ministers at  meetings this week will discuss the issue of economic  cooperation with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  (DPRK) in anticipation of the summit meeting between the leaders  of the two halves of the Korean peninsula.    Government officials said here today that the aim of the  proposed consultations among various South Korean ministries was  to promote intra-Korean economic exchange, which has been  stalled due to the row over Pyongyang's nuclear program.    The inter-Korean summit is likely to be held in the near  future, with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam having accepted  an invitation from DPRK President Kim Il-song conveyed to him by  former U.S. President Jimmy Carter last Saturday [18 June].    The officials said that the first stage of ministerial  meetings will involve the National Unification Board (NUB), the  Economic Planning Board (EPB) and the Trade, Industry and  Resources Ministry.    More detailed consultations will be held after the summit  and  an ensuing meeting between the prime ministers of South Korea  and the DPRK, they said.    South Korea's private sector in particular is expected to  accelerate direct trade and joint investment with the DPRK, if  the summit takes place and the obstacles to economic cooperation  are removed, the officials added.</p>

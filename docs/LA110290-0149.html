			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFER TO BUY NEW YORK DAILY NEWS REJECTED  </P> <P> A labor lawyer and adviser to striking unions of the Daily News offered  Thursday to buy the newspaper, but he was rebuffed by its owners.  </P> <P> Theodore Kheel told Tribune Co., the owner of the News, that he had lined up  investors to help finance the purchase. He also said he could negotiate  contracts with the unions and work out a joint operating agreement with the New  York Post. Kheel refused to identify the investors or reveal his buying price.  Eight of the newspaper's 10 unions struck the News on Oct. 25 over what they  termed unfair labor practices. They were joined a day later by members of the  Newspaper Guild.  </P></p>

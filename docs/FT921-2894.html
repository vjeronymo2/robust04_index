			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Smith claims he would revive economy in months A VISIBLE turnabout in the economy should be in evidence 'within a matter of months' of a Labour government taking office, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, claimed last night. Speaking in the first of a series of televised debates between frontbench spokesmen, Mr Smith said the impact of Labour's training and employment relief measures would quickly register a slowdown in the rise of the jobless figures, followed by a reversal of the trend. His claims on the BBC's Panorama programme were dismissed by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and deemed inadequate by Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrats' finance spokesman. Hopes that the debate would provoke fierce controversy or even a telling election gaffe failed to materialise as the three combatants warily circled each other on important tax and spending topics. The challenges and counter-claims for the credibility of each party's programme were less dramatic than the regular clashes that take place in faster-paced interviews on current affairs programmes such as Newsnight. With so much at stake, it was clear non one was ready to venture far from their approved texts. For Labour, Mr Smith made a credible case for his tax and spending plans, unveiled in his shadow Budget yesterday, in spite of a repeated charge from Mr Lamont that more rises in taxes, inflation and interest rates would follow. Mr Lamont pressed home the claim that Labour's plans were the most punitive ever on middle income earners and that the Opposition's national minimum wage would hurt business. In between them, Mr Beith made his case for a further Pounds 2bn lift to the economy over and above the increase in the public sector borrowing requirment proposed in last week's Budget. All three men committed their parties to observing the current exchange rate within the ERM and rejected any suggestion of a devaluation. Only once were voices tellingly raised, when Mr Lamont accused Labour of being 'ludicrous' when it said a Pounds 1bn recovery package would have an impact on a Pounds 600bn economy. Mr Smith was stirred if not shaken. It was a 'typical Tory technique' to claim credit for bringing down inflation and interest rates, when they had put them up, he claimed. As for inflation rises being a 'blip', since Mr Nigel Lawson's chancellorship it had been 'blip, blip, blip', Mr Smith added. What was Mr Lamont's response? Unfortunately, the Buggins' turn rules of engagement meant it was time for Mr Beith, not the chancellor, to take his cue.</p>

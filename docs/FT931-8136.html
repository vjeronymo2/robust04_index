			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities close firmly in calm trading A NERVOUS week on the UK stock market closed with share prices edging higher as US markets continued to respond to President Clinton's State of the Union message, and an unexpected fall in German M3 money supply rekindled hopes that UK base rates could be reduced again soon. Trading volume in UK equities was steady rather than exciting but dealers said that market confidence had been helped by this week's UK economic data. Although the 2.3 per cent fall in the German money supply figure was quickly described by the Bundesbank as a 'distortion', the announcement reinforced sterling's firmness and also the view of some City analysts that a slowdown in the German economy will take the pressure off the pound, opening the way for further cuts in UK base rates. Government bond prices gained more than half a point yesterday, encouraged also by comments from the team of independent UK economic forecasts known as the 'seven wise men'; one of the team called for two more one point cuts in base rates in the next few months. Index-linked gilts, the prime anti-inflation hedge instrument, lagged well behind the conventional bond sector. Cautious at first because of Wall Street's easier trend overnight, equities soon climbed by 8 Footsie points, before reversing to show a fall of 5. Traders said there was little significant selling and buyers reappeared as the German money supply news was followed by favourable reports from the Humphrey Hawkins testimony to Congress by Mr Alan Greenspan, head of the Federal Reserve. At the close, the FT-SE Index was just 2.3 ahead at 2,840. After plunging sharply on Tuesday when Wall Street fell ahead of President Clinton's speech, the UK market has steadied to show a net fall of only 3 points on the FT-SE scale since the previous Friday's close. Retail, or customer, interest in equities, which has remained high all week, was worth Pounds 1.46bn on Thursday. Seaq volume of 533m shares yesterday, of which about 65 per cent was in non-Footsie stocks, compared with 637.1m in the previous session. Activity in the second line issues was also reflected in the rise of 8 points in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index which closed last night at 3,048.3, within four points of its peak. Speculative interest was reawakened in a number of takeover candidates but traders refused to become over-excited. 'Today showed a solid performance by UK equities which have this week held on to the resistance area around the FT-SE 2,800,' said one.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 8, IRNA -- The English Turkish DAILY  NEWS on Friday printed the text of an interview with the Iranian  ambassador to Ankara, Mohammad Reza Baqeri at which he has said  Iran had delivered to the Turkish Government those of the  Turkish dissidents that engaged in anti-Turkish activities on  the Iranian soil.    The Iranian ambassador has said that Iran's position towards  her neighbor Turkey in that respect remains unchanged. He has  expressed hope that the cooperation between Iran and Turkey  would serve as a model for other regional countries.    Baqeri has said Turkish Police Chief Mehmet Aghar will visit  Tehran shortly within the context of security collaboration  between the two countries. He has said that Iran and Turkey  have common enemies, among them those who support the idea of  the creation of an independent Kurdish government.    Referring to the Zionist regime and Turkey's relations with  that regime, the Iranian ambassador has said that the foreign  policy of the Turkish Government is the business of that  government, but he has commented that the Zionist regime is not  to be trusted.    Baqeri has also commended the part being played in Central  Asia jointly by Iran and Turkey, saying that their cooperation  is already nearing its fruition. He has said that the transfer  of Turkmenistan's gas to Turkey and Europe across the Iranian  soil is simply one of the good results of that cooperation.    The Iranian official has also praised Turkey for  contributing  to peace-keeping troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    According to Baqeri a delegation from Turkish Ministry of  Industries is to visit Tehran in two months within the context  of an interim agreement on mutual cooperation on the manufacture  of automotive parts.</p>

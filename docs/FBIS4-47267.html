			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by N. T. Timofeyeva and V. B. Okhlyand, </F> Certification Institute (A-U)]    [Abstract] Individual means of protection (SIZ) play an  especially important role in safeguarding humans in situations  where there is a danger of interaction with harmful factors  during production. Various SIZ have been classified according to  GOST 12.4.011-89 and include 12 classes for hearing organs,  nose, feet, arms, head, eyes, face, respiratory organs, and for  falling from heights. At the present time, about 1000 SIZ items  being are produced and used with varying degrees of protection.  Effectiveness in using these means and devices depends not only  on their protective properties, but also on their correct  selection by taking into account the conditions under which they  will be used. A decree of the GOSSTANDART established a system  of certification for individual means of protection in 1993  which in turn established system structure and an order for  conducting SIZ certification: starting on 1 Apr 93--SIZ for head  and respiratory organs; 1 Jul 93--hearing organs, falling from  heights and insulating garments; 1 Jul 94--feet, arms, SIZ made  from plastics, and face, eyes, and skin; 1 Jan 95 special  garments. The principles and order of SIZ certification is  analogous to that of the European Community standards. A flow  chart is provided which represents the structural system of the  certification process. By the second half of 1993 ten  certificates were issued on SIZ for respiratory organs and nine  laboratories (centers) were accredited including the ITs [test  center] ``Sorbotekhn'' and ``EKOTsENTER'' for testing filtration  devices for respiratory organs (gas masks and anti-dust  respirators).

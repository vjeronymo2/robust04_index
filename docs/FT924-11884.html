			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Technology: Larger than life graffiti - Worth Watching Doodling and defacing pictures in books and magazines is the kind of mischief that children of all ages indulge in, but this week saw the UK launch of a product enabling adults to join in without feeling guilty. Photograffiti starts with a 35mm negative of the customer's boss, spouse, mother-in-law etc. This is enlarged, encapsulated in rigid clear plastic, and returned to the customer with a white plastic speech bubble and a pack of five coloured felt tip pens. Photograffiti, from London-based Graham Associates, can be used, with or without speech bubble, as a memo board or for recreation and amusement, and can be wiped clean with a damp cloth for re-use time and again. When not being used it becomes a portrait. It comes in two sizes, 10in by 14in for Pounds 12.99 and 12in by 18in for Pounds 14.99. Photograffiti: UK, 081 392 9304</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The South Korea-U.S. joint "Ulchi-Focus Lens"  military exercise will be conducted in August for about two  weeks, the Defense Ministry announced yesterday.    Ulchi-Focus Lens is a command post exercise, which started  in  1976 combining the Ulchi exercise conducted by the Korean  government and Focus Lens, a military exercise which had been  conducted under the U.N. Command.    It was separated into two and held on a smaller scale in  1991-1993 to help provide a favorable mood for the inter-Korea  talks.    This year the two exercises will be combined again into  Ulchi-Focus, because Team Spirit, the annual large-scale  Korea-U.S. joint field exercise which is usually held in early  spring, has been postponed to November this year over North  Korea's nuclear impasse, a Defense Ministry official said.    But the official refused to say how many Korean and U.S.  troops will participate in the drill.</p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L .F. ROTHSCHILD HOLDINGS SEEKS BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION  </P> <P> L. F. Rothschild Holdings, parent of a once-venerated Wall Street investment  firm that suffered staggering losses from the 1987 stock market collapse,  sought Friday to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  </P> <P> The filing for protection from creditors does not include L. F. Rothschild  &amp; Co., a registered broker-dealer that is Rothschild Holdings' principal  subsidiary.  </P> <P> Rothschild Holdings, which lost $84 million in the quarter ended March 31, is  in default on three debt issues totaling $60 million and wants to restructure  its debt to reduce interest expenses, according to spokesman Kenneth Henderson.  </P> <P> Separately, the Rothschild Co. brokerage said it intends to re-enter the retail  business with a discount operation pitting the firm against such bigger  discount brokers as Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab Corp.  </P> <P> Rothschild Co., once a leader in public stock offerings for high-tech  companies, will also continue to offer corporate finance and investment banking  services with a greater focus on "middle-market and smaller capitalized  companies."  </P> <P> Rothschild Holdings filed its Chapter 11 petition with the Bankruptcy Court for  the Southern District of New York in Manhattan. Henderson said the company soon  would file its reorganization plan, which includes the swapping of existing  debt for zero-coupon debt to cut current interest expenses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Much Smaller Firm  </P> <P> The company's board said that while the move may affect the firm adversely in  the short term, "following a successful reorganization . . . Rothschild will be  better positioned" to expand its business through the brokerage arm and  ultimately become profitable.  </P> <P> Henderson said Rothschild Co. has "a large number of deals in the works" mostly  involving mergers and acquisitions and leveraged buyouts, but he could not  elaborate.  </P> <P> With 75 employees, the current Rothschild is a shadow of the old-line  investment house and full-service brokerage that employed as many as 2,200  people before the Oct. 19, 1987, stock market crash.  </P> <P> Rothschild was formed in 1899 as L. F. Rothschild &amp; Co. In 1977, it merged  with C. E. Unterberg Towbin Co., then a young investment boutique. But  management strife forced out partners A. Robert Towbin and Thomas Unterberg  shortly after the company went public in 1986.  </P> <P> As of Jan. 1, 1987, Rothschild ranked as the 18th-largest U.S. securities firm  with capital of $289 million. But by the end of the year, Rothschild posted a  $129-million annual loss, $56 million of which resulted from arbitrage and  over-the-counter trading positions held during the Black Monday crash.  </P> <P> In an attempt to rebound and slash fixed costs, Rothschild systematically sold  or abandoned its retail brokerage, public finance and municipal bond sales and  trading operations. It also ceased over-the-counter market making, arbitrage  and the selling and trading of mortgage-backed and high-grade corporate  securities.  </P> <P> The firm, which in late 1986 became one of just 40 primary dealers that could  buy and sell government securities as both principals and agents, left that  business in January.  </P> <P> "The object . . . in the recent past is to reduce operations and be as  efficient as possible and go into businesses with . . . the lowest overhead,"  Henderson said.  </P> <P> A year ago, Rothschild Holdings became a subsidiary of Franklin Financial  Services, a services company that itself is a unit of Ottawa, Kan.-based  Franklin Savings Assn.  </P> <P> Regarding the brokerage business's plans to offer discount brokerage services,  Henderson said, "We're aware that it is a very competitive business. But we do  have customer lists from our old retail operations and can rely on the  Rothschild name."  </P> <P> Except for advertising, the cost of setting up discount brokerage operations  will be minimal, Henderson said. Back-office operations, which he described as  the heaviest contributor to overhead, will be handled by another firm.  </P></p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Technology: Designing chips that defy logic / A look at a faster way of building the next generation of semiconductors Defying conventional wisdom that American semiconductor chip makers lag their Japanese competitors in manufacturing technology, LSI Logic, a leading Silicon Valley chipmaker, has developed what it claims is a world-beating semiconductor production process. LSI's technology will enable the company to produce chips with about twice as many miniature transistors as today's most complex commercial devices. This level of chip density could make the much vaunted 'computer system on a chip' a reality. By reducing the 'line width' of circuit elements on a chip to just 0.6 micron, LSI appears to have leapfrogged its competitors. The process is 'clearly one step ahead of most of the competition,' says Ron Collet, principal semiconductor analyst at Dataquest, a US market research group. LSI's feat is surprising, not only because it comes from a US chipmaker but also because LSI's semiconductors are not mass-produced memory chips like those which the Japanese have turned into a commodity product. Instead LSI is a specialist in the production of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), semiconductor devices tailored to meet the needs of individual customers. Traditionally, memory chip makers such as Hitachi, Toshiba and NEC Japan have led the chip-density race. Dynamic Random Access Memory (D-Ram) chips have been used as a vehicle to prove new semiconductor production processes. When several US chip makers dropped out of the D-Ram market in the mid-1980s in the face of mounting Japanese competition and alleged Japanese 'dumping' of D-Rams at prices below production costs, a concern among US semiconductor industry and government officials was the potential impact upon the US chip industry's ability to keep pace in process technology. Fears that US chip makers would not be able to develop leading-edge chip-making technology without D-Rams to drive them led to the formation of Sematech, an industry consortium that receives half of its funding from the US Defence Department. Sematech set ambitious goals to develop world-beating manufacturing techniques or 'process technology' on behalf of its US semiconductor industry members. LSI Logic was one of the 14 founding members of Sematech, but in January the company withdrew from the consortium, saying that its research and development funds were better spent internally. LSI had recognised that the process technology requirements of its ASIC products were diverging from those of mass production commodity chips such as D-Rams, which remain the focus of Sematech's efforts. Indeed, the notion that D-Rams are a critical 'technology driver' for the semiconductor production process has been widely called into question by US semiconductor experts over the past few years. However, for LSI Logic, the development of leading-edge process technology was imperative if the company was not to sink beneath the rising tide of competition. With revenues last year of close to Dollars 700m, LSI ranks as the eighth largest US semiconductor producer, but it is dwarfed by Japanese competitors. To accelerate its process technology development time, LSI turned to computer simulation as a faster, cost-effective method to advance process technology. While it can take several weeks to get the results of an experimental production process run, the same results can be obtained using computer simulations in a matter of days. A long-time expert in the use of simulation in the design of semiconductor chips, LSI put computer modelling to work for itself. The company acknowledges that it also drew upon research performed at several US universities that was funded by the semiconductor industry's Semiconductor Research Corporation, to which it contributes. LSI also made the decision to refit its California production facility, which might otherwise have been closed down, for research uses and pilot-line production, thus providing its R&amp;D team with faster access to a factory test bed. The result, says Wilfred Corrigan, chairman of LSI Logic, is that the company has accelerated its 'learning cycles', the number of experimental production runs (real or simulated) that it can perform in a given period. But getting one step ahead is not enough in the highly competitive chip market. To maintain its process technology lead, LSI will have to continue to redouble the pace of process innovation. Already, however, LSI Logic has created a quandary for its competitors. Typically, the largest Japanese semiconductor producers 'recycle' their semiconductor plants. New plants are designed for the latest generation of D-Rams, then after a few years they are turned over to produce microprocessors and ASICs, and ultimately to chips such as those used in calculators and consumer electronics products. By applying the latest semiconductor production technology to ASICs, LSI aims to gain a competitive advantage over much larger companies that do not focus their process development efforts on this segment of the semiconductor market.</p>

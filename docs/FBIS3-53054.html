'Abd-al-Shafi told Reuter television that he had decided,  right from the beginning, to distance himself from having any  role in the deal. He said this was his final decision.    'Abd-al-Shafi made the remarks shortly after arriving in  Amman from Tunis where he pressed Palestine President Yasir  'Arafat for reforms.    The Gaza doctor, who is now spearheading Palestinian efforts  to curb 'Arafat's power and introduce democratic reforms in the  PLO, said he told the president of the mood of the people.    [Begin 'Abd-al-Shafi recording] We wanted, first of all, to  make Chairman 'Arafat aware of the needs of the situation, and I  think we did that very well. We made him aware of the mood of  the people, of what do we expect, and certainly, I mean, in  terms of reform, it is mainly the democratic practice within the  PLO organizations. [end recording]    Tonight, Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi headed a meeting of Palestinian  reformists at the Palestine National Council offices in Amman.  He briefed them on his visit and talks in Tunis and the PLO  leadership's response. He said the PLO had asked him to contact  the opposition inside and outside the occupied territories to  begin a national dialogue on reform.</p>

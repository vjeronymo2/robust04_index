			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' at the </F> airport in Algiers upon his arrival on 15 March -- recorded]    [Text] I have been assigned by President Hafiz al-Asad to  convey a message to his brother President Liamine Zeroual and to  listen to whatever President Zeroual wants to tell us about the  situation in dear Algeria. Undoubtedly, we in Syria are very  concerned and worried about what is taking place here out of our  concern for Algeria's unity and its role in the Arab and Islamic  arenas, and on the basis of our conviction that President  Zeroual's statement on the dialogue was positive and it is bound  to lead to the easing of the brotherly people's suffering and to  the establishment of security and stability in this country.</p>

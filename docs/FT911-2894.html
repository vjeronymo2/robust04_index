			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Man In The News: Fixer finds friends for his Kurds - Jalal Talabani A month ago he made a triumphant return to Kurdistan and appealed to Iraqis, both Kurdish and Arab, to topple President Saddam Hussein and end what he called the 'bloody dictatorship of Baghdad'. This week he embraced Mr Saddam and said he thought they could do a deal. In the intervening days, of course, the Iraqi army had all but crushed the post-war uprisings in Kurdistan and in the Shia Moslem towns of southern Iraq. But Mr Jalal Talabani, the veteran Kurdish guerrilla leader and politician, has stunned many of his supporters with a U-turn so remarkable that it stands out even in a nationalist movement famous for its shifting alliances and loyalties. Mr Talabani, now a grey-haired 57-year-old, has alternately fought and negotiated with his enemies since he joined the late Mullah Mustafa Barzani's Kurdish Democratic party at the age of 12. He split from the KDP in 1964, and Barzani - hardly a man of unchanging allegiances himself - once sneeringly described him as 'an agent for everybody'. In the current negotiations with the Iraqi regime, however, Mr Talabani is not alone, although it was he who spoke for the Kurdish delegation this week after the first round of talks. The Kurdish side included Mr Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (which he founded in 1975), the KDP (now led by Mustafa's son, Masoud Barzani, who is expected to lead the next round of discussions) and other members of the Iraqi Kurdistan Front. Mr Talabani and his fellow Kurds are taking an extraordinary political risk by talking to President Saddam at such a time and by urging Kurds to return home when their long-term safety from government reprisals is not assured, but they feel they have no choice. They do not want the nearly 2m Kurds who have fled to the borders with Iran and Turkey to become permanent refugees. At the same time they believe the west has accepted that Mr Saddam will stay in power, and they want to squeeze concessions from the Iraqi leader while he is still weak in the aftermath of the war over Kuwait. 'We are alone,' Mr Talabani said at rebel headquarters in Shaqlawa after his meeting with Mr Saddam. 'We have no friends . . . The Iraqi government wanted to crush us, but was unable to do so. And we wanted to overthrow the government but have not been able to do so.' So the negotiations continue. Nobody would have been surprised at Mr Talabani's decision to talk to his enemies in the Iraqi government, or at his subsequent optimism about the prospects for democracy in Iraq and autonomy for Kurdistan, had he not been so widely admired as an astute and prudent politician. Many Shia Moslems are furious at what they see as Mr Talabani's betrayal of the 17-party Iraqi opposition coalition which is seeking to overthrow Mr Saddam, but his friends and allies are confident that he is not about to throw caution to the winds. 'I don't think he can be deceived or be made to agree to something that does not accord with his principles,' says Mr Ibrahim Ahmed, his father-in-law. Mr Talabani, who is married with two sons, is as relaxed in a western suit and sitting on a sofa as he is in baggy trousers and turban sitting on the ground surrounded by his pesh merga (the Kurdish guerrillas, or 'those who face death'). Years ago he often used to harangue his PUK colleagues and threaten to resign as leader if he did not get his way. He would fling down his revolver, tell his colleagues to do what they wanted without him and make as if to leave. They invariably urged him to stay, handed back his revolver, and yielded to his wishes. But one day, so the story goes, when times were hard in Kurdistan before the end of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988, an angry pesh merga bodyguard pointed his Kalashnikov at Mr Talabani's stomach and told him to pick up the revolver and take responsibility for the mess into which he had led the Kurdish people. Mr Talabani retrieved his gun. 'Since then he's stopped doing that,' says one of his acquaintances. A fluent English-speaker, the exiled Mr Talabani has impressed his interlocutors in the west and elsewhere with a mixture of determination, moderation, honesty and humour. 'He was always a shrewd politician and he has only one main occupation - the Kurdish problem,' says Mr Kamran Karadaghi, the Kurdish foreign editor of the Arabic newspaper al-Hayat. 'When he speaks about the Kurdish cause he talks with the same enthusiasm and emotion as he did when he was 15 years old.' His early differences with the Barzani clan arose partly because he and his leftist allies saw the Barzanis as tribal and backward, and to this day Mr Talabani's supporters say he has a much better grasp of international affairs and their relevance for the Kurdish problem than most of his rivals. He was particularly anguished when the Iranian government used Iraqi Kurds based in Iran to fight Iranian Kurds during the Iran-Iraq war. Like many Kurds, he espouses ideals of cross-border Kurdish nationalism but has come to accept that complete independence is not a goal which can be achieved in the teeth of opposition from Turkey, Iran and Iraq. His aim now is an autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan within a democratic Iraq, an ambition so acceptable to Turkey that he was invited to meet Turkish government officials in March. He is already close to the Syrians and sometimes lives in Damascus. As for the Iraqis, this is the third time that Mr Talabani has done serious business with the government in Baghdad, although this time the stakes are higher. Since he last met President Saddam in 1984, the Iraqi government has gassed to death the residents of Halabja and all but finished its programme of depopulating the Kurdish countryside by demolishing villages and deporting the inhabitants. Some Kurds are inordinately proud of the 1970 autonomy agreement reached with Baghdad by Mustafa Barzani, and it is on this agreement that the proposed deal between the Kurds and the Iraqi government is to be based. Kurds admire the 1970 accord because it represents a far greater series of concessions from a central government than the Kurds have won in Iran or Turkey, but it remains a piece of paper of the kind not normally respected by Mr Saddam. Mr Talabani and his allies are nevertheless hoping to put it into practice and to enforce it by means of international guarantees. 'I have never seen in all this time such a positive spirit, such a positive climate, such positive ground for negotiation on Iraqi Kurdistan,' said Mr Talabani after meeting Mr Saddam. His supporters are praying that his political acumen has not deserted him.</p>

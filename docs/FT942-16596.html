			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Top advertisers 'would welcome BBC airtime' Two-thirds of top-spending advertisers would like to advertise on BBC television, with the Nine O'Clock News heading the list of most attractive programmes, a consultancy says today. Their ambitions are almost certain to be thwarted: it is expected that the government will reject the possibility of allowing the BBC to take advertising when its royal charter comes up for renewal in 1996. The findings of the survey by Media Audits highlight some dissatisfaction among advertisers with ITV programmes and their ability to deliver desirable audiences. It also underlines fears about the increased concentration of the selling of advertising airtime, caused by the spate of recent TV company mergers. A total of 85 per cent of advertisers surveyed said ITV mergers worked against their interests. This dissatisfaction comes as figures from the trade magazine, Media Week, show that ITV airtime prices for May will be at least 18 per cent higher than they were a year ago - the highest level of 'airtime inflation' for at least five years. The list of advertisers' top 10 BBC programmes do not necessarily have the highest viewing figures - the Nine O'Clock News, for example, does not even figure in the latest official viewing figures for the top 30 programmes, but its upmarket audience would be attractive to advertisers. The standard of ITV programmes, apart from soap operas, was seen by advertisers to have declined, with 87 per cent of respondents saying that comedy programmes were worse than a year ago. Sports coverage, news programmes, children's programmes, documentaries and drama were all seen to have declined. BBC and Channel 4 programmes, meanwhile, were generally seen to have improved. Mr Michael Cluff, Media Audits managing director, said: 'ITV's long-term interests will be best served by investing in its programming. The perceived problem is that ITV constantly chases short-term profitability.' The survey was compiled from 80 responses from the top 300 advertisers, accounting for about 25 per cent of annual spending on TV advertising. The most attractive BBC programmes for advertisers included the Nine O'Clock News; soaps EastEnders and Neighbours; and sport programmes.</p>

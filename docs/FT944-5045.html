			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / SFO fails to ban press from Maxwell case The Serious Fraud Office yesterday failed in an attempt to have a blanket reporting ban placed on a High Court case in which Maxwell pensioners are trying to recover Pounds 60m from Credit Suisse bank. The SFO - backed by lawyers acting for some of those being prosecuted over the Maxwell affair - had argued that reporting of the case should be stopped because publicity could damage the chances of Mr Kevin Maxwell and others who are facing criminal charges from receiving a fair trial. However, Mr Justice Lindsay, the judge in the Credit Suisse case, ruled in favour of 10 national newspapers, including the Financial Times, which had opposed the proposed ban. In the civil case, the trustees of the Mirror Group Pension Scheme and the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the largest manager of the Maxwell pension funds, are suing Credit Suisse over its acceptance of pension fund assets as collateral for a Pounds 50m loan to the Robert Maxwell Group. They are arguing that Credit Suisse knew, or should have known, that the assets belonged to the pension funds. Both the SFO and lawyers for some of the defendants argued that the issues in the civil case overlapped with those that the jury in the criminal trial would have to consider. However, Mr Edward Bannister QC, for the newspapers, argued there was an important public interest in the Credit Suisse trial being reported. The case involved the conduct of leading institutions and whether they had overstepped certain commercial boundaries, he said. The Credit Suisse case is expected to end next summer - after the start of the first Maxwell trial scheduled for April.</p>

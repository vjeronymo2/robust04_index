			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (8): Banks start to catch up - The growth potential of the market 'WE ARE the 73rd bank in the country,' explains Mr Ibrahim Betil, chairman and chief executive of Bank Ekspres, a new Turkish bank which has just opened its doors in Istanbul's business district. Until last year, Mr Betil was general manager of Garanti Bankasi, one of Turkey's larger private sector banks. Then he decided to strike out on his own, raising Dollars 16m in capital from a group of like-minded private investors, a move which is something of a novelty in Turkey where private sector banks tend to be offshoots of an industrial empire owned by a single individual or family. Over the next five years his game plan is to target medium-sized corporate customers and the retail banking market and build up a branch network of between 40 and 50 branches, thereby establishing Bank Ekspres as one of the main players in the Turkish market. It is an extremely ambitious goal even for a banker who is already well-known in his own market. Mr Betil, however, is not alone in believing in the growth potential of the Turkish market where each year sees a few more hopefuls, usually one-branch trade finance boutiques, being granted banking licences. Why is there so much interest in a banking sector whose operating conditions, judged by the standards of the rest of the world, look extremely daunting? Because of Turkey's runaway inflation, interest levels are almost stratospheric. The inter-bank overnight interest rate at the end of April was 66.7 per cent. One-year retail deposits can earn up to 81 per cent from some banks and US dollar deposits 11 per cent. Corporate borrowers pay between 100 and 120 per cent. Borrowing rates have actually fallen in the last year because customers are hard to find. The margin may look still wide but it isn't. According to Mr Erol Sabanci, vice-chairman of Akbank, Turkey's most profitable bank, required reserves, taxes and staff costs eat up nine-tenths of every hundred lira held by a Turkish bank. 'Deposit costs are just not under control,' Mr Sabanci says. Banks make money not by lending but by holding treasury bonds or other operations of which trade finance is the most lucrative. There is, nevertheless, frantic competition for deposits, especially from the smaller banks. Deposit rate competition was introduced in Turkey in the late 1980s. Though the large banks currently pay between 71 and 73 per cent on one-year deposits (and between 55 and 60 per cent even on one-month money), the smaller banks can beat this by as much as six percentage points. Not surprisingly, once in a while savers get nervous in this market. In early January, savers lined up outside branches of one of the smaller Istanbul banks. The scare proved groundless and short-lived, but quite a few savers seem to have been willing to forgo a year's interest just to get their money back. There have been no actual bank failures since the first half of the 1980s, though the treasury monitors each bank's balance sheet and from time to time stages discreet operations to help banks out of trouble. There can also be other surprises. In mid-April, Ziraat, the state-owned agriculture bank which is Turkey's largest, abruptly moved its rates to depositors up by two percentage points, to the dismay of its main competitors, Akbank and Turkiye Is Bankasi. Just why Ziraat selected this moment to move seems to be something of a puzzle. Mr Sabanci identifies high operational costs and low working capital as chronic problems of the banking sector. In theory, all Turkish banks are now moving gradually towards the international standards set by the BIS for capital adequacy. In practice, the strengths of the banks are rather more difficult to assess. Ziraat this year has moved, for example, from being audited by the Turkish offshoot of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, to a small local accountancy house. Mr Sabanci points out that the capital bases of many of Turkey's larger banks look distinctly less impressive when real estate and equity holdings are deducted, though this is not a requirement under the BIS rules. The fact that the Turkish banking sector can be measured against international standards is, nevertheless, a sign of how far it has come in the last decade - and its success not just in piloting its way through a hyperinflationary environment, but also in coping with high levels of non-performing corporate debt throughout the 1980s. Though most banks are still owned by industrial groups, there are some changes in attitudes towards non-banking subsidiaries. Turkiye Is Bankasi, for example, has sold off stakes in three subsidiaries in the past two years, including most recently its stake in Unilever's Turkish offshoot, which went to the international parent company for an undisclosed price. Most of the infrastructure of a modern banking sector has been set in place, though foreign bankers identify some continuing weaknesses. 'Taxes on inter-bank transactions are still holding back the inter-bank market. With taxes on transactions and volumes, not on revenues, you do not get a deep inter-bank market and without that bankers cannot develop derivative products and sophisticated financial instruments to eliminate costs,' says one American bank in Istanbul. However, some parts of the banking sector are becoming much more like large banks in a modern country. Akbank, set up after World War II, has already overtaken the other large private sector and the public sector banks in profitability and will probably pass in them in asset size in a few more years. It has a notably less bureaucratic atmosphere than that which still prevails among some of its rivals. At one of Turkey's largest banks last month, the deputy chief executive folded his arms and confessed nervously to the Financial Times: 'I am just an appointed clerk. You can't expect me to be able to comment on anything.' But at the retail end of the market, changes are under way, driven by the emergence of a consumer middle class and expectations of higher standards of service than in the past. The dozen or so largest banks are developing modern cheque clearing and money transmission houses. An automated clearing house is being set up with a pilot stage in Istanbul which will offer clearing one day in Istanbul and three days across the entire country. A new inter-bank electronic funds transfer scheme began operating on April 1 for corporate and retail customers, and BKM, an inter-bank ATM network service, has also been launched. Turkey has virtually nothing in the way of credit reference services. So a limited debit card service which is being set up operates with all transactions being authorised by computer at the point of sale. Nevertheless, the plastic card market is growing rapidly. BKM expects that there will be around 10m cards, the vast majority of them cashcards for use in automatic teller machines, in circulation by the end of this year. That sort of rapid expansion, originally led by the Yapi ve Kredi bank, is proving to be more profitable than the other large banks expected.</p>

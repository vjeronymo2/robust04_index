This is an old Victorian mansion set in the foothills of the San  Gabriel Mountains. Red and green stained-glass windows. Seven fireplaces on  which to hang your stocking. A parlor for snoozing and schmoozing. This year  for the first time, proprietress Janice Ilsley has engaged a group of  performers to enact Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol." Premieres Dec. 24.  </P> <P> This Queen Anne-style home dates from 1904. Period antiques, a library  containing dozens of books. Afternoon tea served in the parlor.

The fireplace is lit. Snow is guaranteed. Sleigh rides, ski touring,  ice skating. Hot soup served in the dining room and a harpist to entertain  guests. The hosts will pack you a lunch for an all-day outing. They'll also  send you off in a horse-drawn sleigh. Sydna and Bill Zeliff were named  "Innkeepers of the Year."

Rates: $68/$90.  </P> <P> Sonoma Valley: In Northern California's Sonoma Valley, the historic El Dorado  Hotel has reopened under new ownership (same people who operate Auberge du  Soleil in Napa Valley and San Ysidro Ranch at Montecito). A first-class act.  Goose down comforters on the beds, terry-cloth robes for the guests. A heated  swimming pool. The hotel's 27 rooms face a Spanish courtyard and the town  square. The restaurant is a sister to the highly acclaimed Ristoranti Piatti in  Yountville.

Divides the nation  into 250-by-250-mile grids. By using Wurzman's "USAtlas" it's unnecessary to  possess a doctorate in cartography to get a fix on Seattle or San Francisco. Or  Savannah or Schenectady. Wurzman is the same guidester who created the city  Access guides. (In his "USAtlas" he reserves the margins for travel trivia.) No  table of contents. Just a cover map that slices up the nation into numbered  grids. Pick a number and turn to the page. It's as simple as that.  </P> <P> Published by Prentice-Hall: $12.95, paperback; $29.95, hardcover.

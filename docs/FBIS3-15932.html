			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] We've just received an urgent telegram in the  office. The Russian Federation Procurator General's office has  announced that on 11 March, acting Procurator General Ilyushenko  dropped the criminal case against the chemist Vil Mirzoyanov,  who was accused of divulging information that constituted a  state secret, owing to the absence of any corpus delicti in his  actions.    [Moscow INTERFAX in English at 2048 GMT on 10 March, in an  earlier report, adds: "Russian scientist Vil Mirzayanov, charged  with betraying a national secret, told Interfax on Thursday that  he would continue his efforts to end the development of new  chemical weapons in Russia." "Mirzayanov said Russia and other  nations continued devising new toxic substances, for that did  not contradict any international agreements. Thus, the Paris  Convention on the destruction of chemical weapons does not  mention new types of chemical arms, including binary weapons.  `As long as work goes on on new kinds of toxic substances I  will continue fighting whether I am arrested again or not," the  scientist said.'"]</p>

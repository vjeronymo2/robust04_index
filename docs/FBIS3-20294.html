			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Frankfurt/Main/Bonn (DPA) -- German Government  authorities are currently examining a Mannheim company that the  UN Sanctions Committee suspects of wanting to help Iraq  circumvent the economic sanctions imposed after the Gulf War,  according to FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG (FAZ). The Foreign  Ministry had passed all information on the enterprise "United  Oil Company" to the responsible authorities, it was reported in  Bonn on Tuesday [29 March]. According to Tuesday's FAZ, a firm  with only a post office box address is hidden behind the  enterprise.    According to the FAZ report, in February the Mannheim firm  applied for a permit for the delivery of almost 2 million tonnes  of foodstuffs and other goods valued at a total of $1.343  billion (2.3 billion German marks -- DM) to Iraq. The Foreign  Ministry passed this application on to the Sanctions Committee  for Iraq, "apparently, without having previously been briefed on  the business background of the enterprise mentioned," it was  further stated.    According to Foreign Ministry spokesman Michael Gerdts, his  ministry passed the export application on to the UN Sanctions  Committee in February, with the remark that the inner-German  authorization still has to be obtained. So far, however,  neither German authorities nor the UN committee has authorized  the delivery. The examination in the UN Sanctions Committee is  often lengthy. It serves the interests of the economy if  applications of this kind are initiated before the internal  control process -- among others, the Federal Export Office in  Eschborn near Frankfurt is responsible for it -- is concluded,  Gerdts said.    According to the FAZ, the enterprise allegedly wants to  export foodstuffs, soap, and other goods. The goods correspond  to the unusual amount of more than 50 shiploads. Moreover, it  is unusual that the post-office box number in Amman (Jordan)  given for the alleged interim addressee in the applications  turned out to be the address of a hotel chain. "Only hotel  guests who want to `cover up' that the receiver is a hotel guest  use this post-office box," the FAZ wrote.    The delivery list presented to the United Nations also  contained strange things. Several goods were to be procured at  unusual prices. For example, the enterprise wanted to export  100,000 tonnes of "cleansing soap" from German production at a  price of $4 (DM6.8) per tonne to Iraq. Since not even the  cheapest soap can be obtained at that price, one is now asking  whether the Mannheim enterprise really wants to procure the  specified goods, the FAZ writes.    Meanwhile, the United Nations has enough experience with  Iraq's ingenuity in order to achieve the release of the frozen  Iraqi foreign exchange. However, the Sanctions Committee for  Iraq will have to authorize the deal involving billions, "not  least because German authorities have refused to help so far,"  the FAZ wrote.

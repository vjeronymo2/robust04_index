			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report: from "NHK News: program] </F> <F P=106> [Interview with Kozo Watanabe, acting secretary general of </F> Shinseito, Japan Renewal Party, by unidentified NHK reporter at  the Shinseito headquarters in Tokyo -- live via satellite; from  the "NHK News" program]    [Text] [NHK] What do you think of Prime Minister Hata's  decision on the general resignation of his cabinet?    [Watanabe] I shed tears of regret. Mr. Hata has stressed the  need to push for political reform. He has asserted that  politicians must practice politics not for themselves, but for  the people, and they must place importance on the people over  themselves. This is a political belief that he has held for the  25 years of his career as a politician. Given his political  belief, it is natural for him to made that decision.    [NHK] I would like to ask you how the ruling coalition  parties plan to form a new coalition government after the Hata  cabinet resigns en masse. Will the ruling coalition parties  resume talks with the opposition Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ] to discuss the SDPJ's return to the ruling  coalition?    [Watanabe] The ruling coalition parties are continuing talks  with the SDPJ. The SDPJ's biggest demand is that the Hata  cabinet must resign en masse and then new political forces must  be rallied to form a new coalition government. The SDPJ and the  ruling coalition parties formed the Hosokawa government with the  aim of preparing Japan for the 21st century. The SDPJ voted for  Mr. Hata as prime minister in both houses of the Diet. The SDPJ  did not join the Hata cabinet for ceretain reasons. I have  confidence that the ruling coalition parties will continue talks  with the SDPJ about how to form a new coalition government in  order not to set Japan's politics back.    [NHK] How about the possibility of the ruling coalition  parties forging a coalition with the opposition Liberal  Democratic Party?    [Watanabe] In the news conference that was held just a while  ago, Prime Minister Hata stated: The industrial nations' summit  draws nearer. Political parties should not think only of their  interests and should place top priority on the people over  themselves. I hope that the next government will be formed in  tune with the will of the Diet.</p>

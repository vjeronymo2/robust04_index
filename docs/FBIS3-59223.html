But 1994 also  threatens to be a terrible year. Here is why.    In mid-November, Sister Maria Lucia Soncini gave in to the  Internal Revenue Service. "We were gathered together for our  spiritual exercises when I decided to take a bold step," said  this mother superior of 22 cloistered Dominican sisters of the  San Giuseppe nunnery in the town of Fontanellato (population  6,000, with one parish), 20 km from Parma. "There would be no  more Eucharist wafers for the local parishioners." She said the  taxes were to blame. "They wanted to make us open a VAT  [value-added tax] account, and they ordered us to have a cash  register. We would also be required to produce receipts and  invoices.... All because of 200,000 lire in sales per month. I  sought advice, and was told that this was more trouble than it  was worth. Then a fellow nun from a convent in Macerata told me  that for their wafers they had been fined 6 million lire, and I  thought: Where would I get such a sum? I made up my mind on the  spot. Enough is enough. No more holy wafers." Sister Maria Lucia  and the other nuns will henceforth prepare the Host only for  their own convent. "Now I want to see if they will also impose a  tax on homemade bread," she added.    Well, it would not be surprising if they did. An internal  revenue service--the only one in the world that dares to make  its citizens pay a tax of 100,000 lire (for opening a VAT  account) in order to collect other taxes--might well entertain  such an idea. Especially in these times. The year 1993 was the  annus horribilis [terrible year] of taxes, in which  the burden on individual citizens and firms underwent an  exceptionally sharp rise following a decade of sustained and  constant growth--the sharpest rise recorded in any of the  industrialized countries. In the meantime, however, the services  provided by the state neither increased nor improved, and  neither did the fight against tax evasion make any progress.    According to some economists--for example, Paolo Leon and  his  colleagues of the CLES [expansion not given] research  institute--the tax burden as a percentage of GDP grew by more  than 1.5 percent in 1993. Inasmuch as GDP has risen to more than  1.5 quadrillion lire, the computation is easily made. Individual  citizens and firms in 1993 paid over 20 trillion lire more in  taxes than they did the previous year.    It is an enormous sum. Until a few weeks ago, however,  Finance Minister Franco Gallo was declaring with pride that the  tax burden had actually been lighter in 1993 than during the 12  previous months: specifically, 1 percent lighter. Not even he is  making that claim any longer, however. On the afternoon of  Monday, 3 January, Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi reached  Gallo by telephone in Venice--where the finance minister was  vacationing--to agree on a statement concerning the progress  made with respect to taxes, in response to the thousand  controversies that had broken out the previous day. Gallo  suggested that it would be better to talk about the expectations  for 1994, the year when--the government promises--the tax burden  should decrease by 1.2 percent. This stated objective is at  variance, however, with rumors concerning an umpteenth fiscal  maneuver to be carried out next spring, and also with the  plethora of taxes large and small that were actually enacted  late last year and that the taxpayers will have to pay in 1994.    The government--and some newspapers--have called this  maneuver "the minimaneuver." Perhaps because it will impact a  populace that has already been hard hit--and perhaps also  because spirits are already overheated in anticipation of the  spring elections--it has caused an uproar. At the very beginning  of the year, Mario Segni lit the fuse by floating the idea of a  fiscal pact between the state and its citizens that would be  based on the imposition of "a strict freeze on the tax burden."  Segni is convinced that "a limit on the tax burden and on public  spending as a percentage of GDP must be established as a  constitutional norm, so that it cannot be circumvented."    It is an idea--welcomed by the moderate elements--that has  suddenly appeared to be the ideal adhesive to bind together a  center-right program for governing: an idea for which Silvio  Berlusconi--the publisher of PANORAMA (among other things) who  has now been projected onto the political stage--offered an  explanation. "It is not possible to improve public accounts by  increasing revenues without controlling spending." We should  abandon the old method and put a ceiling on taxes--a ceiling  written into law. "What we need," he explained, "is  constitutional norms to regulate the decisions made concerning  taxation and spending. We can no longer allow ourselves to sign  promissory notes."    Lega leader Umberto Bossi quickly gave his approval,  hastening to point out that he himself has been reiterating  these ideas for a long time. But the opposite front--the left  front--has been firing point-blank broadsides at the  Segni-Berlusconi proposal.    The harshest criticism has come from PDS [Democratic Party  of  the Left] leader Achille Occhetto. "It is a demagogic idea," he  said, "that resembles those propounded by petty South American  dictators. It is as if I--to win votes--were to promise that if  I won, I would hand out champagne and brioches to all Italians."  Writing in L'UNITA, Vincenzo Visco--who was finance minister for  a few hours in the Ciampi administration and is currently the  PDS expert on taxation--branded the concept of a ceiling on  taxes with similarly harsh words. "It is mere propaganda," he  said. Giorgio La Malfa, Ottaviano Del Turco, and a number of  economists are also on the same wavelength.    "One of the old evils of the financial left is surfacing,"  says Giulio Tremonti, one of Italy's best known tax experts,  "namely, the belief that reform of the public debt is possible  within the old framework represented by the current system of  taxation, whereas it is necessary to get rid of the entire  system." Bocconi University Rector Mario Monti and other  economists, while keeping their distance from the strident tones  of the controversy, have nonetheless welcomed the fact that the  political confrontation is finally moving toward concrete issues.    And it is hard to find anything more concrete than taxes. To  find new revenues in 1993, the government was compelled to  resort to three different economic maneuvers in only seven  months: in May; in September, on the occasion of the  introduction of the budget bill; and now, at year's end. Budget  Minister Luigi Spaventa has himself acknowledged that "taxes in  1993 reached levels that are truly unbearable." "For example,"  he pointed out, "we paid taxes on our homes two or three times."  In the year just ended, the measures enacted by the previous  government--that of Giuliano Amato--began to take effect,  starting with the drastic revision of the IRPEF [personal income  tax] rates that suddenly raised the tax burden on individuals to  the very high levels that prevailed before 1988.    The increase in the rates was by no means compensated by the  tax reduction on ownership of the first home or even the  reduction in the advance payment of the IRPEF to 95 percent from  98 percent, among other things because the Amato administration  had taken steps to thin out the deductions allowed. For example,  the ILOR (local income tax) is no longer deductible, and medical  expenses, insurance expenses, and interest paid on loans are  deductible to a lesser extent than in the past.    Even the VAT underwent repeated upward revisions during  1993,  the last of which came at year's end. The tax was raised to 13  percent from 12 percent on 17 classes of products ranging from  disks to corn flakes [preceding two words in English], from  ornamental plants to lobsters, and from certain articles of  clothing to shoes. It was reduced on five-star hotels to 13  percent from 19 percent, but compared to the other revisions  these are clearly of little significance, among other things  because in the financial maneuver of last May the government  provided that the advance VAT payments would be made even  earlier and would be raised to 90 percent from 60 percent. The  experts have calculated that the average rate of VAT increased  half a percentage point in one year--to 12 percent from 11.5  percent. In absolute terms, this represents an additional 2  trillion lire for the state coffers.    In the group of the five major taxes--i.e., those that yield  the most substantial percentages of the total of taxes  collected--only the IRPEG [corporate income tax] and ILOR were  not revised upward. There is talk of reducing the tax withheld  on bank interest, but for the time being it remains at 30  percent. In the meantime, those taxes that are technically  defined as "excise taxes" and that constitute the third source  of revenue--i.e., the taxes on gasoline, methane, and alcoholic  beverages--were also raised. In 1993, the minimum tax [preceding  two words in English] began to yield revenue: According to some  estimates, it produced approximately 4 trillion lire for the  state coffers, while the ICI--the municipal real estate  tax--yielded 14 trillion.    But it was not just the major taxes. It was also a year to  forget as far as minor taxes were concerned. For example, the EC  directive "on the subject of the exemption of dividends from the  income tax levied on mother-daughter companies" was received in  March. Whereas in all the European countries minimum thresholds  of participation were established to determine when a company  may be regarded as a "daughter" company--with the aim of  facilitating the exemption to the maximum possible extent--in  Italy the very high threshold of 25 percent was chosen. "It is a  self-destructive measure," comments Enrico Nuzzo, professor of  tax law at the University of Naples. "You not only do not  attract foreign capital and foreign companies in this manner,  but you also do not halt the exodus of Italian capital and  Italian enterprises."    If 1993 made the taxpayers cry, 1994 is making them tremble.  No sooner had the end-of-the-year maneuver been executed than  rumors began to circulate to the effect that another maneuver  would be necessary immediately after the elections, obviously  accompanied by the usual tax increases. Even Undersecretary of  Finance Stefano De Luca and Raffaello Lupi, tax expert and  adviser to Finance Minister Gallo, do not deny this. "One cannot  rule out the possibility of an adjustment in the spring designed  to plug other holes in the tax structure; to thwart tax evasion  strategies; and at the same time to grant tax relief, as for  example with respect to taxes on company profits that are  reinvested." Hypotheses are already being advanced as to the  measures that might be taken: for example, more stringent laws  relating to transactions conducted entirely abroad by Italian  companies and relating to mergers among companies.    This does not mean that the category of unearned income has  been overlooked. At the very end of the year, the government  decided to introduce a bill that would delegate to the executive  branch the power to tax profits from the sale of stock. The  subject is an extremely delicate one, and there is danger that  the Internal Revenue Service will for the umpteenth time score a  goal against its own team. The tax experts are urging caution.  "Targeting income from financial sources at this time," they  say, "would amount to opening the doors to a massive flight of  capital." And that is precisely what is not needed.  <H5>  [Box, p 148] </H5> <H5>  Famous Next to the Last Words </H5>   "I believe that legal mechanisms should be introduced that  would automatically reduce the deficit to zero and keep it  there." Who is speaking? Is it Silvio Berlusconi, Mario Segni,  or Umberto Bossi? Or some new standard bearer of the  center-right alliance that is now being formed? Not at all;  these words were spoken in 1988 by Antonio Maccanico, who today  is under secretary of the office of prime minister in an  administration that has been firing incendiary shells at the  proposal that would put a ceiling on the tax burden--by means of  a constitutional amendment, if necessary--with the aim of  holding down spending and continuing the efforts to balance the  national budget.    In an interview he granted to L'EUROPEO six years ago,  Maccanico was explicit on the subject of ceilings. "Governmental  reform," he said, "must also extend to the sector of the public  finances by amending not only the laws and regulations now in  effect but--if necessary--the Constitution as well." And he  added: "The time has come to regard controlling the national  budget as an institutional emergency." Are these ideas  extemporaneous, thought out in solitude? Not at all. During the  interview, Maccanico declared that his convictions were also  shared by the Bank of Italy, which was at that time headed by  the very same Carlo Azeglio Ciampi who is the current prime  minister.    In Maccanico's opinion, the guiding principle for initiating  the reform process should have been a measure modeled on the  Gramm-Rudman Act, a law introduced in 1985 by the Reagan  administration to balance the budget. "The basic principle of  that mechanism," Maccanico declared, "should be imitated, which  is to make the Parliament and the government legally obligated  to pursue the goal of balancing the government's books."

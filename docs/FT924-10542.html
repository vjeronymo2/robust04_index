			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Currency jitters focus on Unilever swap option - The difficult decisions behind the switch strategy on Anglo-Dutch shares STERLING'S downward roller-coaster slide in recent weeks has sent fund managers reaching for their computer models and calculators to gauge the potential for switching shares issued in pounds and guilders by Unilever and Shell, the Anglo-Dutch groups. The subject has acquired added importance in recent weeks following the announced merger of Reed International and Elsevier, the British and Dutch publishing groups. Investors have eagerly awaited further details of the merger, particularly since exchange rate turmoil has probably made it harder for the two to reconcile the values of the Dutch and UK businesses. Reed might reveal more information with its results today. The decision to switch from one stock to the other is not an easy one, with several factors to take into account. While the arguments are basically the same for both groups, the recent experience of Unilever highlights the problems. It has been estimated that about 5 per cent of the stock has been swapped. Earlier this month, several institutions switched from Dutch shares in Unilever NV to UK shares in Unilever PLC as sterling tumbled. They believed that Unilever earnings per share, as expressed in sterling, would grow faster due to favourable overseas earnings. Some brokers, however, caution that currency considerations are only one aspect of the switching argument. They say this is demonstrated by NV's shares outperforming LC. As the accompanying chart shows, the PLC shares have been running at a 5-10 per cent premium to their NV equivalent for most of 1992, sustained by a combination of greater liquidity, sterling's membership of the ERM - pre-mid September - and the periodic outperformance of the London market relative to the Amsterdam bourse. This led to successive bouts of switching from the PLC to the NV's, particularly as the PLC's premium to the latter crept up towards the 10 per cent mark. PLC has also been subject to individual shocks, for example the Tory election victory in April which boosted the premium from about 5 to 9 per cent. Sterling's exit from the ERM had the reverse effect. If the difference between the two shares is less than 3 per cent, then most brokers agree that the switch is uneconomical. But beyond that there is differing opinion as when to consider the move. 'There is no precise science in this,' says Mr John Campbell, food manufacturing analyst at County NatWest and a former head of investor relations at Unilever. 'It is a combination of several key components, of which currency is only one.' Dividend yield is often cited as one of the fundamental considerations behind a switch decision and sterling's recent nosedive has made Unilever's interim dividend payment - to be announced next week - all the more pertinent. Merchant bank Robert Fleming says that, in light of the sterling crisis and the company's method of equalising dividend payments between its two sets of shareholders, NV shares are likely to enjoy a better yield than the PLCs. Under the equalisation agreement - with 3 NV shares equal to 20 PLC shares - the interim dividend is calculated by the average exchange rate during the third quarter. Fleming calculates that at an average rate of Pounds 1:Fl 3.14 in the company's third quarter, and assuming that the NV dividends are raised in line with market expectations of profits of about 3.3 per cent, PLC shareholders could see a 10 per cent rise in their interim dividend to 5.5p. But at rates on the date of dividend declaration (assuming no big shift from today's 2.76), PLC dividends would be 9 per cent lower than those being paid to NV shareholders. Taxation is another factor. Gross UK funds, such as pension funds, which hold NV shares are subject to a 15 per cent Dutch withholding tax on dividends. Life funds face a corporate tax of 33 per cent, while UK mutual funds must pay a 25 per cent levy. While not quite the same, it is a similar story for Dutch investors holding PLC shares. And while gross funds at first glance look good to switch, both UK and Dutch investors tend to favour the PLCs and NVs respectively because they can only reclaim their domestic witholding tax. For US investors, the vexed question of taxation faced by most of their European counterparts is simpler. They are subject to the same 15 per cent witholding tax in both PLC and NV shares; a tax neutral situation making their ability to switch easier. Not surprisingly, it is from the US that most switching originates. US investors, who trade both NV and PLC shares in New York, now hold some 20 per cent of Unilever equity. And with the continued strength of the Dutch guilder relative to sterling, some observers believe that US investors may prefer to take the NV route to Unilever as the uncertain economic outlook persists, closing down the PLC premium. As the gap persists, fund managers continue to plot sterling's plight with added interest. Mr Carl Short, food analyst at Nomura, said: 'Currency is very much a double-edged sword when it comes to switching. When sterling depreciates against other currencies, there is a translation gain which benefits the group's earnings per share growth when expressed in sterling terms. 'However, the positive impact of this on the PLC share price needs to be set against the relative capital disadvantage of holding a sterling asset.' It has been a similar story at Shell, where the Dutch shares have been at a premium to the UK shares, which trade as Shell Transport. Black Wednesday sent Royal Dutch to a temporary high premium of 11 per cent from about 6 per cent. Arbitrageurs bought into Shell Transport and narrowed the gap.</p>

Offers have to be in by Monday and the suspense is getting unbearable. Will the entrepreneur drop in by balloon, perhaps? Apart from the fact that his wife is not keen on him ballooning, the streets off London's Haymarket where the Office of the National Lottery is found are a bit too narrow even for a daredevil like Branson. No, the word is that Branson will deliver his bid on Desert Orchid, the legendary racehorse known as The People's Choice . . .</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 6 May (INA)--The newspaper AL-'IRAQ has  said the coalition forces' silence on the massacres of Iraq's  Kurds, represented by the conflict between the Talabani and  Barzani groups, exposes the false humanitarian slogans  Washington and its allies used as a cover to enter into  Kurdistan.    In its editorial today, the paper emphasizes that the  continued annihilation of Kurds in the fierce and ongoing  confrontations between the Jalal Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani  groups sheds light on the serious conspiracy concocted by the  colonialist and Zionist circles against Iraq and its people.    AL-'IRAQ adds that the comprehensive and large-scale  fighting  between the Talabani and Barzani gangs reflects the miserable  situation created by the erroneous circumstances in the absence  of order and law in the area.    The paper wonders about foreign forces' role in confronting  the scandals and terrible crimes to which the sons of Kurdistan  are being subjected. These forces came on the pretext of  immediately intervening and protecting the Kurds, if they are  subjected to any military operation.    Suffice it to say that turning a blind eye to the ongoing  massacres of Iraq's Kurds is a flagrant war against the Kurds  targeting their lives, existence, fate, and their future, the  paper notes.    AL-'IRAQ describes the position of the foreign forces, which  are idly watching the slaughtering of Iraq's Kurds at the hands  of the Talabani and Barzani gangs, as a new formula of  imperialist-Zionist hypocrisy and a form of intrigue, lies,  distortion, falsification, reversal of realities, and  concealment of facts away from the world public opinion.</p>

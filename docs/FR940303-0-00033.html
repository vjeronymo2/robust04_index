			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations provide that a taxpayer does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have carryover-allocation basis in a project unless, by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> close of the calendar year of allocation, the taxpayer is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner, for federal income tax purposes, of land or depreciable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> real property expected to be part of the project. The final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations do not explicitly contain this requirement. After  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further consideration, the IRS believes that satisfaction of the requirements of &sect;1.42&hyph;6 is sufficient to ensure that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer intends to complete a qualified low-income housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project. For example, if a taxpayer has basis in land or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depreciable property that is reasonably expected to be part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a project and the requirements of &sect;1.42&hyph;6 are otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfied, the taxpayer has carryover-allocation basis with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to the land or depreciable property. This basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes all items that are properly capitalizable with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to the land or depreciable property. Thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notwithstanding the rule in Notice 89&hyph;1 to the contrary, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonrefundable downpayment for, or an amount paid to acquire an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option to purchase, land or depreciable property may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in carryover-allocation basis if properly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capitalizable into the basis of land or depreciable property  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is reasonably expected to be part of a project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commentators objected to the exclusion of credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application fees from carryover-allocation basis and requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the final regulations permit these fees to be included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carryover-allocation basis. On further consideration, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appears that an absolute prohibition against the inclusion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application fees (and compliance monitoring fees, which were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also not included) in carryover-allocation basis is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warranted. Accordingly, the final regulations subject credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application and compliance monitoring fees to the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards imposed upon other fees under the regulations. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, if a fee is properly capitalizable as part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer's basis in land or depreciable property that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably expected to be part of a project, the fee is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in carryover-allocation basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Verification of Basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations provide verification requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and procedures that an Agency must follow to ensure that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum basis requirement that is required to be met by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> close of the year of allocation is, in fact, met. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commentator suggested that the basis verification requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are too burdensome to Agencies and that Agencies lack the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expertise to verify the costs includible in basis. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IRS does not expect Agencies to audit projects or make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legal determinations. Rather, the proposed regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide that an Agency may verify the basis requirement by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring the taxpayer to obtain a certification from an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attorney or certified public accountant that the taxpayer has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incurred the minimum required basis by the close of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calendar year of allocation. Accordingly, the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations adopt the basis verification requirement of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

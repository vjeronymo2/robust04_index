			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENT AT THE CROSSROADS;  </P> <P> THE COASTLINE: DEBATING DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE SHORES;  </P> <P> PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE COAST, WHICH EBBS AND FLOWS, IS AGAIN ON THE RISE.;  </P> <P> ASSAULT ON NATURE AT THE EDGE OF THE OCEAN  </P> <P> For any Californians who still think the creation of the Coastal Commission in  1972 stopped view-robbing coastal development, assured ever-widening access to  beaches and generally preserved a flawless future for the state's legendary  shoreline, Judith Rosener has some bad news. California's coast -- in some way,  its metaphorical soul -- still is in danger of being swallowed up by developers  on one side and by erosion on the other, and what remains is often befouled by  garbage left by swimmers and sunbathers or washed ashore from ships at sea.  </P> <P> "Sometimes I wish there wasn't (a Coastal Commission)," said Rosener, a former  coastal commissioner who now teaches at the UC Irvine Graduate School of  Management, "because people still think that they are being protected." But as  Rosener sees it, they're not. In many ways, the commission -- resisted by local  governments, manipulated by the Legislature and undermined by Gov. George  Deukmejian -- is failing.  </P> <P> After celebrating a glorious sunset at Zuma or Laguna, it may be difficult to  imagine the coast in serious peril. But that is only because so many people  spend so much time and so much money preserving the pretty picture. In a real  sense, the relatively clean and readily accessible broad and sandy beaches of  California's coast are nearly as much a product of image-making as Disneyland.  The "imagineering" ranges from workers toiling to stop erosion in Oceanside and  preservationists fighting the loss of open shoreline in Irvine to laborers  combing 11 tons of trash each day from Los Angeles County beaches and planners  scrambling to preserve the monarch butterfly habitat north of Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Long-Term Needs  </P> <P> Public interest in the coast, which ebbs and flows wildly, is once again on the  rise. But the problems menacing the coast today are the products of nature and  human nature -- two forces supremely resistant to good intentions. Real  solutions will require patience. "This can't be a one-night stand," said Bob  Hattoy of the Sierra Club. "This has to be a long-term relationship."  </P> <P> Development has, is, and will be the politically stickiest problem, and the  pressure is greatest in Los Angeles and Orange counties. The two counties have  only 10% of California's coastline but create 50% of its coastal development  applications -- more than 1,000 a year. About 90% of those are approved by the  state Coastal Commission, even though Los Angeles and Orange are the two  slowest counties to comply with the Coastal Act of 1976. Neither has prepared a  local coastal plan that complies with that law, nor have some of their biggest  beach cities -- Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Torrance and Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> "In some of the Orange County (cities), they just told us to go fly a kite  (when plans were sought)," said Gary Holloway, who oversees the Local Coastal  Plan approval process for the commission. "Under the law, there is nothing we  can do." The Coastal Commission's authority has indeed slumped mightily since  the late 1970s, when it could dictate the color of homeowners' cottages or the  rates of innkeepers' rooms. Now the commission is so understaffed it sometimes  enlists high-school-age volunteers to look for banned development, even though  the agency lacks the legal power to immediately stop any illegality it finds.  </P> <P> Deukmejian has made no secret of his desires to do away with the commission  entirely, but coastal protection still is too popular with voters. Instead, he  has bled the commission's budget by 40% since 1982, a tactic Sierra Club  lobbyist Paula Carrell called "death by a thousand (budget) cuts." Gordon Hart  of the Sierra Club goes further, blaming the governor for inhibiting the  Legislature from addressing any coastal problems. "Nobody is proposing any new  (coastal) legislation," Hart said, "because they know he will veto it."  </P> <P> The governor's office acknowledges rigid ideological opposition to the idea of  turning local land-use planning decisions over to non-elected commissioners in  Sacramento, despite voter approval of that very idea in 1972. But spokesman  Kevin Brett insists the governor thinks that the commission's current problems  are its own fault. The commission missed its original 1981 coast-plan deadline  long before Deukmejian was elected, and has never caught up, Brett noted. After  13 years, only 56% of the local coastal plans have been certified. Funds were  cut because "the commission has just not done its job," Brett said. How will  the commission ever be able to catch up without money and without support from  the governor? Brett does not say.  </P> <P> In some areas, a kind of anarchy results. Developers bulldoze illegal roads in  the Malibu hills with little fear of discovery, much less punishment. Fines  levied for unlawful construction are shrugged off as just another cost of doing  business. Malibu residents use subterfuge -- opposing a sewer -- to arrest  growth. Laguna Niguel residents sidestep local elected officials and negotiate  directly for concessions from builders of a $300-million Monarch Beach resort.  UCLA environmental law professor Henry W. McGee Jr. contends tax-starved local  governments approve many coastal projects for the new taxes they generate, and  any other public interest be damned. "This is a statewide resource, but it is  not really being managed as such," he said. The usually sad result, said Fern  Pirkle of the Friends of the Irvine Coast, is that "you drive along PCH (the  Pacific Coast Highway) and you can hardly see the beach any more."  </P> <P> But, grass-roots action can wring compromises from cooperative developers that  reduce the loss of open space and views. A 20-year battle over the Irvine Coast  -- the last remaining big undeveloped stretch of Orange County coast --  recently ended with the Irvine Co. agreeing to scale back its housing-and-hotel  project to avoid developing three-fourths of the property, including most of  the land on the beach side of Pacific Coast Highway.  </P> <P> Erosion, on the other hand, is not easily resolved by either negotiation or  legislation. It is mostly a product of human interference in natural processes  of sand replenishment -- and it worsens with each seawall erected to contain  it. Fully 86% of the California shore is now eroding, some by as much as 10  feet a year.  </P> <P> Erosion itself is a natural process in which tides and winter storms siphon  sand off beaches and deposit it in deep submarine canyons all along the coast,  including one particularly deep trench off La Jolla. Normally, that erosion is  repaired by sand swept in by mild summer currents or carried in by rivers. But  harbors, jetties and seawalls block coastal sand flow, and the U.S. Army Corps  of Engineers has said that dams cut the river replenishment by two-thirds. Now  when a winter storm eats away at a beach, people must restore it. "We tend to  think of the sandy beach as the natural condition, but much of it (in Southern  California) is man-made," said Bill S. Satow, assistant director of the state  Department of Boating and Waterways.  </P> <P> Man-made means man-maintained, as Oceanside has found out. Oceanside Harbor  acts as a sump for sand pushed by summer currents, causing the marina to shoal  and a nearby beach to starve. City officials have responded with a $12-million  "sand bypass system" that vacuums up sand from the harbor and pipes it in a  seawater slurry to the beach. Other cities, such as Long Beach, dabble with  synthetic seaweed, which supposedly grabs sand suspended in the water before it  is carried out to sea. Los Angeles County uses the direct approach: moving  thousands of tons of sand to eroded beaches from an oceanfront construction  site. "The bottom line," said Gregory Woodell, a supervising planner at the  county Department of Harbors and Beaches, "is that if man wants a beach, he is  going to have to continually replace the sand that is being taken away."  </P> <P> Trash, as any veteran beach-goer will attest, is no less irritating a blight  than either development or erosion. But because it can include such flotsam as  used hypodermic needles and rusty scrap metal, it poses an even more immediate  threat.  </P> <P> A beach cleanup effort last year found California's shore tidier than most, but  still burdened by a lot of garbage -- 100 tons on a single day. The haul was  greater in urban areas, where the beaches do not usually have 5,700 volunteers  to sift refuse from sand. Only 69 trash collectors typically tidy up Los  Angeles County beaches, which receive 4,000 tons of garbage each year. Unknown  tonnage washes out with the tide, killing wildlife that eats or strangles in  it.  </P> <P> Another problem is storm drains, which routinely belch out garbage, oil and  "almost everything imaginable," said Dorothy Green of the Santa Monica-based  environmental group Heal the Bay. Sewage spills from exploded pipes frequently  make TV news and close beaches, which is bad enough, but smaller leaks may be  more common -- and often go unnoticed until plastic tampon applicators appear  on the beach. Equally scary are potentially infectious medical wastes, such as  the syringes and vials of blood that washed onto San Diego County beaches last  winter.  </P> <P> Most often, however, beach trash is humdrum. Almost half of what was picked up  in last year's national beach cleanup was plastic, and most of the rest was  such picnic leavings as glass bottles and metal bottle caps. So if the beaches  are going to improve, beach-goers themselves must repent. Abandoning a used cup  or foam ice chest may seem inoffensive, but Don Feinstein of the Venice Action  Committee asserts "the stuff is so fragile that it just dissolves and becomes  part of the beach." Indeed, the beach veteran complains that every handful of  Venice Beach sand contains the ubiquitous plastic pebbly remnants of foam cups  and insulation. It is the final insult for our beleaguered beaches.  </P> <P> </P> <P> REPORT CARD  </P> <P> Average score: 6  </P> <P> Three views on our progress, rated on a one to 10 scale  </P> <P>  * Fern Pirkle, Friends of the Irvine Coast: "The Coastal Act has been  moderately successful; I'm reasonably pleased with what has happened. But so  much is still being built right on the coast . . ." Score: 6  </P> <P> * Melvin Nutter, lawyer and former Coastal Commission chairman: "It's a mixed  bag . . . In terms of wetland protection, it looks like we're going to do  better than just a few years ago (but) as population pressures continue and as  more people act to maximize their short-term return, the (development) battle  will go on and on." Score: 7  </P> <P> * Ann Nutthoff, Natural Resources Defense Council: "You have a lot of valuable  resources; some have been seriously degraded and the rest are endangered . . .  Coastal access has not kept up with population growth (and) we're still  allowing too much development, but at least it's sited more sensitively than in  the past." Score: 5  </P> <P> </P> <P> TURNING POINTS  </P> <P> * January, 1990 -- Gov. George Deukmejian to submit his 1991 budget plan,  including critical funding for the California Coastal Commission; the  Legislature and preservationists to seek an increase to make up for heavy cuts  in the past, but Deukmejian is resisting.  </P> <P> * Early 1990 -- California Coastal Commission to seek some way to enforce state  regulations against illegal development. Such work goes virtually unchecked now  because builders often can finish a job before overworked commission inspectors  can obtain court orders to stop them.  </P> <P> * Mid-1990 -- Proposal to substantially expand Los Angeles and Long Beach  harbors will require special planning to save valuable but fast-dwindling  coastal wetland wildlife habitat from dredging, filling or other environmental  degradation.  </P> <P> * November, 1990 -- Election of new governor is expected to end an eight-year  legislative and regulatory logjam blamed on Deukmejian, whose antipathy for the  Coastal Commission has stymied enactment of new coastal rules and enforcement  of old safeguards.  </P> <P> </P> <P> VOICES  </P> <P> "The environment, generally, is healthier on the beach than even a few blocks  inland. It's a critical resource . . . The water quality has changed somewhat,  and there's a problem with potential oil spills from the oil islands and  tankers. But there are days when you can see 20 feet or more into the water . .  . And unlike the county's hills and canyons, everybody has access to the  beach."  </P> <P>  -- Lifeguard Capt. Bill Richardson of the Huntington Beach Marine Safety  Department  </P> <P> "This town has just exploded . . . You think they're running out of land and  then they sell off the hills with all of those citrus trees that you see up  there. . . . It's really hard to imagine what they're going to do to (the  coast) but I assume that by the time my grandchildren are grown that it will be  solid from Santa Barbara to L.A. I don't think there's any doubt of that."  </P> <P>  -- Elizabeth Fortner, a homeowner in Summerland in Santa Barbara County  </P> <P> </P> <P> POPULATION DENSITY  </P> <P> Chart shows population growth in five selected cities along the Southern  California coastline. Figures indicate number of persons per square mile in the  years 1960 and 1988, and percentage of growth in that time period.  </P> <P> Development of California's coastline in recent years has resulted in some of  the state's most spectacular population growth and created some of its most  densely packed areas.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P> <P> 1960: 2,983  </P> <P> 1988: 4,202  </P> <P> Percent growth: 41%  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach  </P> <P> 1960: 11,511  </P> <P> 1988: 14,522  </P> <P> Percent growth: 26%  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P> <P> 1960: 500  </P> <P> 1988: 7,219  </P> <P> Percent growth: 1,344%  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P> <P> 1960: 1,040  </P> <P> 1988: 2,180  </P> <P> Percent growth: 110%  </P> <P> Oceanside  </P> <P> 1960: 889  </P> <P> 1988: 2,557  </P> <P> Percent growth: 188%  </P> <P> Source: U.S. Census  </P> <P> </P> <P> BEACH CLOSURES  </P> <P> Beach closures in Southern California coastline counties that were caused by  sewage contamination.  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.55IN:1.56IN:1.56IN:1.67IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> COUNTY  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Los Angeles  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 12  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Orange  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 12  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> San Diego  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> N/A  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 79  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 30  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Santa Barbara  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Ventura  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> *NOTE: 1989 figures from January to Aug. 31.  </P> <P> SOURCES: L.A.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Process Equipment Changes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Process equipment changes also may constitute modifications. Examples of potential modifications are replacing a fixed-bed reactor with a fluidized-bed reactor, increasing the plant capacity by increasing the size of the reactor or adding additional reactors, and changing the product recovery system (e.g., from an absorber to a condenser). Such changes might be considered modifications because they can result in increased VOC emissions. Again, capital expenditures may be a factor in determining whether the change is a modification or a reconstruction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Combinations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A combination of the changes described above could be chosen in any given situation with the decision based on the most advantageous economics for the site-specific conditions. The combination of changes might be considered a modification if they resulted in an increase in emissions. The most common combinations are plant expansions or simultaneous changes in feedstock and catalyst as described earlier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Reconstruction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An existing facility may become subject to NSPS if it is reconstructed. Reconstruction is defined in &sect;60.15 as the replacement of the components of an existing facility to the extent that: (1) The fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost required to construct a comparable new facility; and (2) it is technically and economically feasible for the facility to meet the applicable standards. Because the EPA considers reconstructed facilities to constitute new construction rather than modification, reconstruction determinations are made irrespective of changes in emission rates. If the facility is determined to be reconstructed, it must comply with all of the provisions of the standards of performance applicable to that facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Monitoring Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed standards include requirements for continuous monitoring to ensure that owners suppress and capture emissions from the process unit wastewater collection system, treat the wastewater to reduce the VOC concentration, and convey emission from the wastewater collection and treatment to a control device as specified in the regulation. The specific parameters that need to be monitored are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Enhanced monitoring is required for certain control device parameters to demonstrate compliance with the standards. Failure to maintain the established values of the monitored parameters would be an enforceable violation of the emission limits of the standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Wastewater Collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The standards require monitoring to ensure that the wastewater collection system equipment, which includes tanks, surface impoundments, containers, and drain systems, is operated with no detectable leaks. The standards require owners or operators to monitor initially using Method 21 to demonstrate that the system has no detectable leaks according to the procedures in the rule. The standards also include a requirement for semi-annual visual inspection of the wastewater collection system to detect and repair any leaks in the individual drain system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Wastewater Treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulation requires each owner or operator using a steam stripper to comply with the design and equipment standard specified for wastewater treatment processes to install, calibrate, operate, and maintain according to manufacturers' specifications continuous monitors with continuous recorders of:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The mass rate of wastewater fed to the stripper;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The mass rate of steam fed to the stripper; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The wastewater column feed temperature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These parameters are either established during an initial performance test or according to design specification in the regulation. They are typically monitored in the industry to ensure proper operation; therefore, ensuring continuous compliance of a steam stripper with the specified requirements for VOC removal requires no additional monitoring burden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Owners or operators using a biological treatment unit to achieve a 95-percent total VOC reduction across the unit are required to measure the volatile organic concentration in the influent and effluent on a monthly basis and identify appropriate parameters to be monitored to ensure continuous compliance. These parameters must be determined during the initial performance test as demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction, and monitored accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Enclosure and Closed-vent System Monitoring Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule establishes requirements to ensure that negative pressure is maintained on enclosures and that emissions are routed through a closed-vent system with no detectable leaks. If the closed-vent system contains bypass lines, the proposed standards require the owner or operator to ensure emissions are not bypassing the control device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An initial performance test must be conducted to ensure that negative pressure is maintained on all openings of each enclosure, and a monthly inspection must be performed to confirm that any enclosure openings that were closed during the performance test remain closed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure continuous compliance with the requirement of no detectable leaks from the enclosure and closed-vent system, monitoring with a portable hydrocarbon detector is required to be performed initially along with a program of annual visible inspections of ductwork, piping, and connections to covers for evidence of visible defects. If visible defects in the closed-vent system are observed, readings greater than 500 ppm by volume above background are measured, or enclosure openings do not have negative pressure, a first effort to repair the closed-vent system must be made as soon as practicable and no later than 5 calendar days after identification of the problem. The repair must be completed no later than 15 calendar days after identification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure the control device is not being bypassed if bypass lines are present, owners or operators must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to manufacturer's instructions a flow indicator that provides a record of emission point gas stream flow at least once every 15 minutes. As an alternative, the proposed rule allows bypass lines to be sealed in the closed position and visually inspected to ensure they are being maintained in the closed position. The use of flow indicators or seals on the bypass lines ensures that process vent streams are continuously being routed to the control device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Control Device Monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of enhanced monitoring is to provide a means for major sources to demonstrate that the affected facility is in continuous compliance with the standards. In light of these requirements, the EPA has considered how sources subject to the NSPS would demonstrate continuous compliance with standards for SOCMI process unit wastewater. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

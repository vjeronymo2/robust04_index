			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Insurers under pressure SHARES IN two of the UK's leading composite insurance groups, Commercial Union and Royal Insurance, were roughly handled, with one of the London market's leading agency broking houses said to have adopted a bearish view, saying that the companies could be liable for pollution claims arising from a court decision in New Jersey in the US. Other insurance specialists professed surprise at the market's reaction to the story. 'The case is a month old and well known in the US. There are negatives but there is no need for the companies to change their provisions.' It was also pointed out that the US insurance stocks had hardly been troubled by the news. 'They've been zooming up ever since. It's a bit odd that the UK stocks have reacted in such a fashion,' said one observer. Commercial Union shares dropped to 611p early in the session, before stabilising and settling a net 7 off at 614p after above average turnover of 2.5m. Royal Insurance slipped to 317p but rallied to close a net 8 cheaper at 318p, with turnover reaching a much higher than usual 5.3m shares.</p>

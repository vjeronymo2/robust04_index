			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Caracas approves two oil projects THE Venezuelan Congress has approved two oil projects worth a total of Dollars 4.8bn (Pounds 3.2bn), in which international investors will play an important role. The two joint ventures involve the production, upgrading and international placement of heavy crude oil from Venezuela's Orinoco Belt, the world's largest accumulation of heavy oil and bitumen. In both projects, the Venezuelan partner will be Maraven, a subsidiary of Venezuela's national oil company, PDVSA. Conoco, a unit of EI du Pont de Nemours, will hold 49.9 per cent equity in one project that calls for total expenditures of Dollars 1.7bn. The promoters plan to produce 120,000 barrels per day of heavy crude oil and use a delayed coking process to make lighter crude that can be processed by a Conoco refinery in the US. Maraven will also have 49.9 per cent equity. In the other project, which has a projected cost of Dollars 3.1bn, the international partners will be France's Total and two Japanese companies, Itochu and Marubeni. At present, Total is expected to have 40 per cent of equity, Maraven 35 per cent and two Japanese partners 25 per cent. Maraven said the equity composition of the projects could change if new international partners were added. On August 10, the Congress opened the door to foreign investment in Venezuela's oil and gas industries for the first time since the 1976 nationalisation.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Mozart for the masses: Antony Thorncroft tunes in to Classic FM's launch Anyone running through the wavelengths of their radio in recent months will have been startled to come across a channel, at around the 100 spot on FM, which seems to broadcast nothing but bird-song. From 6am on September 7, the birds disappear but the songs remain, supplemented by symphonies, concertos and string quartets. Classic FM, which claims to be the largest commercial radio station in the world, will take to the airwaves. It is certainly the first land-based commercial station to cover the UK, or rather 80 per cent of the country initially. Next year it will be joined by a national pop channel, but in the meantime it has the opportunity to attract Britain's growing band of classical music listeners. The arias and melodies used in television commercials have captured the imagination of a substantial segment of the population. Puccini's aria 'Nessun dorma', the signature tune of the 1990 World Cup, topped the record charts. John Spearman, the former chairman of CDP, the advertising agency, who is chief executive of Classic FM, expects to tempt 7 per cent of the population to listen to the new channel for up to six hours a week. He has already persuaded advertisers like W H Smith and Time magazine (both of which have never used the medium before) to buy spots. Despite the deep recession in the advertising industry, Spearman is surprised to be above budget targets and expects perhaps Pounds 4m in advertising revenues in the first year. For clients, the attraction is the audience of affluent spenders which is expected to be drawn to the station. But perhaps an even bigger surprise is that Classic FM is taking to the airwaves at all. When the Radio Authority sought bids for the licence last September, Classic FM's offer of Pounds 6m was beaten by Sir Peter Parker's Show Time station, with a format of middle-of-the-road music. But then Show Time fell victim to economic pessimism and withdrew. Classic FM, funded mainly by Sir Peter Michael, chairman of Cray Electronics, and Time-Warner, which share 70 per cent of the equity, won the day. A frantic start-up operation then ensued. It produced studios in an underground boiler-room at Camden Lock; a library of 6,000 CDs; and a team of announcers better known for their broadcasting experience than their love of classical music. The main morning slot is taken by Irishman Henry Kelly, familiar as a TV host, while the equally important drive-home programme will be in the care of Margaret Howard, whose removal from BBC Radio 4's 'Pick of the Week' caused a middle-class uproar. Classic FM will not stretch the listeners' mental powers too much. The morning wake-up programme will play short - seven-minute or so - selections of favourite tunes, with the musical pieces getting longer throughout the day. Many programmes will be sponsored, including the weather and traffic reports, and live broadcasts will be limited to the occasional recital, although members of the LSO have been contracted to perform regularly throughout the first year. Although advertising revenue is higher than forecast, Classic FM still faces a tough financial future. It must recoup the Pounds 5m cost of installing its transmitters; it must pay the Radio Authority an annual licence fee of Pounds 650,000, plus a small percentage of its revenue; and it has yet to conclude negotiations over royalty payments to record companies and artists. But Spearman is optimistic that in four years income will be Pounds 16m-plus and the station will be profitable. Whatever its long-term achievements, Classic FM can claim at least one short-term victory. It has lit a fuse under the BBC's classical music channel, Radio 3. For years, Radio 3 hummed along, capturing only 5 per cent of BBC Radio's declining audience, at a cost of Pounds 50m a year. But its unrivalled reputation as an artistic force, funding four orchestras and commissioning dozens of new works every year, protected it from criticism. In the intensive review of all the BBC's activities, initiated by Mr David Mellor, the national heritage secretary, the performance of Radio 3 has come under the spotlight. The result has been surprisingly encouraging. Radio 3's commitment to cultural innovation has ensured it an important role in the BBC of the future, but at a price. There was a feeling within the BBC itself that Radio 3 was not attracting its full potential audience. Many who bought Pavarotti's Greatest Hits would never infiltrate deeper into classical music; but many more, given a helping hand, might. The advent of Classic FM strengthens the hands of those in the BBC arguing for change. According to this group, Radio 3 needed to sound less stuffy. A young controller, Nicholas Kenyon, was brought in to try a broaden the station's appeal. The imminence of Classic FM's launch speeded up some of his changes, which were introduced last month to a predictable outcry. Kenyon attempted to make the wake-up programme 'On Air', which attracts Radio 3's largest audience, more accessible, with shorter items of popular music and more frequent news bulletins. He added talk and reviews to 'In Tune', the drive-home programme. Radio 3 has an articulate audience and it has made its voice felt in the press and through letters to the BBC. Most of the reaction has been negative. Kenyon is unrepentant. Every change to BBC programming produces a similar outcry, he says, adding that the decision to move 'Women's Hour' from the afternoon to the morning produced a much more vociferous reaction. Kenyon has moved to placate his critics, extending the musical items in 'On Air' to 20 minutes or more and bunching the news reports so that they are less obtrusive. But he retains his aim of making Radio 3 accessible and of alternating music with talk and drama. More changes such as the introduction of an arts review programme will be announced on September 13. It is too soon to judge whether the audience for Radio 3 is growing but Kenyon seems confident. The station will still play much more Stockhausen and Boulez than Classic FM could ever imagine. It will also play more Mozart and Vivaldi than it did in the past. Its commitment to drama, and to funding the arts, is intact. The US supports 50 classical music stations. The undoubted growth of interest in classical music in the UK should enable two stations to thrive, especially as they do not clash head-on, in spirit or in ambition. Classic FM could even become the conduit which will eventually expand the audience for Radio 3.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Martin S. Lambeck report: "Presidential Elections: </F> Nervousness Within CDU Is Growing"]    [Text] Bonn -- In spite of intensive efforts to win over  the electors of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] before the  vote by the Federal Assembly in Berlin on Monday [23 May], the  CDU leadership is not certain that its candidate Roman Herzog  will received the majority of votes. Against the backdrop of  increasing nervousness -- also because of the votes of the Free  Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] -- Juergen Ruettgers, the  manager of the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union] Bundestag group,  admonished his own party in an interview with DIE WELT: "Every  vote will be decisive in Berlin. No experiments should be made  in the election of the head of state."    The statement by Saxony-Anhalt FDP leader Peter Kunert that  there is a tendency in the new laender that "speaks clearly in  favor of the candidate of Johannes Rau, the Social Democratic  Party of Germany," caused quite a stir. The CDU/CSU leadership  has made it clear that "if Herzog fails, the coalition will  break apart, and we can forget the rest of the election year."  The CDU/CSU Bundestag group, which is particularly skeptical of  the FDP, stated: "If Rau should be elected, a completely new  situation will arise." Last Monday CDU/CSU Bundestag group  leader Wolfgang Schaeuble made the following skeptical statement  at the meeting of the CDU Executive Committee: "No decision is  made until all votes are counted."    The CDU/CSU leadership is particularly concerned about the  voting behavior of the electors from the new laender. They are  unpredictable, and it is not clear for whom they will vote.  There were rumors in Bonn that the SPD is trying to "buy"  electors by promising them positions in their east German home  towns. In view of this, the critical position of former  Transportation Minister Guenther Krause (CDU) is to be assessed  as less significant. The leadership of the CDU/CSU Bundestag  group does not consider this a "Bonn issue."    This became clear during a meeting between Roman Herzog and  about 50 east German CDU deputies in the basement of the  government building in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on Thursday  evening. Deputy Bundestag group leader Clemens Schwalbe from  Saxony-Anhalt assured Herzog of the following amid the applause  of the delegates: "You can rely on the east Germans next  Monday." Krause did not attend the meeting, during which beer  and fish specialties were served.    The east German CDU delegates vehemently rejected any  suspicion that one of them is preparing a stab in Herzog's back.  Ulrich Klinkert from Saxony-Anhalt stressed: "Those who speak  of the east German delegates as a wavering front are not  realistic." Participants in the meeting, which lasted well into  the night, spoke of a "breakthrough for Herzog."    The candidate succeeded in creating a humorous atmosphere.  He referred to Humphrey Bogart's legendary final scene in  "Casablanca." When he was asked what he thinks of the criticism  voiced by Saxon State Minister Arnold Vaatz, Herzog humorously  quoted the final sentence from the famous film: "This might be  the beginning of a wonderful friendship."</p>

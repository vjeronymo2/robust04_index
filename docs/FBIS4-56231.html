			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Letters by Defense Minister General Reynaldo Andino Flores </F> to the National Congress on 27 April and "text" of proposed  draft ammendment to Article 276 of the Constitution on military  service]    [Text] Secretaries of the National Congress: On  instructions from the president of the Republic and Armed Forces  commander in chief and in compliance with Article 213 of the  Constitution, I hereby send to you a draft decree and  corresponding explanation of motives regarding the amendment to  Article 276 of the Constitution.    [Signed] Brigadier General Reynaldo Andino Flores, defense  minister.  <H5>  Explanation of Motives </H5>   The proposal that has been presented is based on the need to  replace conscription with enlistment for educational, social,  humanitarian, and democratic purposes. This enlistment should  spark and stimulate the interest of Honduran youths in  developing their human potential and engaging in military  training to defend the homeland.    Once the constitutional amendment is ratified and enacted,  enlistment for educational purposes should be developed into a  secondary law to regulate its organization and operation.    With the proposed constitutional amendment, the president of  the Republic makes good a pledge made to the Honduran people  that he would substantially change military service.    I have no doubts that the proposal to amend Article 276 of  the Constitution, whose essential basis and justification we  have presented, will be approved by the National Congress with  the majority required by our Constitution.    [Signed] Brigadier General Reynaldo Andino Flores, defense  minister.    This is the text of the proposed amendment.  <H5>  Decree No. </H5>   Whereas the Honduran people's duty to defend and serve the  homeland -- a duty set forth by Article 38 of the Constitution  -- can be complied with through military service or any of the  various civil services that citizens must render according to  their merits and capabilities, as demanded by the country's  fundamental needs;    Whereas Honduran society's evolution demands a revision of  the criteria with which military service has traditionally been  complied with, and this compliance should be regarded by the  people, particularly young people, as compliance with a civic  duty rather than a mere demand;    Whereas the Honduran people should be given the option for  military service that would make it possible to reconcile the  will to render it with the duty to serve and defend the homeland  anywhere and under any circumstances demanded by the homeland,  and the need to give the people this option cannot be delayed  any longer; and Whereas the state must ensure the fulfillment  of the constitutional duties assigned to the Armed Forces, and  it is thus necessary for the Armed Forces to have a permanent  number of compulsary members, according to the Constitution, it  is therefore decreed: Article 1. Article 276 of the  Constitution shall be amended to read as follows: "Article 276:  Citizens between 18 and 30 years of age will serve in the Armed  Forces on a voluntary basis in peacetime for educational,  social, humanitarian, and democratic purposes. The state,  however, retains the right to exercise conscription according to  the Military Service Law. In case of international war, all  Hondurans capable of defending and serving the homeland are  soldiers."    Article 2. For this decree to become law, it shall be  ratified by the National Congress in the next regular  legislature by two thirds of the total number of members and  published in the gazette.    Tegucigalpa, on such and such day of 1994.    [Signed] The president and secretaries.</p>

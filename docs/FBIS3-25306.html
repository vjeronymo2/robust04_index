			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Z.B. du Toit] </F>   [Text] Right-wing plans for a rebels' volkstaat [Afrikaner  homeland] are far advanced and the first phase for a unilateral  declaration of independence--like the one in the former  Rhodesia--could come into operatiion as early as this week.    Pressure from militant circles for the process of creating a  volkstaat starting without delay was intensifying at the time of  going to press, especially after the Afrikaner National Front  [AVF] had announced on Thursday [10 February] that it would not  take part in the April elections. But the decision to declare a  volkstaat had already been made in Pretoria on 18 January. The  moderate faction in the AVF under the leadership of General  Constand Viljoen has, however, apparently been given time to  exhaust the negotiation option first.  <H5>  Victory </H5>   The militant faction in the AVF this week achieved victory  after victory at consecutive meetings of the CP's [Conservative  Party] Executive Committee and the "transitional parliament."  The faction is capitalizing on the 29 January events, when  General Viljoen was booed in Pretoria while he -- under certain  conditions -- was calling for participation in the election.  Well known moderates in the AVF were not even present on  Thursday when the "transitional parliament" authorized a  decision to boycott the election. Among them were General  Constand Viljoen and two CP MP's -- Drs. Corne and Pieter Mulder.    The approximately seven to 10 CP MP's who are in favor of  participation in the election showed no signs of resistance in  the midst of emotional intimidation from far right wingers.  <H5>  Elated </H5>   Spokesmen in the militant faction of the AVF were elated  yesterday over the victories achieved this week. To further rub  salt into the wounds, AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader  Eugene Terreblanche yesterday unequivocally rejected proposals  to get international mediation on the volkstaat issue. "It is  just a trick to sow division within the National Front," Mr.  Terreblanche said. But it is General Viljoen who on several  occasions has been toying with the idea of calling in  international mediators.  <H5>  Fight Back </H5>   Despite these drawbacks, sources in the moderate group said  they were going to fight back. They give the assurance that  differences will be brought to a head within "10 days."    Preparations for a rebels' state have nevertheless been  underway for a long time, with two MP's, Messrs. Schalk Pienaar  and Kobus Beyers, playing a significant role.    It revolves around a so-called "resistance map" in which a  large portion of the country has been designated as a future  volkstaat in contrast to the "peace map" for which negotiations  between the government, the ANC and the AVF over the past few  weeks yielded nothing. Meanwhile, it has come to light that  neither the CP nor the AWB support this map and that even the  AVF's Executive Committee rejected it.    The "peace map" makes provision for 15 percent of the  country's area as a volkstaat. It has been rejected by both the  government and the ANC.    The more than 60 CP-controlled city councils in the  Transvaal  and the Orange Free State will play an important role in the  establishment of a rebels' state. After the CP-orientated  Transvaal Municipal Association indicated that it would not take  part in a new constitutional dispensation, it is a foregone  conclusion that right wingers will find refuge around these city  councils and even defend them with weapons.  <H5>  Radio Pretoria </H5>   The success achieved through Radio Pretoria will serve as a  model for resistance surrounding the city councils. On Friday  General Viljoen, in an interview with RAPPORT, broadly referred  to an "emergency solution" to attain a volkstaat peacefully.  He was reluctant to elaborate further, except to say the  transitional constitution has to be amended to legalize the  implementation of a volkstaat during the interim period of five  years.    Yesterday Gen. Viljoen castigated ANC leader Nelson Mandela  in an open letter over his umpteenth utterance that a volkstaat  will not materialize. "Your current statements do not match  what has been going on during the negotiation process and it has  left my team confused and embarrassed," the letter stated.</p>

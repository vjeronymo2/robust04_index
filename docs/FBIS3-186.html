Mr. Booh-Booh renewed his call yesterday 1 March  at the end of a meeting in Mulindi with Rwandan Patriotic Front  [RPF] senior political and military officials. During talks  that lasted two hours, the UN secretary general's special  representative reminded the RPF officials about the need to give  greater importance to dialogue, to demonstrate the logic of  peace and to prepare themselves for acceptable political  compromises.    According to a communique issued on 28 February in Mulindi,  the RPF declared itself prepared to take part in the  transitional institutions provided that the deputies of the  Liberal Party ratified on 4 January 1994 by the Constitutional  Court was maintained. The RPF condemned the current high level  of violence in the country and denounced the manipulations aimed  at changing the balance of political forces as stipulated in the  Arusha peace agreement.

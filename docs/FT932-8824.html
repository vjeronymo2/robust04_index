			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Shell/BP The marked divergence between investors' attitudes to Royal Dutch/Shell and BP must leave the Anglo-Dutch giant feeling a little aggrieved. BP has slashed its dividend, cut capital expenditure and still has over 90 per cent gearing. It has also rallied to within an ace of the ill-fated 1987 rights issue price and yields only 3.25 per cent. Shell is expanding, has 3 per cent gearing yet languishes on 4.5 per cent yield. US buyers have sucked BP's shares out of the UK for its lower cash flow rating. UK fund managers may now be tempted to chase the performance they have missed in BP's rally. There is also concern that the normally smooth Shell machine has fumbled the ball at Showa Shell in Japan. BP's dividend cover may approach two times by this year end, though any increase will probably have to wait until the end of next year. And there is still the threat of a rights issue in 1995-96. Shell's dividend cover is low, though it will build to over 1.5 times in 1994 as the world economy recovers. Even if conditions remain poor, Shell's rock-solid balance sheet means there is no threat of a dividend cut. Its first-quarter figures also suggest that the haemorrhaging in the chemicals business may be slowing. That reflects the upturn in the US and capacity cuts in Europe. Signs that Shell was moving aggressively on cost cutting might draw attention back to the huge yield gap between the two companies.</p>

			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Letter: Time to mend their ways Sir, The culture of late payments has been sown, fertilised and further grown by large companies. They must be made to mend their ways. Until they do the poor small business does not even receive the cash to pay its own bills. It is, therefore, no wonder that research appears to support the contention that small businesses are as dilatory as the large ones ('UK's late payment culture attacked,' May 10). When will the headline writers, authors of financial arguments and others look at it from this angle? D Ellis, 25 Kingsley Park Grove, Sheffield S11 9HL</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy setback on renewed inflation concerns - Market report A sudden wave of inflation concerns, reflected in setbacks in bond markets across Europe, hit UK stocks hard yesterday. At midsession the equity market was heading for its worst one-day fall of the year, but losses were significantly reduced when UK government bonds steadied, helped by similar trends in the US dollar and Federal securities. The FT-SE 100 Index closed 51.8 off at 2,971.1, but had earlier shown a fall of 85.3 for a session's low of 2,937.6. Renewed fears that inflation pressures in the US will herald a general raising of global interest rates left no sector of the stock market unscathed on the first day of the new equity trading account. However, trading volume was relatively mild and there was no question of panic selling. London fared better than the German stock market, where the prospect of a switch to upward pressures on interest rates came as more of a shock. Weakness in the US dollar was a bearish factor for the multi-national stocks, and Unilever, ICI, Hanson, HSBC and many other big names suffered significant losses. Even the oil shares sector, which at first responded strongly as US crude oil prices moved above Dollars 20 a barrel, reacted later as the US stock market continued to come under pressure. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 30 points off when the UK markets closed for the day. As so often in current market conditions, much of the downward pressure was exerted from stock index futures. Selling of the September contract on the Footsie, which took over market leadership on Friday, drove the contract to a discount as marketmaking firms struggled to protect themselves against a collapsing stock market. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 48.4 down at 3,478.7 but, with the focus strongly on blue chip stocks, trading in non-Footsie issues made up only about 48 per cent of total business in equities. Seaq volume totalled only 460.1m shares, compared with 736.8m on Friday, when retail business was worth Pounds 1.46bn. Traders warned that the low level of turnover in the market yesterday should not be taken as cause for comfort. 'There was no time to sell much stock,' commented one head dealer, 'but the selling was done in the futures markets.' At last night's close, the FT-SE 100 Index was just over 39 points above the year's low reached at the beginning of this month. Below the year's low of 2,931.9 is an unsupported area for the index, with the nearest support level not clearly visible much above Footsie 2,800. UK market strategists found it difficult to draw heart from yesterday's rally from the session's lows. London stocks clearly remained vulnerable to the next move in bonds, and suggestions of decoupling suddenly sounded even less convincing. Moreover, it was clear that securities markets are now highly nervous of the gains in commodity prices, which are likely to continue as the recoveries in world industrial economies gather pace. Domestic factors, including the announcement that new mortgage commitments by UK building societies had edged higher to Pounds 3.39bn in May, were largely ignored yesterday. Markets also appeared unperturbed by prospects for Britain's non-EU trade deficit for May which is due for publication this morning. For the near term, there is little doubt that trends in the UK stock market are at the mercy of the US bond markets.</p>

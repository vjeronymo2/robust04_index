Our  Bratislava correspondent, Renata Havranova, reports in detail:    [Havranova] Listeners who wanted to listen to a Radio Free  Europe [RFE] newscast this morning could not find it on the  airwaves.    Former Minister Hofbauer has implemented his threat, made  after the editors of this radio station were savagely attacked  outside the president's office, and withdrew the frequency of  Radio Free Europe. This was confirmed to me this morning in a  telephone conversation with (Otto Machac), administrator of the  Bratislava Office of RFE. He said he had been warned of  disconnection as early as Monday, but no one had officially  informed him until now. Otto Machac added that the United  States, as well as the Munich leadership of RFE, will protest  against this step.    The behavior of the outgoing government is very strange.  Roman Kovac confirmed to journalists last night that personnel  purges are continuing at the ministries, privatization is under  way, and certain property is being written off.    According to Roman Kovac, the first step of the new  government, which has been complete since last night, will be to  open investigations into these unlawful steps on the part of  former Prime Minister Meciar and the other members of the former  government.</p>

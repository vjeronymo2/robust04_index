			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] South Atlantic waters, aboard the icebreaker  "Almirante Irizar," 1 May (NA) -- Tonight, President Carlos  Menem emphasized that he does not harbor "the slightest doubt  that within a very short time" Argentina will regain its  sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands. He made this remark  during a meeting aboard the icebreaker "Almirante Irizar" with  the relatives of seamen killed in the sinking of the cruiser  "General Belgrano." President Menem thus appeared to be raising  the bet on his most recent remarks on the Malvinas Islands  issue, in which he indicated that the islands would again become  part of sovereign Argentine territory before the year 2000.    The president made this remark before a group of 65  relatives  of seamen killed in the sinking of the warship "General  Belgrano," which was torpedoed by the British nuclear submarine  "Conqueror" 12 years ago.    In an emotional tone, Menem addressed the relatives of the  "General Belgrano" seamen in one of the icebreaker's holds a few  minutes after boarding the ship, within the framework of a  tribute that the national government is paying -- for the first  time -- to war veterans and relatives of the seamen killed on  the "General Belgrano." The tribute in the South Atlantic  waters is scheduled to end tomorrow.    The president arrived in Ushuaia, from which town the  icebreaker was sailing, at 1735, and an hour later went to the  naval base, where he boarded the "Almirante Irizar."    The president was joined by Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella;  Defense Minister Oscar Camilion; Army Chief of Staff Martin  Balza; Navy Chief of Staff Enrique Molina Pico; Juan Paulik, the  Air Force chief of staff; Tierra del Fuego Governor Jose  Estabillo; and Public Function Secretary Claudia Bello. Bello,  along with Jorge Baeza, the Defense Ministry military affairs  secretary, organized the tribute, which was called "Operation  Memorial." [passage omitted]</p>

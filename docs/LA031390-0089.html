			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> National Semiconductor Corp.: The computer chip maker said it lost $10.2  million in its third quarter, compared to a $44.6-million loss in the same  period a year earlier.  </P> <P> Sales rose 6.6% to $404.3 million. The Santa Clara, Calif., firm said the third  quarter "is historically a challenging one for us, incorporating a seasonal  slowdown in sales, along with the annual holiday shutdown of our production  facilities." The results were helped by the reversal of $4.6 million in  one-time costs originally set aside to pay for the closing of a Danbury, Conn.,  plant. The firm also had $6.7 million in non-recurring credits.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One national trade association commenter suggested that the Board should adopt an additional appendix to Part 707 similar to Appendix C to Regulation DD, entitled ``Effect on State Laws.'' 12 CFR Part 230, App. C. Regulation DD's Appendix C addresses inconsistent state requirements and provides procedures for institutions seeking preemption determinations from the FRB. After receipt of a preemption request, the FRB generally will issue a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice of its intent to make a preemption determination, and provide an opportunity for public comment. Notices of final preemption determinations are also to be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The commenter stated that NCUA had not shown any uniqueness reasons for varying from the FRB in not adopting a similar appendix for Part 707; or at least by adopting more guidance in the commentary as to the preemption standards to be used, and means for providing an opportunity to comment by the affected states and other interested parties. The commenter also pointed out that by allowing affected states and other interested parties to comment, that the impact of any preemption determination could be minimized upon the state. This is in accord with federal policy, as enunciated in Executive Order No. 12612. Therefore, the Board has decided to adopt changes in the commentary to provide preemption standards, and an informal notification process to affected states, allowing sufficient time and opportunity for comment, before issuing any preemption determinations under Part 707. These changes are made in comments 1(d)&hyph;1 through 4. Four commenters requested that the requirement for the credit union requesting a preemption determination demonstrate a compliance burden be deleted. One commenter believed that the requirement was reasonable, and should be retained. The Board notes that demonstration of a burden is a caselaw prerequisite for a finding of preemption. Therefore, the Board has not modified comment 1(d)&hyph;2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 707.2_Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Account <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 2(a)&hyph;1 provides examples of accounts subject to the regulation. The FRB, as did NCUA, proposed to narrow the regulation's coverage of trust accounts individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and simplified employee pension (SEP) accounts, to minimize compliance burdens for institutions. Many FRB commenters supported the FRB's general approach, but questioned whether the regulation should exclude accounts held by individuals pursuant to informal trust arrangements such as ``Totten'' or payable on death (POD) trusts. These commenters noted the purpose of a Totten trust is to avoid probate proceedings to transfer funds remaining in an account upon an accountholder's death. It was also noted that the account's signature card may be the sole evidence of the trust relationship. The FRB commenters suggested, and the FRB agreed, that consumers opening Totten and POD trust accounts be afforded the protections of TISA and Regulation DD. Fourteen NCUA commenters agreed with the FRB's approach. The NCUA Board concurs, and the commentary reflects this approach. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 2(a)&hyph;3 in the proposed commentary was removed to reflect the amendments made in Part 707 to implement the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. As discussed previously, this change exempts unincorporated association accounts from coverage of TISA and Part 707. As a result, proposed comment 2(a)&hyph;3 is not incorporated into the final commentary. This change was also requested by thirteen commenters. Comment 2(a)&hyph;2(vii) adds unincorporated nonbusiness association accounts as being exempt from the coverage of part 707, as required by the new legislation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Hurd to address Foreign Office staff on job cuts Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, is taking the unprecedented step of addressing a meeting of his department's entire London-based staff to try to reassure them about the size of redundancies, career prospects and pay. About 1,000 people are expected to attend next Monday's meeting, said to be the first of its kind in the Foreign Office. It is due to be held in the Durbar Court, the restoration of which was undertaken under Mr Hurd's predecessor, Sir Geoffrey Howe, now Lord Howe. The court has been used mainly for diplomatic receptions. The meeting is taking place at the request of the Diplomatic Service's Whitley Council, which represents the various trade unions and has expressed increasing anxiety about the future of the staff at a time of financial retrenchment in all government departments. The Foreign Office was characteristically vague about details, saying only that Mr Hurd had agreed to give 'a general address to the staff which will focus in part on management and administrative issues'. It is no secret, however, that the department will have to make staff cuts as a result of financial constraints imposed by the Treasury, and the planned cuts have had a demoralising influence. Other developments, such as the market-testing programme of several Foreign Office departments to see whether they could operate as privatised agencies, has also worried staff. Though the meeting has been billed as a general address by the foreign secretary, it would be surprising if civil servants did not take the opportunity of asking Mr Hurd some searching, and possibly embarrassing questions about career prospects and pay.</p>

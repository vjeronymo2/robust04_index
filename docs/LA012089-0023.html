			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REVISED GROWTH-MANAGEMENT PLAN DESIGNED TO BYPASS CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Hoping to avoid "analysis paralysis" as the San Diego City Council prepares to  tackle anew the politically thorny issue of growth-management, two council  members and Mayor Maureen O'Connor on Thursday offered a plan to quickly adopt  some of the key provisions of a growth-control ballot measure defeated by  voters last November.  </P> <P> The proposal, developed by Council members Bob Filner and Judy McCarty and  endorsed by O'Connor, encompasses some of the major components of last fall's  Proposition H, a City Council-backed growth-control plan rejected by a  55.5%-44.5% margin. Although sharing goals with Proposition H, the plan differs  significantly from the ballot measure in that it eschews annual housing caps as  a method of controlling growth.  </P> <P> In so doing, the proposal -- dubbed "A City That Works" by its authors -- seeks  to provide a conceptual guideline on growth policies intended to balance  environmental protection against the need for sufficient development to  "preserve a climate conducive to economic growth," the council members said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shortcut Through Process  </P> <P> San Diego voters' rejection of both Proposition H and a more stringent citizen  growth-control initiative on last November's ballot set the stage for a renewal  of last year's protracted debate on the subject. McCarty and Filner described  their plan as a shortcut through round two of that potentially lengthy, costly  process.  </P> <P> "This is a way to accomplish most of our goals without having to spend millions  of dollars and taking months to do it," Filner said at a news conference in his  City Hall office.  </P> <P> McCarty added: "We don't need more consultants, we don't need more studies and  charts and endless hearings. This is a way to do these things now."  </P> <P> Filner also argued that it was significant that he and McCarty -- "two people  perceived to be at opposite ends of this debate" -- crafted the three-page memo  sent to other council members Thursday. While Filner is regarded as one of the  strongest environmentalists on the council, McCarty has compiled a strong  pro-development record during her first three years at City Hall.  </P> <P> "We thought that, if we could agree, the council ought to come to an  agreement," Filner said.  </P> <P> The two council members expressed hope that their colleagues could adopt their  proposal as early as next week, when the council is scheduled to consider  various growth-control proposals.  </P> <P> Although McCarty said the proposal contains "nothing new," Filner stressed that  its value lies in its brevity, which stems from their conscious effort to  address the complicated growth issue "in a concise way . . . that people can  understand."  </P> <P> "It tries to come up with a reasonable, sensible protection of sensitive lands  while recognizing that there has to be some flexibility," the councilman said.  "This is a pragmatic attempt to balance competing concerns. . . . Nobody's evil  because they're . . . trying to protect the environment or no one's evil  because they're trying to develop property."  </P> <P> The Filner-McCarty plan sets broad goals in four basic areas: neighborhood  preservation, the funding and timing of public facilities, protection of  sensitive lands and overall environmental goals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conform Zoning  </P> <P> With an eye on preserving single-family neighborhoods, the council members  recommend that the Planning Department schedule hearings to make zoning conform  with all community plans by August. Under the plan, city planners would also  identify proposed "single-family preservation areas" in communities throughout  the city.  </P> <P> One of the focal points in recent growth debates has involved the provision of  public facilities such as streets, parks and libraries necessitated by new  developments. McCarty and Filner suggest that the city take steps to accelerate  so-called "turnkey development" policies, ensuring that developers build needed  roads, parks and other public facilities before buyers move into new homes.  </P> <P> By linking growth and public facilities "very directly, very pragmatically,  very clearly," Filner said, the city will be able to accomplish many of the  same goals that last November's propositions sought to attain through  controversial annual caps on housing construction. (As a corollary, the  Planning Department is reviewing an O'Connor proposal that would establish  stand-by housing limits that could be implemented in the event of runaway  growth in a particular area.)  </P> <P> In accord with Proposition H's goals, the plan unveiled Thursday also would  protect environmentally sensitive lands, with individuals or communities having  options to propose revisions to which areas would be preserved in a natural  state.  </P> <P> The Filner-McCarty plan also would establish broad environmental goals,  including adoption by July of a traffic-reduction plan incorporating the  provisions of last November's Proposition K, an advisory measure calling for  companies that employ at least 25 workers to offer staggered work hours in an  effort to reduce peak-hour traffic.  </P> <P> Their other recommendations include establishing a curb-side recycling program  within three years, preparing an open-space bond measure for voter  consideration in 1990 and developing a water reclamation program.  </P></p>

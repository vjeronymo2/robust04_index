			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESS WIDENS DRUG INDUSTRY PROBE  </P> <P> The chairman of a congressional committee that has been investigating  corruption and fraud in the generic drug industry for the past year said  Tuesday that the probe was expanding to the makers of brand-name products.  </P> <P> The first target of the expanded inquiry is to be Eli Lilly &amp; Co. of  Indianapolis, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell  (D-Mich.) disclosed in a letter to Food and Drug Administration Chief Frank E.  Young.  </P> <P> The letter was made public late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Dingell's letter was prompted by Lilly's announcement earlier Tuesday that the  drug maker had begun a voluntary recall from its wholesalers of 18 lots of  drugs involving 10 different products.  </P> <P> Lilly said it initiated the recall because some of the manufacturing procedures  used for the drugs had not been approved in advance by the Food and Drug  Administration, as required by federal law.  </P> <P> Dingell, in his letter to Young, asked for copies of the FDA's internal reports  on a just-concluded agency inspection of Lilly.  </P> <P> The inspection's findings had led to the recall, Lilly said.  </P> <P> Congressional sources confirmed that the letter was a sign of Dingell's intent  to expand the investigation, saying the lawmaker wanted to look at Lilly to  determine whether that company's problems were unique or indicative of a  broader pattern in the manufacture of brand-name drugs.  </P> <P> Dingell has spearheaded a yearlong probe of the generic drug industry that, in  conjunction with federal prosecutors in Baltimore, has turned up drug company  payoffs to FDA drug reviewers, manufacturing irregularities, paper work  deficiencies and testing fraud.  </P> <P> The investigation has also led to the recall of numerous drug products, though  there have been no reports of safety problems attributed to the irregularities.  </P> <P> Monday, a senior FDA enforcement official told a hearing of the Energy and  Commerce Committee's Investigations Subcommittee that recent special  inspections had turned up manufacturing and paper work irregularities in 11 of  13 generic drug makers that were targeted for review because they were  suspected of compliance problems.  </P></p>

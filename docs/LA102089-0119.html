			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KNBC SWEEPS SLATE CLEAN FOR QUAKE STORY  </P> <P> The quake shook the Bay Area some 400 miles to the north, but Los Angeles  television station KNBC saw it as the ultimate local story. From shortly after  5 p.m. Tuesday, when the station's news department first learned of the  disaster, until 7 p.m. Wednesday, Channel 4 scrapped all of its regular  programming to provide continuous coverage of the disaster.  </P> <P> The NBC-owned station had never done that before -- not after the Whittier  quake two years ago and not after the Sylmar quake in 1971.  </P> <P> While rival station KCBS Channel 2 switched over to "The Pat Sajak Show" late  Tuesday, KNBC kept its anchors up through the wee hours of the night to talk  about the quake. While KABC Channel 7 broadcast its daytime soaps as scheduled  Wednesday afternoon, Channel 4 carried San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos' press  conference from the streets of that city's devastated Marina District.  </P> <P> "It's the E-word," Tom Capra, KNBC's news director, said Thursday.  "Earthquakes, especially one in San Francisco on the San Andreas fault, scares  everyone down here. They want to know how bad it is. Many people here have  relatives or friends in the Bay Area, and we want to know how they are. My  daughter was evacuated from her dorm at San Jose State and is staying with her  grandparents in Santa Cruz. I think people want to know as much as we can tell  them."  </P> <P> In the first hour after the quake rumbled through the Bay Area, Channel 4  couldn't tell them much at all. Its San Francisco sister station, KRON, was  knocked off air by the temblor.  </P> <P> But from about 6 p.m. Tuesday onward, when the station was finally able to get  pictures out of San Francisco, it was all earthquake, all the time. Like other  local stations, Channel 4 sent several of its own reporters to the Bay Area,  and also drove Phil Shuman to Santa Cruz in a rented satellite truck.  </P> <P> Capra said that his station certainly did want to catch up with its  competitors, who all had pictures of the area more than an hour earlier than  Channel 4. But once the station was able to obtain KRON's coverage, which KNBC  used liberally throughout the day, Capra said he figured: "Why stop? The  satellites were working, we had our people there, we had their coverage and it  was a story that changed and changed."  </P> <P> John Beard, who anchored many hours of Channel 4's coverage, said that the  extensive reporting was justified because Southern Californians can learn from  any large earthquake.  </P> <P> "Even though we're told it's going to happen here again, there's a part of your  mind that refuses to believe it until you see it. We saw it for 24 hours -- how  people dealt with it, how preparedness paid off and what kind of questions were  raised about our readiness for the quake and about the infrastructure, the  freeways and bridges down here. There are so many parallels that it becomes a  Southern California story."  </P> <P> KNBC's continuous coverage also proved a boon in the ratings. Between 6 a.m.  and 4 p.m. Wednesday, Channel 4 averaged a 9.9 rating and 32% of the audience  -- about twice the number of viewers it gets on a normal day. KABC Channel 7,  which aired live earthquake coverage for part of that time period, registered a  6.4, while KCBS Channel 2, which broadcast the majority of its regular  schedule, received a 3.6 rating. KNBC's newscast from 4 to 6:30 p.m. Wednesday  also easily outdistanced its two competitors.  </P> <P> A KNBC spokeswoman said that a few viewers called to complain because they  couldn't see their favorite soap opera, but calls to the station, she said,  were running about 6-to-1 in favor of the extended quake reports. Capra said it  was the first time that preempting regular programs didn't produce outrage from  at least some viewers.  </P> <P> "When Richard Ramirez was captured, we preempted the NBC baseball game of the  week to go live with that," he said, "and this guy called up the newsroom and  said he was going to come down here and rip my heart out. Here they captured  the Night Stalker, who had been terrorizing the entire area, and this guy  wanted to kill me over missing the second inning of the Cubs and Cardinals. We  didn't have anything like that this time."  </P> <P> Capra added that sending reporters up to the Bay Area and procuring satellite  time to beam their reports back to Los Angeles did cost the station  "something," but he added that the extensive coverage was not "overly  expensive." He said he could not be more specific. No extra personnel were  hired and the station was able to air all of its regular local advertising  spots.  </P> <P> Some of KNBC's competitors, who chose not to devote so many hours to the San  Francisco quake, complained that KNBC's coverage in the middle of the day  Wednesday became "repetitive and boring." But Channel 4 personnel dismissed  that criticism as sour grapes.  </P> <P> "This is such an important story for us in Los Angeles. It deserves this kind  of attention," said KNBC anchor Linda Alvarez. "It's going to happen here and  we can all get prepared with radios and flashlights and water. But we have to  keep mentally prepared too, and this really helps us to see what can happen. I  think showing as much as we can of what happened up there really makes it hit  home. I don't think we can over-report this story."  </P> <P> And when the big one finally does hit at home? "We wouldn't be off the air  yet," Capra said Thursday. "You'll see us here for for days on end."  </P></p>

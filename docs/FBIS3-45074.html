			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yin Hongzhu (1438 7703 4376)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 11 Jan (XINHUA) -- Addressing a  teleconference called by the State Education Commission today to  discuss educational projects in 1994, Zhu Kaixuan [minister in  charge of the State Education Commission], pointed out that 1994  is a year crucial for intensifying educational reform and fully  implementing the educational "program." Education workers in  the country, he said, must work hard with higher morale, explore  with daring, and be brave to do practical work so that  educational reform and development can reach a higher level.    After recalling China's educational development in 1993 in  his work report, Zhu Kaixuan pointed out: While the situation  was generally satisfactory, we must realize that the country is  still confronted with certain educational problems: There is  insufficient coordination between the reform of the educational  system on the one hand and economic reform, reform of science  and technology management, and reform of the political system on  the other; the shortage of educational budgets has intensified,  the mechanisms governing educational investment cannot keep pace  with needs in educational development and needs in various  social quarters; teachers' pay remains low, and problems  concerning delinquent salary payments for teachers have not yet  been fully resolved; in some localities and schools, the ranks  of teachers are unstable and the rates of school dropouts have  increased; in some localities and schools of higher education,  the conditions for educational operations cannot keep pace with  the rapid increase of students, giving rise to new managerial  problems; and there is also the problem concerning inadequate  macroscopic regulation and control for educational reform. We  must deal with these problems as quickly as possible through  deepening educational reform.    On the 1994 assignments, Zhu Kaixuan pointed out: The  nation's educational development for the time to come will focus  on basic education, especially the "two basic projects" -- basic  universalization of the nine-year compulsory educational system  and the project of basically wiping out illiteracy among  growups. We must firmly implement the nine-year compulsory  educational system as the law requires. On the basis of the  State Education Commission's principles and objectives that  there should be regional planning, difference guidance for  different projects, and plans for step-by- step implementation,  all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly  under the central government's jurisdiction must also draw up  specific nine-year compulsory educational development plans that  can be implemented by all counties and townships step by step.  Meanwhile, we must also study and draw up policies and measures  for popularizing compulsory education for specific numbers of  years in remote, impoverished regions. Schools of higher  education must fully implement the general policy that "their  sizes must be larger, their quality must be better, their  structures must be more rational, and their efficiency must be  noticeably higher." The enrollment and growth of schools of  higher education must be appropriate. They should give priority  to improving their quality, restructuring their organization,  improving their efficiency, and improving their operating  conditions. We should arouse the enthusiasm of schools operated  by central departments and local authorities to set up schools  through forming all types of partnership programs so that  significant headway can be achieved this year in reforming the  system governing educational operations by government  departments and the system governing educational investment.  Provincial, regional, and municipal authorities should be given  greater power gradually to make overall planning for the  development of higher education in areas under their  jurisdiction. Schools of higher education, and specialized  secondary vocational training schools must energetically  expedite the process of reforming their systems governing  enrollment, collection of fees, and graduates' job assignment.  Priority should be given to replacing the system whereby the  state is responsible for students' tuitions and post-graduate  assignment with a system whereby the students have to pay their  own tuitions and have to find jobs themselves; and to improving  the systems governing scholarships, student loans, and  work-study programs.    Zhu Kaixuan said: For vocational education, we must  encourage all trades and professions to work with people in all  social quarters to set up schools through forming partnerships;  and enterprises, in particular, must fulfill their obligations  in this regard. We must have stronger teacher-training projects  and we must improve the system for hiring teachers on the basis  of their performance. We should encourage the use of the dual  credentials system [shuang zheng zhi 7175 6086 0455] and improve  all services facilitating the development of vocational  education. We should assign some major vocational training  colleges to set up professional training classes on an  experimental basis to promote reform and construction of  professional universities. We should actively develop all kinds  of vocational education for students that graduate from junior  and senior middle schools. Meanwhile, we should continue to  designate certain counties to experiment with educational reform  and designate certain townships to demonstrate the "prairie fire  program;" and then we should pay attention to promoting their  experiences in other areas to promote "unified planning among  three forms of education" [san jiao tong chou 0005 2403 4827  4693] and integration of agricultural production, scientific  research, and education. We should also continue to make sure  that cities and enterprises designated to carry out experimental  comprehensive educational reform will accomplish their  assignments. For adult education, we should continue to give  priority to on-the-job training and follow-up education and  encourage all trades and establishments to set up and improve  their on-the-job training programs, certification programs,  qualification test and evaluation programs, and follow-up  training programs. Townships, towns, and villages must properly  operate their literacy and technical schools offering technical  training. They should implement the "green certificate" system  to intensify the training for workers of township and town  enterprises. Radio, television, correspondence, and other means  should be used to provide follow-up post-high school education  for people in society, especially those in medium and small  cities and remote areas.    Speaking on ensuring educational investment and raising  teachers' pay, Zhu Kaixuan said: This year, the state has  allotted a noticeably higher budget for educational institutions  whose operations fall under the national budget. We should set  up and gradually increase the special funds for central,  provincial, county, and township governments for supporting  compulsory education. Financial and taxation authorities should  come up with, as quickly as possible, the proportion of  educational fees to be collected in cities and rural areas after  tax reform, as well as the measures for collecting those fees.  Provincial governments and central departments and committees  should work together to readjust and standardize the amounts of  tuitions and miscellaneous fees to be collected in all types of  schools. Based on the principle for unifying administrative and  financial powers, we should study and come up with views about  administrative educational departments joining governments of  corresponding levels in budgeting educational funds. We should  study ways to improve rural areas' measures for raising  educational funds, earnestly solve the problems about investment  in building middle and primary school buildings, set up  educational trust and investment companies, and make  preparations for setting up the "China Foundation for  Educational Development." He said: We must earnestly implement  the plan for reforming teachers' pay scales, central and local  authorities must both take effective measures to speed up  construction of teacher housing. Those areas which still have  not paid teachers' salaries must be seriously handled lawfully  according to their situations. Mechanisms for guarding against  delinquent payment of teachers' salaries must be devised.    Zhu Kaixuan said: Leading comrades of central authorities  have agreed in principle to call a national educational  conference during the first half of this year to mobilize the  whole party and the whole society to implement the strategy of  giving priority to educational development and implement the  "program" [for educational development]. The conference will  come up with additional views and measures for China's  educational reform and development.</p>

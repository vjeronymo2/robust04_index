			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Arts: The BBC Symphony Orchestra Why do audiences so stubbornly resist the BBC Symphony Orchestra's winter concerts? The new policy of giving concerts in Barbican Hall has not, alas, improved matters. Friday night's concert under the orchestra's chief conductor Andrew Davis was more like a studio session. It was, of course, a recording session as well - all BBC Symphony concerts are - and Radio 3 listeners will presently be able to seize the opportunity, even if the London public did not, of comparing two important British works of 1948, both well-known but not too often given of late. Admittedly there is something about Vaughan Williams's sixth symphony that all too vividly recalls the recording studio, the film sound-track, the wartime Pathe News. But it is full of interesting features. The subtle eliding of four movements into a continuous structure is one - an old trick, but freshly appealing here; another is the complex but sharp-kicking metrics; and a third is the startling use of a saxophone - one of those brazenly colouristic effects which mark out the composer's later symphonies. Davis tilted into the performance with gusto, and the result was a bitingly exuberant sound, crackling with trombones, a sound at once bitter and buoyant as the mood of the piece demands. The third movement's hysterical tumult and the Epilogue's oddly disconcerting ethereal serenity were well caught. If the Moderato second movement with its eerily lamenting strings and drum alarums suggested Ives or Shostakovich at half-cock, that was not the conductor's fault. Whereas Vaughan Williams made something new or newish out of a traditional form, the St. Nicolas cantata, Op. 42, with which the 35 year old Britten astonished the congregation at Lancing College Chapel a few months after the 76 year old's symphony was premiered is utterly original, a work of amazing genius and simplicity. The simplest strokes are typically those of purest genius, as when the solo treble's refrain 'God be Glorified]' in the waltzing 'Birth of Nicolas' is dramatically taken over at the end by the mature tenor with an accompaniment of loudly ceremonious organ chords. One missed the power of a cathedral instrument at that point, but Benjamin Dawson's treble, wafted from on high, was exquisite and Anthony Rolfe Johnson's tenor here and throughout was passionate, atmospheric, magnificent. The church rituals of the work (including congregational hymns) were well-faked, and the BBC Symphony Chorus and (placed on the lower balcony) women of Trinity College of Music Chamber Choir sang with keen clarity and beauty.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Arts: Sylvie Guillem SYLVIE Guillem, the Parisian ballerina who has been a permanent guest artist at Covent Garden for three years now, is surely the most famous and controversial female ballet dancer today. The main reason for her fame is that her legs go up high, but it also helps that her feet are strikingly arched, that her hair is a singular shade of henna, and that her facial personality is both gamine and mignonne. Several of those who object to her complain that she has technique but no feeling. The reverse is nearer the truth. As an actress, Guillem is adult, assured, involved and serious. True, she is never moving - but that is because her physical training will not let her be. On Wednesday she returned to the role of Nikiya, the temple dancer who is the heroine of La Bayadere. She is always eyecatching. She addresses each character with perfect attention, and she demonstrates Nikiya's emotions - love, jealousy, rage, scorn, grief - with intelligence. But her feeling never grips us, because her Parisian training has painstakingly removed any true centre from her style. It was curious on Wednesday to watch her beside Deborah Bull, who played her rival, Gamzati. Bull, a rather two-dimensional actress, sneers and hams her way through Gamzati. She likes to underline her points by flashing her eyes, grinning, lifting her chin haughtily; and also lets her mouth drop open. Her dancing is exact but heavy; she is best in roles that have no kind of lightness. Nonetheless, Bull has a certain force. Her gestures are supported from the torso. Guillem, by contrast, is so sophisticated that she makes everyone else onstage look provincial. But she has no force, and no tone. Whether miming or dancing, her movement is, in the wrong sense of the word, weightless. This is also why, as Natalia Petrovna in A Month in the Country, she cannot convey passion; and this is why as Cinderella she had no vulnerability. She was strongly partnered on Wednesday by Zoltan Solymosi, the Hungarian dancer who is completing his first season with the Royal. Now here is someone who really is not much of an actor. When he has to sit loyally by his fiancee Gamzati while his true love, Nikiya, is dancing ardently before them, he seemed merely to have switched his mind off. Still, he is a real dancer, with tone, weight, force in plentiful supply; and (unlike so many rising Royal men) he never turns the force into strain. His dancing is big, handsome, obvious and easy to enjoy. In the 1960s the Royal learnt much from having Rudolf Nureyev as a permanent guest artist. Do the powers that be at Covent Garden think that today's Royal can profit similarly from Sylvie Guillem? I hope not. The more closely you analyse her style, the less truly classical it is. And, after three years, nobody seems to have learnt anything from her - not even her many incidental virtues (authority, definition, chic). She keeps to herself, they keep to themselves, everybody consents to put on a show when the curtain rises, but nobody learns from the experience. Strange.</p>

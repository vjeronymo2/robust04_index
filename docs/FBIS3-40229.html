			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Cao Mingcui [2580 2494 5050], Luo Fengguang </F> [5012 7364 0342], et al. of the National Laboratory of Laser  Technology, Huazhong (Central China) University of Science &amp;  Technology, Wuhan 430074: ``Four-Function Exchange-Switch  Optical Omega Network for Digital Optical Switching Network,''  supported by grants from NDSTIC's Science Fund and NSFC; MS  received 13 Oct 92, revised 25 Jan 93]    [Abstract] An optical Omega network with a four-function  optical exchange-switch for a digital optical switching network  is presented. The principle of the optical implementation of the  four-function exchange-switch and Omega network via an 8-pixel  liquid-crystal spatial light modulator (LCSLM) and special  polarizing prisms is discussed in detail. The optical system and  experimental results with twisted-nematic liquid crystal plates  are given.    Figures 1, 3, 4, and 6, reproduced below, show an Omega  interconnection network (P.S. = perfect shuffle, A-L are the  twelve 2 x 2 switches), a schematic diagram of the optical Omega  network with four-function optical exchange-switch (I and II are  polarizing optical prisms, lines AB and CD indicate polarizing  films, C[.sup]0[/] and C[.sub]4[/] are two of the eight  pixels in the LCSLM, and PB[.sup]1[/] and PB[.sub]2[/] are  prism blocks), the four states of the exchange-switch  corresponding to the different states of the liquid-crystal  pixels, and a schematic diagram of the optical Omega  interconnection network with four-function optical  exchange-switch arrays, respectively. Figures 2, 5, and 7, not  reproduced, show a simple schematic of a four-function exchange  switch, five photographs (input light-beam permutation, left  P.S. connection, right P.S. connection, down-spread connection,  and up-spread connection) of the experimental results for the  four-function optical exchange-switch, and five photographs of  the experimental results for the optical Omega network with  four-function optical exchange-switch, respectively. There are  no tables.   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-29A>           Figure 1. The Omega Interconnection Network (N = 8) </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-29B>           Figure 3.

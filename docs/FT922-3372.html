			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Qualifying assets The stock market has long been taking property company asset values with a pinch of salt. But yesterday's announcement that the auditors Ernst &amp; Young intend to qualify Regalian's report and accounts is nevertheless welcome for bringing the issue out into the open. No doubt the firm's decision owes something to the self-interest of the accountancy profession. Investors have been getting increasingly litigious of late - and not just on the far side of the Atlantic. So when a board of directors that its assets are worth 105p per share and the market is only prepared to pay 22p (or 15p by yesterday's close) it is understandable that discretion should prevail. Valuation, of course, has always been an inexact science and never more so than in current market conditions. The problem in the Regalian case is not just that there are few deals against which to measure the company's estimates, but the fact that the valuations have been carried out by the directors themselves. This is perfectly acceptable under accounting standards as they stand, but there is surely now a case for making independent valuations compulsory. Without this, further qualifications are inevitable, something which housebuilders and retailers as well as other property companies may care to ponder.</p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RUBEN BLADES' PERFORMANCE A GOOD OMEN FOR LATIN JAZZ  </P> <P> In many ways, Sunday night's Ruben Blades concert at the Ventura Theatre could  be seen as a good omen for Latin jazz and salsa on the West Coast.  </P> <P> Blades isn't new to this edge of the continent. His mission of broadening  salsa's boundaries by fusing it with new-jazz and world-beat inflections and a  rich tradition of Latino narrative balladry has grown synergistically with his  movie career.  </P> <P> Moreover, though the New York veterans who invented salsa more than two decades  ago are faced with losing a new Latino generation as it forges a Latin hip-hop  identity, they still tour here. Meanwhile, the handful of local bands, many  with deep jazz roots, are surviving with modest success.  </P> <P> What Panama's hybrid salsa-jazz-movie superstar brought to his wildly  enthusiastic fans was the promise of more live performances at smaller clubs  like the Ventura -- and the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano where Blades  plays Wednesday night.  </P> <P> And, despite periodic sound problems which made it difficult to hear his voice,  Blades managed to provide local salsa acts with a new standard.  </P> <P> His band, Son del Solar, has expanded to 11 members with the addition of  trombonists "Papo" Vasquez and Reinaldo Jorge, who have had a humanizing effect  on the band: They lend flashes of heat and color to the jazzier, cooler,  overtly synthesized sound of such songs as "Nacer de Ti" ("Born From You") and  "Patria" ("Motherland"), Blades' best love song to date, from his current  "Antecedente" album.  </P> <P> Against the brutal accuracy of Robert Ameen's drumming on traps, Blades  returned to his extroverted storytelling style. His fans needn't have badgered  him with requests for songs from his early days (like 1978, when Blades changed  salsa's face by recording "Pedro Navaja," the music's best-selling single  ever). He obliged willingly.  </P> <P> If there was an awkward moment during his performance, it was when Blades  prefaced two of his songs from his English-language "Nothing but the Truth"  album by taking a shot at critics who have stereotyped him as merely a salsero  (Third World artist). In some ways Blades is right: His English-speaking voice  is indeed remarkably flexible, especially in lower, slower jazz registers.  </P> <P> But his performance of "Hopes on Hold" -- a rock-inflected collaboration with  Lou Reed -- underscored the album's weaknesses in songwriting. Many of the  songs from "Nothing but the Truth" simply sound stilted -- like  well-intentioned but awkward translations.  </P> <P>  Ruben Blades plays Wednesday at 8 and 10:30 p.m. at the Coach House, 33157  Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $19.50. Information: (714)  496-8930.  </P></p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Election news gives strong boost to equities - Market report A burst of strength by the dollar, which helped stimulate a round of big gains across international bond markets, provided the perfect trigger for a London stock market primed to move ahead yesterday. The wave of Republican victories in the US mid-term congressional elections set the scene for international markets, with the dollar racing higher as the election news swept around the world, boosting bond and equity markets. The euphoria produced by the dollar saw the FT-SE 100 Index penetrate the 3,100 mark in midsession before coming off the top minutes before the close of trading and settling a net 35.8 up at 3,099.6. The late downturn in London came in the wake of a sharp setback on Wall Street, where the Dow Average, up 38 points shortly after the opening, was virtually level as London closed and down almost 10 points an hour or so afterwards. Traders in London professed concern at the slide on Wall Street, which they said led to some determined selling of the Footsie future after hours. 'We felt very firm all day, but things are getting confused now; Wall Street remains the key to European markets,' said one dealer. He added that the next phase of the series of US bond auctions, which total Dollars 29bn, would be crucial to the market's performance, as would the Bundesbank meeting today. A senior marketmaker at one of the big European securities houses adopted a more positive view of the market, taking the view that a bout of profit-taking had been expected after a near 50-point rise in the market. 'I think we'll be fine, as long as we can hang on to close above 3,100 at the end of the week,' he said. One real bonus for the market post the US elections was the sharp increase in the level of business yesterday. Turnover expanded rapidly to reach 728.3m shares, the highest for almost a month. It was pointed out, however, that 'bed and breakfast', or tax-related deals, accounted for at least 15 per cent of that total. A large number of these trades were said to have been executed by UBS, the Swiss securities house. There are rumours in the market that the UK chancellor of the exchequer could include moves to prohibit such deals in the November 29 budget. The FT-SE 100 began the session in fine form, with marketmakers hoisting their opening prices and pushing the 100-index up 12 points. Buying interest from international institutions began to gather momentum in mid-morning, when dealers picked up hints of a strong opening by Wall Street, and the index surged ahead to the day's peak of 3,112.0 shortly before US markets came in. Thereafter all eyes were fixed on the dollar and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, with debt products helping to sustain equities until just before the close of trading. Interest in the market's second liners was much more subdued and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index could manage only a 13.6 rise at 3,533.3. The demolition of the Democrats in the US saw UK drugs stocks surge ahead, with analysts taking the view that capping of drugs prices as part of the US health care reforms proposed by the Clinton administration would be much harder to implement after the Republicans gained control of the two houses of Congress. Cable and Wireless was one of the Footsie's worst performers as the market showed its disappointment with the poor figures from the company's Mercury telecoms division. Bank shares attracted strong support, especially NatWest, where the recent flow of ADRs, resulting from NatWest's acquisition of Citizens Financial, and a major drag on the NatWest share price, was said to have dried up. Utilities suffered from the Labour Party's proposals for the imposition of a mixture of windfall taxation and a public dividend on the water and electricity companies.</p>

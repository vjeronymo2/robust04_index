			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Business and the Law: Ruling on car quotas queried - European Court A European Commission decision not to investigate a complaint by consumers against an agreement restricting imports of Japanese cars into the UK was overturned last week by the European Court of First Instance. The complaint concerned an agreement between the British Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) and the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) restricting the export of Japanese cars to the UK to 11 per cent of the total annual UK car sales. The European Consumers Association (BEUC) and the National Consumer Council (NCC) argued the agreement was contrary to the Rome treaty's ban on restrictive agreements. They also alleged restrictions on access to the market resulting from the agreement constituted an unlawful abuse of a dominant position by SMMT. The Commission took the view that there was not a sufficient Community interest in opening a formal investigation procedure since the agreement would be terminated soon by the EC/Japan consensus on car exports. Under this, the EC committed itself to abolishing national restrictions of any kind by January 1 1993, while Japan accepted a transitional period until December 31 1999 to facilitate the adjustment of Community manufacturers to adequate international competitiveness. The Court treated the Commission's letter to the consumer groups as a definitive rejection of their complaints. The Commission's letter stated three grounds. Each justified the way the Commission exercised its discretion on competition complaints as recognised by the CFI in the Automec II case (T-24/90). The CFI confirmed the Commission was not bound to investigate a formal competition complaint. But it reiterated the Commission was obliged to consider carefully the factual and legal issues brought to its attention by a complainant, to assess whether those issues indicated conduct liable to distort competition within the common market and affect trade between member states. Where the Commission rejected a complaint without an investigation, the purpose of judicial review by the CFI was to ensure that the challenged decision was based on a correct assessment of the facts and was not invalidated by any error of law, manifest error of assessment, or abuse of power. The court held all three grounds invalid. The first and main ground was undermined by a manifest error of assessment. The main reason given for not investigating the past and present SMMT-JAMA arrangements was that there was no reason to doubt that the arrangements would end by January 1 1993 because of the commercial consensus on car exports. None of the documentary evidence relied on by the Commission established this would necessarily happen. In particular, the Commission failed to explain why the transitional regime to December 31 1999 would be based on anything other than the agreement. It was not impossible, therefore, that the arrangements for implementing the transitional regime were incompatible with EC competition law. The second ground was wrong in law. The Commission wrongly treated the agreement as if it were a national measure of commercial policy by relying on its past approval by the UK, when it merely involved private economic operators. The fact that the agreement was known, permitted or even encouraged by national authorities did not exclude the competition rules. The Commission's third ground for rejecting the complaint, namely that the alleged infringement did not significantly affect trade between member countries, was also wrong in law and insufficiently reasoned. It could not be justified solely by asserting that the infringement did not primarily concern trade between member countries. The CFI considered the arrangements, by their very nature, were liable to impair the functioning of the common market and the natural movement of trade because they restricted imports into the Community and affected the entire territory of a member country.

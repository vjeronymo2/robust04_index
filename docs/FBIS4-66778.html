			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rashid Hasan: "National Bank Results; Signs of </F> New Phase"]    [Text] A few days ago, the Saudi National Commercial Bank  published its general budget report for 1993, accompanied by the  usual explanatory financial data. This is the first time in  years that the bank's management has offered such a revealing  review of its situation and performance in various fields,  because the general budget for 1991-92 was not published in any  detail or, at least, did not receive a sufficient amount of  attention and absorption at that time. In view of the choice and  scope of publication, attributable to the bank being a private  noncorporate company, providing financial data in this detail to  the public is, of itself, the most important indicator of  changes that have suddenly occurred in the situation of this  important national institution. After the difficult  circumstances to which it was subjected in 1991, the National  Bank weathered the crisis in 1992, and entered into  unprecedented activity under the circumstances by exposing its  total performance to market pressures and the scrutiny of  overseers. This in itself is the most important factor of future  strength and the biggest incentive for the bank's progress, so  that it may reclaim its natural position as the kingdom's most  deep-rooted and strongest bank.    Because numbers are just numbers, we are taking this  occasion  to publish this report so that its numbers can be quickly read,  while pointing out the most important aspects that will  especially interest the ordinary citizen.  <H5>  Status of Deposits </H5>   The National Bank is keen on repeatedly making sure that the  developments to which it was subjected have not affected its  base of depositors, which clearly has been loyal to the bank.  This fact is revealed by the stability of clients' deposits of  nearly 49 billion Saudi riyals [R], which remain virtually  unchanged from 1992. On the contrary, one could say that  customer deposits increased "slightly" in 1993. However, this  increase was not obvious, because the bank's clients kept an  increasing part of their deposits in government bonds, since  these bonds had a greater return than interest on deposits and,  at the same time, had convenient incentives. As an example, the  volume of customer investments of this type of financial  instrument increased from R5.7 billion in 1992 to R7 billion in  1993.    However, total deposits in the National Bank were affected  in  1992 (in comparison with 1991) because the bank's operations in  New York and London were halted. The suspension of the bank's  two international branches resulted in transferring a major part  of foreign operations to other banks and, consequently, the  removal of deposits connected with those activities. The New  York branch alone represented $4 billion which, for the most  part, were deposits of institutions and banks. Moreover, the  budget of the London branch ranged between $1.5 billion and $2  billion. It was no surprise, therefore, that customer deposits  dropped in 1992 to R48.7 billion from the approximately R65.5  billion at the end of 1991. However, the largest portion of the  decrease in this area stemmed from the removal of deposits of  organizations and groups doing business abroad and not from the  removal of deposits of individuals and traditional clients.    At the same time, the deposits of banks do not represent an  important source of the National Bank's funds, which has always  been a net creditor of the Interbank market. This explains the  lack of important deposits from international banks in the  National Bank, while the deposits of Saudi banks in 1993  totalled R5.1 billion. This is a modest figure as a percentage  of the budget and of the total deposits in the bank.    As a result of the drop in total deposits, the size of the  general budget report declined from R78 billion in 1991 to R63.7  billion in 1992. The 1993 statement has slightly improved, as it  has again risen to R66.8 billion, an increase of nearly 5  percent.  <H5>  Investments </H5>   The drop in deposits for 1992, as a result of the decrease  in  the bank's foreign operations, was accompanied by a comparable  drop with regard to assets. The most prominent indicator of that  was the bank's reduction of its portfolio of deposits with banks  (which ranged from R24.4 billion in 1991 to R15.8 billion in  1992). There was also a reduction of the bank's portfolio of  stocks, bonds, and securities by about R4.4 billion. [sentence  as published] This is the equivalent of approximately R13  billion.    The National Bank had to liquidate its operations in New  York  within a 90-day period, as set forth by American authorities,  which was by the end of October of that year. This explains why  the 1992 budget carries the full brunt of the closure of the  branches.    In contrast to that, it should be noted that the bank's  credit activities in Saudi Arabia remained stable and were  unaffected by events abroad. The net from loans and credit  totaled R25.9 billion in 1991 and 25.1 billion in 1992, rising  to R27.5 billion in 1993.    One of the most important developments vis-a-vis the  National  Commercial Bank, which is clearly evident in its report, is the  continual decrease over the past two years in the volume of  letters of credit and, consequently, the financing of imports.  These documentary credit activities in the 1993 budget totaled  R3.6 billion, which is 33 percent less than the 1992 figure  (which was R5.4 billion) and 40 percent less than 1991, which  totaled R6 billion.    We believe that this aspect is one of the most important  factors preoccupying the bank's management, because it pertains  to its traditional share of the commercial money market and  importing activities by commercial groups and houses and,  consequently, income from brokerage commissions. This is assumed  to be an important source of net income.    It is probable that the loss of the New York and London  branches will have an impact on financing trade and imports.  These activities have also been affected by the position of  certain international banks (especially in Japan) with regard to  cooperation in assuming credits. In 1993, they may also have  been affected by the drop in financing imports by the private  sector, the guiding of governmental expenditures, and the  decrease in financing of oil operations because of the drop in  crude oil prices. However, it is certain that the percentage of  decrease in documentary credits in the National Bank is higher  than the rate of decrease in the market, because of other  reasons that we have mentioned. However, the bank is clearly  determined to regain its role and its share in this filed,  within the framework of a comprehensive plan to reestablish its  presence and operations in the market, especially after the  major increase in its capital to R6 billion.  <H5>  Strengthening the Conservative Trend </H5>   The 1993 statement clearly shows a shift in the bank's  policy  regarding currency circulation in future contracts, especially  in the currency market, because the decline of this item in the  chapter of regular accounts (i.e., those outside the budget) has  continued. The total future contracts to buy and sell foreign  operations was R34.2 billion in 1993, compared with 39.3 billion  in 1992, and approximately R89 billion in 1991.  <H5>  Hard Debts </H5>   The National Bank's 1993 statement contained further  evidence  of increased conservatism in evaluating its budget and assets,  since the total allocation for debt losses was R293.4 million,  compared with R81 million in 1992, and R470 million in 1991. At  present, the best evidence for this development is the  re-addition of major allocations for the decline in value of the  real estate portfolio, totaling R393.1 million, and other  allocations for the decline in value of other investments. This  totaled R170 million, which raises the total allocations for  1993 to R856.5 million.    It is worth pointing out that the real estate allocations  resulted from the bank's portfolio of real estate obtained as  part of debt settlements. This portfolio has decreased in value  as a result of the drop in real estate prices in 1993, and  because of the possibility that the sale price would be affected  by the size of the offer, particularly since the bank cannot  hold on to real estate for more than two years. In any event,  the belief is that the allocations are larger than what may be  required. However, they reflect the bank's desire for more  conservative policies with regard to evaluation of assets.  <H5>  Restructuring and Operating Costs </H5>   The 1993 National Commercial Bank Report included evidence  of  the stability of the bank's operating expenditures which, in  that year, totaled R1.432 billion, compared to R1.435 billion in  1992. Despite the fact that the National Bank has taken actions  to reduce staff and restructure operations, with the goal of  increasing efficiency and strengthening management, this process  did not begin until the latter part of 1993. Consequently, not  enough time has elapsed for this process' results to be  reflected in this report.    It is expected, therefore, that the bank will clearly show  stronger developments with regard to guiding expenses during  1994, especially with regard to salaries. However, the  possibility of increased reliance on modern technology, and the  development of other branches for capital investments, means  that total cost of operations could rise next year, despite  possible reductions in salaries.    One may view the 1993 budget report as the first one of the  National Bank's new stage of guidance and centralization.  However, this bank--conservative by nature--will avoid any  implementation cost, i.e., making a desired change by shock  methods. As is clearly shown by the bank's performance in 1993,  this next phase could be called: searching for beneficial ways  to restore the bank to its natural position. However, it is  important to implement it now, given the lack of anticipated  profit from international branches abroad. Here is the  challenge, because it is difficult to visualize a bank the size  of the National Bank without international branches. This matter  will raise a question sooner or later and, in any event, rumors  are strong in this regard.</p>

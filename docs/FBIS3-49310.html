			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Nikica Valentic by Aleksa </F> Crnjakovic; place and date not given: "We Deserve a Favorable  Judgment"]    [Text] Nikica Valentic, a 45-year-old originally from  Lika, a lawyer by training and a modern manager by vocation, is  not really a typical politician, although he has, by chance,  been thrown into politics in the most direct way. He does not  like public personal promotions, he does not speak in phrases,  he is not entirely serious even when he explains the most  serious moves of the government, he does not act to please, and  he is not a political pawn. He knows what he wants, and he  knows how to get it. People trust him; he is an authority and  would be considered one even if he were discussing the spiritual  life of mosquitoes, for example.    However, apart from the respect that he inspires when you  talk to him, you feel as if you were sitting with a childhood  friend who had suddenly appeared. We hardly managed to fit into  his crowded schedule. Prime Minister Valentic works 16 hours a  day every day. Who knows if he will get at least the first 10  minutes of the New Year to spend with his family?!  <H5>  It Is Hard To Assess Oneself </H5>   [Crnjakovic] It has been nine months since you were  appointed, which is long enough for an inventory. What could  you say that you pride yourself on, without false modesty?    [Valentic] It is really hard to assess oneself, and that is  not just a cliche. We are all subjective. However, when you do  this kind of work, you have to do it with a certain amount of  criticism, which we do. With all the self-criticism, I think  that we deserve a favorable judgment for what we have done so  far. I am not making excuses for myself when I say that we  inherited a difficult situation. There was a war on, and then  there were the consequences of the war, which, naturally, "gave  birth" to the 30-percent inflation, heading toward 40 percent.  We were quite aware that if we reached 50 percent per month,  there would be no basis for recovery, and we would lose  credibility. People did not believe that we had the strength to  do anything radical, and they were nervous, but a week after  taking over we started working on the stabilization program. Do  you remember the troubles in April? That was when we took over.    [Crnjakovic] Do you mean the energy collapse in Dalmatia?    [Valentic] Yes, I am referring to the darkness in Dalmatia,  which is only one of the many consequences of the war, not of  the negligence of my predecessors. I am referring to the time  when everything had to be done, the most important thing being  to abolish the selective loans from the primary currency issue,  so that the preparations for the sowing, the harvest, and the  crop purchases could be made. For six months we worked on the  basis for the stabilization program. The commodity and foreign  exchange reserves had to be improved, and the disparity of the  prices of electricity, oil, and gas eliminated.... We also  created the minimal basis for the program in the banking system.  When I list only some of the things offhand, it now seems that  they were easy to do. However, they demanded a lot of energy  and radical moves. In expert circles it is believed that  spring, or the beginning of the year, is the ideal time for  stabilization changes, but we had no time to lose, because in  three months inflation would have reached 100 percent.    [Crnjakovic] In the last three months of this year you have  managed to curb inflation. Was it perhaps done in an artificial  way?    [Valentic] There are no surrogates in economics. We brought  inflation down to zero, and it may even become negative in the  future. There is no artificial inflation, since we have not  frozen anything, either salaries or prices. The only question  now is whether we will manage to keep public expenditure in  check. Croatia has inherited a huge public debt, from old  foreign currency savings accounts to bonds, the losses and the  rehabilitation of the electricity generating industry, and the  health system. We have managed to reorganize all these sectors  to a large extent. The electricity industry is no longer  suffering great losses, and we have prevented the health system  from collapsing. At present, we are keeping all the important  sectors under control. We cannot have another collapse of the  electricity system, and we are now considering the means for  providing energy for next winter, since we have taken care of  this one.    [Crnjakovic] What about production, the main precondition  for long-term economic stability?    [Valentic] We do not expect a drastic drop in production  next year. It has dropped by 40 percent in the past three  years, but that is because of the war.  <H5>  There Is No Magic Wand </H5>   [Crnjakovic] Are you expecting a wave of bankruptcies, and,  hence, strikes?    [Valentic] There will be some bankruptcies, but no major  ones.    [Crnjakovic] However, many people will lose their jobs. Has  the government prepared any preventive measures?    [Valentic] Yes, we have secured funds to provide the  incentive for creating new jobs, for the reorganization of  banks, the shipbuilding industry, and some agricultural estates.  My estimate is that there will be more "internal cleanings",  reducing capacities, than bankruptcies. However, this is normal  in any system. What is important is that the state prepares a  social program, which we have done. In any market economy you  have certain companies going bankrupt, and new ones opening, so  people are on the labor market, and they get new jobs. The  structure of the Croatian economy is to a great extent  socialist, and changes always bring negative consequences too.  However, that is a pattern that one cannot change.    [Crnjakovic] There is an impression that the government  gives too little incentive to small entrepreneurs, a process  which the sluggish bureaucracy ardently helps. To start a firm,  you need to stand in line for hours just to get a stamp.    [Valentic] You are exaggerating. Anyone can open a firm in  two days; there are no bureaucratic, customs, or tax barriers  there. These are people who basically know nothing about  economics, but interfere anyway. I accept criticism, but one  should not exaggerate. We must simply realize that we were in a  complete collapse, and that several governments will have to  succeed one another before we create a stable economic system.  There is no magic wand. If you push one lever, another comes  up. As far as small entrepreneurs are concerned, I have to tell  you that they are in a better position because they can cheat  the state more easily than the big corporations, and we will  have to put a stop to that. Do you imagine that we do not see  that owners ostensibly pay workers 100 German marks [DM], so  that they can provide fewer benefits, while they pay them  another 200 "under the table"? We are not so naive.    [Crnjakovic] Is there a political consensus for the  stabilization program -- does your team work together, or is  there any banging under the table?    [Valentic] The government is a closely knit team. There was  no dissenting voting at any of the many sessions, and we made  all the decisions, after they were carefully gone through at  coordination and working groups, by consensus. There have been  some serious confrontations, because each ministry would like to  get as much of the cake as possible, but this government will be  remembered for being a team. If this were not so, the program  would not have been successful. Anyone can attack the  government, but it will not be easily shaken. A political  consensus really does exist. Even the opposition, which, by  definition, simply has to attack, offers significant support.  There have been no significant reproaches to our work, from  either expert circles or the trade unions. I am happy with the  support that we have.  <H5>  The Time of People Being Worn Out Quickly </H5>   [Crnjakovic] Considering this general affection, we suppose  that this government will last quite a long time. How long do  you expect it will be in office?    [Valentic] Everything depends on future results. For the  time being, we have a positive balance. The average salary used  to be DM140, and now it is DM280. Our foreign exchange reserves  were DM1.2 billion, and now they are DM1.3 billion. The  commodity reserves have been increased by several hundred  million German marks. Are these improvisations or facts? Our  energy reserves have been increased, the situation with the  supply of electricity has been stabilized, the health system has  been reorganized, and the retirement fund is doing even better.  The government will last as long as it endures according to  market principles. At present we have a stable situation, there  are no demands for anyone's resignation, and we have full  political support. However, we are not deceiving ourselves. I  am not saying that we can last very long. In our situation even  several months is a long time, and a year is an eternity.    This is the time in which people are being worn out quickly.  We had four government sessions in just one week before New  Year, there was a parliament session, and another session was  held, and on Monday we are starting again at full force. We  will even be working on Epiphany [6 January]. This is a crazy  pace.    [Crnjakovic] This pace will probably make your life as prime  minister shorter?    [Valentic] This is not an excuse, but many know that I have  serious arthritic problems. This is not an illness from which  you die, but one with which you die. My illness demands a lot  of rest, treatment at spas, and a quiet life with no travel or  frequent changes of climate. But I will certainly not run away  and leave those who trusted me, and gave me the support without  which we would not have been able to implement the stabilization  program. However, it is a fact that one cannot take this pace  very long even when one is completely healthy. We work 16, even  18 hours a day. Let us go back to the question, though: I  believe that we will last six more months, which means that we  will maintain production at this level, that there will be no  inflation, social unrest, or strikes. If we succeed in that,  then we will have done a great deal of work.  <H5>  I Am Not Buying a Company </H5>   [Crnjakovic] When you leave, will you remain in politics?    [Valentic] Never. When I am done with this job, I will go  back to private business.    [Crnjakovic] What kind of business?    [Valentic] Some combination of law practice and modern  financial transactions. I think I am one of the rare people who  can organize a group of top experts -- lawyers, attorneys,  financial specialists -- that can work on infrastructure and  construction. I have no political ambitions; I am not going to  buy any company. It is easier for me to start from scratch than  buy old trash. Many will regret buying companies with old  technology, and there are hardly any Croatian factories that  have modern technology at the European level. This is at the  same time a reply to the attacks of some who have bought up  factories: Let them buy them! All those who lack  competitiveness will fail. As for me, I will start from the  beginning. If you are a little late in the beginning, you can  make up for it by not having old organization, so when you start  you are much faster.    [Crnjakovic] What is your comment to the claims that 10  businessmen have bought Croatia?    [Valentic] These 10 people hold no more than 2 to 3  percent of the social capital. At present there are 100 strong  industrialists in Croatia, and tens of thousands of rich ones.  Over 50 percent of Croatia has not been privatized at all.  However, the property that has been bought is yet to be put  into operation. I am not afraid that Croatia could become a  "banana republic". There will be hundreds of industrialists,  but there are also about 400,000 small stockholders. Even if  half of them fail, there will still be 200,000. Unfortunately,  some stratification will occur.    [Crnjakovic] You have recently said that it is better to  have property belonging to someone than no one. Will we not  wake up one morning to discover that our country is in someone  else's hands?    [Valentic] When we open up completely, when there is a stock  market, owners will change daily, so that the worker will not  even know who he is really working for. This is also normal.  We cannot have foreign capital and control over everything at  the same time. However, we will not sell our property for next  to nothing.  <H5>  It Is Impossible To Return Everything </H5>   [Crnjakovic] I must ask you the topical question: Will you  be the prime minister who will start the process of  denationalization?    [Valentic] I will start it, but I will not finish it. It is  a very complex process. I am not one of those who think they  can work miracles; I cannot promise such things. We will  probably accept the Hungarian model of monetary restitution.  How do you return someone's property that was taken away 70  years ago, when you can not even return the property to someone  from Vukovar? It is impossible to return everything. There  will most certainly be no spectacular moves in that area.    [Crnjakovic] Are there going to be any spectacular moves in  the tax system? Everybody is complaining that the taxes are too  high, but no one can explain precisely what the essence of the  new system is. Could you tell us?    [Valentic] Not in this kind of conversation.    [Crnjakovic] Could you at least say how it will influence  the small man?    [Valentic] It will have almost no influence on him, as the  rates are low up to certain incomes. Higher incomes are taxed.  Even we, who have been working on introducing a new,  internationally compatible tax system, are not quite certain in  practice, and we expect difficulties in the first three months.  Tax reforms are in fact revolutions; countries usually take 10  years to prepare for them. There will be nervousness in the  beginning, but in a year we will have a well established system.  Its essence is that the total income is added up, and this  amount is then uniformly taxed. It is impossible to explain all  the taxes. I do not like giving interviews. I do not like to  be superficial, and it is impossible to be serious and explain  thoroughly. This is why I will give no more interviews.    [Crnjakovic] So I got in at the last moment?    [Valentic] Yes, you did. You reporters take sentences out  of context, and then they are transferred, and put into the  headlines.  <H5>  The State Will Pay as Much as It Can </H5>   [Crnjakovic] However, at least you know who to blame. What  would you politicians do without reporters?!    [Valentic] Now, you do know that I understand your  profession, and you also know that I am self-critical and that I  accept part of the blame. However, it is simply impossible to  resolve a problem in one conversation. You can discuss  politics, but economics is a trade.    [Crnjakovic] You have had numerous interviews with trade  union representatives, university students, old age  pensioners... which one was the most difficult?    [Valentic] With disabled veterans, for emotional and moral  reasons. We must do absolutely everything for these people.    [Crnjakovic] Will you?    [Valentic] They will come first; we have assigned DM163  million for our defenders. I am also sorry for old age  pensioners, who keep attacking me. We can start printing money,  but then their pensions will amount to DM5, as in Serbia,  instead of the DM200 that is the average pension now. I was  advised not to attend the interview with the university students  because they would whistle me down. However, that is also part  of the job. I am one of those people who face problems, not  avoid them.    [Crnjakovic] So did they whistle?    [Valentic] No, they greeted me with a round of applause. We  had a very open conversation.    [Crnjakovic] One more topical question: What will happen to  the old foreign currency savings accounts?    [Valentic] Whether the state should take over the public  debt is a question. The state will pay as much as it can; we  are servicing part of the interest. The state can not return a  couple of billion dollars overnight, but we will do it in  several years. We will reduce the public debt.  <H5>  [Box, p 13] </H5> <H5>  Like a Drill in the Stone </H5>   [Crnjakovic] Will Nikica Valentic be remembered in history  as the prime minister whose term of office saw the kuna  [currency in use in fascist Croatia 1941-5] reintroduced?    [Valentic] Money is the reflection of the power of the  economy. We must not jump the gun. An orderly economic  situation greatly depends on the political situation, on the  resolutions for these areas. However, I assure you that even if  things get worse we will not give up our program, and will not  allow the printing of money, so that we get the same situation  as in Serbia, where monthly inflation is 400,000 percent -- in  the Weimar Germany it was 30,000 percent. If the political  situation remains as it is now, we will make more radical moves.  If there is no more war and the situation gets better, we have  the chance of keeping inflation below 3 percent per month. If  production does not fall, and there is no social unrest, we  could introduce the new Croatian currency by State Day. This is,  I repeat, if there is peace.    I believe that I will be prime minister until then. I will  consider my part of the job -- the first part of the second  stage of rehabilitation and restructuring -- done. After that  it is important that my successor continues where I started.  You know, it is important not to keep changing the program all  the time. I always compare myself to a drill in the stone:  Sooner or later the bore will break, but it is not the same if  it breaks at the first or the 20th centimeter, and if drilling  the same hole continues, or a new one is opened. This time  there will be no new holes; whoever comes after me will continue  drilling.  <H5>  [Box, p 13] </H5> <H5>  The Mercep Case Should Not Be Politicized </H5>   [Crnjakovic] Could you give me your political comment on the  following: Dr. Greguric, a former prime minister, questioned  the credibility of the press report on Mercep's troops. Certain  information from one of the ministries, that is, the office  headed by Mr. Manolic, obviously leaked straight to the press.  What is this all about?    [Valentic] I am not familiar with the details, since I have  not discussed it with anyone, but have only heard the  representative's question and the minister's answer, like  yourself. However, I can comment on it. It is up to the state  attorney's office to start the proceedings within their  authority and jurisdiction. In principle, I am against such  cases being solved in the papers instead of in court.  Information can be published, but in a legal way.    However, regardless of the press and the representative's  question, the proceedings are under way, and all the material  facts will be established -- the information in question is not  a fact but circumstantial evidence. The government can not  state a political position on this; it is up to the court to  establish the truth and justice, and justice is always  attainable, even if it is slow. Only the court can establish  the facts. I will insist on making the process faster, so that  the case is not politicized any further.</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: Hostile W. A. Deutsher bid for Siddons Ramset fits ITW's Asian ambitions W. A. DEUTSHER, an Australian subsidiary of Illinois Tool Works (ITW), the US engineering group, yesterday said it would review all the operations of Siddons Ramset, the hardware and fasteners group, if its ADollars 94m (USDollars 64.8m) hostile takeover bid was successful. Deutsher said in its formal takeover document that the offer would enable ITW to expand in south-east Asia and extend its Ramset businesses to Australia, New Zealand and the UK. However, Siddons said both the ITW offer and a rival ADollars 86m bid by Pacific BBA, a subsidiary of BBA, the UK motor components maker, significantly undervalued the company. Siddons said it expected to publish an independent valuation of its assets before the end of the year. Deutsher's offer document said ITW would try to optimise Siddons' Asian distribution network and expand its product range and technology skills. Deutsher said no decision had been made about the future of Siddons' businesses or future employment levels. The offer said the bid would be funded by drawing on an unused USDollars 300m revolving credit facility with 13 US and international banks led by the First International Bank of Chicago. Pacific BBA has not matched ITW's offer, but has reserved its right to increase its bid.</p>

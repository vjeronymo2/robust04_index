			<p>BFN     [Text] Panama City, June 11 (XINHUA) -- An average of 300  Chinese ships pass through the Panama Canal each year, with 130  of them flying the national flag of China, according to Cheng  Zhongbiao, president of the China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO).    Speaking here on Friday [10 June], the visiting Chinese  official said that in order to strengthen cooperation with Latin  America in sea transport, COSCO in May 1994 began to operate  three regular shipping lines to the region, two for  containerized cargo and one for general cargo, visiting several  ports in the area.    China is continuing its policy of opening to the outside  world and is increasing its commercial exchange with Latin  America, Cheng said.    COSCO is cooperating with its Latin American counterparts  and  is doing its share to promote economic development in the world,  he added.    The Chinese maritime transport official is touring Latin  America and North America. He arrived in Panama City last night  after visiting Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Lima.</p>

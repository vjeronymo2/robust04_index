			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. AND SOVIETS SEEK JOINT WAR ON TERRORISM  </P> <P> In the strongest indication to date of Soviet interest in superpower  cooperation on international terrorism, a U.S.-Soviet counterterrorism task  force today will issue a sweeping list of recommendations for joint action.  </P> <P> The proposals include the "timely exchange of information about terrorist  groups or individuals, their tactics, plans, specific operations and supply,  training and support structures," members of the task force told The Times.  </P> <P> They also call for mutual assistance in investigations of aircraft bombings, in  release of hostages, in restricting the movement and financial activities of  terrorists and in preventing terrorist acquisitions of weapons of mass  destruction -- from plastic explosives to chemical or nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sensitive Stumbling Block  </P> <P> Sharing intelligence on terrorism has been the most sensitive stumbling block  to superpower cooperation because both nations fear disclosure will endanger or  expose sources.  </P> <P> The weeklong, closed-door talks in Santa Monica held by the Soviet-U.S. Task  Force to Prevent Terrorism are considered important in testing the waters for  more formal efforts. Both Bush Administration and Soviet officials have  expressed interest in probing the depth of commitment on specific joint actions  -- especially on intelligence issues -- through unofficial channels before  direct negotiations.  </P> <P> "Terrorism has been a continuing source of tension for many years," said  terrorism specialist Brian Jenkins of the RAND Corp., which hosted the  discussions. "For the two countries now to address this issue with the degree  of candor that has been evident throughout the talks is extraordinary. There  was nothing that was not on the table.  </P> <P> "We were specific and often blunt about what concerns us the most. The Soviets  were equally frank about putting their cards on the table."  </P> <P> "The Soviet Union is genuinely committed to do whatever is necessary to  eliminate terrorism, preferably with the United States," said Andrei Shoumikhin  of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, a member of the Soviet delegation.  </P> <P> The group of 10 American and 10 Soviet experts on terrorism met in Moscow in  January for the first discussions on terrorism held at any level between the  United States and Soviet Union, which helped pave the way for the opening of  formal superpower talks on the issue last June.  </P> <P> The task force proposals issued today will be relayed to both governments in  preparation for what Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign  Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze announced last week would be a second round of  official talks on terrorism in early 1990.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Indication of Interest  </P> <P> Although this week's talks are unofficial, the Soviet delegation includes the  two highest-ranking former KGB officials ever to publicly visit the United  States. Their presence is considered an indication of Soviet interest in  establishing a new framework for joint counterterrorism efforts.  </P> <P> "The KGB has sent a clear message. It is willing to cooperate with the CIA,"  said John Marks, chairman of Search for Common Ground, a Washington-based  public-interest group that was one of the talks' co-sponsors.  </P> <P> The new spirit of cooperation was evident in a recommendation by former leading  U.S. and Soviet intelligence officials at the conference.  </P> <P> "No nation, nor any of its government services nor representatives, should  engage in or sponsor, encourage, train or supply any kind of terrorist  activity," it declares.  </P> <P> It also calls on nations that condemn terrorism to "take all appropriate  measures to prevent terrorism and to persuade other nations and groups with  which they have contact to cease and desist from employing terrorism tactics."  </P> <P> The proposals even urge joint U.S.-Soviet efforts to prevent portable missiles  and munitions from falling into the hands of terrorists, and to recover those  already available on the black market.  </P> <P> On the growing problem with narco-terrorism, the task force calls for the  superpowers to exchange information on production, smuggling and distribution  of drugs as well as to cooperate on restricting laundering of funds derived  from drug trafficking.  </P> <P> The American delegation included former CIA Director William Colby and former  Deputy CIA Director Ray S. Cline. The two former Soviet officials are Lt. Gen.  Fjodor Sherbak, who was deputy KGB chief, and Maj. Gen. Valentin Zvezdenkov,  who headed the KGB's counterterrorism unit for eight years.  </P> <P> "They pay a price for being here. The mere fact they are engaging in  discussions will be seen by some governments and groups as a hostile act,"  Jenkins said. "No matter what level of cooperation is ultimately established  between the two governments, terrorist groups now have to take into account  that KGB intelligence may be targeted against them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Forthcoming, Practical'  </P> <P> Colby described his former Soviet counterparts as "very forthcoming and  practical."  </P> <P> In addition, Cline said: "I'm impressed with the long experience in  counterterrorism of the Soviet participants. I am convinced that they have come  with a clear signal from their own government that it is in the Soviet interest  to come down on the side of combatting terrorism."  </P> <P> He said he thought Soviet cooperation was produced by more than just glasnost,  as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of openness is known.  </P> <P> "In my view, they have finally realized that terrorism may turn against the  Soviet Union, perhaps because of the increasing tension of ethnic minority  groups," he said.  </P> <P> Bush Administration sources also have speculated that ethnic and religious  turmoil in several Soviet republics, as well as a continuing exodus from East  Bloc nations, could lead to the emergence of new terrorist groups that may  target the Soviet Union or its personnel and facilities abroad.  </P></p>

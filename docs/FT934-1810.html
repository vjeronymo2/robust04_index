			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / European tie-up on telecoms/aviation Unisource, a Pan-European joint venture between the telecom companies of the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland, has entered into a partnership with Sita, a global data network operator owned by airlines, freight forwarders and other companies involved in world aviation, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. The alliance will give Unisource access to telecommunications networks outside of its base in Europe. For Sita, whose full name is Societe Internationale de Telecommunications Aeronautique, the partnership will open up opportunities to find customers outside the aviation sector. Unisource's aim is to provide 'seamless' global data communications to multinationals in direct competition with big telecommunications operators such as AT&amp;T of the US and British Telecom. Unisource and Sita said their networks were based on compatible technologies, making partnership between them straightforward.</p>

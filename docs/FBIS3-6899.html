			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's cabinet decided Friday [18 March] on a bill that  would require employers to set the retirement age for employees  at 60, starting in fiscal 1998.    The bill, to be sent soon to the Diet for approval,  stipulates the retirement age should "not be below 60" but  exempts jobs which are considered difficult for older workers.    It also gives the labor minister the authority to recommend  that employers secure jobs for employees until 65.    The bill, which would revise a law on job security for older  workers, also contains a relaxation of restrictions on the kinds  of jobs temporary workers are permitted to perform.    Under existing law, temporary staff are allowed for only 16  kinds of jobs, such as translators and secretaries, but the bill  would expand the scope for older workers to include all jobs  except cargo handling at ports, construction and security.</p>

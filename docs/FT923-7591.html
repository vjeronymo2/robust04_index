			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / US Money and Credit: Treasury market faces test of nerve SOME people, it seems, are never satisfied. Despite the fact that Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has sanctioned more interest rate cuts in the past 18 months than any of his predecessors over a comparable period, and despite borrowing costs being at their lowest level for almost 30 years, the call has gone up again for another policy ease. The politicians, of course, are still unhappy with the Fed for not doing more to boost economic activity, but in an election year that is to be expected. The economic pundits in the media also continue to press for further rate cuts, while plenty of their counterparts on Wall Street agree that more should be done to breathe fresh life into the weak recovery. All argue that recent economic indicators show interest rates need to go lower if consumers are to be persuaded to dig into their wallets and pick up their spending. Some go even further, such as Mr Ed Yardeni, the chief economist at brokerage house CJ Lawrence. Commenting on last week's 'disappointing' 0.4 per cent rise in July industrial production, Mr Yardeni said: 'Manufacturing production is at a standstill. Weak early August car sales are not encouraging. We believe lower interest rates are needed just to sustain slow growth in the economy.' The chances of a new cut in rates, however, are slim. For one, the sustained and troubling weakness in the dollar has left the Fed with less room to manoeuvre. Regular and co-ordinated intervention by US and European central banks to support the ailing currency during the past few weeks has shown how concerned the monetary authorities are by the steady decline in the dollar. The Fed is unlikely to give the green light to another interest rate reduction, which would make the dollar even less attractive to overseas investors, at a time when central banks worldwide are working hard at propping up the US currency. Second, the Treasury market is becoming more nervous about the outlook for efforts to reduce the budget deficit as the election battle hots up, and so another policy ease may not bring long-term market rates down much further. Last week was a clear example of how the bond market is unwilling to push long-term rates substantially lower. On Thursday, the 30-year bond nose-dived after Mr James Baker, the new chief of staff at the White House, said tax cuts should be the centrepiece of President George Bush's re-election campaign and second term. His comments immediately drew fire from bond analysts. Mr Mitchell Held, of Smith Barney, said that 'if Baker's statement is meant to imply that attempts to balance the budget will begin to play second fiddle to the need for new federal fiscal stimulus to undo the economy's lethargy, then the fixed-income market's disapproval has only begun to be heard.' More of that disapproval could be on display over the next few days during the Republican Party convention. The market is particularly concerned that the president may announce during his acceptance speech a tax cut as part of a package of economic stimuli aimed at recapturing the ground lost in the polls to Democratic nominee Governor Bill Clinton. Rumours that he may do just that were flying around Houston yesterday as delegates arrived for the convention, as was speculation that the president is ready to recommence hostilities with Iraq. It looks as though the next five days will be a test of the Treasury market's nerve - if it breaks, bond yields could head back up through 7.5 per cent in a hurry.</p>

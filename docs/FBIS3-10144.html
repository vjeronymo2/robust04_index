The new coup was allegedly being  prepared against President Juan Carlos Wasmosy.    It is worth noting that the rumor again had as its main  actors Deputies Francisco Jose de Vargas and Hermes Rafael  Saguier, two legislators characterized by their regular reports  of preparations being made for coups d'etat.    The rumor, which did not make clear its origin, the reasons  supporting it, or who was behind it, rocked congressional  circles. Following a series of meetings behind closed doors it  then finally dissipated.    Military, government, and ruling party officials  categorically denied the alleged existence of a coup.    The calm congressional morning was broken when a meeting of  the Chamber of Deputies special commission created to analyze  the social priorities for the year was abruptly curtailed to  allow De Vargas, Euclides Acevedo, and Nery Filemon Gonzalez to  walk to Government Palace.    The delegation returned to the Congress building a few  minutes later, and continued their closed door meeting. Then  suddenly the meeting was ended and legislators withdrew from the  premises. The first report, which was later denied, indicated  that the legislators drove to the 1st Army Corps headquarters in  Campo Grande, or to the U.S. Embassy.    De Vargas denied the rumor, as well as his having visited  any  of the above mentioned institutions. He also denied the  existence of a coup plot.</p>

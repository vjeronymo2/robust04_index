			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN IS HAVING BABY TO SAVE HER AILING DAUGHTER  </P> <P> In an unusual case that raises complex ethical issues, a 43-year-old Walnut  woman is having a baby in hopes that the newborn can become a bone marrow donor  for her teen-age daughter, who is suffering from leukemia.  </P> <P> "I never thought I'd be pregnant at my age, but when you're faced with the  possibility that your child is going to die, you desperately seek, and whatever  you need to do, you do it," said Mary Ayala, who is due in mid-April.  </P> <P> Although family members are the best sources for transplants, none of the  Ayalas proved compatible when tested. A search by the National Marrow Donor  Program of unrelated donors -- with only a 1in-20,000 chance of a match -- also  came up empty.  </P> <P> Doctors said the bone marrow can be obtained at little risk from an infant who  is at least 6 months old. And doctors say the Ayalas' 17-year-old daughter,  Anissa, is likely to still be alive then. The chances that the two siblings'  tissues will be compatible are about one in four.  </P> <P> Medical ethicists interviewed Thursday said it is extremely rare for a baby to  be conceived specifically to serve as a bone marrow donor for an ailing family  member, and that the Ayala case raises a number of ethical issues.  </P> <P> Unlike adults, children are unable to give informed consent for medical  procedures such as marrow donation. Such legal consent is usually given on  their behalf by a parent or guardian. But, ethicists said, the Ayala case  raises the issue of the parents' ability to do what is in the baby's best  interest because a decision may be clouded by desperation over another family  member's sickness.  </P> <P> "What they're doing ethically is very troubling," said Alexander M. Capron,  professor of law and medicine at USC. But he added, "On the other hand, I can  sympathize with their desire to do everything possible to save their daughter's  life."  </P> <P> Jake Priester, a research fellow at the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the  University of Minnesota, said that he, too, can understand why the Ayalas opted  to have another baby. However, "it seems to raise questions as to whether this  child is simply being used as a means to provide something for someone else.  How much potential pain and risk can one parent demand of one sibling for the  benefit of another sibling?"  </P> <P> The Ayalas acknowledge that their decision is highly unusual. But they defend  their choice and express dismay that anyone would question their motives.  </P> <P> "If it's not a match, we will love our baby just the same," Mary Ayala said  softly. The new baby, she said, "would give Anissa lots of enthusiasm, it would  make her fight to stay alive to see her grow up."  </P> <P> And the Ayalas say that their unborn baby girl, if able to communicate, would  agree to be a marrow donor.  </P> <P> "It was our choice, and I think the baby, if she turns out to be the donor  Anissa needs, would have thought it was a real miracle," Mary Ayala said.  </P> <P> The Ayalas decided to go ahead with the pregnancy even though Anissa's doctor,  a pediatric oncologist at City of Hope Medical Center in Duarte, advised Mary  not to become pregnant just for Anissa's sake.  </P> <P> "I thought it was a peculiar reason to have a baby," said Dr. Patricia Konrad.  "It made me uncomfortable. It didn't sit well, if that was the only reason, to  have a child to help another child."  </P> <P> But Konrad said she plans to perform the transplant if the infant girl, whose  sex was revealed through the prenatal diagnostic test known as amniocentesis,  proves to have compatible tissue.  </P> <P> Last year, after Mary and Abe Ayala -- who own and operate a speedometer repair  business -- had exhausted all alternatives to save their daughter's life, they  decided to create one of their own.  </P> <P> At a time when many of their friends were becoming grandparents, the Ayalas  opted to become parents again.  </P> <P> The Ayalas say their decision was not a frivolous one. The couple did a lot of  soul-searching, they said, and discussed the idea at length with Anissa and  their 19-year-old son, Airon. They also said they asked for -- and received --  God's guidance.  </P> <P> "I had a dream and God told me everything was going to be OK," Mary Ayala said.  "He wants me to have this baby."  </P> <P> Anissa's doctor said the leukemia has stabilized, leaving her in relatively  good health.  </P> <P> The teen-ager's burnished brown hair and rosy skin belie her illness. She does  volunteer work, exercises at the local gym and expects to graduate from Walnut  High School in May.  </P> <P> Even after the Ayalas decided to have another child, they didn't know if they  could because Abe Ayala had undergone a vasectomy after Anissa was born.  </P> <P> At first, doctors offered little hope of a reversal. But six months after the  vasectomy reversal operation, Mary Ayala became pregnant. The baby is due April  13, nearly two years to the day since Anissa's illness was diagnosed.  </P> <P> This week, as Mary Ayala recounted the history of her daughter's leukemia,  Anissa wrapped her arms tightly around a pillow on the family's living room  couch. But when the conversation turned to the baby, mother and daughter took  on the conspiratorial tones of sorority sisters.  </P> <P> Mother and daughter have combined their names to come up with one for the baby  -- Marissa Eve.  </P> <P> When Marissa is born, Konrad plans to collect blood from the baby's umbilical  cord, then freeze the blood for use later in the transplant.  </P> <P> If the baby's tissue matches, Anissa's doctor will begin the long and painful  process of preparing her for the transplant by destroying her existing marrow  through bombardments of radiation and chemotherapy.  </P> <P> The harvesting of the marrow, as the medical procedure is known, is done under  general anesthetic, during which a thick needle is inserted into the marrow  cavity of the donor's hipbone. Konrad said a healthy donor can regenerate the  extracted marrow within a week.  </P> <P> The marrow is prepared and then injected into a vein of the recipient, similar  to a blood transfusion. The marrow cells then travel through the bloodstream to  the bone marrow, where they grow.  </P> <P> Because the pregnancy has only a one-in-four chance of yielding a match, the  drive to find a donor for Anissa continues, with the help of such groups as  Covina-based Life-Savers Foundation of America. The foundation recruits donors  for the 9,000 Americans who are awaiting bone marrow transplants.  </P> <P> Also, Walnut High students, their families and friends next week will begin to  recruit volunteer marrow donors for Anissa and to help raise money for testing.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Ayalas are waiting out the last two months of pregnancy. "We  face it every day, that maybe today Anissa gets sick," Mary Ayala said. "But  you just can't dwell on it."  </P> <P> "We're just waiting and hoping that our miracle baby will be the miracle baby  that Anissa needs."  </P> <P> Times medical writer Robert Steinbrook contributed to this story.  </P></p>

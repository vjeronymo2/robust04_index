This year, the holy month of Ramadan begins after the  expanded National Dialogue Committee completed the accord  document, which is just waiting to be signed. The delay may  have been an act of God so the signing of the document would  coincide with the early days of this month, during which human  beings are closest to God.    I take this religious and worthy occasion to urge all  official and unofficial media to call a halt to vituperation and  turn a new leaf in the life of our united Yemen and our  pioneering democratic exercise. [passage omitted]    I would like to say how grateful and thankful I am to our  steadfast and patient people who have borne all manner of  distress and weathered the consequences and ill effects of the  crisis. I would also like to reiterate that we are readily  available for a joint effort with all the partriotic, unionist,  benevolent, and dedicated forces to maintain the unity of the  country and entrench the democratic choice, and work together  toward the resolution of all issues and problems our homeland  and people are facing in a responsible and brotherly spirit that  puts the interests of the homeland before any parochial  interests.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Else Ursula Picon including excerpts of recorded </F> interview with "repentant" MRTA leader Emilio Villalobos Alba,  also known as "Comrade Celso," place and date not given; from  the "Panorama" program presented by Guido Lombardi -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Lombardi] This past week Dincote 2 [National  Counterterrorism Directorate, 2d Department], headed by Colonel  Juan Gonzalez Sandoval, arrested important MRTA [Tupac Amaru  Revolutionary Movement] leaders. Panorama was able to interview  one of those arrested, a repentant MRTA member, and in the  course of the interview he supplied some details about the  MRTA's internal organization.    [Picon] The last man in the arrested group of MRTA members  did not mean much to anyone: Emilio Villalobos Alba. With his  arrest, however, Dincote did not arrest just another MRTA  member. Villalobos' arrest meant that Dincote had arrested Peter  Cardenas Shultz's successor, that is, the MRTA logistics  apparatus chief, the chief of the MRTA special forces, and the  man in charge of the MRTA's international network; a member of  the MRTA national board, and a member of the MRTA national  leadership. That is who Emilio Villalobos, also known as  Comrade Celso, is.    Emilio Villalobos, Comrade Celso, joined the MRTA in 1984.  The police first identified him on 23 December 1985 when Celso,  as a member of the MRTA hit squad, attacked the Escala Gigante  shop on Alfonso Ugarte shop, where he was injured. He was able  to flee, but by August 1986 the police were aware of the attacks  he had taken part in and they began to seek him.    To this point, Comrade Celso's task in the organization had  been to orient the masses and execute armed actions. All this  changed, however, on 19 July 1988, when he was arrested and sent  to serve his sentence at the Castro Castro jail. This is where  Emilio Villalobos's story begins; how he became a member of the  MRTA leadership and how eventually he became Peter Cardenas  Shultz's successor.    Panorama was able to interview the protagonist of this  story:  Emilio Villalobos, Comrade Celso, who is under arrest today.    [Begin recording] [Villalobos] At the time, I held a very  high position within the MRTA leadership. At the time, the  leaders included a number of MRTA members and many of them had  held important posts.    [Picon] Such as?    [Villalobos] Such as Peter Shultz, Lucero Cumpa, Miguel  Rincon Rincon, etc. [end recording]    [Picon] Given his prison ties, when he left jail on 6 April  1990, the MRTA selected Villalobos to do important work with one  of the most important MRTA leaders, Nestor Cerpa Catolini:    [Begin recording] [Picon] Were you a member of the  Metropolitan Committee?    [Villalobos] That is right.    [Picon] What other posts did you hold within the MRTA?    [Villalobos] (?Depending) on different needs, I was assigned  to the northern region. Later, I took on larger  responsibilities. [end recording]    [Picon] In view of this new task, Peter Cardenas Shultz  ordered, from jail, that Celso be assigned an undercover  identity. From that point, Emilio Villalobos, also known as  Comrade Celso, became Oscar Balderrama Bernedos, a Bolivian  journalist acting as a PRESENCIA magazine correspondent in Lima.    With this undercover identity, Celso, together with Nestor  Cerpa Catolini, was responsible for planning the most violent  kidnappings and assassinations of various Peruvian businessmen.    [Begin recording] [Villalobos] (?These) deaths (?had to  with)  the all-out war we were waging against the Armed and military  forces. But in no way whatsoever did the MRTA ever support any  project based on killing Peruvians in an indiscriminate manner,  or perpetrating actions that would affect the civilian  population. We were very respectful in this regard. We even  upheld the Geneva agreements.    [Picon] Why, then, did you kill kidnapped victims? There are  several examples in this regard, such as Ballon Vera, the  Spanish businessmen, Miyasato, Furukawa, and several others who  were killed by the MRTA. If the MRTA, as you allege, respects  human rights and the lives of individuals, why did you kill  these kidnapped victims? For money?    [Villalobos] Among the many businessmen who were taken  prisoner, you will find several -- and some of them have  publicly told this to the media -- who have commented on the  dignified manner in which they were treated...    [Picon, interrupting] But there are also many, like  businessman Ballon Vera, who were savagely killed.  Unfortunately, they are unable to comment on the tortures they  endured, but they were killed.    [Villalobos] Among the reports we have available,  unfortunately we do have reports of these incidents. We have  faced difficult circumstances. But I believe these deaths are  part of a war, and there are no wars without deaths. This is a  fact. [passage omitted]    [Picon] [words indistinct] military with you?    [Villalobos] Well, this would have to be in direct relation  with the activities I was involved in [words indistinct] both in  Lima and in the northern region. [end recording]    [Picon] Arrogance and cold blood are the traits that  allowed Villalobos to continue to climb within the MRTA  leadership. When Dincote 2, headed by Col. Juan Gonzalez  Sandoval, arrested Peter Cardenas Shultz, Comrade Celso occupied  all of Cardenas Shultz's posts, mainly to receive all the funds  obtained from the kidnappings.    [Begin recording] [Villalobos] The money is centralized.    [Picon] Where?    [Villalobos] The national leadership. This money is used as  a war fund.    [Picon] But the MRTA must be aware of what you do with the  money.    [Villalobos] Not really...    [Picon, interrupting] No one knows what is done with the  money?    [Villalobos] This is because of the way in which the group  is  divided up. But all of the organization's needs are met. [end  recording]    [Picon] These MRTA needs are nothing but brand new cars,  luxury houses, and expensive restaurants. Dincote arrested many  MRTA leaders thanks to the ostentatious and luxurious manner in  which they lived.    In addition, Celso was responsible for the MRTA's logistics  apparatus and for establishing international communications,  mainly with Hugo Avellaneda Valdes, in France, and with Walter  Palacios, in Mexico. By then, Celso, already a member of the  MRTA national leadership, established his base in Barranca, and  from there he planned to establish a new kidnappings base in  Arequipa. When the police arrested him on 10 April, Celso had  already planned the kidnapping of two Arequipa businessmen.  [passage omitted]    Celso was arrested in Lima. But before that, the police  spotted him entering several houses which turned out to be MRTA  bases. It is from these houses that the police seized this  important arsenal.    When Dincote agents discovered this arsenal inside an MRTA  base discovered in Las Flores, they also found a guitar case.  They were greatly surprised, however, with what they found  inside the case. What they found inside this simple guitar case  was the very weapon used by the MRTA to attack buildings such as  the Peruvian-American Cultural Institute, the U.S. Embassy, and  the house of ex-Minister Bolona. [passage omitted]    All of these crimes were ordered by Emilio Villalobos Alba,  also known as Comrade Celso, member of the MRTA national  leadership. But how did those who carried out the orders given  by this criminal terrorist feel about it? You will now have an  opportunity to find out what these people feel about the MRTA,  and why they decided to leave that subversive organization.  This is the testimony of an MRTA member who repented.    [Begin recording] [Picon] What actions were you involved in?    [Unidentified repentant MRTA member] I was involved in  kidnappings and harassment, actions of harassment with rocket  launchers and rifles, in the capital. The national leadership  was directly responsible for decisions on the kidnappings.    [Picon] How was the money obtained from the kidnappings  used?    [MRTA member] At the beginning, I thought the money obtained  from the kidnappings was used to keep the armed struggle alive  on the different fronts in the capital. But many times I  encountered members in the lower structure, people who worked in  the unions, in the shantytowns, people who were dying from  tuberculosis, dressed in rags, and things like that. But there  were some leaders who had an opportunity to enjoy the money, eat  in good restaurants like the Haiti, eat pizza, drink beer in the  Miraflores district or places like that.    [Picon] Who did that, for example?    [MRTA member] The ones who enjoyed these privileges were  those in command positions; those who received money within the  party.    [Picon] Why did you do that, why torture, why murder?    [MRTA member] We see here what could be an ideological  decomposition of the MRTA. I do not understand why businessman  Vera Ballon was tortured, left weighing 49 kg, and then shot.  There is no excuse for that.    [Picon] What is the MRTA becoming?    [MRTA member] If the MRTA continues like that it will become  a criminal group having no other choice than its own  destruction. [end recording]    [Picon] The MRTA has entered its final phase of extinction,  and Dincote is playing a very important role in this. This  week, Dincote 2 headed by Col. Juan Gonzalez Sandoval made an  important capture in the struggle against terrorism.</p>

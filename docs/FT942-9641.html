			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: PWS PWS Holdings, the Lloyd's insurance and reinsurance broker, reported a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 446,000 for the six months to end-March, compared with a profit of Pounds 2.07m last time. The outcome, which was struck after providing some Pounds 1m for discontinued activities and reorganisation, came from turnover down from Pounds 8.39m to Pounds 7.05m. Losses per share came out at 0.5p (6.4p earnings), and the interim dividend is cut from 1.5p to 0.5p. The shares closed 11p lower at 62p. Lord Pearson, chairman, said there were clear signs that capacity was returning to the market and, with profit growth now weighted increasingly towards the second half, he expected a healthy second six months.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Caesars World Inc. announced a shareholder rights plan, which it said is  designed to deter "coercive or unfair" takeover tactics against the Los  Angeles-based casino operator. Last month, New York financier Donald J. Trump  asked federal regulators for clearance to buy 15% or more of Caesars' stock.  Under the plan adopted by the company's directors, preferred stock purchase  rights will be distributed as a dividend as of Jan. 23. They will entitle  shareholders to buy the new preferred, to be exercisable under certain  conditions.  </P></p>

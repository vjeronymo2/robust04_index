			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kragujevac, 13 March (TANJUG)--The chairman of the  Srpska republic assembly, Momcilo Krajisnik, said today that  "the future Muslim-Croat federation can encompass 45 percent of  the territory at the most because that is the amount of  territory owned by Muslims and Croats."    Taking part in Kragujevac Radio's "Pecat Vremena" program,  Krajisnik said that all other statements were means of exerting  pressure to make the Serbs give up more territory.    However, Krajisnik said that other things apart from the  percentage of the territory were also important. Quality is also  important and the Serb side will insist on this.    Asked about the Serb position for the tripartite talks which  will take place next week, Krajisnik said that many matters were  already settled except for the territorial demarcation.    "Two entities exist on the territory of former  Bosnia-Herzegovina now--the Muslim-Croat federation and the  Srpska republic. We have also agreed to discuss other,  previously settled, issues so it cannot be said that we do not  want to cooperate," Krajisnik said.</p>

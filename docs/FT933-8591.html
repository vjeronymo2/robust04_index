			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Account closes with new all-time high GOOD NEWS from the gilt-edged market gave a final boost to equities yesterday, enabling the FT-SE Index to end the trading account at a new peak and solidly above the 3,000 level, which had been twice lost earlier in the session. Government bonds, also easier at first, turned sharply higher in late trading after the Bank of England said it would not hold the conventional auction of bonds this month. Equity chart analysts found particular satisfaction in the Footsie's success in closing above 3,000 again, despite the expected end-of-account profit taking. At last night's final reading of 3,010.1, the Footsie showed a gain of 1 point on the day and 40.3 on the week. Pre-occupied with its own affairs, London paid little heed to the gain of 3 points on the Dow Industrial Average in early New York trading. Over the account, the Footsie Index has put on 83.6 points, or 2.9 per cent, as confidence that UK base rates will be cut soon has been stimulated by reductions in interest rates by the French authorities. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, covering a range of second line stocks, rallied from early falls yesterday to gain 3.7 to 3,455.5, maintaining its unbroken run of daily gains which now stretches back to July 21. At the long end of the gilt-edged market, prices recouped early losses of 3/8 or so and were already firmer when the Bank of England announcement brought final gains of nearly a full point. Short dates shaded easier on the belief that rate cuts may have to wait until the autumn, while index-linked gilts indicated underlying concerns over inflation by gaining about  1/2 point. Seaq volume in equities remained high at 753.8m shares. Trading in non-Footsie stocks made up about 63 per cent of the day's total, indicating once again the presence of the private investor in the equity market this week. On Thursday, Seaq volume of 908.2m shares represented Pounds 2.18bn in retail worth, the highest daily figure this year. High equity turnover implies high profits for the London-based securities houses, and has been reflected in the strength of merchant banking issues which have substantially outperformed the rest of the market over the past 12 months. Good trading news from Unilever cheered the stock market yesterday, although there was some concern over progress in the US.</p>

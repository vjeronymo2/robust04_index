			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: GBE Intl rises 18% to Pounds 2.8m Profits of GBE International, the engineering equipment group formerly known as Downiebrae, rose by 18 per cent to Pounds 2.8m pre-tax over the year ended December 1993. Turnover expanded from Pounds 34.7m to Pounds 37.4m while earnings per share improved from 3.06p to 3.82p. The single dividend is lifted from 0.5p to 1.25p. Orders anticipated in the last quarter failed to materialise and this was expected to affect operations during the opening half of 1994. However, those orders had now been received and with a good order book at good margins directors expected the second half performance to be 'excellent'. Nevertheless, the shares closed 8p lower at 66p.</p>

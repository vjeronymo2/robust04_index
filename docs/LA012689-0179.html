			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PICKUP HAD LOST RUGS;  </P> <P> PASSENGER KILLED AS CYCLE HITS FALLEN CARPET ROLLS  </P> <P> A motorcycle passenger was killed Wednesday evening and the driver was injured  when two carpet rolls fell from the bed of a truck, causing the two-wheeler to  crash and eject both driver and rider on the Garden Grove Freeway, the  California Highway Patrol said.  </P> <P> Neither the motorcycle driver nor the passenger, a woman, wore a helmet. "A  helmet may have saved her life," CHP spokesman Mike Lundquist said.  </P> <P> The accident occurred about 5:50 p.m. in the westbound lanes of the Garden  Grove Freeway, east of Glassell Street in Orange. A 1988 Mitsubishi pickup  truck, driven by Michael R. Lockhart, 26, of Huntington Beach, was traveling  about 50 m.p.h. in the fast lane and carrying two 10-by-9-foot rolls of  carpeting, Lundquist said.  </P> <P> The carpeting fell off into the path of the 1986 Kawasaki Ninja motorcycle  driven by Carlos Cirado, 19, of Santa Ana, Lundquist said.  </P> <P> The motorcycle struck the carpeting, went out of control and hit the center  divider, ejecting both the driver and passenger, he said.  </P> <P> The passenger fell head first in the fast lane and was dead on impact,  Lundquist said. She then rolled into the path of a 1986 Buick, which had slowed  almost to a stop. "There was only minor impact to the body," he said.  </P> <P> A coroner's spokesman identified the woman as Angela Caballero, 19, of Orange.  </P> <P> Cirado fell into the fast lane and suffered major injuries, including a broken  clavicle, a broken wrist and possible internal injuries, Lundquist said. He was  listed in serious condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange, a hospital  spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> The driver of the Buick, Leota Sears, 54, of Garden Grove, was not injured.  </P> <P> Lundquist said the accident is under investigation, adding that the carpeting  was obviously not properly tied down in accordance with highway safety laws.  </P> <P> "If it comes off, it definitely was not tied down properly," he said.  </P></p>

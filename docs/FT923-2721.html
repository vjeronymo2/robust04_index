			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / International Company News: ING seeks seat on BBL's board THE Netherlands banking and insurance group Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING) said it is seeking board representation at its takeover target Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), possibly through a vote at today's extraordinary shareholders' meeting of the Belgium bank, Reuter reports from Amsterdam. ING said yesterday that it 'has urged BBL's chairman that it should be directly represented on the bank's board'. This would help it create a co-operation pact with BBL on banking and insurance. ING said last week it planned to offer at most BFr3,600 (Dollars 117) a share in a friendly takeover bid for Belgium's second largest bank. ING, which already has an indirect 10.03 per cent stake in BBL, will make a final decision on the bid by mid-October.</p>

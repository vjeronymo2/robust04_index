			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Measures to revive banks in Finland introduced FINLAND'S central bank announced plans to revive the country's ailing banking sector and avert a credit crunch yesterday, saying it would raise interest rates, set up a FM20bn government deposit guarantee fund, and scrap stamp duty on share transactions. Finnish banks have been plagued by heavy credit losses in the past year as the economy plunged into recession and the number of bankruptcies soared. The Bank of Finland said its proposed measures would strengthen banks' capital structure and to improve interest margins, helping to avoid a credit crunch. The Bank of Finland will raise the base rate from 8.5 per cent to 9.5 per cent with effect from the beginning of May, a measure intended to improve the banks' interest margins. A substantial proportion of the banks' lending  - particularly to households  - is tied to the base rate, which has been held at 8.5 per cent since 1989. The banks fund their lending in the money market, where they have had to pay considerably higher interest rates  - of close to 15 per cent  - in recent months. The parliamentary supervisory board of the Bank of Finland yesterday said it had decided to raise the interest rates on the banks' low-interest loans  - which are tied to the base rate  - by 1 percentage point to a maximum of 12 per cent. The central bank proposed that the central government provide capital to support the banks, should their capital adequacy ratios  - which are currently above the 8 per cent requirement  - fall significantly. Following the rescue last year of Skopbank, the central bank for the Finnish savings banks, the Bank of Finland has proposed a new government deposit guarantee fund which would grant support loans and guarantees to the banking sector. The fund would provide back-up for the deposit guarantee funds already in existence for the savings, co-operative and commercial banks. The abolition of stamp duty on shares is intended to help boost liquidity on the stock exchange and make it easier for the banks to trade their equity holdings. While bankers have been pressing for many of the changes in recent months, one analyst responded gloomily to the package of reforms, saying 'the message is that the situation here is really bad . . . if the Bank of Finland thought there was going to be a recovery these measures wouldn't be necessary.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, April 20 (YONHAP) -- South Korean  fishing companies have been on their toes ever since four Korean  vessels were seized recently by Argentine naval authorities.  The fishing business here for South Korean companies, which  goes back to the late 1970s when Hansong Enterprise Co. first  took to the water, witnessed its worst group seizure ever.    All four vessels are operated by locally incorporated South  Korean companies -- two by Tae Ung Deep Sea Fisheries Co., one  by Tongwon Industries Co. And the last by Chewon Co. These  locally incorporated firms own a total of 34 vessels, all flying  Argentinian flags and obligated to follow local regulations,  prompting South Korean officials to question why they were  seized by Argentine authorities.    The captured boats were operating about 300 miles north of  the Falkland Islands. The fishermen say they were taken  illegally, insisting they were outside Argentina's territorial  waters. Local authorities, however, say the boats were inside  the 200-mile territorial limit, fishing 195 to 197 miles off the  coast.    Bickering over whether a vessel is operating inside or  outside the boundary is common: Most boats fishing illegally  inside Argentine territorial waters speed beyond the boundary  when chased by maritime authorities and claim they were fishing  at the point of capture. But officials here say this time, the  maritime police started from outside the boundary and gradually  worked to the inside, discrediting the South Koreans' claims.    Argentina's federal courts will have to decide who is right,  and most observers say South Korea is aboard a sinking ship.  History shows that virtually no vessels accused of illegal  fishing were set free without paying at least a minimal fine.  The federal courts usually take at least three months to  investigate before setting a fine. Depending on whether the  courts see the violation as premeditated or unplanned, the fine  could range from 490,000 U.S. dollars to as high as 1 million  dollars. Because four boats were caught at once, the courts are  most likely to view it as a planned violation, the officials say.    Over 500 boats operate in the teeming waters off Argentina  in  March and April including 50 Russian and 150 South Korean  vessels, as well as Japanese and Taiwanese boats and those  locally incorporated.    The officials say Argentina's fierce reaction to boundary  violations is understandable given that so many foreign vessels  cross the line to net squid and shrimp whenever the authorities'  watchful eye is averted.</p>

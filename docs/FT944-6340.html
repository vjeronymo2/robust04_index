			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: Between a rock and a hard place - One quarry's fight for planning permission In the heart of Dorset in southern England an argument is taking place over the happiness of sand lizards. The lizards are indigenous to an area extensively quarried by ARC, the Hanson subsidiary and one of the biggest aggregates-providers in Britain. ARC, along with a local conservation group, claim the lizards are content to live in areas of excavated sand created by large-scale extraction. The Council for the Protection of Rural England, however, picked the ARC sites at Hyde Heath and Portland as two of five quarries which illustrated the danger to the environment caused by planning permissions dated before environmental legislation passed in the 1980s. ARC's reaction to its inclusion on the blacklist was both speedy and furious. The company's good relations with the local wildlife trust - ARC claims it has handed two-thirds of Hyde Heath, designated a site of special scientific interest, over to the trust - and its general restoration of quarried land were featured in the local media and trade press. But ARC's response was based on larger national issues than the plight of reptiles. CPRE's chief demand, set out in its response to a government consultation paper on old planning permissions earlier this year, is that such permissions should be updated to comply with modern standards. Where a company fails to update the sites, planning permissions should be revoked. The companies should pay for the updating or suffer the closure of the sites without compensation. The issue of compensation is set to prove the most contentious before the paper is made law. The government is proposing that compensation be paid where changes to comply with new planning regulations affect asset values by restricting the scope for excavation. It says that there will be no compensation in some cases, where changes are made to meet modern regulations. It says this would apply to 'sensory' conditions, such as noise levels at an excavation site, where the change does not affect earnings. The CPRE, however, says the compensation proposals are too complicated. 'It is particularly on the issue of compensation that we fear the proposals will founder.' Lilli Matson, CPRE's minerals campaigner, calls the proposals a 'recipe for muddle'. 'There are going to be long legal wrangles over what constitutes a sensory condition and what should be compensated.' The aggregates industry enjoys better conditions over environmental regulation than many others, she says. The government proposals are contested by industry groups which claim they make a nonsense of cost predictions at the start of construction. The British Aggregate Construction Materials Industries, the trade federation, says the cost of complying with the 1990 Environmental Protection Act alone will be Pounds 100m and that this can hardly be seen as special treatment. 'How,' it asks, 'would householders feel if their planning rights and thus their houses were taken away without compensation?' At the heart at the issue lies the estimated demand for aggregates. The government's own predictions suggest that demand for construction aggregates will rise from 240m tonnes in 1991 to between 330m and 365m by 2006. Environmentalists such as the CPRE and Friends of the Earth argue that the government's road-building programme - which they oppose - makes up a large amount of that total. They believe that more material could also be provided by recycling. ARC seems to have won the war locally - the Dorset CPRE campaigner has applauded the company's conservation work and 'the lizards are happy' according to the local paper - but its sites are still on an environmental blacklist. John Mortimer, ARC group operations executive, fears that moves by groups such as CPRE have a 'dripping tap effect' on government policy and public opinion, however. The government paper - likely to become law in the next parliamentary session - will reveal how strong the drip is.</p>

Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> NO NAZI SOAP, ARCHIVIST SAYS  </P> <P> Israel's Holocaust Museum, rebutting a common belief, said today that the Nazis  never made soap from human fat of murdered Jews during World War II.  </P> <P> "Historians have concluded that soap was not made from human fat. When so many  people deny the Holocaust ever happened, why give them something to use against  the truth?" said Shmuel Krakoski, archives director at the Yad Vashem Museum.  </P> <P> Israeli Holocaust historian Yehuda Bauer said there is no evidence that Nazi  Germany had used corpses for soap although some Nazis did use skin to make  lampshades and hair to fill mattresses.  </P></p>

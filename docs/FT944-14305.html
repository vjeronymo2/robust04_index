			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / This Week: Cricket Bouncers were bowled at England cricket captain Mike Atherton as soon as the team landed in Perth, where the first match of the tour will be played tomorrow. This time the fast balls came from the Australian press and the hot topic was sledging - players verbally abusing opponents at the crease. Atherton was questioned fiercely about a statement he is alleged to have made after the last Ashes series in 1993. 'The one who really got up my nose was Steve Waugh,' Atherton is said to have said. 'He spent the entire series giving out verbals - a bit of a joke really as he was the one bloke on either side who was wetting himself against the quick bowlers.' Atherton now claims he cannot remember making the comments, but the issue highlights two things that will determine England's success in the coming Ashes battle: team spirit (sledging or no sledging) and fast bowling. 'Ashes to Ashes, dust to dust, if Lillee doesn't get you, Thomson must.' That was a chant that turned many an England supporter's blood to ice, and it has been traditional that the side with the best fast bowlers wins Test series in Australia. Atherton will be hoping that the tradition is maintained, because this time round it is England that have the stronger pace attack. However, Devon Malcolm, Phillip DeFreitas, Darren Gough, Martin McCague and Joey Benjamin will need to be at their best, for Australia seem to be stronger in every other department, including team character. Firing up the troops to take on the ancient enemy has never been an Australian problem. As Graham Gooch lamented last year: 'Our spirit is nothing like their's' Atherton will be aware that developing the team's character will be as important as his other duties if he is to interrupt one of the worst spells - for England - since James Lilleywhite first led an England touring side to Australia in 1877. The last three Ashes series have finished 4-0, 3-0 and 4-1 in Australia's favour.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                      ENGLAND'S TOUR OF AUSTRALIA  ------------------------------------------------------------------- OCTOBER  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Date              Match                          Venue  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Tue 25            England     v Chairman's XI    Lilac Hill.

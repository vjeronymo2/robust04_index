			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Cynthia Malta: "Brazil Needs To Change Export </F> Profile To Win Space in World Market"]    [Text] Sao Paulo--The profile of Brazilian exports must  change so that the country can compete and win space in the  world market over the next few years. That observation comes  from Minister of Finance Rubens Ricupero, who spoke yesterday at  the international seminar on the "New Map of World Trade,"  sponsored by this newspaper. He said: "We are witnessing a  panorama that requires care."    According to the minister, Brazil is outstanding as an  exporter of bulk soybeans, orange juice, crude soybean oil, iron  and steel products, and paper and cellulose. "Those are products  with which Brazil shines more in terms of volumes  exported--quantities--than in terms of value added to the  product." That picture reflects a concentration of capital and  "expresses Brazilian society itself"--that is, a society which  has invested little in education and technological research and  which is therefore being outdone by countries that made the  necessary investments and now have more sophisticated and  cheaper finished goods to export.    "When I arrived at GATT in November 1987, China was just  beginning to export. I left GATT in 1991, and by then China was  exporting twice as much as Brazil," said Ricupero, who was head  of Brazil's delegation to GATT. In 1991, Chinese exports totaled  about $73 billion. "Last year, China's exports and imports  totaled $200 billion," the minister said.    He is especially concerned about the textile, capital goods,  and footwear industries. "The textile industry is among those  that will experience the fastest rate of growth in world trade  over the next few years. It is estimated that garment exports  will increase by 60 percent and that footwear exports will rise  by 34 percent." The basis for comparison is the year 1992. If  that turns out to be the case, the minister said, the biggest  beneficiaries will probably be the Asian countries known as the  Asian tigers: "the countries belonging to that zoological  category, which is growing every year," the minister joked.    The situation in the footwear industry is also cause for  concern. "Brazilian exporters have already lost the market for  cheap shoes. China now has half the U.S. market, and the Chinese  have now started to move ahead in the area of midpriced shoes,"  the minister said.    The capital goods industry is another weak point. "Twelve  years ago, Brazil was exporting power lathes, but it started to  lose market share when electronic components began to be used in  those machines," the minister noted. When all is said and done,  "Brazil did not make the necessary investments, but the Asians  did."    According to the minister, Brazil should go back to  investing  from 22 to 23 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) so  that its exports will resume their growth. He recalled that in  the 1970's, the investment rate was 25 percent of GDP. By last  year, that figure had fallen to 16.5 percent--the lowest  percentage in Brazilian history. "This is a gap that we must  close. But to do so, businessmen must have stable prospects so  that they will become interested again and invest."    Jose Milton Dallari, the Ministry of Finance's special  adviser on prices, was also present at the seminar. He noted  that "the businessmen have that vision--that it is necessary to  invest. But they are justifiably worried about short-term  developments, about inflation, and about what they are going to  do to get through this phase."    The minister noted, however, that he was "mindful of the  needs of foreign trade and preparing measures for exports and  imports." He pointed out that there were concerns about foreign  exchange because of the introduction of the new currency on 1  July and repeated that "the administration will announce a  stable anchor appropriate to a stable economy."    Among the measures being prepared by the administration, the  minister mentioned a reduction in federal and state  taxes--especially the ICMS [goods and services movement tax],  which the states collect on exports of semimanufactures--the  opening of a line of credit through the National Bank for  Economic and Social Development (BNDES), and the granting of  export insurance for small and medium-size firms.    Ricupero noted that the program in question was coming at a  time when the firms had little debt, were beginning to modernize  their equipment (during the first three months of this year,  imports of capital goods were up 30 percent over 1993), and were  rapidly adopting international standards of quality. He said:  "Over 300 firms already have their ISO [International  Standardization Organization] 9000 certificate."  <H5>  Minister Publishes Book in Chile </H5>   Sao Paulo--Minister of Finance Rubens Ricupero is scheduled  to publish a book entitled A Rodada Uruguai e o  desenvolvimento da America Latina (The Uruguay Round and the  Development of Latin America) in Santiago, Chile. The book  will have a chapter on the prospects for developing countries  following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT.    Here are the main points in the minister's analysis:    1. The multilateral system has been strengthened by the  establishment of the World Trade Organization (the body that  will replace GATT in January 1995). The countries, and  especially developing countries, will benefit from improvements  in the rules on safeguards, antidumping, subsidies, technical  barriers, and the mechanism for resolving disputes. The  countries should also benefit from the gradual liberalization of  trade in agricultural products, textiles, and services.    2. The developed countries have reduced their average import  tariffs by about 38 percent. That tariff reduction is expected  to reduce the cost of $464 billion worth of imports by the  developed countries. Tariff reductions were not offered on  imports worth $148 billion.    3. Also expanded was the universe of goods imported by the  developed countries and to which a tariff will not be applied.  This group of products formerly accounted for 20 percent of the  total tariff schedule, but is now up to 43 percent. The opening  up of developing countries was even greater: the share of goods  on which no tariff is collected rose from 22 percent to 45  percent.    4. The developing countries also increased the number of  products whose tariffs are consolidated in GATT, meaning that  those tariffs cannot be increased. The developing countries,  which had consolidated 21 percent of their tariff schedule in  GATT before the Uruguay Round, have now expanded that share to  65 percent. The industrialized countries have increased their  share from 78 to 97 percent.    5. Using estimates worked up by GATT, the minister notes  that  by the year 2005, world trade in goods "will be 12 percent  higher than it would have been without the Uruguay Round." This  means an increase of $745 billion (in 1992 dollars) over the  level that would have existed if trade had grown at the average  annual rate recorded during the period between 1980 and 1991  (4.1 percent).    6. The greatest growth in world trade is expected to occur  in  the clothing industry, where a 60-percent increase is predicted,  textiles (34 percent), forest and fishery products (20 percent),  and processed foods and beverages (19 percent). It is precisely  in the textile industry, says the minister, that Brazil's weak  point exists. He notes that Brazilian firms have not been  investing to modernize their equipment and that that  technological lag is causing the country to lose ground to the  Southeast Asian countries when it comes to exports.    7. According to calculations by the World Bank (IBRD  [International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]), the  OECD, and GATT, the growth in world income should total from  $213 billion to $274 billion annually.</p>

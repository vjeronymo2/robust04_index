			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT  </P> <P> "Consolidate California Sprawl by Regional, Responsible Government" (by Ray  Remy and Dan Garcia, Opinion, March 25) not only assumes regional and  responsible are synonymous, but is a rewrite of the SCAG (Southern California  Assn. of Governments) elitist theology that the people's preference for "a  detached single family home . . . a private automobile . . . and strong local  governments" is to be dismissed by bigger-is-better regionalists as "an  anachronistic collective image of the ideal metropolitan area."  </P> <P> Perhaps, however, the truth of the matter is that anyone who believes SCAG-like  governance is preferable to this county's 86 cities, with elective bodies  responsible to their neighbor-constituents, is indulging in "an anachronistic  collective image of the ideal" governing mechanism.  </P> <P> JOHN CARL BROGDON  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

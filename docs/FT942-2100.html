			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Observer: Rutting season Who is Jill Rutter, the shadowy member of the prime minister's Downing Street policy unit, who sat in on a Railtrack board meeting last Friday? Surely she is not the same Jill Rutter who, as a Treasury civil servant, was seconded to the team which dreamed up the poll tax? Many regard her as one of its real architects. If they are one and the same, then her presence behind the scenes at Railtrack strengthens the suggestion of the late Robert Adley MP: that rail privatisation is a 'poll tax on wheels'.</p>

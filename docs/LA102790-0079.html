			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : FREEMAN UPHOLDS BADDIE IMAGE IN 'WILD AT HEART,' 'MILLER'S  CROSSING'  </P> <P> E. Freeman is getting recognized a lot these days. But people can't really  place his face. "They don't know from where they saw me," he says, "but they  know it's bad."  </P> <P> Real bad.  </P> <P> Over the past five years, Freeman has played the baddest of the baddies. He was  the villain in the CBS miniseries, "Fresno," a psycho in the Bette Midler  comedy "Ruthless People," and a vicious gangster pursuing Nicolas Cage and  Laura Dern in David Lynch's "Wild at Heart." He currently can be seen  committing murders and creating devious mayhem in Joel and Ethan Coen's  gangster melodrama "Miller's Crossing," as the Dane, a menacing hit man.  </P> <P> "It was such a joy to read the script," says Freeman. "It had so many  dimensions. I did the first scene at the audition for them (the Coen) and then  they asked me to do all of my scenes. I even died on the sofa for them."  </P> <P> Freeman defends the movie's brutal violence. "If you want to be true to the  period (1929) you can't not be violent," he says. "I don't think there was any  gratuitous violence. I did find it a little strange how Tom (the film's lead  played by Gabriel Bryne) kept getting beat up and had no bruises."  </P> <P> The actor got his part in "Wild at Heart" at the last minute. "They originally  cast a musician," says Freeman, "and just before they were going to shoot, the  musician went into the (recording) studio and wouldn't come out. On the first  day, David Lynch just sat down with me and worked with me line by line. I had  never done that with a director. They were ready to shoot and he made the crew  wait." Freeman didn't start acting until 15 years ago at age 30. He signed up  for a writing class in college, only to discover he was the only male among 15  women. "I just didn't want to be the only male in that class," he says. So  Freeman opted for a TV dramatic lab. The class changed his life. "Acting  immediately put me in control of my own life. You have the words, you know what  the emotions are and besides, I like the attention." SUSAN KING  </P></p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Acid rain pact to be signed in Oslo Officials from more than 30 European and North American countries, meeting in Oslo, are likely today to sign a far-reaching pact to curb acid rain. Mr Thorbjoern Berntsen, Norway's environment minister, warned the agreement, reached after a year of tortuous negotiation, 'will not solve the problems, but it's a step in the right direction'. The protocol, part of an international 'umbrella' convention covering air pollution which crosses national boundaries, aims to curb sulphur emissions, a main component of acid rain. Acid rain is thought to damage plants and fish and eat away at buildings. The deal has been controversial because sulphur is emitted mainly by coal-fired power stations, and curbs require countries either to switch energy sources or fit expensive filters to power station chimneys. The new deal, worked out by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, which covers most of Europe together with North America, has broken with precedents by setting individual targets for each country based on how much pollution wildlife and plants can withstand. Britain, Poland and Spain, which contribute a large part of the 20m tonnes of sulphur spewed into the European air each year, and which declined to sign the earlier protocol, are expected to sign today. US officials, who are attending the meeting, will not sign. They have argued their environmental standards, while based on different criteria, are as strict as the Oslo cuts. Under today's agreement, Germany faces the biggest cut - of 87 per cent compared to 1980 levels by 2005 - which it plans to achieve largely by modernising noxious plants in eastern Germany. Britain will pledge to cut sulphur emissions by 80 per cent on 1980 levels by 2010, mainly by switching to gas from coal at power stations. Greece will agree a 4 per cent emissions cut. Its soil contains high levels of calcium, which neutralises sulphur, and so suffers less damage. Environmental groups Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and the World Wide Fund for Nature, in a joint statement yesterday criticised the protocol as 'inadequate to stop acidification'.</p>

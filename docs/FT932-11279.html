			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Arts: Today's Television Dispatches (C4, 9.00) presents fresh and important evidence that the government knowingly permitted British businessmen to sell arms to Iraq, and then sold them down the river. Paul Grecian and his fellow accused were arrested in October 1990 and were found guilty last year of breaking the arms embargo. Their unsuccessful defence, that the government knew of and abetted their activities, was the same which subsequently got the Matrix Churchill defendants off. Grecian relates how his discoveries about Saddam's supergun led to his becoming an unpaid informer for M15 and M16. Open Space: The Price of Fish (BBC 1, 7.40) gives a mouthpiece to the fishermen of Brixham and Grimsby and their grievances against the EC quota system. Living Islam (BBC2, 8.10), reports on a subject about which much rubbish is talked, namely the position of women in Islam. Pigs are enthusiastic omnivores. So are humans, which adds a certain piquancy to the report on Tomorrow's World BBC 1, May 5) that the Dutch have discovered how to feed pigs on their own manure.</p>

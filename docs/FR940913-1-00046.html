			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Mercedes C. Lewis, Division of Personnel Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. 20245, telephone number (202) 208&hyph;2506.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Indians, as defined in the Indian Reorganization Act of June 18, 1934, receive employment preference in appointments in the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The preference conferred in 25 U.S.C. 472 must be applied in the filling of every vacant position within the Bureau of Indian Affairs,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Freeman  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Morton <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> , 499 F.2d 492 (DC Cir. 1974). The Secretary issued a final rule for the definition of ``Indian'' on January 17, 1978. A fifth criterion applied to the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma and to the Osage Tribe whose rolls were closed by Acts of Congress and who had not as yet reorganized so as to establish current membership standards. Many such persons have received preference based on the one-quarter degree standard previously established by the Secretary. In order that they would not be deprived of that eligibility and made to meet the one-half degree standard, in 1978, the tribes were allowed 3 years, until July 17, 1981, in which to establish membership standards. Almost 13 years later, the Osage Tribe is the only remaining tribe that has not organized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The complexities of the Osage's unique history have been described in the litigation surrounding the organization of the tribe and the authority of the Tribal Council. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Logan  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Andrus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 457 F. Supp. 1318 (D. Okla., 1978),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> affirmed <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  640 F.2d 269 (10th Cir. 1981). It is apparent that the Osages have a uniquely difficult task in organizing, since they are the only tribe which is excluded from organizing under the provisions of the Indian Reorganization Act and the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act. Also, the Secretary's regulations under the 1906 Osage Allotment Act permit only Osage headright holders to vote for the tribal council.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 4, 1984, the Bureau of Indian Affairs published a final rule (49 FR 39157) to amend 25 CFR Part 5, Preference in Employment. Paragraph (e) of &sect;5.1 specified the date of October 4, 1985, as the final date for making appointments of persons of one-quarter degree Indian ancestry. On September 15, 1986, the Bureau of Indian Affairs published a final rule (51 FR 32632) to revise 25 CFR Part 5, Preference in Employment. Paragraph (e) of &sect;5.1 of this part specified the date of September 15, 1988, as the final date for making appointments of persons of one-quarter degree Indian ancestry. The last final rule published (54 FR 282, January 5, 1989), extended Paragraph (e) of &sect;5.1 to January 5, 1990. Paragraph (e) of &sect;5.1 has expired and should be removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Osage Tribal persons who are employed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and who received preference in any previous appointment will continue to be preference eligible so long as they are continuously employed. However, Osage tribal members who are seeking Federal employment must now meet category (c) of &sect;5.1 of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

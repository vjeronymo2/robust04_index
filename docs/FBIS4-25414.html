The agreement was signed by  the tourism ministers of both countries. The two men decided on  ways for both countries to cooperate and agreed to exchange  information and personnel.    According to the cooperation agreement between Israel and  China, a committee to discuss cooperation efforts and joint  working plans will be established. The committee will meet  alternately in Beijing and Jerusalem. Israeli Tourism Minister  'Uzi Bar'am said that he hopes to witness a significant increase  in tourism between the two countries.    Bar'am arrived in China after a week-long tour of Japan and  South Korea. He was accompanied by Eli Gonen, the director  general of the Tourism Ministry and Shmu'el Tzur'el, assistant  director general of tourism marketing.    In Japan, Bar'am met with senior tourism officials,  including  the president of the travel agents association, who promised to  augment interest in tourism to Israel among Japanese tourist  agents. The president of the Japanese travel agent association  will head a delegation of 500 tourist agents to Israel this  summer.    In South Korea, Bar'am met with senior aviation officials,  who asked him to help expedite the signing of an aviation  agreement between their country and Israel. The South Koreans  asserted that thousands of South Korean pilgrims do not visit  Israel because there are no direct flights. The officials  implied that senior managers at El Al were not making any  efforts to get the agreement signed.</p>

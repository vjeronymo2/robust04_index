			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAVIS CALLS TIME OUT IN BID TO TAKE CONTROL OF NWA  </P> <P> Wealthy Los Angeles oilman Marvin Davis, in an abrupt about-face, declared a  truce Tuesday in his battle for control of NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest  Airlines.  </P> <P> Davis agreed to drop his campaign to unseat NWA's board with his own slate of  directors and to postpone purchases of NWA stock under his outstanding  $90-a-share tender offer. In return, NWA agreed to give Davis confidential  information about the company's financial condition to assist him in making a  bid.  </P> <P> The cease-fire between Davis and NWA is a sharp turning point in Davis'  aggressive, monthlong pursuit of the airline company, which is based in Eagan,  Minn. Until Tuesday, Davis had employed a wide range of tactics to gain control  of NWA, which twice rejected his $2.7-billion cash offer.  </P> <P> Investment analysts speculated Tuesday that Davis sought the truce with NWA  because he faced an uphill battle to replace the airline's board. Also, with  NWA's shares trading at about $102 each, Davis' tender offer stood little  chance of success.  </P> <P> Davis was fighting "a losing battle," said Daniel A. Hersh, an airline industry  analyst with the Los Angeles investment firm of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards  Inc. "It's clear that his bid would not be approved, and the proxy battle would  not be won."  </P> <P> But Davis' attorney said both sides sought the agreement. "It's fair to say  that it was mutual," said George A. Vandeman, a partner with Latham &amp;  Watkins in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Davis, who owns 3% of NWA's shares, had initially balked at signing a  confidentiality agreement with NWA because he believed that the terms were too  restrictive. In return for confidential information, NWA demanded that  prospective bidders not make a hostile bid for the company or accumulate  shares.  </P> <P> Tuesday's agreement allows Davis to resume a hostile bid for the company after  June 30, if NWA has not decided to sell the company by then. The agreement  allows Davis to buy shares under his tender offer after June 30 and also allows  him to launch a second effort to unseat NWA's board after that date. For its  part, NWA said it would give Davis 10 days' notice if it plans to pursue  "non-sale" alternatives.  </P> <P> "This agreement protects and preserves our rights to deal directly with our  fellow NWA stockholders should we become convinced that the process is not  moving in a direction which we believe truly serves stockholders' interests,"  Davis said in a statement.  </P> <P> Hersh, the Bateman Eichler analyst, speculated that NWA agreed to modify the  terms of its confidentiality agreement to avoid a disruptive proxy battle.  Davis and NWA also agreed not to proceed, at least temporarily, with lawsuits  filed against each other in courts in Minnesota and in Delaware, where NWA is  incorporated.  </P> <P> NWA's board is exploring a number of options for the company, including a  special dividend, a stock buyback or a sale of the airline. NWA Chairman and  Chief Executive Steven G. Rothmeier has said he hopes to find an investor who  is willing to act as a "white squire" by taking a large stake in the company.  </P> <P> Besides Davis, NWA has been approached by up to four other investors who are  interested in a "friendly" takeover of the airline. They have been asked to  sign confidentiality agreements that bar a hostile bid for the company.  </P> <P> One of the friendly investors is known to be Alfred A. Checchi, a Los Angeles  investor who leads a group that owns 4.9% of NWA's shares. Among the others are  thought to be two New York investment firms that specialize in leveraged  buyouts -- Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. and Forstmann, Little &amp; Co.  Also named as a possible NWA investor is Ronald O. Perelman, chairman of  Revlon.  </P></p>

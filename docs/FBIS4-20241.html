			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Otto Klambauer and Herwig Schmidl: "Is the </F> Border at the Brenner Uncertain?"]    [Excerpt] In South Tirol the world is no longer in the  balance: Since the election victory of the right-wing alliance  of Forza Italia, the Northern League, and the neofascists, the  South Tirol problem is in the headlines again.    The reason: Italy's neofascists. First it was the hymns of  praise by MSI [Italian Social Movement] leaders about  Mussolini's era that set the alarm bells ringing in South Tirol.  Now, neofascist Mirko Tremaglia has finally caused a commotion  on the Eisack and Etsch Rivers: He is calling for the annulment  of the Osimo treaties, in which Italy and Yugoslavia set down  the rights of the Italian minority in Istria and Dalmatia in  1975. In the same breath, Tremaglia is demanding a revision of  the existing borders.    In South Tirol it is generally accepted that if Italy's  borders are uncertain, then South Tirol's autonomy is also  uncertain. South Tirol People's Party Chairman Brugger counters  with the argument that autonomy is a foregone conclusion. The  "Union for South Tirol" has a harsher formulation: End "the  time of whining and gestures of protest" -- now it is necessary  to also make preparations "for the revision of the unjust border  at the Brenner" and the "departure of South Tirol from Italy."    Today, Thursday, South Tirol's Governor Durnwalder and  Brugger will travel to Vienna for a special summit on South  Tirol. One thing is clear: The situation involving South Tirol  cannot leave Austria, as a protective power, indifferent. This  was confirmed by Foreign Minister Mock in an interview with  KURIER: "As the protective power, we are watching the discussion  with great attention." Mock warns: "We are proceeding from the  assumption that both neighbors are interested in respecting the  agreements that have been concluded (South Tirol package -- the  editor)!"    What is making the situation difficult at the moment is that  there is still no new Italian Government -- and thus, there is  no partner for the talks. Austria, at least, hopes -- and urges  -- continuity in bilateral relations, that is, also for a  commitment of the new Italian Government to the existing South  Tirol treaties. Mock told KURIER: "Exactly. Hopefully there  will be the continuity that you are talking about! I must  assume that the new government, too, will observe the current  legal provisions."    Mock wants to establish contact quickly with the new  government in Rome: "It lies in the nature of the matter that  neighbors always establish basic contacts quickly, as soon as  there is a new government."

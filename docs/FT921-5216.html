			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Rights issue follows DFDS profits rise DFDS, the Danish shipping and transport group, plans a rights issue after increasing pre-tax profits to DKr149m (Dollars 23m) from DKr109m last year, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen The proposed share issue, which will be launched this spring, will raise around DKr370m in present stock market conditions. Group sales rose to DKr5.32bn from DKr5.04bn. The profit after financial items was up to DKr150m from DKr110m. An unchanged dividend of DKr60 per share is to be paid. Recession in the UK and Sweden meant that earnings by Scandinavian Seaways, the passenger shipping division, were little changed despite a 6 per cent climb in the number of passengers. However, the transport division turned in an improved performance.</p>

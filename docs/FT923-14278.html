			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Letter: Angels in the garden The 'appropriately named' Englischer Garten ('Munich finds G7 summit a heady brew', July 6) gets its appropriateness for Frau Kohl and and the other consorts of the leaders by being angelic rather than English. Moreover, the Engels in question are real angels, not friends of Marx called Friedrich. This is Bavaria, after all.

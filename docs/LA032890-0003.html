			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHABARUM WON'T RUN  </P> <P> I have known Sarah Flores for the last 10 years and have been quite impressed  with the devotion and loyalty she had for Schabarum.  </P> <P> It is quite all right for Schabarum to endorse whomever he wants to succeed  him. But it was so sickening of him to be so unkind to Flores who has been such  a loyal and trusted secretary and deputy for 18 years ("Schabarum Snubs Aide  and Backs Judge as His Successor," Part B, March 16).  </P> <P> It will be interesting to note how Schabarum could attract loyal friends and  associates in his future endeavors in Southern California.  </P> <P> VICTOR S.

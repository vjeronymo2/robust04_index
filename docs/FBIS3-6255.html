			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>   [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  inspection team will leave Pyongyang on 15 March after finishing  its 12-day inspection of North Korea.    David Kyd, IAEA information director, said: On 14 March, the  inspection team completed its activities in Yongbyon, which  started on 3 March in response to an emergency order from the  IAEA Secretariat. The team will depart Pyongyang on 15 March  and return to Vienna via Beijing on 16 March.    The IAEA is now considering convening a special Board of  Governors meeting next week after notifying major board members  that the recent inspection activities were unsatisfactory  [manjoksuropchi motaessumul].    Major board members decided that the recent inspection of  North Korea was not sufficient [mihup] to determine if nuclear  materials are being used for other purposes because it was  difficult to collect sample materials due to North Korea's  uncooperative attitude [pukhanui pihyopchoro]. Accordingly, it  seems to be inevitable that a special Board of Governors meeting  will be convened next week.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, the first session of the Belarusian Cabinet  of Ministers' Coordinating Council of Law Enforcement Agencies  -- on combating corruption and crime -- was held. National law  enforcement agencies heads, chairmen of oblasts and a range of  city and rayon executive committees participated in this  meeting. Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich, chairman of the  Coordinating Council, said that combating crime is a key issue.  This is a very important social issue, which in equal measure  concerns both government and residents of the Republic. In the  prime minister's opinion, in order to ensure personal freedom  and self-confidence, not only new approaches by law enforcement  agencies should be introduced but a range of everyday pressing  problems of the citizenry should be resolved as well.</p>

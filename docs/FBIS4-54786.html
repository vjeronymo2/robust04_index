			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 5 -- President Lech Walesa received on  Thursday U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown in Warsaw for  the East-West Economic Forum.    Greeting the guest Walesa said that Poland is trying to  reform its economy. The process is difficult and the road from  communism to capitalism is long, but there is no danger that  Poland will veer from this direction. Walesa also said that he  was counting on the fact that the United States will monitor the  equality of partners. We do not want any special treatment, we  want to be treated as partners emphasised Walesa.    Brown said that the dialogue between the east and west is of  key importance to peace and development in the world. The  United States is very supportive of the changes in Poland, said  Brown adding that the U.S. and Poland are linked very closely  and are co-dependent.</p>

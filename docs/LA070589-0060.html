			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The California State University system will need four to six new campuses --  costing between $2.5 billion and $3 billion -- over the next 16 years, or  thousands of eligible students will be turned away, state higher education  officials said. "If the state can't come up with the funding, if there's a  shortage of either faculty or facilities, a lot of students simply won't get  in," said Frank Jewett, planning director for the state university system.  Officials predict that enrollment will grow by 186,000 students in the next 15  years, to 541,300.  </P></p>

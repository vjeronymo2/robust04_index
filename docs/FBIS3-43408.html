"I guarantee that this trial will be conducted in the strict  observance of the laws in force in the country and in line with  international rules in the matter," the Guinea-Bissau head of  state said in his answer to Portuguese head of state, Mario  Soares, who wrote to him at the end of December to express the  hope of seeing "caution" and "openness" guide this trial.    President Vieira, in his letter published by the LUSA AGENCY  just before the opening of the trial on 4 January, denies the  allegations that the date of da Costa's trial was set up  hastily. "All the steps of the criminal procedure have been  scrupulously observed," President Vieira assured in his letter  to Mr. Soares.</p>

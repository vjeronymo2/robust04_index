			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSAL TO REDUCE RENTERS TAX CREDIT ASSAILED;  </P> <P> STATE FINANCE: FOES OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET-TRIMMING PLAN TELL A LOS ANGELES  HEARING IT AMOUNTS TO SPECIAL TAX INCREASE THAT WOULD HURT THE POOR.  </P> <P> A proposal by lame-duck Gov. George Deukmejian to reduce the renters tax credit  was strongly denounced Monday as a special tax increase on the poor during a  rare hearing in Los Angeles by the state Senate Budget and Fiscal Review  Committee.  </P> <P> Majority-party Democrats opposed to the governor's plan moved the hearing from  Sacramento because of the high renter population here. Renters constitute about  65% of the households in Los Angeles, or 817,000 families, according to city  housing officials.  </P> <P> The governor's proposal would reduce the credit to a flat $52 a year, down from  the current credit of $120 for married couples, heads of households and  surviving spouses and $60 for individuals. Those amounts are paid to all  renters, even people such as welfare recipients who have no taxable income.  </P> <P> Reaction to the governor's plan in Los Angeles was predictable as Mayor Tom  Bradley led a group of critics in the County Board of Supervisors hearing room  in voicing strong disapproval of the governor's budget move.  </P> <P> Bradley called the proposal "an insult to the people of this state who can  least afford it." The Democratic mayor released figures showing that of the 2.2  million households that qualify for the credit statewide, more than two-thirds  have incomes of $10,000 a year or less. In Los Angeles, the average renter  earns $26,000 annually, Bradley said.  </P> <P> Gary Squier, head of Bradley's housing program, sharply disagreed with the  portrayal of the proposal by the Republican Deukmejian as elimination of a  benefit, arguing that "it will have the identical effect of a tax increase."  </P> <P> The credit dates back to passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, which dramatically  reduced taxes for property owners. Lawmakers created the special tax program to  provide some equality to renters in the face of huge benefits given to property  owners when the initiative passed.  </P> <P> With the state facing a potential $800-million deficit in the current year's  budget and a shortfall next year in the range of $5 billion to $6 billion,  Deukmejian offered up the renters credit reduction as part of a $1-billion  emergency plan of cuts and revenue increases.  </P> <P> But the governor's plan, which also called for a reduction in funding for  public schools of $526 million annually, fell on its face almost immediately.  </P> <P> Generally, lawmakers said they would rather wait and deal with Pete Wilson  after the governor-elect is sworn in Jan. 7 before tackling a comprehensive  budget plan.  </P> <P> More specifically, Democrats criticized the proposal because it would single  out low-income Californians for an extra tax bite. The plan ignored a tradition  in the Legislature of dealing with renter and homeowner tax benefits together  as a matter of fairness.  </P> <P> During the hearing Monday, Gail Greer Lyle, director of the nonpartisan  Commission on State Finance, fueled the controversy when she released a chart  showing that bank and corporation taxes over the last five years have steadily  declined, in part because of tax breaks approved by the Legislature in 1987.  </P> <P> David Hamlin, president of the Park La Brea Tenants Assn., said, "I was  astounded to hear that the bank and corporation taxes in California have been  dropping steadily. I don't think it is appropriate to ask the renters, who  represent the lowest level of income earners in this state, to make up the  difference."  </P> <P> Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), one of five Los  Angeles-area lawmakers who attended the hearing, said he and other Democrats  strongly oppose the governor's plan. Roberti said it makes no sense to target  renters for tax increases when wealthier corporate and individual taxpayers are  not touched.  </P> <P> Only one of the nine people who testified during the three-hour hearing was in  favor of the governor's move. James S. Dwight Jr., chief deputy director of the  Department of Finance, defended the proposal in light of the state's pressing  budget problems.  </P></p>

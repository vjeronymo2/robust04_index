			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: MEPs should force the pace to create Emu - The single currency deadline can be met The advantages of a single European currency for lowering transaction costs, supporting competition, and reducing uncertainties are well known. The new members of the European parliament must explain these advantages to their electorates and must reassure them of the soundness of the planned transition to economic and monetary union (Emu). By June 1999, when the new MEPs seek re-election, a European central bank will probably have started to issue Ecus for the first group of countries to embark on monetary union. During the last two years, the European Monetary System (EMS) has seen drama. But the rationale for Emu is unchanged. None of the remaining ERM participants has used the wider bands to cut interest rates excessively or to engineer competitive devaluations. After last summer's crisis, many officials saw countries' willingness to continue stability-oriented policies as a test of the political and economic philosophy behind Emu. The core countries have passed that test with flying colours. Will they be able to transfer to a single currency as early as 1997? A majority of countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands) already fulfils the purely financial criteria set by the treaty. They have low inflation, long-term interest rate convergence and relatively stable exchange rates. However, greater fiscal efforts are necessary to bring deficits into the 3 per cent range set down by the treaty. Lower debt/GDP ratios are also necessary. More time may be needed to achieve convergence. That does not jeopardise the target of a single currency this century. Central bank co-operation must also improve in the approach to the final stage of Emu. The European central bank will be responsible for conduct of monetary policy from the first day of stage three. That implies it will have to supply the banking system with Ecu liquidity through the existing money markets. It can do so efficiently only if these markets are fully integrated beforehand. That in turn requires the convergence not only of long-term interest rates - as stipulated by Maastricht - but also of short-term rates. One way to achieve such convergence is to define common money supply targets for the countries of the stability zone, and then to stop sterilising capital flows between them. The history of the EMS indicates that during the 1980s successful disinflation was linked to some kind of income policy in many countries. The European Parliament could help reduce unemployment and pave the way for economic convergence by stimulating a debate about the need to link pay increases to productivity growth. The European Parliament should monitor the removal of Ecu obstacles. MEPs could create an independent panel of economists and 'wise men' to assess progress. Above all, MEPs can be useful in creating a European-wide consensus about the stability required for Emu to be successful.

The decision to form the  committee was announced at the end of a meeting held at the  headquarters of the Jordanian Arab Socialist Ba'th Party on 27  January 1994. Seventy-five political, party, and independent  key figures attended the meeting at the invitation of the  nationalist Jordanian political parties. After several  meetings, the temporary committee agreed on the final draft of  regulations and bylaws. These will be presented to the general  committee for approval and implementation.    In a statement issued yesterday, the temporary committee  demanded the formation of a broad Jordanian popular movement,  including all those who stand against the agreements of  submission and normalization with the Zionist enemy, to work as  one team to secure the success of the confrontation plan which  expresses the Arab Jordanian people's rejection of capitulation.</p>

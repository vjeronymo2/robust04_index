			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Sajir Zubayr Ja'atah, president of the General Federation </F> of Peasant Cooperative Societies, interviewed by Dhiyab  al-Mafraji; place and date not given]    [Text] The question remains: how do we increase our  agricultural production? We multiply the acreage of cultivated  land. What is required of the peasants, as they are the crucial  factor in the success of any agricultural plan? While Iraqi  peasants have their decreed national role, what is the role of  the General Federation of Peasant Cooperative Societies? Is it a  merely guiding role, or does it have special executive aspects  in its serious endeavor to implement agricultural plans in a  manner suited to our present circumstances, in which we are  contending with the criminal sanctions?    These are the questions AL-'IRAQ posed to Mr. Sajir Zubayr  Ja'atah, the federation's president. We had a dialogue, with  responses that may shed light and provide indications that we  hope may play a broad role in implementation.    The president of the federation said, at the outset of our  interview with him:    "Throughout its long career, our federation has had an  effective and influential role in the production process, in  propelling the agricultural sector forward. At the present time,  as a result of the difficult circumstances and the effect of the  unjust sanctions on the scarcity of agricultural and productive  necessities, everyone is forced to search for other means and  alternatives in order for the production process to continue in  the agricultural sector, without interruption. We are acting to  increase agricultural production at rates surpassing those of  past years. I can confirm that our country is capable of food  self-sufficiency, using the same cultivated areas, if we use  ideal scientific methods in cultivation. We can raise production  standards on the basis of increased yield per acreage unit, in  terms of plants, and per production unit, in terms of livestock.  The 1994 plan focused on our federation's total action and  activity by carrying out the tasks entrusted to us and departing  from traditional formats of work and searching out innovative  methods, with the instructions of President Commander Saddam  Husayn, God preserve him, as the guide for our daily work. The  federation's plan relied upon an emphasis on field  work--productive work."    The president of the federation added that the federation's  working plan for 1994 is founded upon the following bases:    "Reliance upon the sayings and instructions of President  Commander Saddam Husayn, God preserve him, considering them the  guide for our labor, and a permanent program for all our rural  activities, as well as in our political and agricultural work as  the Peasant Cooperative Societies take up their effective and  influential role in mobilizing their energies in the political  and productive fields, and as we make field visits to the  governorates, hold symposiums with the peasants in their  workplaces to explain the dimensions of the current phase and  the economic conditions our combatant country is experiencing,  the importance of the honorable role of the peasantry in  confronting threats and all types of agression, and thwarting  the criminal sanctions."  <H5>  The Organizational Aspect </H5>   "From the organizational standpoint, the plan emphasizes the  development of the local and branch federations and the peasant  cooperative societies. Each local federation selects one peasant  cooperative society for each region, and makes it into a model  society that can be the core of cooperative and advanced action.  We are working to mobilize the peasantry and get them involved  in their societies, training qualified and active persons for  the membership of the administrative boards, and concentrating  on some societies noted for their growth."  <H5>  The Production Aspect </H5>   Turning to the productive (economic) aspect, the president  of  the federation says that "our federation's working plan confirms  our pricing policy, which was set by the leadership, and the  unlimited support of the President Commander that the  agricultural sector has enjoyed. That has been one of the most  important direct means of increasing and developing production,  and getting into the production process in a practical way. It  takes into consideration the reality of production and the  yields realized for various crops, with a study of decreasing  yields and the search for methods available to boost  productivity in the agricultural sector, confirming the  importance of exploiting arable land in a studied and systematic  way. Part of this is the method of farming and the use of types  of seeds, fertilization, pest control, and the monitoring of  yield during the harvest, marketing, and storage phases to  increase agricultural production on one hand, and to put an end  to losses and waste on the other. In addition, we work with all  relevant agencies in the agricultural sector to develop our  work, offer better services, and supply agricultural needs.  Steps will be taken and actions taken toward a fair procedure  for distributing water in the major and branch waterways in  order to provide the water needed for all cultivated areas,  especially in the summer season, rationalizing consumption  through reduced direct outlays; economizing in the use of  primary materials and resources needed in production; setting up  a comprehensive plan for field monitoring and supervision of  actual agricultural work; identifying its problems, finding  suitable solutions for them, and working together with related  agricultural companies in the agricultural sector."  <H5>  Boosting Yields </H5>   "The General Federation of Peasant Cooperative Societies  accords this field special importance, and is coordinating with  research and scientific agencies in the agricultural sector, and  the universities, to achieve an advanced agricultural state  based on what is present and available, to boost yields and  improve them. One of the chief causes of the drop in crop yields  is the weakness and decline of types of seeds used: the seeds  currently in use have been used for years without bringing in a  new strain or type. This has led to the overuse and decline of  the yield of these types. Thus we must reaffirm the need for the  agricultural scientific research agencies to invent new types of  the strains and varieties now in use in the cultivation of  wheat, barley, rise, and other crops, that will achieve higher  yields. This is also the case as relates to the invention of  varieties with a high resistance to salinity. This is a  dangerous pest that has spread in many regions of the country.  We will also study the causes of the deterioration of grain  yields in farming, seeds, the use of fertilizers, irrigation,  and the effect of other factors on that, such as the rise in  salinity, agricultural pests, and other things."    The president of the federation concluded the interview by  saying: "There are other matters relating to the plan, related  to marketing and credit, and making the best use of animal  resources. The General Federation's plan emphasizes these bases  in its work and it is up to the relevant offices and local  federations to undertake the monitoring of detailed plans and  their details with the aim of having them implemented by the  relevant office and local federations, in coordination with the  relevant ministries and offices, each in accordance with its  jurisdiction."</p>

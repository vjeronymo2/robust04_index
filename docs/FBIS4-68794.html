			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Stepan Kiselyov: "Who Is on the Minds of </F> Newspapers"; first paragraph MOSCOW NEWS comment]    [Text] In March of 1994, PRAVDA wrote more frequently about  Boris Yeltsin than other newspapers while IZVESTIA mentioned  Vladimir Zhirinovsky more frequently.    For a year now, sociologists of the Public Opinion fund have  been calculating how frequently the names of famous persons are  mentioned in five central newspapers. They do this regardless of  the context, no matter if he is heaped with abuse or is dipped  in holy oil. That is why "the accounting of newspaper  popularity" is concerned least of all with journalists' likes or  dislikes, but with who was on the tongue of newspapermen in a  given month and, correspondingly, who was in the minds of the  readers of these newspapers.    Judging by the names with the highest index of being  mentioned, the Russian press remains super-politicized.  Forty-three out of the first fifty names are politicians. But  politicians are gradually retreating from the newspaper field;  last year their showing was even more expressive and the  aggregate index of the mentioning of politicians amounted to  6,047 points in March of 1993 as opposed to 3,696 points in  March of 1994. Even the attention of journalists to President  Yeltsin, who still leads the list has fallen threefold during  the year, from 2,049 to 699 points.    As for rising stars, the leader is undeniably the political  scandal-monger Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who didnt' even make the  final fifty last year, and who now occupies seventh place (174  points). The attention of the press to Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin has grown considerably (229 as opposed to 156  points), which testifies not only to the enhanced role of his  government but also to his personal potential as a possible  candidate for the presidency in 1996. It is improtant to note  that the rules of the game in politics demand that a person with  ambitions should always be "within ear-shot" of the electors and  that any mention of his name in a newspaper is publicity. Among  young politicians regarded by the press as possible presidential  candidates, the highest rating belongs to Yegor Gaidar (93  points). The leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord,  Sergei Shakhrai, ranks 27th (48 points), while the leader of the  Yabloko parliamentary faction Grigory Yavlinsky did not even  make the first fifty names, falling behind not only chess  players Garri Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov but also actress  Victoria Ruffo from the superpopular serial "Simply Maria." It  should be said that all the latter, including the spy Aldrich  Ames (197 points), whose popularity in March was less only than  that of Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomydrin, should be  considered "wandering stars" since their appearance at the top  of the scale is quite accidental and liable to fade out by the  end of the month.    If the mention of a name in a newspaper is considered  advertisement, a closer analysis of the list of "newspaper  stars" reveals a paradox: Boris Yeltsin and Yegor Gaidar are  advertised more than others by PRAVDA and SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA,  while Vladimir Zhirinovsky gets more publicity from IZVESTIYA  and MOSCOW NEWS. This is probably explained by the fact that  ideological opponents are nearer and dearer than those who share  one's views. For the Russian press, which is tradionally the  epicenter of political struggle, the genre of expose remains, in  the view of newspapermen, the essence of their work.</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Observer: Selection tray Headhunter Egon Zehnder has just taken on what must be one of its most difficult assignments  - finding a chief executive for the Swiss fine chocolate group, Lindt &amp; Sprungli. The job has changed hands five times in the past six years, and became available again two weeks ago after the autocratic chairman, Rudolph Sprungli, 72, suddenly married a woman 28 years his junior who had reportedly been meddling in the selection of company executives. Fortunately, there are still some members of the family prepared to step in. Luzius Sprungli, the chairman's younger son, plans to join as assistant marketing director next year. His older brother, Rudolf, was ejected by his father as marketing director last year, but Luzius may fare better. He did his dissertation at the University of St Gallen on 'The new role of the board of directors'.</p>

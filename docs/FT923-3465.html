			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: John Govett launches funds JOHN GOVETT Unit Management has launched four authorised futures funds, adding to the limited range of UK unit trusts investing in derivative instruments. The Securities and Investments Board opened the door to unit trusts investing in derivative instruments more than a year ago, but only two companies, John Govett and Legal &amp; General, have so far taken advantage of the new regulations, which many market participants have criticised as too restrictive. Up to 10 per cent of the assets of futures and options funds (Fofs) can be invested in derivative products, while the riskier geared futures and options funds (GFofs) can have up to 20 per cent of their assets in futures and options. ED&amp;F Mann has raised Dollars 220m in year to end July, in joint venture futures funds in various countries, including non-unit trust futures funds in the UK, in conjunction with Providence Capital.</p>

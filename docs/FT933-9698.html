			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Behind the Queen's curtains: Buckingham Palace opens to the public today. Antony Thorncroft took the tour 'They've lowered their guard at Buckingham Palace. The press poured in, bereft of malice.' I HAVE never seen such a subdued hack pack. The opening of most of the finest state apartments at Buckingham Palace to the public from today seems likely to re-establish the gap between sovereign and subjects. Nowhere in the kingdom, nowhere in the world, is such a concentrated collection of masterpieces displayed in such an exalted residential setting. And since the monarchy is mainly theatre, the tour is a masterpiece of dramatic timing. It begins pianissimo. If you dared speak in the well-regulated splendour you might remark that the Grand Hall is quite small, almost domestic, and the Grand Staircase scarcely over-powering. But even in these foothills there are the clues to the secret of Buckingham Palace. It is a shrine to ancestor worship. The walls of the staircase are covered with portraits of Queen Victoria's forbears and family, both the rogues, like her father, the Duke of York, and the characters, like the Duke of Sussex in a kilt. The palace is one monumental family album, with the same faces, especially its founder George IV and his amiable mother, Queen Charlotte, looking down in myriad guises. Sometimes the family are in fancy dress - there is Prince Albert carved as a Roman soldier; sometimes they are pitiful - as in a portrait of the apotheosis of the short-lived princes, Octavius and Alfred, on their way to heaven; sometimes humanity peeps through, as in the portrait of Queen Victoria at her coronation, a tiny apprehensive porcelain doll receiving the hurrahs of her confident subjects. No one is forgotten. There is a tiny octagonal vestibule given over to portraits of Queen Victoria's daughters-in-law. The only members of the family mysteriously absent are the Queen and her immediate relatives. As soon as you reach the first floor you are thrown another dramatic theme: this building is about majesty. Everything, every object, every vista, every cornice, every fabric, proclaims wealth and splendour. You quickly accept that the palace contains the finest collection of Sevres porcelain; unequalled examples of French 18th century furniture by Weisweiler, Carlin, and Reisener; and a picture collection stuffed with Rubens, Rembrandts, and Van Dycks. Amid such ornate decoration the actual Throne Room can dare to be quite sparse, bereft of thrones, but with two comfortable looking chairs embroidered with an 'EII' and a 'P'. After a surfeit of decorative grandeur the Picture Gallery becomes almost pedestrian. I thought it one of the least successful rooms, with its shrimp-pink wall-covering, grills to the electric fires barely hidden inside marble, and the worthiness of the collection, the 18th century's homage to the artists of the 17th. There are splendid things, the Rembrandt portrait of Agatha Bas; the Rubens of St George; the Cuyp of a negro page. But you look in vain for a decorative splash, something French and glitzy. It will look better when the Canalettos return. Having lulled the visitor into a dreamy acceptance of the luxurious the tour ends with a jolt in the finest and happiest rooms, all designed by Nash, with plenty of quirky detail. There is the extraordinary sculpted memorial to that arch republican Milton in the Blue Drawing Room; the critical line of portraits in the State Dining Room (bereft of its table and silver); the fake door of looking glass and pier table in the White Drawing Room through which the royal family materialises to startle its guests. Then there is a lowering again as you descend to the Marble Hall, almost a feeling of returning to a nether world after observing the glory of the gods. It is a hushed finale. Of course these are state apartments, absent of any manifestation of a living majesty. But through the windows of the charming Music Room you see a red-coated servant keeping a wary eye on three waddling corgies, and as you stroll through the garden to the exit you call at the shop and buy the chocolates, crockery and videos, plus the excellent guide to the palace prepared by Apollo magazine, which, with the Pounds 8 entry fee, will help the Queen raise approaching Pounds 3m in the next eight weeks towards the restoration of Windsor Castle. The palace, so austere from the outside, offers a stunning, unsettling surfeit of an experience, eased by the charm of the attendants.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): A classical partner for the computer For most people, computers and music are poles apart. However, Attica Cybernetics of the UK has brought them together to help anyone wanting to know more about classical music, writes Andrew Fisher. Users need an IBM-compatible multimedia PC, with a 386 processor, a CD-Rom drive and sound card with speaker or headphones. At Pounds 99, Attica's CD-Rom 'An Introduction to Classical Music', contains more than four hours of excerpts, pictures and details of more than 40 composers and information on 350 compositions.

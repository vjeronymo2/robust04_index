			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow retreats as May housing data ignored Wall Street A BIGGER than expected rise in May housing starts failed to lift sentiment on US stock markets yesterday, and blue chip issues led equities into lower territory, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 25.41 at 3,329.49. The losses on the more broadly based Stan-dard &amp; Poor's 500 were less extensive, the index finishing down 1.97 at 408.32. The American SE composite slipped 2.66 to 386.12 and the Nasdaq composite shed 4.94 to 564.07. Turnover on the New York SE was modest, at 194m shares, while declines outpaced rises by 952 to 755. Although the morning's economic data - an 11 per cent rise in housing starts last month and a 0.6 per cent increase in May industrial production - should have been broadly positive for equities, investors chose to ignore the data. An afternoon report from the Johnson Redbook Service of a 4.5 per cent decline in early June department and chain store sales only added to the gloom. Compaq fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 25 after Alex Brown &amp; Sons, the Baltimore based broking house, lowered its investment rating for the stock and trimmed its 1992 earnings estimate from Dollars 1.82 a share to Dollars 1.45. Other big computer stocks were mostly weaker, with IBM down Dollars 1 at Dollars 93 and Hewlett-Packard Dollars 2 1/8 lower at Dollars 68 3/8 . Time Warner advanced Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 109 on reports that analysts do not expect major changes at the top of the media group while Mr Steven Ross, Time Warner's chairman, is on temporary sick leave. Arctic Alaska Fisheries soared Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 11 5/8 in heavy trading after the company agreed to be acquired by Tyson Foods in a stock and cash transaction which values each Arctic share at about Dollars 12 3/4 . The news sent Tyson down Dollars 1 to Dollars 17 1/2 on the Nasdaq market. McDonnell Douglas, which fell sharply on Monday on news that it was delaying the launch of its MD-12 jet due to a lack of orders, recovered Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 38 3/4 . Canada TORONTO stocks slipped from afternoon highs, but weathered the weakness of Wall Street fairly well. Shares were boosted in morning trading by the rise in US housing starts for May, but the market quickly discounted the data. The TSE 300 composite index closed just 2.5 down at 3,407.3, while falls led rises by only 290 to 280 after volume of 25m shares valued at CDollars 232m. Mitel surged 24 cents to CDollars 1.69 a day after Schroders &amp; Partners said it will buy British Telecom's 51 per cent stake in the company.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Mining investment trust beats UK record for fund launch Mr Julian Baring, manager of one of the best performing gold funds, has hit the jackpot with his latest brainchild, the Mercury World Mining Trust. This investment company, covering a range of international mining and metals shares, has attracted Pounds 380m before expenses - making it the UK's biggest ever investment trust launch. It easily outpaces the Pounds 280m raised this month by Limit (the London Insurance Market Trust), a Lloyd's corporate capital fund, and the Pounds 246m launch of the M&amp;G Income in 1991. Mr Baring said yesterday that in the pre-placing by merchant bank SG Warburg and broker Cazenove some 173 institutions decided to buy shares in MWMT, which set out to raise a minimum of Pounds 50m. While some big investors bid for Pounds 20m blocks, 'a lot of people have given me a little'. He suggested that many institutions missed having two substantial UK mining groups to invest in. They were left with only RTZ Corporation after the Hanson conglomerate gobbled up Consolidated Gold Fields in 1989. According to Mr Baring, base metals prices are today in a similar position to the gold price a year ago - down in the dumps but ready to bounce back. Consequently, he says it is reasonable to assume that the new trust can make an 80 to 100 per cent return over the next five years. A year ago Mr Baring toured many of the same institutions seeking money for his gold funds. 'I failed miserably,' he said. Subsequently, as he predicted, the gold price perked up and his Pounds 150m Mercury Gold and General Fund now shows a rise of 267 per cent since the launch five years ago. 'We certainly won't throw our money about in the mining markets to everybody else's advantage,' he promised. Base metal prices may take time to recover and he intends that MWMT will initially be biased more towards gold than other commodities. 'Gold shares are likely to behave better earlier and base metals shares should behave better later,' he says. Another Pounds 120m ordinary shares with warrants in MWMT are being offered to private investors at 100p each. There will be one warrant for every five shares. The minimum investment will be Pounds 1,000 and the annual management charge 1.25 per cent. The offer closes on December 8.</p>

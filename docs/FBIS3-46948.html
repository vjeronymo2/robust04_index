Workers of the Hungnam fertilizer complex, the Chenam coal  mine of the Pukchang District coal mining complex, the Sinuiju  shoemaking factory and the Tongdaewon garment factory in  Pyongyang express their determination to thoroughly implement  the tasks set forth by the great leader President Kim Il-song in  his New Year address and challenged the factories and  enterprises of the same trades across the country to a socialist  emulation.    This challenge has evoked response nationwide.    The workers of the Hungnam fertilizer complex vowed to  increase the production of nitrogenous fertilizer 1.4 times and  phosphate fertilizer 2.5 times compared with last year and are  maintaining the full-capacity operation of modern equipment  including the high-pressure compounding tanks and the  compressors, keeping production on a high level.    The employees of the Chenam coal mine resolved to produce  1.5  times as much coal as last year by actively introducing  effective cutting methods, while giving priority to tunnelling  and pit concreting.    The workers of factories and enterprises all over the  country  including the Sinuiju shoemaking factory upheld the slogan "Let  Us Accelerate Vigorously the General March of Socialism in the  Revolutionary Spirit of Self-Reliance and Fortitude" and those  of the Tongdaewon garment factory are resolved to fulfil ahead  of schedule the export plan for this year which is 24 percent  above last year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, June 17 (AFP) -- A court here Friday [17  June] rejected a charge of treason against Beko Ransome-Kuti,  national president of the Campaign for Democracy, but he was  refused immediate bail.    Ransome-Kuti, who was arrested on June 9, heads an umbrella  group for about 40 pro-democracy and human rights organisations.    The Federal High Court rejected on technical grounds a  charge  of treasonable felony and intent to remove the head of state by  unconstitutional means.    Consideration of a bail application was postponed until  Tuesday.    Ransome-Kuti has been spearheading a campaign to remove the  military junta from power.</p>

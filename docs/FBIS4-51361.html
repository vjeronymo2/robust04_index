			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 26 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai, an  international metropolis, has again become prominent on the  western shore of the Pacific Ocean, after 45 years of  construction.    Since May 27, 1949, when the government of the New Republic  took over the city from the Kuomintang, the fixed assets  investment in state-owned enterprises here has accumulated to  250.4 billion yuan, a more than 40-fold increase over 1952. Its  annual increase has reached 19.8 percent,    The traditional industries, such as textiles, shipping,  power  and iron and steel, have expanded their production capacities --  in some cases even hundreds of times.    The modern pillar industries like automobiles and  telecommunications have grown rapidly from the ground up.    Statistics show that in the 1953-1993 period the city  registered an annual growth of 8.6 percent in output value, 11.7  percent in local finance, 9.7 percent in industrial output value  and 8.9 percent in retail turnover.    Compared with 1952, the city's export volume shot up  61-fold,  and imports, 888-fold.    This rising economic strength has given a push to the  sectors  of science, education, medicine and health.    Now, the city boasts a strong technical force of 888,800  professionals and a comprehensive medical care system.    Citizens' incomes, excluding inflation indices, have  increased by an average of four percent a year since 1952.    The dynamic market economy, featuring rising industries such  as securities, telecommunications and real estate, and the  development of the Pudong New Area, has been strongly backed by  the ongoing infrastructure construction, which is forging ahead  with 60 billion yuan poured in this year.    It is expected that the 1990s will be a take-off decade for  Shanghai to become a financial and trade center for the whole  Asia-Pacific region.</p>

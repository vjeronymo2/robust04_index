			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / July likely for audit change Legislation exempting small companies from an annual audit will not be in force before the end of July, the Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday. The legislation moved ahead with the release of the text of the draft statutory instrument. It said the exemption would apply immediately to any eligible companies which had not yet filed accounts. This could allow those with financial year-ends as early as last November to take immediate advantage of the relaxation. The amendments, announced in November's Budget, will exempt companies with turnover less than Pounds 350,000 a year and a balance sheet total of up to Pounds 1.4m. Companies with turnover above Pounds 90,000 will be required to include a 'compilation report' with less rigorous demands. The exemption will not apply to public companies, banking or insurance companies, those authorised under the 1986 Financial Services Act or a parent company or subsidiary. The compilation report must be by members of one of five recognised bodies - the three chartered accountancy bodies covering the UK and Ireland, the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants and the Association of Authorised Public Accountants.</p>

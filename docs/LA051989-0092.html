			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> KTTV Channel 11 broadcast the wrong set of Lotto numbers Wednesday night,  setting off a chain of disappointments for people who thought they had won.  While televising a Dodgers baseball game against the Mets in New York, KTTV  superimposed six numbers and a bonus number at the end of the game telecast.  Lotto officials, who reported receiving about 100 phone calls per hour Thursday  concerning the error, said they had been told that there was a technical mix-up  and KTTV accidentally used numbers that had been chosen in the April 12  drawing. "We've had calls from people who said they had the winning number, but  they tore up their tickets," said California Lottery spokeswoman Joanne McNabb.  Said KTTV program director Don Tillman: "It was one of those things that  shouldn't happen."  </P></p>

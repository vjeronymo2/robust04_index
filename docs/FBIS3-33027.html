The Foreign Minister explained: "They have invited the  Salvadoran Attorney General's Office to be present at the trial  and have asked our investigating units to participate with their  U.S. counterparts."    The foreign minister said the U.S. Embassy is aiding the  relatives of Jose Crescencio Diaz, the bodyguard murdered on 21  January in Soyapango.    The U.S. officer left El Salvador almost immediately after  Diaz' death. This moved the Salvadoran Government to send a  protest note to the U.S. Government asking for penalties for  whoever was responsible of violating Salvadoran immigration laws.    On another issue, the foreign minister said it is expected  El  Salvador will be taken off the list of countries that violate  human rights by the end of February or the beginning of March.    Reportedly the UN Human Rights Committee, which is meeting  in  Switzerland, will be adopting this decision.    The official said a group of Salvadoran experts is  participating in that meeting and, if necessary, he would return  to Switzerland to be present for the voting.    Salaverria said: "As a result of the signing of the peace  agreements, human rights violations that were a product of the  war dropped considerably, and the country's situation looks  different."    Foreign Minister Salaverria said he has sent letters to the  countries that are members of the commission to help in taking  El Salvador off a list "on which we should not be listed."</p>

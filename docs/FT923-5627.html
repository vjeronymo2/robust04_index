			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Builders hard hit again ANOTHER set of dire statistics from the influential Builders Merchants Federation (BMF), hard on the heels of equally serious warnings of impending dividend cuts throughout the sector, left building shares in disarray yesterday. Builders merchants bore the brunt of determined and often heavy selling pressure as specialists focussed on the latest bad news from the BMF. Figures released by the Federation showed July sales 2.7 per cent lower than in the corresponding month last year, compared with a 0.2 per cent increase in June against the corresponding month. Earlier this week, building shares fell sharply after County NatWest issued a blanket sell recommendation on the contracting and building materials sectors. Next week sees the start of the autumn reporting season for these sectors. Mr Robin Hardy, building analyst at Panmure Gordon, warned of 'horror stories that will surely emerge during the next month, with poor results and dividend cuts, or warnings at the very least least, likely to be the order of the day.' Panmure expects that, by the end of the year, close to 60 per cent of the contractors and 40 per cent of the materials companies will have cut their dividends. Worst hit by news of the BMF sales figures were Meyer International, the timber specialists, which slumped 31 to 204p, Heywood Williams, glass and aluminium products, 20 lower at 139p. Hepworth, the building materials supplier, dropped 16 to 264p. Lucas slide Automotive and aerospace group Lucas Industries was one of the worst hit stocks in the London market yesterday with selling coming from the US. Also, worries over the safety of the dividend are growing amid bad news from many areas of the motor industry. The shares fell 7 to 83p - the lowest for at least five years - on turnover of 2.3m. The shares began to slide in early trading as a block of stock failed to find a home. Then, computer-operated pension fund BatteryMarch was said to have turned seller. Dealers added that the market believes Lucas's historic 7p dividend is unsustainable this year and has been making its point by marking down the share price. At 83p Lucas is on a gross yield of 11.2 per cent which is seen as far too high compared with the sector average of around 8.27 per cent. Sentiment was further affected by news of layoffs at Jaguar and warnings from several big European car manufacturers of grim conditions in the second half of this year. The flow of bad news from the brewing, hotels and leisures industries continued to cast a shadow over shares in these sectors. Grim warnings on Thursday from Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the brewing and leisure group as well as Greene King, the brewer, followed a similar announcement from Grand Metropolitan on Monday and a series of profits downgrades on Bass and Whitbread. Scottish &amp; Newcastle, down 19 on Thursday, dropped 7 more to 383p yesterday while Bass retreated a further 13 to 475p. Rank Organisation, heavily involved in the UK leisure industry, via its film, video, hotel, holidays and bingo hall businesses, came under increased pressure yesterday, retreating 15 to 504p. Analysts at many of the big broking houses were looking hard at their Rank estimates after the warning from Scottish &amp; Newcastle. The current range of estimates is from around Pounds 230m to Pounds 260m with many at the top end beginning to chop their numbers closer to the Pounds 230m mark. The market continued to focus on Glaxo as a number of UK fund managers who are underweight in the stock were said to be concentrating on a number of positive factors. The need to adjust holdings prompted the shares to rise 12 to 722p yesterday on turnover of 4.7m. Observers are looking towards a meeting of the US Food and Drug Administration advisory committee on Thursday to discuss wider use of Glaxo's chemotherapy drug Zofran. Then, on September 8, the group will address a symposium on its anti-migraine medication Imigran. It is hoped this will hasten US approval for injectable Imigran. Finally, investors are awaiting full-year results on September 10. Glaxo is expected to announce profits of between Pounds 1.42bn and Pounds 1.46bn and an increase in the dividend, possibly by as much as 40 per cent. Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome had a slow start but gathered pace during the day turning an early fall of 2 into a gain of 17 at 817p. There was interest at the disclosure, earlier than expected, of a meeting by US authorities to review an AIDS-related drug. Then, in New York, Salomon Brothers joined the general enthusiasm of UK securities houses by initiating coverage of Wellcome with a buy rating. Wellcome is also still affected by technical factors as dealers seek to find a level for the share price following the recent share issue by Wellcome Trust. British Bio-Tech jumped 20 to 452p in response to its inclusion in the FT Actuaries list. NatWest substantially underperformed the rest of the big banks after hints that one of the big broking houses was preparing a profits downgrade. No confirmation of such a move was forthcoming but NatWest shares remained weak, closing 7 off at 294p. Insurance broker Sedgwick kept up its recent strong performance, stimnulated by the latest rise in the dollar and optimism over US insurance rates. Television production and services group Carlton Communications recovered 12 to 559p with SG Warburg Securities repeating its buy recommendation. The house admires the company's balance sheet, likes its exposure to US recovery and, although it maintains its full-year profit estimate of Pounds 102.5m, feels the forecast might be conservative. Information and electronic systems group Reuters jumped 22 to 1049p with a number of analysts focusing on prospects for the group's new dealing systems. Mr Brian Newman of Henderson Crosthwaite said the derivative products dealing system Globex was now seeing more than 5000 contracts traded every day and Dealing 2000-2, the foreign exchange product was now used at around 85 sites. However, another analyst said Reuters was still not happy with the progress of 2000-2. Isle Of Man Steam Packet retreated 12 to 167p after the steep fall in half-year profits. BAA closed 13 off at 632p, hit by worries about profits downgrades and potential damage to the group's business by another outbreak of conflict in Iraq. British Airways eased 5 to 224p for the same reason. Slough Estates, the UK's fourth-biggest property company, continued to make progress after Thurday's dividend reduction which had been expected. Dealers said yesterday's rise, which put a further 9 on the shares to 104p, following a gain of 6 on Thursday, was a reflection of the attractive yield and recovery prospects.

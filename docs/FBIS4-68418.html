			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA interview with Vazha Lordkipanidze, </F> head of the Apparatus of the Georgian Head of State: "Reforms  Need To Be Carried Out More Radically": place and date not  given]    [Text]    [Correspondent] Recently, certain political circles have  been  blaming particular problems on the fact that the Head of State  does not have a team to help him carry out his course of action.  What do you think about that, and can we say that the Head of  State's Apparatus does constitute a team?    [Lordkipanidze] At first we didn't even know the concept of  team and we paid no attention to that factor. Now we are  swinging to the other extreme and link the solution to any more  or less important problem to the existence of a team. First we  ought to figure out what we mean by "team." If we think of it as  a group of persons who work for just one man and have assigned  functions--someone creates the image, someone does the  biography, someone writes up the conception, and so  on--Shevardnadze couldn't even have such a team, for it would  take considerable time, traditions, and the right circumstances.  If, however, we mean the people who think like Shevardnadze and  are his comrades-in-arms, whom he asks for advice and uses it to  make decisions, and through whom he tries to implement those  decisions, then he has always had that team and it is  numerically strong right now.    In my opinion, this fuss over whether Shevardnadze does or  does not have a team comes from two causes: the first is the  extreme that I already mentioned, the second is a more serious  one. The fuss is a deliberate one, because if Shevardnadze does  not have people who think like him, with whom he can assess the  situation, if he doesn't have a laboratory where he can think  through programs, strategies, and tools of implementation, in  that case, of course, the Head of State will look powerless,  there will be no government or even a state. Certainly the  staffers of the Apparatus, along with other political and state  figures, scientists, and specialists who surround the Head of  State, do make up his team. The Head of State's Apparatus is a  part of his team. One of the main principles governing the  structure of the Apparatus derived exactly from that. When  creating the Apparatus on the basis of the law passed by the  Parliament we studied practically every country's experience and  created the structure of the Apparatus on that basis. When we  put it together we received advice from German and American  colleagues and experts from the Euro-Association. They are still  working in the Apparatus and helping us. Just as there is  nothing exactly like the institution of the Head of State, the  Apparatus as well is a vehicle of new content. It is a structure  that serves analytical rather than executive functions. Its  duties are defined such that there is no way it can take over  the functions of the Cabinet of Ministers, much less the  Parliament. It cannot be compared to any old structure of  centralized administration; in the context of the necessity of  carrying out a rigorous policy of decentralization, such  centralization would be wholly unacceptable. The Apparatus's job  is to help the Head of State work out his position with respect  to the development of various spheres, sectors, and processes.  This also entails the formulation of long-term conceptions and  program documents, also local issues. However, our activity is  in no way linked to the executive branch. I can state  confidently that there has never been a single instance of  interference in the old or the new Cabinet of Ministers or any  ministry or their functions. We have never had a single quarrel  with the executive branch, let alone a conflict. This is  natural. Our jurisdictions don't intersect, nor could they. The  guarantees of this are built into the structure of the  Apparatus's task. No attempt by any private person can violate  that.    [Correspondent] Does the Apparatus take part in cadre  selection and appointments? For example, ministers and their  deputies, factory directors, and so on?    [Lordkipanidze] The Apparatus only takes part in the  selection and appointment of leadership cadres for bodies of  local administration. The Parliament granted this right to the  Head of State. In the Apparatus, essentially a specially created  service performs this function. The final decision is made by  the Head of State after consulting with leaders of the Cabinet  of Ministers and taking account of recommendations by  parliamentary commissions and factions. As for the selection of  ministry leadership and other cadres, the Apparatus is not  involved; that is not its function.    [Correspondent] By what principle do you choose members of  the Apparatus?    [Lordkipanidze] We have posts of adviser, state adviser, and  consultant; this in itself defines the criterion--high  professionalism and high moral qualities. You often hear, to be  sure, that the Apparatus is bloated, but compared to similar  institutions in other countries the number of our staffers is  modest; it is only a third as large as even the smallest  apparatuses of heads of state anywhere in the world. We include  academicians, professors and holders of the doctorate,  candidates of science, and representatives of 16 parties and  movements.    Any work with us goes essentially by the principle of  agreement; on the one hand this enables us to avoid creating an  entrenched bureaucracy, and on the other hand it enlarges the  circle of membership. We work with all the scientific research  institutions of the Academy of Sciences, the Tbilisi State  University and its departments, almost all the sociological  survey centers in Tbilisi, and representatives of both the  traditional and modern schools of psychology.    [Correspondent] And does all this material come to the  attention of the Head of State?    [Lordkipanidze] Shevardnadze's energetic industriousness is  well known. This means that he himself works with all the  services in the Apparatus. There are no hierarchical levels in  business dealings with him. He is in direct contact with  practically all the Apparatus's top officials, meeting with them  regularly and listening to them. He has the same direct contacts  with ministry and department officials, mayors, and local  administrators. These contacts are basically made outside the  Apparatus. You can argue with the Head of State and express your  opinion. That is the main criterion of his demands--rigorous  thinking, innovation, the creative and systematic approach to  problems. He is a very good and courteous listener. He listens  carefully to his advisers and correlates their opinions, but he  always makes the decision himself. There is nobody who can force  a decision on Shevardnadze. I don't mean cases where someone has  confronted the Head of State with a short-sighted and  thoughtless action and created serious problems for the country.  Nor am I referring to compromise decisions dictated by some  untenable predicament.    I flatly disagree with the notion that the Head of State  places the Apparatus before Parliament. The Head of State, like  every Apparatus staffer, understands the Parliament's crucial  importance very well in its capacity as one of the chief and  essential institutions and guarantors of independent statehood  and democracy.    [Correspondent] We often hear charges that Shevardnadze has  not figured out what kind of Georgia he is building. There are  some who accuse him of trying to return to socialism, while  others accuse him of wanting to build a Chinese-style socialism.  What does Shevardnadze really want?    [Lordkipanidze] I don't agree with the notion that  Shevardnadze has not worked out a program; he has, and he has  announced it publicly many times.    Some people also accuse Shevardnadze of not even having a  conception or orientation of a foreign policy. This charge is  convincingly refuted by the Head of State's calculated system of  official visits abroad in the past year. The past year and a  half has been an active period of foreign policy formulation for  Georgia. I believe this process is certainly continuing today,  and I'm certain that the results of his official visit to the  U.S. will constitute clear proof of that.    Is it mere chance that Georgia is the chair country of the  Black Sea Basin Countries Commonwealth, entailing new forms of  integration of relations? That Georgia is a member of the  Euro-Association and Euroconference? That we have representation  in NATO? Isn't our orientation reflected in the formula "a  commonwealth of commonwealths," which Shevardnadze suggested  some time ago and which the world community has already accepted  and confirmed? Surely that was not said just for the sake of the  phrase; rather, it embodies processes that are favorable to us,  very specific and promising. In my opinion, that represents a  global orientation.    Hence, on the one hand we are pursuing a Westward  orientation, and I personally am in favor of that. On the other  hand, certain vehicles of that orientation pay no attention to  the opinion of the West and its political leaders specifically  regarding Georgia, our state and our Head of State. The West has  never had any doubt about Shevardnadze's policy course and its  orientation. How could anyone assume that the West, the U.S.,  doesn't know where Georgia is heading and what its orientation  is and still offer support and trust to Shevardnadze?    The charge of trying to turn back the clock is absurd,  because the very process of turning back is absurd and  inconceivable. It is impossible to stop historical development,  progress, and civilization, to turn back the clock.    It is entirely natural and logical, then, that Shevardnadze  cannot be nostalgic for the past, unlike certain opposition  politicians who define the present by a Georgia of the late  Middle Ages and are more inclined to embrace the concepts and  orientations of that period than of a Georgia of the 21st  century.    [Correspondent] Nevertheless, reforms in Georgia are going  very slowly to say the least. Not only that but there are  increasingly louder calls for restoring the old structures  before creating new ones....    [Lordkipanidze] It may be true that we were in fact too  hasty  to dismantle certain structures, but there is no way we are  going to correct that mistake with a bigger mistake. There is  absolutely no way we can begin to restore the old structures and  then transform them later, because that will cause even more  destruction.    I am in favor of carrying out reforms much more radically. I  believe that the only realistic way out of our grave  social-economic situation is to carry out radical economic  reforms and establish market relations everywhere and in  everything. But this will take a new system of thinking;  everyone will have to understand the need for private property,  development of the private sector, entrepreneurship and  business. We have the chance to become a state having an  independent economic system, and we must not pass up that  chance. We already let it slip through our fingers. We must  never repeat that mistake. Unfortunately, Georgia is not well  endowed with highly qualified cadres of economists, so at the  initial stage we will have to have help and advice from foreign  specialists. The paradox of it is that the West is actively  trying to help us in this, yet we keep on doing things our own  way. No systematic work is being done in this regard.    [Correspondent] In my opinion, those who oppose the  formation  of a market economy aren't willing to make concessions. When  some minister or big enterprise executive gives a speech you get  the impression that either he has no conception of market  relations or he is deliberately playing the fool.    [Lordkipanidze] Indeed, often they have only a hazy idea of  the new relations. Let's keep in mind that we used to study  economics in the Course of Political Economy. Some people really  are fooling themselves, because market relations are in conflict  with their personal interests. We also need to keep in mind that  corruption still flourishes.    Of course, the principles of the market economy will  diminish  the rights of the ministries. When market relations are in  place, the ministries will no longer have the economic functions  they did in the era of the centralized, planned economy. In my  opinion, the ministries should retain the function of policy and  strategy formulation and, for example, the implementation and  monitoring of two or three federal programs. Moreover, the  process of decentralization and destatization must not be done  at one stroke but in well-thought-out phases. In the initial  stage we need to formulate new, mutually beneficial relations  and principles governing the ministry and its subordinate links.  This could be done by agreement or some other specific form.    [Correspondent] That makes all the more surprising the  recently launched campaign against private structures....    [Lordkipanidze] A lot of honest men have gone into business  these days, because they want to realize their potential, and  business gives them plenty of opportunities. The only thing that  can regulate the private sector, again, is economic levers. Of  course we cannot permit the looting of the state, but we must be  very careful not to smother business just as it is getting on  its feet. Unfortunately, we see the danger of this everywhere.    Unfortunately, we often make big mistakes which we then  blame  on other people's maliciousness. Instead of going through  specific, phased periods, we dismantled everything that was old  but failed to create anything new. In the late 1980s we faced  specific economic problems which would have been much easier to  find realistic and promising solutions to then, through joint  efforts, than today. Instead of acting wisely, we are at each  other's throats. All we do is yell, We'll tighten our belts and  make it through.... Now that we have a ruined economy on our  hands, we will have to start from scratch to find solutions,  ways to restore the economy, essential and beneficial economic  ties. It is probably due to excessive politicization that we  have not yet appreciated Russia's economic market and its truly  rich potential. At a time when the whole world was rushing to  get in on Russia's market, we who were already there--at a time  when we had more opportunities than ever before to take  advantage of that market--we were in the process of abandoning  it, and consciously or unconsciously we rejected  everything--including things that objectively belonged to us. I  think we didn't know then and possibly we haven't realized even  today, that a totally new social-economic entity has taken shape  in Russia itself: capitalism is developing vigorously in Russia.  This opens prospects for completely new, mutually beneficial  economic relations on a non-imperial basis. If we had realized  this in time we wouldn't be in this predicament today.    How would this benefit us today? Well, Russia and Georgia  would be dotted with joint enterprises founded on mutually  beneficial terms. Economic partnership would not be linked  solely to political and state relations between us, and changing  them would no longer depend on the will and desires of just a  few political forces. Production would be revived. Goods would  be produced, a sure guarantee against inflation. We would also  gain much in political terms: a very strong and influential  segment of people in Russia, the segment basically in charge,  businessmen, would be interested in Georgia and good relations  with it. They would oppose, for example, the reactionary mafia  that defeated us in Abkhazia.    Our relations with the West would also be different. In  1990,  I used to receive five or six solid foreign businessmen every  day in the Council of Ministers; they were interested in  economic cooperation with Georgia on new principles. Naturally,  they also wanted to use Georgia to enter the Russian market, but  if we had taken advantage, Georgia would have all kinds of  operating Western-Georgian joint enterprises right now, and we  would be linked to the West with economic threads. Then there  would be many more people in the West who cared about Georgia  and its fate, and Western aid and support would go beyond mere  moral support. We suffered very badly from the absence of such  support during the tragic days of Sukhumi. And if we are to be  objective, the West's moral support was due to the reputation  and world authority of just one man--our Head of State.    I am certain, though, that the most effective way to settle  any regional conflict is to pursue a course of radical economic  reform. I have no doubt that in the future, it is the activation  of economic mechanisms that will prove to be the most effective  and realistic way to finally settle the regional conflicts with  Abkhazia and Tskhinvali.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] At dawn today, there was a massacre in the  occupied West Bank city of Hebron. The Israeli version says  that an Israeli settler opened fire on a group of worshipers at  the Tomb of the Prophet Abraham, killing 13 and wounding many  others. [passage omitted]    The PLO gives a different casualty toll for the massacre.  PLO Information Head Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh has told our radio that  more than one settler carried out the attack. [passage omitted]    [Begin 'Abd-Rabbuh recording] The crime that took place at  dawn today, and which was carried out by groups of settlers  against the sons of the Palestinian people and the worshipers in  the blessed Ibrahimi Mosque, martyred more than 30 Palestinians  and wounded 150 others. The crime took place under the eyes,  ears, and supervision of the Israeli occupation army.    The Rabin government and the occupation army are completely  responsible for this crime. No peace can be achieved on  Palestinian land as long as a single settler remains on it.  These are criminal gangs, and they are one of the tools of  occupation, and they must leave Palestinian land with the end of  the occupation.    The PLO views this crime as a very grave turning point.  Complete protection for our people should be guaranteed. Such  protection can never be provided by this occupation, and by the  army of occupation -- one of the tools of killings as we have  seen over the past two days in Abu-Dis and al-Ram. Therefore,  to have an international presence to guarantee protection for  our people is inevitable. The command will adopt several  measures in the next few hours to ensure real security in light  of these crimes and the serious threats our people  experience.[end recording]</p>

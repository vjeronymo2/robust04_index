			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carlos Rafael Jimenez for the "Doing Radio" </F> program in Havana -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] We are in front of the  provincial directorate for aqueducts, sewers, and ditches in  Havana. Carlos Rollan, Jose Silva, and I are here in an effort  to get a firsthand report on water distribution. It is true we  have received more calls than usual this morning. People have  called us, although they are well aware of the limitations we  have concerning the distribution of water, meaning you get it  every other day.    For example, Mr. Mendez called us today and said La Vibora  was scheduled to get water yesterday, but that they got it for  only one hour. Others called us from Havana's old sector and  downtown areas.    In other words, we got more calls than usual to talk about  water distribution. This prompted us to come here to the office  in charge of Havana's aqueducts. I am waiting for Comrade  Humberto Munguia, assistant director of the waterworks. He was  located by plant personnel, brought directly from the operations  room, and was asked to come here. He said he will be here in  approximately 15 minutes.    Meanwhile, I have something to announce. El Gato aqueduct  will shut down today for maintenance work. Everyone knows it was  built some years ago and has helped considerably in the  distribution of water in Havana. The facilities in Vento, that  historic aqueduct, also faces problems because its reservoir  levels are low. I looked at the tanks through which water is  gravity-fed at El Alvear, and I saw that their contents are far  below the necessary level.    Since I am not a specialist on this topic, we will wait for  Comrade Humberto Munguia's reprt on the topic that brought me  here, meaning that although they are aware of the limitations,  people called me to report that the distribution of water in  Havana has decreased.</p>

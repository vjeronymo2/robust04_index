			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by political editor Fanny Wong] </F>   [Text] They talk, they argue, they frown, they laugh in  front of the camera, explaining policies and putting them into  action. Technically they are the servants of the Crown, the  policy-makers who determine the fate of Hong Kong's  six-million-strong population.    Day in and day out, Hong Kong people take it for granted  that  these mandarins, the civil servants, are there and the services  delivered. At midnight June 30, 1997, the Queen, the Union  Jack, Governor Chris Patten will all become history in Hong  Kong. But will all these familiar faces also be a matter of the  past? Who determines their fate? China? Britain? Or Hong  Kong?    After more than a decade of protracted preparation for 1997,  the change in sovereignty from British to Chinese may not have  such a profound impact on the man in the street, but for those  striding along the corridors of power, it could make or break  careers. So much has been said about continuity of service, but  with China and Britain in dispute, there is simply no guarantee  that the top brass of the Civil Service will ride the through  train.    Mr Patten obviously has his short-list of candidates to fill  the 22 principal official posts which, under the Basic Law, have  to be occupied by Chinese nationals without right of abode in  any foreign country. Beijing, having announced its plan to go  it alone, is compiling its own list. Neither list has been  finalised, but preferences are undoubtedly noted for some of the  strategic positions.    Mr Patten's choices are expected to be the more  straightforward, as the basic selection criteria should be the  candidates' experience and expertise. China's consideration may  be more complicated, as the leadership line-up will have to  reflect the change of sovereignty.    In any case, the first Chief Executive of the Special  Administrative Region (SAR) Government, whose task will be to  nominate and report to the Central People's Government on the  appointment of principal officials, will have a lot of influence  in drawing up the final list. The big question on the minds of  Hong Kong's would-be leaders is how the two lists differ and how  much disruption that will bring.    Under Mr Patten, the careers of the Chief Secretary, Anson  Chan Fang On-sang, and the Secretary for the Civil Service,  Michael Sze Cho-cheung, have blossomed, but whether they will  wilt in the post- 1997 regime is anybody's guess. In the run-up  to 1997, save for any unforeseen events, Mrs Chan is sure to  stay on as Chief Secretary, and it has also emerged that Mr Sze  is a leading contender to be the first local Financial  Secretary. Word that both Mrs Chan and Mr Sze will be turfed  off the civil service through train at the changeover may be too  severe.    Equally, it might be rather optimistic to think they can  continue to stay in the positions of enormous influence. When  the mood in Zhongnanhai accords so much importance to  allegiance, an automatic inheritance of the key players in the  Patten administration is rather remote. By the same token those  who are not seen as particularly favoured by the Governor and  who do not openly promote his policy on Sino-British matters  stand a better chance of moving up the hierarchy.    Joseph Yam Chi-kwong, head of the Monetary Authority,  believed to be the public officer in Hong Kong most trusted by  China, remains the front-runner as the post-1997 financial  chief. As for the post of Chief Secretary, the Secretary for  Home Affairs, Michael Suen Ming-yeung, is seen as one of  Beijing's potential candidates. By 1997, Mr Suen will be the  most senior local policy secretary, because Secretary for  Education and Manpower, Michael Leung Mankin, is expected to  retire by then.    Although Mr Suen, formerly Secretary for Constitutional  Affairs held the sensitive position when Sino-British relations  deteriorated in the aftermath of the June 4 massacre, his  experience and relatively low-key and non-confrontational  approach have made him stand out as a candidate for the top  position.    The next most important post in the SAR hierarchy, but yet  to  be created, is Hong Kong's top representative in Beijing to  lobby on its behalf with the central authorities. Ideally, Hong  Kong should have set up its representative office in Beijing,  but the current icy relationship has simply made that impossible.    But post-1997, such a post will be indispensable, and the  candidates are expected to include Secretary for Economic  Services, Gordon Siu Kwing-chue, and Secretary for  Constitutional Affairs, Nicholas Ng Wing-fui. Their frequent  contacts with Chinese officials have given them ample  opportunity to deal with their mainland counterparts and  understand the mainland system.    The policy branch for the Beijing office should be the  Constitutional Affairs Branch. While Mr Ng currently occupies  the post, in mapping out the new team Mr Patten may want to  bring in some new blood, such as Lam Woon-kwong, currently  Deputy Secretary for Education and Manpower. Mr Lam's recent  performance in handling the old age pension proposal is  understood to have impressed the administration. His good  political sense may also put him on the list as the post-1997  constitutional chief.    Another sensitive position is the Secretary for Security  post  which is expected to be taken up by Mr Ng's deputy, Peter Lai  Hing- ling, given his strong Joint Liaison Group (JLG)  experience. Equally, Mr Ng, now a full JLG member, could be a  contender.    A more difficult vacancy to fill is the high-powered  position  of head of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC),  as the appointee has to be a person of high principle, tough and  independent-minded while also senior enough to command the  respect of the anti-graft team. Among the senior officials the  Treasury Secretary, Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, is considered to have  all the qualities to be a leading choice for the ICAC post  before and after the changeover.    But such a possibility will not deprive him of the chance to  be a candidate for the pre-1997 Financial Secretary post, given  his experience. Taking over from Mr Tsang before or after 1997  is expected to be his deputy, Kwong Ki-chi, or the  Director-General of Industry, Denise Yue Chung-yee, also a  deputy in the Finance Branch.    As it is the Government's plan to get the new team in place  in early 1996 at the latest, Mr Patten still has time to  finalise it. China's final decision may depend on Mr Patten's  choices. Provided China does not appoint non-civil servants to  principal posts, the membership of the pre- or post-1997  leadership will not differ much, as the choices are rather  limited.    On both lists, would-be leaders are expected to include  Secretary for Trade and Industry, Chau Tak-hay, Secretary for  Recreation and Culture, James So Yiu-cho, Secretary for  Transport, Haider Barma, Commissioner for Transport, Rafael Hui  Si-yan, Director of Education, Dominic Wong Shing-wah, Director  of the New Airport Projects Co-ordination Office, Billy Lam  Chung-lun and head of the Government's Geneva trade office,  Joseph Wong Wing-ping.</p>

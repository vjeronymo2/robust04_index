			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: S&amp;P downgrades Aetna unit The life insurance subsidiary of Aetna, the US composite insurer, was downgraded yesterday by Standard &amp; Poor's in a move which could hit its ability to attract new business. The downgrading came as Aetna revealed an after-tax loss of Dollars 366m last year (Dollars 593m before accounting changes), resulting from substantial one-off charges announced two weeks ago. The charges, amounting to Dollars 1.28bn after tax, stemmed from the company's move to stop offering unprofitable guaranteed investment and annuity products, and to cut 4,000 jobs in an attempt to lift its lacklustre performance. S&amp;P said it had lowered its rating of Aetna Life's claims-paying ability to A plus, removing its double-A rating. Given the long-term nature of many life insurance products, a strong rating is an important factor in many customers' minds when selecting an insurance company. S&amp;P said the downgrade was based in part on an assessment of the charge made against discontinued annuity products. Though the assumptions that lay behind this charge seemed reasonable, Aetna Life might eventually need to set aside more to cover the costs of these products, which would not run off for 30 to 40 years, S&amp;P said. The agency added that the life company had become more reliant on its health insurance operations, and the future for this business was unclear given the debate in the US over healthcare reform. Aetna disputed S&amp;P's decision, saying that its life company was stronger than it had been before the charges. It also said other rating agencies continue to give a double A rating to its claims paying ability.</p>

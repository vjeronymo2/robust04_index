			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Markets shaken by German money supply upsurge: Fears of Bundesbank brake on further rate cuts - Shares recover after early sell-off The most explosive growth in German money supply since unification in 1990, reported by the Bundesbank yesterday, sparked further turmoil in world financial markets already shaken by fears of rising US inflation. M3, the Bundesbank's most important guide to monetary policy, grew at an annualised rate of 20.6 per cent in January, far exceeding the most pessimistic forecasts and the bank's own target range of 4 to 6 per cent. Although senior bank officials had given clear warnings of an inflated figure, shock at the scale of the growth and fears of a brake on German interest rate cuts prompted an international sell-off. By the close, stock markets across Europe had partially recouped substantial losses suffered after the announcement of the German data. Confidence in the outlook for European interest rates made a fragile recovery, but markets remained wary of a further tightening of credit policy by the US Federal Reserve. US stock and bond markets staged the most impressive recovery, after falling sharply in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, down more than 50 points in the morning, ended up 22.51 at 3,831.74, while the benchmark 30-year bond rallied from a big early loss to finish slightly higher, where it yielded 6.76 per cent. Earlier in the day, the 30-year yield had risen as high as 6.85 per cent. In London, the early fall in leading equities of just over 2 per cent was smaller than in continental centres. The FT-SE 100 index fell 74.9 before bouncing at the 3,195 level to close at 3,248.1, for a final loss on the day of only 22.5 points. Frankfurt's Dax index fell 2.3 per cent. Paris held its loss to 1.8 per cent, after earlier tumbling 4 per cent, while Zurich, the day's biggest loser, finished down 2.7 per cent. Rumours that several large UK funds were selling bonds meanwhile sparked fears that mainstream fund managers were joining the exodus from the market. Price falls in recent weeks have been spurred by hedge funds and banks trading on their own accounts. Mainstream fund managers have clung to the belief that the sharp sell-off is not justified by economic fundamentals, but the extent of the recent decline is now forcing some to act. 'Some fund managers are panic selling,' said one institutional investor. 'They have held on to the fundamentals for weeks, but the pain was just getting too great.' There were also signs, however, that some fund managers were buying selectively bonds which they thought had become underpriced. 'Everyone has a pain threshold,' said one head of trading at a bank in London. 'The markets are just not acting on fundamentals, and that is forcing a lot of people to re-evaluate their strategies. The problem is that they are shutting the door after the horse has bolted.' European government bonds plunged at the opening, after the overnight sell-off in US Treasuries, and slid further after the release of the German money supply data. Bonds recouped some of their losses as traders covered their short positions in futures markets. But sentiment was fragile and long-term investors remained stubbornly on the sidelines, awaiting the outcome of today's Bundesbank council meeting and Friday's US jobs data. German bonds set the pace, falling by more than 2 points in the morning, but closing only about  1/2 point weaker. Although traders reported an early offer from the Bank of England to buy cash bonds from market-makers, gilts slid in line with other markets but staged a late recovery. Foreign exchange traders said the currency market was confused with a lot of 'hot money', as investors liquidated positions to cover losses elsewhere. The trade dispute with Japan also weighed on the dollar, which fell to Y103.670 from Y104.615, but recovered to Y104.37 at the Tokyo open. The D-Mark closed higher in London against the dollar at DM1.7037 from DM1.709 on Tuesday, but eased in New York. Although German-based analysts concluded that the Bundesbank's policy of hyper-cautious interest rate cuts would continue, they expected the pace of reduction to slow because M3 would now take longer than expected to approach its target range. Some said the bank's bland, generalised explanations in its initial statement on the provisional January M3 figures also sharpened the markets' initial reactions. The Bundesbank put part of the blame for the 'distortion' on 'special factors'. Heavy inflows of capital from abroad, induced by tax changes, which had boosted the measure's monthly growth rate to 8.1 per cent in December, were still having an effect. The figure was also bloated by heavy borrowing by companies and individuals. Instead of falling as usual in January, bank lending rose DM2.1bn.

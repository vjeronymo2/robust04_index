			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Spain to make offering of Repsol shares The Spanish government is to make an international offering of Repsol shares in the last quarter of this year that could raise between Pta200bn and Pta300bn (Dollars 1.4bn to Dollars 2.2bn), Mr Oscar Fanjul, chairman of the state-controlled energy and chemicals group said yesterday. The size of the offer suggests that INH, the state's energy holding company, is considering reducing its present 41 per cent stake in Repsol to close to 20 per cent. Mr Fanjul said he expected INH to decide in the near future the extent of the offer. Last year, INH realised Pta110bn when it reduced its equity in Repsol from 54 per cent to 41 per cent through an international placing. Repsol is at present completing the acquisition by Gas Natural, its gas distribution subsidiary, of Enagas, the fully state-owned monopoly supplier of industrial gas. Gas Natural, which is 45 per cent owned by Repsol, is likely to pay about Pta80bn for Enagas's main business and will have the option to acquire a Pta300bn pipeline being built linking Spain, via Morocco, to Algeria's natural gas fields. Mr Fanjul said the acquisition would be announced shortly after final details on pricing and consumption had been resolved between Enagas and Spain's electricity utilities. The main obstacle to the acquisition had been Enagas's commitment to the 1,265km pipeline which Gas Natural was unwilling to undertake. This has been resolved by the creation of a separate public company, Sagane, which will build the pipeline. Repsol has the option to buy Sagane from INH, the company's present owner, when the pipeline becomes operational. The acquisition of Enagas completes a 10-year long diversification by Repsol into the domestic gas business. Gas Natural controls 41 per cent of natural gas sales in Spain. After the takeover, it will have close to 90 per cent. Gas Natural's contribution to Repsol's operating income rose from 9 per cent in 1989 to 25 per cent last year. Repsol increased its 1993 net profit by 11.4 per cent to Pta80.1nbn and its first-quarter net profit this year by 11.6 per cent to Pta46.4bn.</p>

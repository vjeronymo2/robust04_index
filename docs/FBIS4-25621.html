			<p>BFN     [Text] During his investigation and study in Jiamusi city,  Yue Qifeng, secretary of the provincial party committee, pointed  out: In the process of building the system of socialist market  economy, it is necessary to conscientiously study volume no.3 of  the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, further  emancipate the mind, and reexamine the provincial and city  situations with a new insight in an effort to form an economic  development strategic thinking that complies with reality to  promote a rapid economic development in the whole province.    On 10-11 June, Yue Qifeng conducted investigation and study  in Jiamusi. Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial  party committee, Wang Xianmin, member of the standing committee  of the provincial party committee and secretary general, and  responsible comrades of provincial departments concerned  accompanied him during the inspection tour. Yue Qifeng and his  entourage successively inspected Jiamusi paper mill, textile  plant, synthetic materials plant, combined harvester  manufacturing plant, Sanjiang Foodstuff Company Limited, and  other state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises; inspected  the provincial state farms general administration, model  villages in Jiamusi suburban areas, and village-run enterprises  in (Sihe) Village; and visited (Liang Fengming), a major chicken  raiser and deputy to the National People's Congress, and (Jiang  Houzhi), an enterpreneur of a private enterprise. In every  place the leading comrades traveled, they asked in detail about  the production and operation of enterprises and the living of  their workers, talked extensively with the broad masses of  workers, and discussed with them major plans for economic  development. During his inspection and study, Comrade Yue Qifeng  offered some important views.    Yue Qifeng said: Since the third plenary session of the 11th  party Central Committee, like other places in China,  Heilongjiang Province has made big progress in economic  construction. However, we must not deny that we have lagged  behind the areas with rapid economic development. It is true  that our lagging behind is caused by many objective reasons. But  more importantly, I think it is caused by subjective reasons.  For many years, we were used to practicing the unitary mode of  planned economy, ownership structure, financial sources, and  work thoughts, and had many deviations in our understanding of  the provincial and city situations. At present, to march  towards the goal of building the socialist market economic  structure, we must further emancipate the mind, change ideas,  reexamine the provincial and city situations, and establish an  economic development strategic thinking that complies with the  reality.    Yue Qifeng pointed out: Judging from the viewpoint of  building a socialist theory with Chinese characteristics or from  the actual situations of the past years, the old mechanisms left  over during the past years are actually the mechanisms leading  us to failure. This is why we must conduct reform. Reform is a  painful process of thoroughly remolding ourselves, which  includes casting aside some things we got familiar with in the  past. For example, we concentrated our main energy for a long  time on the production of raw materials which required big  investments but gave small output, required strenuous efforts  but earned small money, thus resulting in a very low economic  efficiency. At present, we must actively readjust the  industrial structure, develop precision and intensive processing  industry, strive to increase the technological content and value  of products, and raise economic efficiency. For another  example, some comrades regarded township enterprises and  individual and private economic units as an alien force of the  socialist economy and discriminated against and suppressed them  over a long period of time, thus making our province lag far  behind the economically developed areas in this aspect. From  this, we can see that we must use the socialist theory with  Chinese characteristics to emancipate and arm our thinking.  Only by so doing can we realistically broaden the reform pace  in the course of our practical work.    Yue Qifeng said: Jiamusi city is a place of economic and  strategic importance and vital communications outlet on the  Sanjiang Plain. It is an important central city. How to  accelerate its development and give full play to its radiating  role is of vital importance to the whole province's economic  construction. Therefore, Jiamusi city must proceed from its own  reality and from the demands of developing the socialist market  economy, conscientiously conduct investigation and study, and  define its main targets and development priorities. Sanjiang  Plain is China's important commodity grain base. We must exert  strenuous efforts to study ways to process and convert grains as  well as agricultural and sideline products into other products  so as to increase their value, and enable Jiamusi city to  gradually trun from an agricultural production base into a  foodstuff industrial base so that its products can be sold in  the whole country and can enter the world market. We should  regard this as an important strategic orientation and objective  and be determined to attain it. In this aspect, we should  broaden our thinking, free our hands, invite business, and  introduce capital. In addition to keeping our eyes on overseas  businessmen, we should also regard southeast coastal  economically developed areas as our cooperation partners,  combine our resources and industrial advantages with their  funds, technology and market advantages, and seek development  through cooperation.    After hearing work briefings given by leading comrades of  the  provincial state farms general administration, Yue Qifeng  pointed out: Actually, we are conducting the second development  program in the Great Northern Wilderness. Comparing with the  first development, the second development has much better  conditions. But the tasks are more arduous and the objectives  are more magnificent. It is not enough to change the Great  Northern Wilderness into a big granary of northeast China. We  should learn from, inherit, and promote the spirit of the people  in the Great Northern Wilderness, hold aloft the banner of  building an enterprise through arduous efforts, and build this  place into China's commodity grain base and foodstuffs  industrial base.</p>

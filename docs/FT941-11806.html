			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Margins improvement helps Adscene jump 50% to Pounds 1.4m An improvement in operating margins - from 15 to 19.5 per cent - helped Adscene Group, the Canterbury-based newspaper publisher, lift pre-tax profits by 50 per cent in the half-year to November 27. The shares rose 10p to 300p. The increase from Pounds 946,000 to Pounds 1.42m, was, said Mr Harry Lambert, chairmanand chief executive, 'a result of the progress in the publishing division', which in turn was a result of increases in advertising revenues. Operatingprofits for the division advanced 52 per cent to Pounds 1.27m (Pounds 836,000) on turnover up 10 per cent from Pounds 5.84m to Pounds 6.4m. Mr Lambert said that of this figure, about Pounds 6m derived from advertising revenue and the balance from copy sales. Revenues climbed 18 per cent in Kent, where all the titles are free; by 6 per cent inLincolnshire, where all but one are paid-for; but fell by 7 per cent in London,where half are paid-for and half free. Revenue from recruitment advertising rose 41 per cent across the group, and though Mr Lambert said the rise in Kent had been 80 per cent, it had been from a very low base. Revenue from retail advertising grew 18 per cent and from motor advertising 11 per cent, and these 'meant much more in revenue terms', he said. Circulations of the paid-fornewspapers had fallen in line with the decline across the industry, said Mr Lambert, though circulation revenue was higher, as some cover prices were raised. Profits for the printing division fell 20 per cent to Pounds 189,000 (Pounds 237,000) on turnover down 17 per cent to Pounds 1.06m (Pounds 1.28m). Mr Lambert said he thought the market was beginning to 'firm up' with the bottom of the cycle already reached. Group turnover was 5 per cent ahead at Pounds 7.47m (Pounds 7.11m); earnings rose to 6.15p (4.54p) per share and the interim dividend is lifted to 2.5p (1.8p).</p>

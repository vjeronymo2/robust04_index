			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Italians split over 'tainted' candidates Italy's scandal-tainted ruling parties are divided over whether to allow politicians under investigation for corruption to stand as candidates in next month's general election. The problem mostly concerns southern Italy where the long-ruling Christian Democrat and Socialist parties have a formidable network of patronage. While up to 80 per cent of the outgoing legislature is expected to retire, many southern politicians are refusing to stand down. Mr Ciriaco De Mita, the former Christian Democrat prime minister, ex-party secretary and unquestioned boss of the region south of Naples round Avellino and Irpinia, is insisting on standing in his native Irpinia for the Popular Party (PPI), the renamed Christian Democrats. This has deeply embarrassed some members of the PPI and threatens a rift with the PPI's principal electoral ally - the Pact for Italy of Mr Mario Segni, leader of the referendum movement. Others in the PPI argue that southern politics have not been subjected to the same renewal as in the north and that the verdict on candidates should be left with the voters. They maintain that individuals who have not yet been sent for trial should be allowed to be candidates. Behind this lies the cynical calculation that in the south the old bosses have the best chance of winning seats under the new first-past-the-post system. Mr De Mita has been involved in investigations ranging from alleged illicit party financing and corruption to extortion. The most serious relate to L12,000bn (Dollars 7.1bn) government disaster relief for the 1980 Irpinia earthquake. He is alleged to have threatened owners of three companies with losing their disaster relief if they refused to take on employees recommended by him. But last week 77 per cent of the PPI members in Irpinia voted for Mr De Mita to represent the constituency. Another case has involved Mr Nicola Mancino, the Christian Democrat interior minister from Avellino. He has been questioned about receiving illicit funds from the intelligence services, a charge he has denied. He is considered an asset by Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the PPI leader, and has been asked to stand again. But Mr Segni opposes scandal-tainted candidates in principle.</p>

[passage omitted] Belgian Foreign  Minister Willy Claes says that if Kengo Wa Dondo appears to be a  good manager, there is no question of interfering with the  choice of the prime minister, and still less to focus on a  question of personalities.

What interests us most -- and here we have  not moved by one millimeter from the line we have been  respecting for several years -- is that we should be faced with  a government which, first, is ready to respect human rights, and  second, has the means to conduct a monetary, budgetary, and  economic policy, independent of absolutely everyone, enabling  the economic reconstruction of the country to take place, having  as its first aim to improve the lot of the Zairean people.

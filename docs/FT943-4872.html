			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Consultation 'to be transformed' European Court judgments in June requiring UK employers to consult employee representatives on redundancies and business transfers, even where they do not recognise unions, could transform worker consultation in Britain, says a TUC legal opinion. Lord Wedderburn says companies will not be able to form committees for consultation and then dissolve them at will. Vehicles for consultation will require adequate resources and proper independence from the employer. The government is wrestling with how to implement the judgment with the least inconvenience to business. The Wedderburn analysis is included in an interim report on representation at work which was strongly supported by the congress yesterday. The report takes another significant step to TUC acceptance of Continental-style rights at work and works councils, but attempts to combine that with an important role for union organisation. The report says: 'This twin-track approach would give legal rights to individuals and unions. At the workplace level all employees would have rights to representation, rights to trigger arrangements for information and consultation and rights to be a union member.' It also spells out a staged process of union involvement from a right to represent all workers in individual grievances to full union recognition for collective bargaining. Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, introduced the interim report. He reassured those suspicious of individual rights that the proposals would not undermine union organisation. He said: 'We cannot import a model from another country whose tradition of industrial relations is different from ours. Neither can we say they have nothing to teach us.' Mr Tony Dubbins, general secretary of the GPMU print union, warned that works councils might not be appropriate in smaller companies. 'It would be a monumental own-goal if these new rights make it more difficult for unions to organise,' he said. The Confederation of British Industry was yesterday urged to reach agreement on a European 'framework agreement' with unions which would provide for a minimum of five days of vocational training each year.</p>

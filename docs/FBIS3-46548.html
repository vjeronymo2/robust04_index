			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Chae-mok based on interview with Foreign </F> Minister Han Sung-chu by Yi Yong-sik, deputy manager of the  political department of MUNWHA ILBO; place and date not given --  first three paragraphs are introductory remarks by reporter Kim]    [Text] Regarding the degree of progress made toward the  solution of the North Korean nuclear issue, Minister Han said,  "While some areas have seen positive results thanks to the time  and effort placed on it, a solution has yet to appear." The  positive results are that there has been no extreme crisis, that  dialogue is continuing, and that clues towards a solution still  remain.    Regarding the decision on policy over the North Korean  nuclear issue, Minister Han said, "The cooperative system  between the ROK and the United States is firm." He added, "The  U.S. position notified to the North in the 22 December North  Korea-U.S. working contact in New York was in fact formulated by  us."    He said, "At the present stage, the ROK and the United  States  are pushing ahead with a small package deal so that North Korea  will allow ad hoc and ordinary inspections [imsi mit tongsang  sachal] by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and  participate in inter-Korean dialogue."    [Yi Yong-sik] What are the prospects for the third round of  high-level talks between North Korea and the United States?    [Han Sung-chu] If North Korea allows the IAEA to conduct  complete ad hoc and ordinary inspections and the exchange of  special envoys between the North and the South to discuss the  nuclear issue, the third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level  talks will be held. The talks, if held, will be held not in a  week or two, but at the earliest, towards the end of January or  in early February.    [Yi] In the event that the third round of North Korea-U.S.  talks are held, what will be the main and auxiliary agenda?    [Han] The third round of talks will, first and foremost,  focus on completely dissolving suspicion on the North Korean  nuclear program. Our position is that once the precondition of  resolving the North Korean nuclear issue is met, we can discuss  the issues raised by the North side of guaranteeing security and  other political and economic issues.    [Yi] In connection with the resolving of the North Korean  nuclear issue, how can we set a political and technical deadline?    [Han] The definition of a deadline can vary depending upon  one's perception of the varying degrees to the resolution of the  nuclear issue. Since it may be several weeks before the present  stalemate connected with the crisis of the IAEA's safeguards  continuity is resolved, the deadline may be several weeks from  now. Since it may be several months before the suspicion that  emerged from the disparity between the North Korean declaration  of its nuclear-related facilities and the IAEA's investigation  results is dissipated, the deadline may be several months from  now.    [Yi] North Korea is reported to have called for a package  solution which includes the IAEA's inspection of the North  Korean nuclear sites and the improvement of North Korea-U.S.  relations. What specific demands is North Korea making in  connection with the improvement of relations?    [Han] In a statement made on 11 November last year, Vice  Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu referred to a package solution in  which the two sides would move simultaneously after determining  the points of discussion.    At the current stage, no concrete details on the method for  the package deal have been presented. However, we can easily  guess that North Korea is concerned and interested in the issue  of guaranteeing security such as the declaration on not waging a  preemptive nuclear attack on North Korea and the suspension of  the Team Spirit exercise, and political and economic issues such  as lifting the designation of North Korea as a terrorist  country, dissolving the trade embargo on North Korea, and  assisting in the construction of light water reactors.    [Yi] There are many figures in the United States who feel  the need for the early establishment of diplomatic relations  between the United States and North Korea....    [Han] It is a well known fact that such figures exist in the  United States. Another fact is that voices of the hard line  faction are rising with each passing day in the United States.  This is an indication that the more North Korea plays for time,  the less favorable it will be for North Korea.    [Yi] Do you think that diplomatic relations between North  Korea and the United States can be attained in the coming year?    [Han] The possibility exists. However, it is not very  probable. This is because other than the resolution of the  nuclear issue, there are many preconditions for the  establishment of diplomatic relations between North Korea and  the United States. Besides the resolution of the nuclear issue,  the United States has deep interest in various conditions such  as practical progress in South-North dialogue, the control of  exports of large-scale homicidal weapons like missiles, the  abandonment of terrorism, the return of remains of U.S.  soldiers, and the improvement of human rights conditions. It is  clear that the resolution of the nuclear issue will greatly  contribute to improving conditions for the establishment of  diplomatic relations between North Korea and the United States.    [Yi] What is our government's position on the establishment  of diplomatic relations between North Korea and the United  States?    [Han] Drawing a hasty conclusion on whether or when the  United States and North Korea will establish diplomatic  relations is difficult. However, we have already established  diplomatic relations with the old Soviet and normalized  diplomatic relations with mainland China. Therefore, opposing  the establishment of diplomatic relations between North Korea  and the United States even after the resolution of North Korea's  nuclear issue is shortsighted. Opposing the establishment of  diplomatic relations between North Korea and the United States  will not help South-North relations and ultimately, will not be  of help on the road to reunification.    We are fully prepared to actively assist North Korea in  becoming a responsible member of international society, once  North Korea's nuclear issue is resolved satisfactorily.    [Yi] Is our government making any special preparations  regarding the possibility of the establishment of relations  between North Korea and the United States?    [Han] Preparations are being made from various angles and  for various possibilities. However, it is inappropriate to  reveal details regarding this right now.    [Yi] What are the positions of Japan and China on the  establishment of diplomatic relations between North Korea and  the United States?    [Han] The Japanese Government views the resolution of North  Korea's nuclear issue as being important to the resumption and  settlement of currently suspended negotiations between Japan and  North Korea on diplomatic relations. Therefore, Japan is  focusing its attention on how dialogue between North Korea and  the United States is progressing.    China does not want North Korea to be isolated in  international society. Therefore, China welcomes and is  assisting North Korea in improving relations with Western  countries.    [Yi] If North Korea establishes diplomatic relations with  the United States, what impact will it have on inter-Korean  relations?    [Han] The improvement of relations between North Korea and  the United States will come about after the resolution of the  precondition on the nuclear issue. Therefore, the promotion of  North Korea-U.S. relations will naturally lead to improvement in  inter-Korean relations. It will activate inter-Korean exchange  of people and materials, which had been suspended with the  exception of indirect trade. By the time North Korea and the  United States establish diplomatic relations, inter-Korean  relations may have progressed enough to establish trade missions  in Seoul and Pyongyang. In short, progress in inter-Korean  relations and the improvement of North Korea-U.S. relations  complement one another.    [Yi] The establishment of diplomatic relations between North  Korea and the United States is likely to have substantial impact  on overall order in Northeast Asia, isn't it?    [Han] Even if North Korea improves and normalizes its  relations with the United States, it will try to restrict  opening itself up to the outside world, because it fears that  the aftermath of the establishment of diplomatic relations with  the United States may endanger the maintenance of its system.  Therefore, hardly any substantial change in order in Northeast  Asia can be expected in the short run. In the long run,  however, it will bring forth very significant change in two  aspects. First, the establishment of North Korea-U.S.  diplomatic relations will lead to the normalization of North  Korea-Japan relations, which will ultimately help North Korea  cast aside isolation to participate proudly in the international  community. Second, it will contribute to fundamental changes in  North Korean society and its overall system of values.    [Yi] What direction will diplomatic policy take in the new  year?    [Han] The five basics of a new diplomacy were established  following the inauguration of the civilian government. The five  basics are to move into the world, diversify, pluralize,  cooperate regionally, and to be futuristic. I believe that the  part on "moving into the world," was especially notable in the  past year.    In a wider sense, prohibiting the spread of large-scale  homicidal weapons including North Korea's nuclear issue, our  participation in the UN Peacekeeping Operation, and our  participation in the free trade system through the settlement of  the Uruguay Round makes it possible for us to broaden our world  view to move toward internationalization. The new year's policy  of a new diplomacy will focus on "pluralism" and "regional  cooperation." With the inauguration of the World Trade  Organization and the Green Round next year, the issues of  environment and development will be prominant and a competition  policy will be brought to the fore. Therefore, while maintaining  a secure basis, our diplomacy must extend its domain into the  fields of economy, communication, environment, and development.  In addition, multi-faceted cooperation in the Asia-Pacific  region is increasing rapidly. The Asia-Pacific Economy  Cooperation summit will be held in Indonesia in November of next  year, and sometime in July, the first Asian Regional Forum of  the whole Asia and Pacific region including Russia, China, and  Vietnam will be held in Bangkok, Thailand.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Inside Politics" column, by Danny Gittings: "McGregor </F> Defeat Shows Business Slant on China"]    [Text] The significance of veteran legislator Jimmy  McGregor's defeat in last week's Hong Kong General Chamber of  Commerce elections goes far beyond the probable end to the  political career of one of the territory's best-known  expatriates. The general committee poll is widely seen as an  indicator of whether Mr McGregor will hold his own in next  year's contest for the chamber's Legislative Council functional  constituency seat, a position he currently occupies. And the  overall message is not good for Mr McGregor, or for those who  share his views. The veteran legislator ended up at the bottom  of the committee poll, winning an embarrassingly low 543 votes.  The result is a clear sign the business community no longer  sees any role for those who try to reconcile the democratic  aspirations of most people in Hong Kong with the need for good  relations with Beijing.    It is all too easy--amid the headlines about his defeat by  pro-China forces--to overlook the fact that Mr McGregor is a  moderate. Radicals, such as independent Emily Lau Wai-hing,  regard him with suspicion, describing him as only a partial  democrat. Although the veteran legislator has been widely  associated with Governor Chris Patten's political reform  proposals, it is often forgotten that he strenuously opposes one  of their central elements: the creation of nine new functional  constituencies, embracing virtually all of Hong Kong's 2.7  million workers. Even the Governor's compromise blueprint, put  forward during last year's unsuccessful negotiations with  Beijing, to instead have nine new organisational-based seats  with an electorate of 840,000, is too much for Mr McGregor. He  is planning to propose still smaller constituencies during the  forthcoming Legislative Council debate on the electoral  legislation.    As far as he is concerned, Mr Patten's proposals are beyond  the pale, since they breach what China understands to be the  original concept of functional constituencies: small  organisational-based seats. Nor will he have any truck with  attempts to bring in more democracy than is allowed under any  reasonable interpretation of the Basic Law: he is strongly  opposed to the United Democrats attempt to push through 30  directly-elected seats for next year's polls. Yet none of this  is enough to satisfy today's business leaders who, as Mr Patten  discovered as soon as he arrived, are desperate not to do  anything that may offend Beijing.    Even Mr McGregor's support for the Governor's modest  attempts  to reform the voting system for the existing 21 functional  constituencies, and introduce a democratically-chosen election  committee, is too much for them. As far as they are concerned,  the veteran legislator has long been living on borrowed time.  His one-time supporter, former Hutchison Whampoa managing  director Simon Murray is gone, a victim of tycoon Li Ka-shing's  decision, like most of the Hong Kong business community, to  concentrate on investments in the mainland. Instead, the  attitudes of leading businessmen today are best represented by  their decision not to invite Mr Patten to Friday's luncheon with  Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office chief Lu Ping for fear it  will offend the visiting mainland official.    So the most that can be hoped for in today's climate is to  see a socially -- rather than politically--liberal businessman  take Mr McGregor's place. Fortunately one is available, in the  shape of appointed legislator Henry Tang Ying-yen. While Mr  Tang may lack Mr McGregor's instinct to push democracy as far as  reasonably possible, he has already made his mark as one of the  few local businessmen ready to maintain good relations with  trade unionists, and even support the introduction of a central  provident fund.    Mr Tang, who has long been tipped to run for the chamber's  functional constituency seat next year, should have no  difficulty winning if he chooses to stand. The Liberal Party  legislator has just been elected to the chamber's general  committee with 1,224 votes, more than twice as many as his  potential rival Mr McGregor managed to garner.    But all this does not mean the old war-horse should give up  without a fight. Although Mr McGregor now looks destined for  defeat in next year's contest, it is to be hoped he will give it  one more shot. Even if he is defeated, there should be a role  for him as an adviser to the new Democratic Party, formed by the  merger of the United Democrats and Meeting Point. He will also  remain living proof of what is all too rare in Hong Kong: that  businessmen can, and should, have a democratic face.</p>

What can one say? Yesterday afternoon, when I  came to the office to discuss a topic for "Today's Halt" column,  the editor suggested I should write about the carnage, but I was  not yet over the shock. I said no and left. What kept preying  on my mind was that the crime will be folded, rolled up like a  carpet and consigned to a dusty corner.    It is expected the peace process will resume after a short  pause. Yasir 'Arafat will return to work on the "only  alternative" and try to fully utilize the "historic opportunity"  furnished by the shameless Gaza-Jericho agreement. Yes, this is  the greatest grief and ultimate humiliation.    'Arafat said that the crime was one that should not be  forgotten. But it will be. They will say that the culprits are  not connected with the Israeli Army and probably describe them  as hysterical and mentally deranged.    'Arafat was publicly wondering about the position of the  United States, as a cosponsor of the peace process. It was  President Clinton who orchestrated the signing of the  Declaration of Principles. 'Arafat also wants to know the  reaction of European and nonaligned countries.    What if you get an answer to that, 'Arafat? What will  change? Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, secretary general of the  defunct Arab League, said that the massacre will endanger the  peace process. The French Foreign Ministry voiced outrage. The  White House also expressed mild indignation. The UK Government  did not denounce the massacre but criticized the events that  followed and expressed--is not this great, 'Arafat?--its hope  that the massacre will not impede negotiations between the Arabs  and Israel. The Spanish Foreign Ministry expressed its  "profound dismay" and called on--this is a good one too--the  concerned parties to continue peace efforts. The German Foreign  Ministry described the incident as a "bloodbath" and called  on--what else can you ask for, 'Arafat?--the various sides not  to allow the peace process to be derailed. The International  Committee of the Red Cross merely expressed alarm and called for  "respect for the rights of civilians"    So, everyone and his cousin have denounced the massacre in  strong or not-so-strong terms. They also called for talks and  the continuation of peace efforts.    Is this what you wanted, 'Arafat? Were you worried that, in  the absence of condemnation, the sacred blood of the  Palestinians would fail to change into negotiable water and dust?    What is degrading is that Western foreign ministries despise  you, 'Arafat, as much as they despise Palestinians, dead or  alive. The massacre that you yourself described as "a crime  that should not be forgotten" will, after all, be forgotten.  After all expressions of outrage have receded, after the call  to get on with our lives--read: let the massacre go  unpunished--is heeded, the process of forgetting will set in.    For more than 40 years, we and the rest of world have been  denouncing and condemning the "Zionist entity," but the  Palestinians continued getting killed and liquidated; the chorus  of condemnation may as well have been the drone of a fly.    How can you confront your people with a straight face while  Palestinian bloodshed in the Ibrahimi mosque covers you from  head to toe? And, what about earlier Palestinian blood? Have  you consigned that to your archives as well?    You, 'Arafat, more than anyone else, should see to it that  the crime is not forgotten. The least you could do is listen to  the advice of Fatah dissident, Munir Maqdah, who said: "In the  past, we called on 'Arafat to step down. But now, stepping down  is not good enough. The best thing 'Arafat can do is to commit  suicide."</p>

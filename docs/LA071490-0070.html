			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RHETORIC WATCH;  </P> <P> GERMAN BASHING  </P> <P> Was what Nicholas Ridley said about a united Germany in a recent magazine  interview really all that terrible?  </P> <P> In his own oddball fashion, Britain's minister for trade and industry was just  agreeing with many analysts that in the new order of things that will follow  the formal creation of the European Community in 1992, Germany will be the  dominant force.  </P> <P> Its currency already is the strongest in Europe. And many Europeans have  deep-seated fears about a unified Germany. No new ground broken here.  </P> <P> But Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's cabinet minister could have gotten the  idea across without likening the European Community to Adolf Hitler and  wondering whether London might be better served if the Germans started bombing  it again instead of trying to take over its economy.  </P> <P> Ridley has "unreservedly" withdrawn the remarks, with about the same effect as  trying to withdraw an artillery shell after the lanyard is pulled. And because  Thatcher's own government is divided on European unification, he may keep his  job.  </P> <P> But before she lets that happen, she needs to worry a little about Ridley's  runaway rhetoric. True, nothing Ridley said will make the new Germany less  dominant, and nothing he can say now will make the new Germans less furious.  Nothing anybody says will allow Britain to ignore the new Germany and go on  about its business. But somehow Ridley made it all a little worse; perhaps now  the British PM needs to make it a little better.  </P></p>

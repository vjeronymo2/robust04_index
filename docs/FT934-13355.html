			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / World Trade News: BAe chief fails to agree date for Taiwan jet talks MR JOHN CAHILL, chairman of British Aerospace, failed yesterday to agree on a date to restart stalled talks on a joint venture to build regional jet aircraft in Taiwan. Another effort will be made this morning just hours ahead of his scheduled departure. Meetings with government ministers and Mr Earle Hou, chairman of Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC), BAe's joint venture partner, appeared to have left a decision over the deal as far away as ever. Failure would be a blow to Mr Cahill's plans to improve BAe's performance. The regional jet business loses money and the company has not made a full-year pre-tax profit since 1990. Taiwan's government also wants the deal to go ahead as part of a policy to bring the island engineering industries into the civil aviation sector. The proposals to build BAe's RJ range of regional jets in Taiwan in return for a cash injection of at least Pounds 120m has hit opposition from Taiwanese politicians, bankers and industrialists who argue that it is uncommercial and too ambitious. Mr Needham yesterday reiterated the UK government's support for the deal but said the decision should be taken by BAe and TAC.</p>

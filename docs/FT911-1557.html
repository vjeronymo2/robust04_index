			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Panfida agrees to Pounds 17m in Guinness dispute PANFIDA, the heavily borrowed retailing company, has agreed to Pounds 17m in settlement of its legal dispute with Guinness, the drinks group, concerning the Pounds 190m price it paid for the Martins chain of newsagents in 1987. The out-of-court settlement compares with a Pounds 50m breach of warranty claim that Panfida launched nearly two years ago. Panfida said the settlement comprises Pounds 17.05m less about Pounds 1.4m worth of interest withholding tax, which it expected to be refunded in due course. Guinness said the settlement meant it had reduced the total net proceeds of the sale by some Pounds 9m to Pounds 181m. Panfida said most of the settlement monies would be invested in MRG Holdings, which owns the 800 Martins newsagents. This now forms the company's principal operating subsidiary. Mandala Investments, a private Australian financial advisory company, is being issued with Panfida warrants by way of a fee for assistance in connection with the settlement. The warrants enable Mandala to subscribe for four million ordinary shares, at any time up to the end of 1996, at 25p each. That compares with yesterday's 4p market price. Guinness said it had maintained its denial of liability but accepted the desirability of resolving the dispute. Among other items, Panfida had alleged that Guinness cut back on necessary repairs before the sale, thereby overstating the shops' estimated profit and net asset value.</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / PSBR lower than expected The government borrowed Pounds 4.6bn in February to finance public-sector spending, taking the public sector borrowing requirement for the first 11 months of the financial year 1993-94 to Pounds 34.7bn. The monthly figure was lower than the Pounds 6.7bn economists expected, because of larger-than-usual borrowing repayments by local authorities and privatisation proceeds of Pounds 0.7bn, mainly from the British Telecommunications share issue. It is unlikely the PSBR for the year will reach the Pounds 49.8bn forecast by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in the November budget. Mr Simon Briscoe, economist at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'This is good news because it points to lower-than-expected government spending. Investors in gilts should be reassured because it promises lower government borrowing and so a lower rate of issuance over the next year.' Yesterday's figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that central government borrowing was Pounds 5.1bn in February, making a total of Pounds 39.8bn for the first 11 months of 1993-94, compared with Pounds 35bn for the same period in 1992-93.</p>

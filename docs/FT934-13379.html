			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Balladur plea to airline strikers THE French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, yesterday urged striking Air France employees to return to work, as riot police moved to block protesting workers from runways at the two main airports in Paris. Making his first comments on the strike which has crippled air travel to and from Paris for the past three days, he said that the industrial action threatened serious damage to the national airline. The strike also reflects a dilemma facing the French government which wants loss-making public sector companies to be restructured but is anxious to avoid protests against large-scale job cuts and the country's rising unemployment rate. Reflecting this delicate balance, Mr Balladur emphasised that Air France's austerity plan, which envisages 4,000 job cuts by the end of next year, would be implemented with a minimum of forced redundancies. However, he described the plan as vital for the survival of the airline which lost FFr3.8bn (Pounds 440m) in the first half of this year. Mr Balladur expressed complete support for Mr Bernard Attali, the chairman of Air France, who announced the airline's restructuring plan last month. But he said he had asked Mr Bernard Boisson, the transport minister, to ensure that sacrifices demanded of Air France employees were shared equally. In addition to protesting against the job cuts, Air France ground staff are fighting reduced overtime payments. They say they are being treated more harshly than pilots and cabin staff in the plan. Mr Attali, who estimates that the strike is costing Air France about FFr70m per day, has said he is determined that the plan will be implemented without changes. Air France was again forced to cancel hundreds of flights to and from Paris yesterday. Riot police managed to clear runways at Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, but striking groundstaff then blocked many of the roads to the two airports for several hours. French television reports said that several Air France workers had been hurt in clashes with riot police. The protests are being spearheaded by two union federations, Force Ouvriere, and the left-wing Confederation Generale du Travail. The striking workers, who number several hundred at both Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports, have closed runways through sit down strikes and prevented passengers reaching the airport. A spokesman for Aeroports de Paris, the French airports authority, said it was unclear what the situation would be today. He said, however, that foreign airlines remained much less affected than Air France and continued to land yesterday at both Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Boycott threat follows Yemen poll ONE OF the most successful parties in early returns for Yemen's elections yesterday accused the two government parties of 'interfering grossly and flagrantly' to influence voters and threatened to boycott parliament if such 'abuses' continued. The statement from the Islah party, an alliance of Islamists and one of the country's biggest tribal groups, came as international observers monitoring unfied Yemen's first election praised the enthusiasm and commitment of officials and voters, but said they had witnessed 'numerous' and 'significant' irregularities. Nevertheless, the 20-strong group of observers, led by the International Republican Institute, an affiliate of the US Republican party, said problems during Tuesday's vote 'do not seem to have significantly affected' the outcome. Islah has already secured 40 seats with two thirds of the 301 electoral districts declared, making it by far the most successful non-government party. But it accused the General People's Congress (GPC) and Yemen Socialist party (YSP), which together form the present ruling coalition, of using security forces to 'terrorise' and 'threaten' its candidates. 'If these abuses continue, we will not participate in the forthcoming parliament,' said Mr Abdullah al-Akwa, a member of Islah's political office. The GPC has won 95 of the 199 early results, with the YSP winning 24. Independent candidates won 31 seats. With counting still continuing late yesterday in several far-flung districts, full results are unlikely before the weekend. Unofficial indications suggest the GPC and YSP will form a sufficient bloc in the new parliament to form a coalition government. Mr Ali Salem al-Beid, vice president and YSP secretary-general, said before the vote that 'even if either party wins the majority, the circumstances of the country require the coalition' - a sentiment aired before the poll by President Ali Abdullah Saleh. While it has been widely assumed Islah would form part of such a coalition, its attack on the two ruling parties throws considerable doubts on its desire to join the government. It also suggests that a period of fierce bargaining over an eventual cabinet will follow the final results. In their preliminary report on the elections, the international observers criticised the requirement that illiterate voters have their ballot witnessed, which they said compromised the secrecy of the vote. They also criticised the government's control of the media during the campaign and said allegations of organised registration of voters outside their appropriate districts were 'too consistent and widespread to be disregarded.' But observers were at pains to point out the ballots had been a considerable experiment. A separate report by the British Electoral Reform Society said electors 'with only a few exceptions were able to express their choice of parliamentary representatives freely and without duress.' The report adds that 'despite individual flaws, we believe that this election was a success'.</p>

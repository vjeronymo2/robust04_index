			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Enhanced prospects by the riverbank: Andrew Adonis on the LSE's plan for a new home The London School of Economics' bid to move to County Hall, the now-defunct Greater London Council's palatial home which faces the Houses of Parliament across the Thames, is likely to move a significant step closer to fruition today. If, as expected, the High Court rejects an attempt by Lambeth council, the Labour-controlled planning authority, to quash a planning consent for the site granted by the government, the way will be open for Lambeth to consider the LSE's plans on their merits. And those, most observers agree, are considerable. The LSE scheme, masterminded by its ebullient director, Mr John Ashworth, represents perhaps the boldest university venture of the last decade. If it succeeds, it will not merely double the existing capacity of the LSE: it will give The School - as its inmates term it - a prime national site from which to project itself as Europe's pre-eminent social science university. Some fairly complex manoeuvring remains before The School can decamp from its present cramped and tatty premises in Houghton Street, off Aldwych. Since the abolition of the Inner London Education Authority, County Hall's last tenant, in 1990, the site has lain with the London Residuary Body, to dispose of to the financial benefit of the Greater London boroughs. To maximise that benefit, the LRB continues to look favourably on another scheme which - the High Court permitting - already has planning consent. Under it, the grade II* listed Riverside Building would be converted into a hotel, residential and conference complex, with the rest of the site redeveloped for office and retail use. Problem: no developer, since a Japanese-led consortium collapsed in 1990. Under the LSE's plans, the Riverside Building would accommodate the core of the LSE. Of the other three blocks on the site, one would house the British Library of Political and Economic Science, while the other two would be designated a 'social science park'. The idea is to surround The School with organisations growing and benefiting from its research activities, particularly in political, economic and social research and forecasting. In addition to renting offices to professional firms such as stockbrokers, accountants and market researchers, Mr Ashworth speculates about prospects for consulting and spin-off companies. He cites existing activities like the School's Decision Analysis and Business History units. The concept has been pioneered in the purely scientific disciplines, such as Cambridge Science Park: it would be novel for the social sciences. The LSE's planning application is to be considered by Lambeth in a month's time. If it goes through, a formal approach to the LRB will follow. Mr Ashworth is offering well below the commercial price for the site. For him to be able to move at all, some government financial help will almost certainly be needed as part of a swap arrangement for Houghton Street. But for the LRB, the LSE is at least a buyer; and anyway, the LRB ceases to exist later this year, when (bizarrely) County Hall looks set to revert to Bromley council to dispose of, if unsold. By then elections to the House across the river will have taken place. But even if Mr Neil Kinnock is the new landlord, Labour has been careful to dismiss ideas of a bloated London bureaucracy. Ms Margaret Hodge, Labour leader of the Association of London Authorities, talks of a new Greater London Authority with a hundred or so officials. They could be better accommodated in smaller premises, perhaps using County Hall's imposing council chamber. 'If we secure County Hall, our ability to expand and become Europe's leading social science institution will be immeasurably enhanced,' says Mr Ashworth. 'That ought to appeal to politicians, businessmen and all sections of the London community.' His plans for the LSE's future are not without their critics. Some in The School resent the emphasis he places on postgraduate studies, to which he intends the bulk of extra resources to be devoted. Furthermore, more than 40 per cent of the students, mainly at postgraduate level, already come from outside the European Community (LSE: Let's See Europe, goes the gag), and that's enough, they say. But most at the LSE recognise that County Hall has one of the greatest opportunities in its history. As for its prospective near-neighbours, at least one - the Archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth Palace - is full of enthusiasm. Perhaps at The School's centenary 1995 a neigbourly Te Deum would be in order.</p>

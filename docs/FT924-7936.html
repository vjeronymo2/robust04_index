			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Rental strength lifts Warner Howard 9% THE APPEAL of renting rather than buying commercial equipment in a recession helped half-year results to August 31 at Warner Howard, the UK's leading supplier of commercial laundry equipment and warm air hand-dryers. Warner, which earns most of its revenue from life-of-equipment rental agreements, reported a 9 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Pounds 3.01m (Pounds 2.78m), even though turnover rose only Pounds 130,000 to Pounds 11.2m. Operating profit was Pounds 3.03m compared with Pounds 2.8m. Earnings per share increased to 8.59p (8p), and a 10 per cent higher interim dividend of 2.12p (1.925p) is declared. Mr Ernie Hazell, managing director, said Warner's higher pre-tax profit was pleasing given that revenue was flat overall. It was a reflection of the success of the group's rental business as well as cost cutting. He said development of a rental culture and nationwide operations at its Euroelectrics subsidiary - which was a sales-driven business confined to the London area when bought by Warner two years ago - was more than compensating for poor equipment sales. Increasing rentals at Derek Wright (Food Machinery), a beverage machines supplier, was proving harder to achieve, but sales were firm. Hazell said Warner's rental business 'acts as a buffer against the recession'. In hard times, there was a dearth of alternative financing facilities as businesses' capital spending dried up, and financing com-panies were reluctant to service small purchases for customers with lower credit ratings. Rental agreements therefore became increasingly attractive. Mr Hazell said Warner's catering, laundry and hand-drier business was exposed to the leisure and construction industries, and the group would depend on a turnround in these sectors for its performance to improve sharply.</p>

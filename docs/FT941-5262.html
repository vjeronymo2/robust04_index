			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Mexican frontrunner strives to make mark Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary party, has begun the difficult task of distancing himself from the present incumbent, President Carlos Salinas. Mr Colosio, who was selected last November by Mr Salinas to be the party's candidate in August's election, chose to dwell on his differences with current administration policy on the 65th anniversary of the PRI's hold on power on Sunday. 'The only continuity that I offer is change,' claimed Mr Colosio, who has previously been so closely identified with the current president that he is known as 'Mr Salinas with hair'. For the first time Mr Colosio seemed to criticise the president. 'We know that the origin of many of our ills lies in an excessive concentration of power, a concentration that leads to wrong decisions, the monopoly of initiatives, abuses and excesses,' he said. 'The reform of government will require a president who is subject - strictly - to the limits of our republican and democratic constitution.' PRI presidential candidates traditionally move away from the incumbent as the election draws closer. Even more than his predecessors, Mr Colosio is under pressure to draw up his own platform, partly because of a general perception that he is a weak candidate. Mr Colosio's campaign has suffered from the peasant uprising in the state of Chiapas, and from the prominent role played by Mr Manuel Camacho in peace negotiations between the rebels and government. Mr Camacho, who had been Mr Colosio's rival for the presidential nomination, may still launch himself as a candidate of one of the opposition parties. While this is unlikely, he may decide to run if support for Mr Colosio declines. A Mori poll gives Mr Colosio 37 per cent public support.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The situation in the free territories of Tesanj,  Maglaj, Doboj, and Teslic is extremely serious. In fact, it is  dramatic. Decisive battles are being waged. The enemy is  pounding civilians and residential areas with unprecedented  savagery. The 133-km long defense line of the Seven South  Operative Group is in flames. The Serb aggressor has engaged  almost 50 percent of their military might in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  including heavy artillery withdrawn from the Sarajevo  battlefield. This all-out attack, which the army of occupation  calls Borders '94, is coordinated personally by war criminals  generals Mladic and Talic. The aim is to establish the southern  border of the phantom Serb state in the area of the Vranduk  tunnel. The free territories of Tesanj, Maglaj, Doboj, and  Teslic are -- believe it or not -- being hit by more than 200  heavy shells every hour. These barbaric attacks aiming at  systematic destruction of civilians and their homes have outdone  everything seen so far on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    As I am reporting, tank and howitzer shells are raining down  onto the town of Tesanj, as was the case throughout last night.  However, the situation is the most serious in Maglaj where most  civilians are dying. Specifically, the army of occupation is  doing its best to capture Maglaj and drive out its remaining  surviving residents. We are reminding the international  community once again, for the umpteenth time, that Maglaj and  Tesanj have been encircled by the aggressor and completely  sealed off for nine months. This is the only area in  Bosnia-Herzegovina where the aggressor is stopping all convoys  with food and other goods for civilians.    However, our soldiers have not given in. In hand to hand  fighting, the joint units of the Seven South Operative Group and  the 2d Corps of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army have halted the  aggressor, and everyone is determined to die rather than allow  the army of occupation to enter Tesanj and Maglaj. All defense  lines are unchanged, and the aggressor is suffering heavy, truly  heavy, losses in manpower. Our soldiers keep on fighting.  Hajrudin Rezovic reported from the information center of the  Seven South Operative Group.</p>

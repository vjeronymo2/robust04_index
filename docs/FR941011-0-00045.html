			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA promulgated regulations that, in broad outline, required affected States to: (1) Coordinate development of SIPs with appropriate Federal land managers (FLMs); (2) develop a program to assess and remedy visibility impairment from new and existing sources; and (3) develop a long-term strategy to assure reasonable progress toward the National visibility goal. 45 FR 80084 (December 2, 1980) (codified at 40 CFR 51.300&hyph;51.307). The regulations provided for the remedying of visibility impairment that is reasonably attributable to a single existing stationary facility or small group of existing stationary facilities. These regulations required that the SIPs provide for periodic review and revisions, as appropriate, of the long-term strategy not less frequently than every three years, that the review process include consultation with the appropriate FLMs and that the State report to the public and EPA a specified assessment of its progress toward the National goal. See 40 CFR 51.306(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 12, 1985 (50 FR 28544) and November 24, 1987 (52 FR 45132), EPA disapproved SIPs of states that failed to comply with the requirements of, among others, the provisions of 40 CFR 51.302 (visibility general plan requirements), 51.305 (visibility monitoring), and 51.306 (visibility long-term strategy). EPA also incorporated corresponding Federal plans and regulations into the SIPs of these states pursuant to section 110(c)(1) of the Act. The Governor of Colorado submitted a SIP revision for visibility protection on December 21, 1987, which met the criteria of 40 CFR 51.302, 51.305, and 51.306 and consisted of five major sections: existing impairment, new source review, consultation with FLMs, monitoring strategy, and the long-term strategy. EPA approved this SIP revision in an August 12, 1988  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice (53 FR 30428), and these revisions replaced the Federal plans and regulations in the Colorado Visibility SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 13, 1994, EPA announced its proposed approval of revisions to the long-term strategy of Colorado's Class I Visibility SIP and revisions concerning the long-term strategy in the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission's (AQCC) Regulation No. 3 (59 FR 25002&hyph;25004). In that proposed rulemaking action, EPA described in detail its rationale for proposing approval, considering the specific factual issues presented. Rather than repeating that entire discussion in this notice, it is incorporated by reference here. Thus, the public should review the notice of proposed rulemaking for relevant background on this final rulemaking action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requested public comments on all aspects of the proposal (please reference 59 FR 25004). Comments were received and are discussed below. This final action on the revisions to the long-term strategy of Colorado's Class I Visibility SIP and revisions concerning the long-term strategy in Colorado AQCC's Regulation No. 3 is unchanged from the May 13, 1994 proposed approval action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Response to Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter responded to EPA's request for comments on its proposed rulemaking. These comments were received on June 17, 1994, in a letter dated June 12, 1994. Although the comment period ended on June 13, 1994, EPA is endeavoring to respond to these comments in an effort to facilitate the public's understanding of this action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 14, 1993, the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) certified to the State of Colorado the existence of visibility impairment at the Mount Zirkel Wilderness Area, a mandatory Class I Federal area located in Colorado. (See July 14, 1993 letter from Elizabeth Estill, USFS, to Governor Roy Romer, which is included in the docket for this action.) The comments in response to EPA's proposed approval of Colorado's review and revision of its Long-Term Strategy address concerns that Colorado has not appropriately responded to the USFS's certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> More specifically, the commenter asserts that EPA's proposed approval of the long-term strategy revision adopted by Colorado on November 18, 1992 is problematic because:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> [I]t ignores numerous deficiencies in the State's efforts to implement the visibility protection program since that time. In particular, Colorado has failed to respond in a timely or effective manner to the certification of visibility impairment in the Mount Zirkel Wilderness Area that was filed by the U.S. Forest Service on July 13, 1993.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

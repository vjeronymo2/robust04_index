			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP WRAPUP;  </P> <P> IN 3RD YEAR, HAWTHORNE MAKES ITS PRESENCE FELT IN GIRLS' SOCCER  </P> <P> When Hawthorne High School started a girls' soccer program two years ago, Coach  Jim Stone admittedly didn't know what to expect.  </P> <P> "I wasn't real excited at first," said Stone, who had been a successful coach  in Hawthorne's American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO). "I was used to  drafting my own teams and knowing I had talent. I wasn't sure I would enjoy  coaching a team that might have a hard time winning."  </P> <P> Fortunately for Stone, that's never been a problem.  </P> <P> With the 25-year-old coach at the helm, Hawthorne has never come close to  suffering a losing season. In fact, with a three-year record of 47-9-8, the  Cougars boast one of the South Bay's winningest programs, breaking into the  upper echelon of girls' soccer that had previously been occupied by Torrance  and Peninsula schools.  </P> <P> This year's team, led by several players who were starters on Hawthorne's  initial varsity squad in the 1986-87 season, owns the best record (13-1-3) in  the South Bay and the area's highest ranking (sixth) in the Southern Section  4-A coaches' poll.  </P> <P> The secret to Hawthorne's rapid rise to success?  </P> <P> Stone explains that the Cougars, although lacking the polished skills of  players from cities with prestigious club programs, are winning because of a  dedicated work ethic and a closeness rarely found on high school teams.  </P> <P> "We call ourselves 'The Family,' " he said. "What's made us such a good team is  that we spend so much time together. We practice over holidays and we try to do  everything as a team. We don't allow anyone to stretch on their own or run on  their own. We'll wait at practice until everybody gets there."  </P> <P> The team concept has paid off for the Cougars. They moved into undisputed first  place in the Bay League on Friday with a 3-0 win over visiting Rolling Hills,  improving to 3-1, a half-game ahead of idle Torrance (2-1).  </P> <P> Hawthorne has outscored opponents, 50-11, with nine shutouts. The Cougars' only  loss came in their league opener at Palos Verdes, a game Stone says will be  foremost on their minds when they play host to the Sea Kings on Jan. 27.  </P> <P> "Our first goal is to win our league," he said.  </P> <P> That goal escaped the Cougars each of the past two seasons, as they took second  behind Mira Costa in the Ocean League.  </P> <P> But this year they are the front-runners, led by a nucleus of players who have  been varsity starters since they were either freshmen or sophomores. The group  includes:  </P> <P> Senior forward Jennifer Stone. The coach's sister, she has already set a school  record with 20 goals this season. Her powerful and accurate shots have prompted  other teams to call her "The Cannon."  </P> <P> Senior forward Erica Henderson. Team co-most valuable player last year, she's  an all-around performer who fits the Cougars' blue-collar style. "She has more  determination than any player out there," Stone said.  </P> <P> Junior defender Jaymie Bradford. Team captain since her freshman year, she  anchors Hawthorne's vaunted defense. A talented athlete, she was named All-CIF  in soccer and softball last year.  </P> <P> Senior midfielder Amy Rubin. Counted on to distribute the ball to the team's  scorers, she has frustrated many players with her fierce, hard-nosed marking.  "She won't allow the team to lose," Stone said.  </P> <P> Senior defender Anna Rubin. Amy's twin sister, she usually draws the opposing  team's leading scorer. She was named co-most valuable player of the South  Torrance Holiday Tournament.  </P> <P> Stone said the team is determined to get past the first round of the CIF  playoffs. Hawthorne suffered first-round losses on the road each of the last  two years.  </P> <P> "The girls don't want to settle for just one win the playoffs," he said. "Our  goal is to play (top-ranked) Mission Viejo. We might get killed, but we want  the opportunity to play them."  </P> <P> Rolling Hills' 89-88 overtime win over Inglewood on Wednesday night was another  example of the Titans' uncanny knack for pulling out close games in the four  years Cliff Warren has been basketball coach.  </P> <P> They've become so commonplace, they're known as Cliff-hangers.  </P> <P> "I've always been lucky in life," said Warren, who owns an 81-20 overall mark  and a 30-1 home record at Rolling Hills. "I really have been fortunate, but it  helps when you have good players.  </P> <P> "Teams get in a habit of winning, or winning close games. Everytime you win  one, the percentage of winning the next one gets better. It doesn't get worse.  And I've been fortunate in always having a guy you can go to when the chips are  down."  </P> <P> Actually, Rolling Hills had two players who excelled in the clutch against  Inglewood. Senior center John Hardy and junior guard Steve Clover combined for  28 of the Titans' 30 points in the fourth quarter and overtime period.  </P> <P> Rolling Hills (13-3 overall, 4-0 in league play) remained tied for first place  in the Bay League with an 84-66 win over visiting Hawthorne on Friday night.  The Titans are tied with surprising Torrance (9-5, 4-0), which rallied from an  11-point halftime deficit on the road to beat Inglewood, 85-75, behind 45  points from junior guard Rick Robison.  </P> <P> Torrance will visit Rolling Hills at 7:30 Thursday night.  </P> <P> The purpose of jersey numbers is to identify the players, but one number has  become more significant to Neisha Williams.  </P> <P> The senior guard wears No. 22 for Hawthorne's girls basketball team. This isn't  particularly unusual, until you consider that Williams is averaging 22 points a  game and, at one point during non-league play, she scored 22 points in four of  five consecutive games.  </P> <P> "I think I'll change her number to 33," quipped Hawthorne Coach John Wheeler.  </P> <P> Williams went over her average this week, scoring 30 points in a 64-32 win over  Santa Monica and 42 in a 76-43 victory over Rolling Hills to help the Cougars  improve to 8-7 overall and 3-1 in the Bay League, one game behind unbeaten  Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> Center Heidi Burge of Palos Verdes set a school record with 43 points Friday in  a 94-36 win over Leuzinger. The 6-4 senior also pulled down 23 rebounds and  blocked 9 shots.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes, ranked No. 1 in the Southern Section 4-A Division, improved to  12-3 overall and 4-0 in league play.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes' soccer team extended its record to 19-0 Friday with a 1-0 shutout  over host Leuzinger in a battle for first place in the Bay League.  </P> <P> Paul Kaemmerer's second-half goal provided the winning margin as the Sea Kings  recorded their 16th shutout of the year, the 15th for goaltender Mark  Antrobius.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes improved to 4-0 in league play, while Leuzinger fell to 2-1.  </P></p>

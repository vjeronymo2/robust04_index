			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / A crisis of leadership: Roger Matthews analyses the difficulties Middle Eastern governments face in attaining peace and prosperity Peace, if it comes fully, and lower oil revenues, if they persist, could pose as big a political challenge to Middle East governments over the next few years as wars and sudden wealth have done during the previous 40. The reaction of the regimes most critically affected by these developments will influence not just the well-being of the peoples in the region, but also the continued security of western oil supplies. War, or the threat of it, has long been used to justify and legitimise authoritarian governments throughout the region. The paternalistic dispensation of vast oil revenues serves a similar function. So long as there was a dangerous enemy without, and expensive oil below, the popular demand for change was likely to remain muted. Neither revenues nor threats of war can now be guaranteed. The enemy, in the shape of Israel, cannot be realistically challenged on the battlefield. Oil, though still plentiful, is not worth what it was, and revenues are no longer sufficient to ensure a pliant population. Peace, in so far as it has been achieved, has been between leaderships motivated primarily by the desire to retain power, and has created little of the warmth between peoples that would make the agreements more durable. The Israeli-Egypt agreement signed in 1979 has done almost nothing to stimulate exchanges, economic or cultural, between the two countries. In part this reflects Egyptian resentment at Israel's continued occupation of Arab territory and its perceived arrogance towards those living under its control. The outline accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the subsequent treaty with Jordan have also failed to ignite popular enthusiasm, for very similar reasons. As a result, Mr Yassir Arafat's leadership of the PLO is under mounting assault for its failure to deliver tangible material improvements for the vast majority of impoverished Palestinians, and for his refusal to consult and delegate more widely. But Mr Arafat is simultaneously at the mercy of an Israeli government, which under Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, is obsessed by short-term security considerations. To this end, Mr Rabin has made Israeli military withdrawal from the West Bank conditional on the degree to which Mr Arafat can halt attacks on Israelis by Hamas and other extremist Islamic groups. Small wonder then that Mr Arafat's opponents, and particularly Hamas, accuse him of acting as a surrogate for the Israeli army. The Hamas accusation appeared to be given greater credence last month when 13 protesting Palestinians were shot and killed by Mr Arafat's police. There is nothing novel about Palestinians fighting among themselves in the diaspora, but the threat of wider armed conflict erupting in the newly-liberated territories is a serious setback to national aspirations. For decades, Palestinians had boasted that when their new state was born it would be modern, democratic and efficient - a reflection of their individual commitment to educational achievement and to their managerial expertise demonstrated throughout the Arab world, and especially in the Gulf. Palestine, they claimed, would not be like other Arab states. So far little has been seen to support that assertion. The most articulate voices of people such as Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman during earlier rounds of negotiations with Israel, and Mr Haidar Abdel Shafi, arguably the most respected leader in Gaza, have been largely stilled. The younger generation of internationally-trained Palestinians has scarcely been encouraged to participate. Instead Mr Arafat prefers to rely on the same, narrow coterie of men who are without popular appeal, but offer no serious challenge to him. Elections to local and national self-rule authorities might just inject some new blood into the senior ranks of the leadership. But polls have been seriously delayed, and remain tied to Mr Rabin's assessment of whether Israeli security can be guaranteed after a military withdrawal. But the longer the delay continues, the more Palestinian resentment will grow at the failures of the peace accord, and the greater will be the chances of elections producing a significant protest vote that will please neither Mr Rabin nor Mr Arafat. This crisis in leadership is repeated in different forms throughout the Middle East. The most extreme example is Algeria, where the inability of the post-independence regime to answer the basic needs of its population provoked a panic rush for legitimacy through the ballot box, and an equally abrupt retreat in early 1992 when the Islamic opposition seemed certain to win. As a result the country has plunged into near civil war, with an estimated 700 people dying every week. Both sides are employing the most brutal methods in their battle for ascendancy. Helplessly squeezed between the two extremes are the vast majority of Algerians who wish for nothing more than responsive, caring government. Their plight is that of so many Middle Easterners, whose governments have looked at the ill-managed flirtation with democracy in Algeria and concluded that they will have no truck with such dangerous adventures. Instinctively hostile to democracy, they have encouraged belief in the myth of a co-ordinated, international campaign by the political wing of Islam to overthrow established, western-oriented governments. It is a convenient argument, sometimes supported by Iranian government actions, but ignores the fact that Islamic forces have fared best where governments have done worst. Egypt, historically the most stable of Arab nations, appears to have at least temporarily blunted Islamic violence, but its efforts to reduce the poverty in which extremism breeds remain modest. The government has no mass political movement to support it, and the majority of people feel incapable of influencing its actions. So when challenged, its response tends to be one-dimensional, based primarily on police and military action that carries with it the risk of further alienating parts of the population. Neither has 15 years of peace with Israel and more than Dollars 2bn a year in annual aid brought significant economic gains to more than a few Egyptians. Greater fiscal stability has been achieved, but the vast and inefficient public sector still dominates the economy and the privatisation programme is moving ahead at a snail's pace. A broader peace with Israel involving more Arab neighbours may bring wider economic benefits, but the Egyptian example is far from compelling. If peace is to be extended, it will require a deal with the Syrian regime, which is more authoritarian than Egypt, has dealt more emphatically with its Islamic opponents, imposes an even greater state domination of the economy, and is the controlling influence over events in Lebanon. President Hafez al-Assad may be moving into the twilight of his career but he is no less determined to win back the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in 1967, and appears unlikely to make any political or significant economic reforms that would undermine his ability to dictate the succession. Mr Assad appears to have convinced President Bill Clinton that he has made a strategic choice for peace, but it will only be on terms that satisfy his domestic requirements. Yet just as such a peace would eventually erode the justification for authoritarian government in Syria, so lower oil revenues will slowly nibble away at the political fabric of regimes in the Gulf. The governments of the six members of the Gulf Co-operation Council, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain, are all faced by the same budget deficit problem. Either they have to slash spending, or find extra sources of income. Saudi Arabia this year has sought to cut official expenditure by 20 per cent, but even if it has been successful the budget deficit is still likely to be close to 10 per cent of gross national product. There is still plenty of fat to trim, but not without causing pain to a population that has grown accustomed to a lifestyle largely funded by government. Getting less from government is, however, one thing. Contributing to government, through the payment of taxes, is something else. Time and again Saudi officials have warned privately that the introduction of such measures is not compatible with social harmony, meaning that the ruling House of Saud continues to set its face against significant change. Such unwillingness to adapt mattered less while Saudi Arabia was cushioned by substantial financial reserves. But these were massively eroded by the Dollars 55bn cost of financing the Gulf war, and the kingdom is now being asked, albeit far more modestly, to contribute to the latest US deployment in October, when Iraq again appeared to be threatening Kuwait. Should further allied deployments be necessary, or another crisis flare in the Gulf, Saudi Arabia would be left with little room for financial manoeuvre. The kingdom might be more relaxed about the future if it were not for the continuing uncertainty about the intentions of Iran and Iraq, its two largest and still potentially hostile neighbours. Iran's religious leaders appear to be maintaining their grip on power, but the heavy burden of external debt and more general mismanagement of the economy is forcing up both inflation and unemployment. Further outbreaks of social unrest appear likely and, while the reaction of the regime domestically is predictable, there is much less certainty about how it might seek to divert attention through its activities on the international stage. No person has played the diversionary card more persistently that President Saddam Hussein, and no people has suffered from it more devastingly than those of Iraq. How, or when, they might emerge from the tyranny is as unpredictable as the behaviour of the Baghdad leadership, but the US appears determined not to accept any significant easing of sanctions while Mr Hussein remains in power. The US policy of 'dual containment' may limit the threat that Iraq and Iran can mount in the short term against their neighbours. But the longer-term effects on the political attitudes of a combined population of 80m people, fed on a constant diet of anti-American propaganda, should give pause for thought in Washington. What is missing most obviously in the Middle East is a role model. Some western fingers point approvingly at Morocco and Tunisia as two countries that have instigated market-oriented reforms and might be willing to contemplate a more liberal political system sometime in the future. Lebanon is trying to rebuild, but its prospects remain hostage to events outside its borders. Jordan also might grow quickly if peace deepens and Iraq. But for all the glimmers of hope, there is also Libya, where Col Muammar Gaddafi still holds sway, Yemen recently battered by civil war, and Sudan torn between civil strife and the grip of an Islamic regime. The collapse of the Soviet Union has helped to accelerate the decline of such regimes, and the collapse of any semblance of Arab unity has underlined their international isolation. Peace between Israel and Arab governments might just provide the catalyst for positive realignments if it moved more swiftly, was approached in a more generous spirit, and developed a momentum that delivered early economic gains. Many businessmen attending the recent Casablanca conference on the economic benefits of peace were encouraged by the contacts they had made and impressed by the ease with which barriers came down. Such flexibility has yet to translate itself to the political negotiating table. It may be, of course, that there is no majority in Israel for a peace that would return virtually all occupied Arab land and see the removal of most of the Jewish settlements. If it is too late politically for Israel, then it may also be too late for many Arab leaders to accept anything less, and survive. Mr Arafat could well be the touchstone. He and Mr Rabin must be well aware that if they fail to carry the day, the centre crumbles, and the challenge of peace will never have been fully joined. That, for the most myopic and the most extreme, will be a relief. Roger Matthews concludes his term as the FT's Middle East editor this month.

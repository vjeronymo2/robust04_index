			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Gardening: Rod to break a grower's back - In the first of an occasional series, Teresa McLean tames an urban jungle against the bureaucratic odds / Me and my Allotment IN APRIL 1991 the town council gave us an allotment. It had taken me years to resign myself to the fact that we only have a tiny back garden, facing north, at once rampant and barren, a non-event for vegetables. When the sun shone, I longed to treat everyone to my mother's summer classic for supper, adelight of my childhood: peas, beans and bacon. Only home-grown peas and beans could make the real thing. Overcoming my subconscious feeling that allotments should belong to those who live in the north of England, or beside railway lines, I wrote to the council and asked for one. They placed us on a waiting list. Then, in spring 1991, the council's amenities and recreation department sent us some documents of a splendidly historical flavour, granting us the yearly tenancy of a plot 'five rods big or thereabouts', at a rent of Pounds 1 per rod per year. I have always had a soft spot for rods. They were next to poles and perches on the back page of my arithmetic text book at school, waiting to be learnt. Or identified. (1 rod = 16 sq ft.) These days it is five rods of land waiting to be cultivated, an old, rich measurement of old, clay soil choked with weeds. We paid our rent and set to work, with the help of the council's site map, swallowing at the third of a mile or so between us and our plot. Most of the other allotment holders on this patch are from the council houses overlooking it. On hot days all they have to do is go home for a drink. We drink before we go. It was after our second summer of persecuting slugs and tearing out bindweed, the scourge of cultivation, that I went to the allotment one evening to pick some spinach and found a note flapping on a stick. It was from the amenities and recreation department, ominously renamed leisure services. A man called Mr Fish, technical officer of leisure services, was going to reclaim our plot, 17A, because we were cultivating land that belonged to some-one else. I sent Mr Fish copies of the documents assigning 17A to us. He rang and said he was sorry; he had got the wrong plot. Early this summer, to make a change, Mr Fish said he was going to reclaim 17A because we had not been cultivating it. We have only recently found out about the National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners, which offers its members everything from cheap seeds to help in disputes with local authorities. At that stage we were on our own, unsupported and up against it, and we decided the soil must fight its own battles. I took a carrier bag full of peas, runner and broad beans, carrots, lettuces and immense radishes to the council's leisure offices, to show those within how hard we had been cultivating. I could not bring myself to cut and bring the globe artichokes, pride of our plot, before they were ready. They were meant for a higher fate. In all the endless entrails of the allotment civil service, even in the ranks of 'inspectors' out in the field, reporting back to base on the state of the plots, I am pretty sure no-one had recognised our globe artichokes for the noble vegetables they are. To the ignorant inspector, they might look like unusual bushes, covering their delicious globes with their great leaves. As Mr Fish was out when I stormed into leisure offices, hell-bent and muddy, I spread out our humbler vegetables in front of a minion, who looked nervous. I made him write down their names and numbers, then took them home. Mr Fish soon wrote to say that we could keep our plot, provided it is always weed-free. Fair enough. Although productive, ours did have a few weeds, which we removed. Apparently, the council fears that it may have to sell some allotment sites to make money and perfect plots are the best argument against that. No more intrepid weapon grows within them than the potato. The ones we planted to break up the ground have done their stuff with a vengeance and, in so doing, have given us a super-abundance of spuds. Instead of turning up at dinner parties with unwanted bottles of wine, we turn up with bags of unwanted potatoes. 17B, the other end of strip no 17, belongs to a friendly man with a pony-tail. His strenuous exertions to turn his wilderness into a vegetable patch have unearthed a few antique potatoes, presumably left from his predecessor's efforts. We urged him to leave those and take ours instead, before one of the inspectors mistakes our chopped-off potato stalks for weeds. So far he does not seem to have done so. Privacy is a basic principle of allotments and I have never seen anyone spilling over from their own plot - least of all the one next door, which is sacrosanct. Mr 17B happily receives our potatoes but does not like to help himself. He takes naturally to allotment life. I do not. I cannot resist picking up fallen fruit and vegetables round about us, rather than leaving them to rot. A sure sign of an alien. Also, Mr 17B's opening act, when given his plot, was to build a compost holder above ground level so that air can pass through it, changing dead plant life into steaming muck for the future. All we have is a rusty cupboard containing a few bits of mesh and bamboo poles. At least it is not our fault; it was there when we arrived. On the 18 side of us there is a shaggy man and on the 16 side a womens' commune, both with the intermittent approach to gardening, keeping it close to nature and free of constructions. Inspectors evidently keep their distance. The lady at no 15 is of a different order. She has the whole strip, all 10 rods, and every last bit of it is full of cabbages. A panoply of cabbage colour from purple, through blue-grey and dark green to young, bright green. Six hours a day, she told us, she spends on it in the summer. Her plot furnishings are well-kept, stocked and used. She makes her own sprays to keep aphids and lip-licking slugs at bay. I lean on my spade and watch her at work sometimes, thinking to myself that I will have become an allotment holder proper, not just a hit-and-run agent, when she does not offer me one of her cabbages. Then I will not be able to accept it.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Major seeks to talk up economic prospects Mr John Major last night sought to talk up the prospects for sustained economic recovery and pledged to hold down inflation, Philip Stephens in New York writes. The prime minister told executives at the British American Chambers of Commerce in New York that the government had set in place 'solid foundations for sustained growth throughout the 90s'. Manufacturing productivity was rising by more than 5 per cent a year, labour costs had fallen and the employment market was strengthening, he said. Britain was again expecting the fastest growth rate among the main European countries this year. Mr Major said there had been a fundamental change in working practices which had given Britain its lowest underlying inflation rate for a generation. 'The inflation psychology is, at last, in retreat. And I intend to keep it that way.' Emphasising that education remained at the top of his domestic political agenda, the prime minister said that long-term competitiveness would depend 'above all on the quality, the ability, the skills of our workforce'. Borrowing some of the recent political rhetoric of the Labour party, he said: 'What we are working for is nothing less than the re-skilling of Britain for the 21st century.' In a sideswipe against Japan, he said that Britain and the US should work together to open up Japan's markets to European and US competition.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For these reasons, proposed paragraph (b)(3) would also be revised to require that when continuous face haulage systems are used, permanent stoppings or other permanent ventilation control devices must be built and maintained to separate the haulage entry in which the low profile belt structure is located from intake entries only to the outby travel point of the dolly. The proposal would also provide that for continuous haulage systems, temporary ventilation controls may be used in rooms that are 600 feet or less from the centerline of the entry from which the rooms were developed. In all other cases permanent stoppings or other permanent ventilation control devices would continue to be required to separate belt conveyor haulageways from intake air courses when air in the intake air course is used to provide air to active working places.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (b)(4) would continue to require permanent stoppings or other permanent ventilation control devices ``*&blank;*&blank;* to separate the primary escapeway from belt and trolley haulage entries, as required by &sect;75.380(g).'' In addition, the proposal would require that when continuous face haulage systems are used, the loading point for purposes of &sect;75.380(g) would be the inby most point of travel of the dolly. The Agency intends that this separation be maintained to the most inby point of travel of the dolly in order to provide protection along the entire length of the conveyor belt entry. A greater or lesser distance for the separation of the conveyor belt structure from the primary escapeway may be specified and approved in the ventilation plan provided it poses no hazard to miners. This provision is consistent with the requirements of &sect;75.380(g).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The portion of the structure necessary to accommodate the movement of the dolly is considered as part of the face haulage system. Consistent with current MSHA policy, waterlines would not be required to parallel continuous face haulage systems using a low profile conveyor belt if the length of the belt is less that 600 feet and sufficient fire hose is available to extend to the working face. Fire suppression devices and signal and alarm systems are not required to be installed along such conveyor belts. However, the belts considered as face equipment must have fire protection at the belt drive as required by &sect;75.1100&hyph;2(e) of the existing standard and, if hydraulically operated, must have fire suppression devices as required by existing &sect;75.1107. Additionally, for safety reasons, check curtains should not be installed across the area of travel of the dolly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has become aware of questions on the part of a segment of the industry relative to what are acceptable construction methods and materials for the construction of permanent ventilation controls, excluding seals, that will result in controls that satisfy the definition of durable given in paragraph (a) of the existing standard. The Agency is addressing these questions by proposing to eliminate the definition of durable and to modify paragraph (e)(1) to require these controls to be constructed in a manner and of materials that results in a construction that has been tested and shown to have a minimum strength of 39 pounds per square foot as tested under ASTM E72&hyph;80 Section 12_Transverse Load-Specimen Vertical, load only. The proposal retains the intent and requirement of the existing standard because the 8-inch hollow-core concrete block stopping with mortared joints, to which all other constructions were tied under the definition of durable in the existing standard, has been tested and shown to have a minimum strength of 39 pounds per square foot.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency recognizes that other construction methods and materials may be available or developed that will result in permanent ventilation controls that are suitable for the intended purpose. The proposal would permit alternative constructions for ventilation controls constructed after [INSERT THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS RULE] under paragraph (e)(1)(i) provided they have been tested and shown to have a minimum strength of 39 pounds per square foot. For a control to be acceptable, the operator would have to demonstrate that the control has been tested and shown to provide a strength of 39 pounds per square foot as tested under ASTM E72&hyph;80 Section 12_Transverse Load-Specimen Vertical, load only. In instances where a construction has already been tested and shown to possess the requisite strength, the operator need only provide documentation of the test results. MSHA will maintain and will make available for review at each MSHA District Office a listing of construction methods and materials that have been tested and have demonstrated a strength of at least 39 pounds per square foot. Persons wishing to have a construction method or material included in this listing should submit documentation of testing to the Agency. To the extent possible, MSHA will also maintain a listing of construction methods and materials that have failed to demonstrate a strength of at least 39 pounds per square foot when tested under ASTM E72&hyph;80 Section 12_Transverse Load-Specimen Vertical, load only. Persons wishing to have a construction method or material included in this listing should submit documentation of testing to the Agency. It should be noted that solid concrete block stoppings that are dry-stacked and plastered on only one side have not been shown to have a minimum strength of at least 39 pounds per square foot when tested under ASTM E72&hyph;80 Section 12_Transverse Load-Specimen Vertical, load only. Unless a stronger plaster is developed, it is unlikely that a stopping plastered on only one side would be acceptable under the current rule or this proposed revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with the existing rule, the proposal would require, in paragraph (e)(1)(ii), that all overcasts, undercasts, shaft partitions, permanent stoppings, and regulators, installed after November 15, 1992, be constructed of noncombustible material. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also like the existing standard, the proposal lists materials that would be suitable for these controls and would continue to prohibit ventilation controls installed after November 15, 1992, from being constructed of aluminum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency is proposing a new paragraph (h) to assure that all permanent ventilation controls, including all doors and seals, regardless of the construction date, be maintained to serve the purpose for which they were built. Existing &sect;75.333(e)(1) requires that ventilation controls be maintained to serve the purpose for which they were built. Because existing &sect;75.333(e)(1) also specifies that ventilation controls installed after November 15, 1992, be constructed of durable and noncombustible material, a commenter questioned whether the maintenance requirement applied only to ventilation controls constructed after November 15, 1992. That is not the case. Given the importance of these devices in preserving the integrity of the mine ventilation system, MSHA is proposing the maintenance provision in a new paragraph to explicitly state that all permanent ventilation controls, including seals, must be maintained to serve their intended purpose. With regard to seal maintenance, the Agency does not intend that the maintenance standard would be applied to seals located within another sealed area. Further, the Agency does not intend that the standard would apply to seals which have become consumed within a gob area which is ventilated and evaluated in a manner approved through the mine ventilation plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

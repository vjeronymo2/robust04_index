			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / UK aid to Africa hit by serious problems ALMOST two in five of Britain's aid-funded projects in Africa run into major problems, including time and cost overruns, according to the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) in its departmental report presented to parliament yesterday. 'African economies have been typified by low skill levels, inferior infrastructure, wasteful public expenditure and ineffective institutions,' the report says. As a result, the ODA has moved the balance of British aid to Africa towards supporting economic reform programmes 'designed to improve the policy and institutional environment,' the report says. In an separate assessment of more than 200 completed projects from 1966 to 1989, the ODA also reveals that 45 per cent of the projects were either failures, or only partially successful. Evaluation reports 'highlighted the difficulty of succeeding at the project level if the policies of the developing country at sector and national level are unsatisfactory.' The ODA identifies a stark contrast with Asia, where significant problems are confronted in just 10 per cent of projects. When the value rather than the number of the problematical projects is measured, the problem is even worse. In Africa, which accounted for projects worth Pounds 324m assessed in 1989-90 and 1990-91, overruns and other 'major' problems affected projects worth about Pounds 140m - or about 42 per cent. In contrast, Asia attracted funding worth Pounds 100m, but ran into complications in just 10 per cent.</p>

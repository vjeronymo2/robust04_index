			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Du Pont closures under question A report by consultants on the decision by Du Pont, the world's biggest nylon maker, to close recently acquired plants on Teesside, says it could not detect any unexpected change in market conditions which would have prompted the move. The report, by chemical industry consultants Chem Systems, says the recession from which the petrochemical industry is emerging started well over two years ago, so nothing 'new' had taken place. The research was commissioned by Cleveland County Council because of the controversy over Du Pont's plans, announced in June, to shut five plants and shed 520 jobs. It will be discussed by councillors tomorrow. It will also be submitted to the European Commission as part of its investigation into Du Pont's plans to shut down the Teesside plants and invest in new adipic acid production in Chalampe, France, in a joint venture with Rhone Poulenc. Du Pont took over the former Imperial Chemical Industries' Teesside nylons capacity, and 920 former ICI Teesside employees, in 1992.</p>

Troops surrounded and sealed off Tshisekedi's Kinshasa home  early in the morning according to his close advisor and former  Tshisekedi government communications minister, Lambert Mende.    Kinshasha streets were deserted Wednesday morning in answer  to an appeal from Tshisekedi for a strike to protest Marshal  Mobuto's dissolution of rival parliaments.    Frequent gunfights in the capital overnight also helped  clear markets and close shops. However, the volatile  working-class districts of the city were reported quiet  Wednesday morning.    Tshisekedi has been in a year-long stand-off with Mobuto  following his refusal to step down as prime minister when the  president dismissed him in October 1992, dissolving his whole  government in February 1993.    Tshisekedi was foisted as premier on the reluctant Mobuto by  a national conference that began its work, often interrupted by  political strife and bloodshed, in 1991.    The latest conflict was sparked by Mobuto's declaration last  week that the signing of a political agreement between his own  Political Forces of the Conclave (FPC) movement and the radical  Holy Alliance opposition coalition entailed the dissolution of  the country's rival parliaments.    The High Council of the Republic (HCR), appointed by the  national conference in 1992, and the National Assembly,  comprising members of the former sole, ruling People's Movement  of the Revolution (MPR), both claim legislative authority.    Mobutu called for a meeting Wednesday among members of the  rival bodies, which he wanted grouped in a new high council, to  consider a new constitution and the premiership of the large,  impoverished central African nation of more than 38 million  people.    The HCR, however, has refused to accept Mobutu's position,  as  it refused to accept the authority of Faustin Birindwa, the  prime minister he appointed after dismissing Tshisekedi for a  second time in two years in October 1992.    The HCR has been summoned into session around midday  Thursday  by its vice-president, Joseph Ileo, a member of Tshisekedi's  Christian Democrat and Social Party (PDSC), who stated that the  HCR would not attend the meeting proposed by Mobutu.    The HCR president, Archbishop of Kisingani Laurent Mosengwo  Pasinya, had called for a meeting of the council as soon as  possible to discuss forming a single body with the national  assembly.    Mobuto's 29-year-old regime is showing increasing signs of  falling apart with mounting reluctance of his main backers,  former colonial power Belgium, France, and the United States to  support him.</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Audit Office faults NHS local autonomy THE NATIONAL Health Service's Pounds 4bn-a-year supplies operation could benefit from management techniques used by companies such as Boots and Marks and Spencer, the National Audit Office says today. An NAO study of the management of complex operations in private-sector companies showed that the NHS's approach differed 'in nearly every respect'. In particular, the report says, none of 16 private companies surveyed 'permitted local autonomy on the scale allowed throughout the NHS'. The report's conclusion - that decentralised structures have prevented the NHS from maximising its purchasing efficiency - comes when the government's health reforms are encouraging still more local autonomy in many areas of the health service. The NAO examined how Boots, Marks and Spencer and Compass Services UK, a contract caterer, handled their equivalent of the NHS supplies organisation, which provides hospitals with food, bedding and equipment. Department of Health officials said 'private-sector practice was not necessarily appropriate for adoption by the NHS'. National Health Service Supplies in England. National Audit Office. HMSO.

			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EVERETT GETS HIS REVENGE ON GLANVILLE;  </P> <P> RAMS: QUARTERBACK HASN'T FORGOTTEN WHAT COACH HAS SAID ABOUT HIM DURING HIS  HOLDOUT DAYS IN HOUSTON.  </P> <P> Twice Sunday afternoon, Jim Everett had that look on his face, the look in  which the eyes inflate like miniature blimps and the smile shifts into spread  formation.  </P> <P> The first time came in the third quarter, when Everett spotted the Atlanta  Falcons in a full-on safety blitz, which left Flipper Anderson twiddling his  thumbs far downfield, awaiting the re-entry of Everett's 37-yard touchdown lob.  </P> <P> The second time came in the locker room, when someone asked Everett about the  personal satisfaction derived by beating Jerry Glanville at his own game, in a  rout, by a final score of 44-24.  </P> <P> "It's good," Everett said without a moment's hesitation. "It's nice to even the  series with him.  </P> <P> "But we still have another one. I'm sure we haven't heard the last of Jerry  Glanville."  </P> <P> Everett hasn't. Ever since he refused to sign with Glanville's Houston Oilers  in 1986, forcing his eventual trade to the Rams, he's had to handle an earful.  </P> <P> Everett can't take a hit, Jerry jabbed.  </P> <P> Everett has chicken legs . . . and a heart to go with it.  </P> <P> Everett sure looks like he could use some real coaching.  </P> <P> Hell hath no fury like a football coach scorned.  </P> <P> Glanville had the opportunity to rub it in in 1987, when the Oilers upset the  Rams on opening day, 20-16, under the Astrodome. And you know Glanville. He has  never been one to let an opportunity go to waste.  </P> <P> Three years later, Glanville was back in black, Atlanta Falcon black, and  Everett turned the reunion into a dark affair, completing 24 of 38 passes for  302 yards, three touchdowns and a Ram triumph.  </P> <P> Forty-four points, counterpoint?  </P> <P> "I just like to win, period," Everett said. "It goes beyond anything between  two people. It great to see your teammates with smiles on their faces. It's  good to see the light in their eyes. We've been through some damn hard times  the past five weeks."  </P> <P> The past five weeks, Everett's Rams were 1-4. That put them behind everyone  else in the NFC West, including Glanville's Falcons.  </P> <P> Everett admitted waiting for this one with special anticipation. The sensation  first struck about the same time the Glanville-to-Atlanta story first hit the  wires.  </P> <P> "I look forward to playing him," Everett said. "There are some things that  happened down there (in Houston) that were the cause of Jerry Glanville, but  it's his style to be the voice of the team. He has a very aggressive attitude,  and it's his way of trying to rally a team around him."  </P> <P> More than that, Everett believes Glanville rallied an entire city around him --  and against Everett -- during the embittered holdout days of 1986.  </P> <P> "Here I was," Everett said, "a 22-year old man who just wants to play the game  of football, and here's Houston, wanting to pay me second-round money when I  was the third guy taken in the draft.  </P> <P> "I had to live with being trade bait. It's tough on a young guy. . . . Jerry  was saying things about me during the holdout and, basically, he had the ear of  everyone in Houston. He's calling me a greedy young kid. All I wanted was to be  treated the way I was supposed to be."  </P> <P> Everett has found it in Anaheim, where the Rams not only rolled out the red  carpet, but had it dry-cleaned and lined with rose petals. The Rams gave him a  $14-million contract, an impenetrable offensive line, the fleetest fleet of  receivers this side of the Golden Gate.  </P> <P> "Everything turned out for the best," Everett notes.  </P> <P> Now in his fifth NFL season, Everett has the benefit of perspective and time's  passage. Today, he says, "I don't know if that was really Jerry talking then.  He might have been pressured. We were just two pawns on the board."  </P> <P> If Glanville won't publicly reveal any new respect for Everett, his actions  Sunday spoke loudly enough. If Everett still rattled in the pocket under  pressure, Glanville would have sent his linebackers and safeties blitzing from  kickoff to sundown.  </P> <P> Instead, Atlanta's defense came out backpedaling, choosing containment over  derailment, which Everett claimed was one reason he needed a quarter -- and a  10-0 deficit -- before he got jump-started.  </P> <P> "Initially, we were prepared for the blitz all the time," Everett said. "But  they came out in a loose zone. They were playing a scheme designed not to give  up the big play. It took me a little time to adjust."  </P> <P> The adjustment took Everett from a five-for-14 start to 14 completions in his  next 16 attempts. Along the way, the Rams scored on eight consecutive  possessions, outpointing the Falcons in the process, 44-7.  </P> <P> And for Everett, no points were sweeter than the ones Anderson produced on one  of the very few times Glanville called for the blitz.  </P> <P> "We were prepared for that," Everett said, grinning again. "I saw 'em coming  right away and I was yelling to (fullback) Buford (McGee) -- 'Buford, Buford,  here he comes, pick him up!'  </P> <P> "Buford made the block and all I had to do was pick a spot and throw to it.  Flipper just ran it down."  </P> <P> Now the scoreboard reads: Everett 1, Glanville 1. The two still haven't spoken  since Everett left Houston. After Sunday's game, Everett shook hands with  several Falcons.  </P> <P> But not Glanville.  </P> <P> "Maybe if he has something pertinent to say someday, I'll respond," Everett  said.  </P> <P> Glanville was too busy assessing his own damage to address old battle lines  with old quarterbacks, so Everett got the last word, on the field and off.  </P> <P> "You've got to respect Jerry as a coach," Everett said. "He knows how to  motivate a team. But he doesn't put on a helmet. He doesn't put on the pads.  We're in two different realms."  </P> <P> Kind of sounds as if Everett wouldn't mind seeing Jerry lining up at free  safety the next time their paths cross.  </P> <P> Everett laughed at the suggestion.  </P> <P> "I didn't say that."  </P></p>

As new aircraft programs become thin on the ground, Sextant  Avionique is making the logical shift into military and civil  modernization markets. So far, the French equipment maker has  been fairly successful in the civil realm, notably with its new  Enhanced Vision Systems piloting display technology. EVS aims to  improve the poor-visibility landing capability of old aircraft,  not all of whose autopilots perform up to requirements.    But Sextant's attempts to capture a share of the military  market have stalled, for lack of both a clear strategy and  opportunity. The equipment maker's product line, for instance,  does not feature mission electronic systems (radar,  navigation/attack systems), which are a key element in  modernizing interception or ground-attack aircraft, the stars of  the military aircraft retrofitting market.    Sextant's international marketing head Jose Sarnito divides  the military retrofitting market into five categories: basic  trainer aircraft; advanced trainer aircraft; air-to-ground  attack aircraft; multipurpose aircraft; and, at the top of the  echelon, multipurpose aircraft with night-flight capability.  There is a wide array of equipment to be updated in each of  these categories.    Customers will want new navigation and display instruments,  usually culled from general aviation equipment catalogs, for  basic trainer planes. In addition, advanced trainers will have  to be equipped with a headup display, multipurpose screens, and  an accurate navigational system, that is, with specifically  military products. The third category, ground attack planes,  introduces the need for such mission equipment as a laser  telemeter, possibly a laser designation pod, and in some cases  even a helmet sight to reduce the pilot's defense reaction time.  Finally, the fourth category, multipurpose aircraft, requires  radar, while the fifth calls for infrared devices for night  attack capability.    Jose Sarnito considers advanced trainer planes (AlphaJet,  Hawks, etc.) to be the most promising market segment. Sextant  has a broad line of display and navigation products for advanced  trainers, and can integrate their equipment. Lower down the  product line, customers look for the best price on initiation  aircraft, and take care of integrating equipment themselves.  Higher up the line are operational aircraft, where the cost and  technical weight of mission electronics become the overwhelming  factor. Sextant does not aspire to market leadership in this  niche, leaving it to its partner Thomson-CSF. Moreover, its big  French competitor Sagem already has a firm foothold in the  mission electronics market.    Jose Sarnito believes Sextant has a card to play in former  East-bloc countries. "The governments of those countries," he  explains, "are trying to preserve their cold-war-era industrial  capability and pilot operational ability at the lowest possible  cost." Their approach, whether in Poland, Czechoslovakia, or  Russia, is to support new trainer projects that adapt Western  avionics to locally-made airframes, which they will eventually  convert into light fighter craft. Inspired by British  Aerospace's success with the Hawk line, Poland's PZL took this  approach with its M-93s and M-95s, which are versions of the  Iryda I-22 with new engines and equipment. So did Mikoyan with  its MiG-AT and Czechoslovakia's Aerovodochody with its L-159, a  version extrapolated from the L-59 and said to have an added  radar.  <H5>  Joint Venture Project </H5>   Sextant has decided to enter the market for the long term.  "Our goal," explains Jose Sarnito, "is to imitate Allied Signal  or the other big American equipment manufacturers. We want to  develop ties with local distributors, set up shop in country,  and team up with local industries to transfer technology or  market manufacturing licenses." Sextant Avionique is said to be  discussing a possible three-way joint venture with Polish and  Czech equipment makers to pursue those goals.    Sextant's technical line involves a complete flight  electronics system christened Topflight, from which customers  can select a list of equipment based on specific project needs.  Topflight features the one-piece headup display "Smart",  liquid-crystal head-in-the-middle color displays, a set of  computers that incorporates mission control and symbol  generation functions, an anemobarometric device, and  conventional emergency instrumentation. Depending on the  navigational accuracy desired, customers can choose between the  Stratus inertial measurement unit (with a Pixyz, three-axis,  self-contained gyrolaser) developed for the Tiger helicopter, or  the Totem gyrolaser navigational system that is currently being  manufactured in large numbers to renovate the Transall. Finally,  Sextant is also offering the Topstar military GPS receiver, with  or without decoding, that it is delivering on Mirage 2000 Ds.    "To capture modernization markets," explains Jose Sarnito  once again, "a company must always be able to offer  off-the-shelf solutions. The sums involved do not cover the cost  of new developments. And the first requirement of customers is  always an accurate navigational system."    Sextant's liquid-crystal multipurpose displays have just  been  chosen by the Bangalore Aeronautics Establishment (India) to  equip prototypes of the future light combat aircraft (LCA).  Though the French equipment maker has its sights set on the more  lucrative avionics integration or chief-contractor projects  getting off the ground in east Europe, this is still an  encouraging sign. In the meantime, however, its competitor Sagem  has again managed to land most squarely on its feet: it has been  selected by the Warsaw Aeronautics Institute to build the M-93  demonstrator.</p>

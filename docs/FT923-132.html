			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Tory activists call for reform at headquarters TORY party managers face the prospect of an embarrassingly high-profile public debate on making Conservative Central Office, the party's headquarters based in central London, democratically accountable to party members. Fifty local Tory associations are supporting a call for a special meeting of the Tory central council, a gathering of senior party activists, to bring about such changes. The group, spearheaded by the Party Reform Steering Committee, a group of 11 activists, accuses Central Office of being 'remote from the constituencies and out of touch'. The difference between this and previous moves to reform Central Office is that the party's rules say that its executive committee must summon a special meeting of the central council if 50 associations require it. The call is another headache for the national union, the voluntary wing of the Tory which is already deep into arrangements for what promises to be a difficult conference next week. Central Office said the first step would be to check whether the rules were as definite as the reform committee envisaged, and whether all 50 of the local associations had indeed signed up to the move. Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, has already promised a review of spending. Central Office is traditionally the scapegoat of the Conservative party conference, with complaints about presentational failures coming from representatives who are not prepared openly to criticise party policy. Mr Michael Normington, the chairman of the steering committee, said yesterday that the call for change was widely supported and that Central Office had put pressure on many constituency associations not to join the move. If Central Office were properly subject to democratic accountability and control by constituency associations, the committee argues, there would be nothing like the level of dissatisfaction with it. The committee is seeking the transfer of responsibility for Central Office and party central funds from the appointed officers to a committee which is mainly elected and then elects its officers.</p>

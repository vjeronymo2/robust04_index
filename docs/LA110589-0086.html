			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CORNEAS FROM SRI LANKA'S DEAD ENABLE 25,000 TO SEE  </P> <P> A blind man from Japan flew to Sri Lanka recently and saw a young woman through  the eyes of her dead grandmother.  </P> <P> Horikoshi Masao, 60, a technician in a Japanese automobile factory, is one of  25,000 people in different parts of the world whose sight has been restored by  corneal grafting with eyes from Sri Lanka.  </P> <P> Masao, a grandfather, came to the Indian Ocean island to participate in  celebrations organized by the Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society to mark the giving  of the 25,000th eye.  </P> <P> The society's president, Dr. Hudson Silva, said Sri Lanka is the only country  in the world giving to other countries corneas of dead people to be grafted  onto the eyes of the blind.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Given to 57 Countries  </P> <P> Silva, who started the humanitarian scheme, said the eyes have been given to 57  countries over the last 25 years. "Our eyes have gone to so many countries to  illuminate the world," the eye surgeon said.  </P> <P> Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa was the chief guest at the  celebrations to mark the event.  </P> <P> Premadasa said that at Silva's request he had carried eyes to several countries  on his official tours as prime minister before he became president early this  year.  </P> <P> "I have taken eyes to various countries, and I know how much the people in  those countries appreciate it," he said.  </P> <P> Masao's defective eyes had been grafted three years ago with the corneas of a  65-year-old Sri Lankan woman named Aslin Nona three days after she died.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Went to See Her Family  </P> <P> During his visit to the island, Masao drove to Aslin Nona's home at  Heriyantuduwe in the suburbs of Colombo to see her family.  </P> <P> "I am very happy to see you, I have always wanted to see all of you with these  eyes," he told Aslin Nona's children and grandchildren.  </P> <P> Her granddaughter, Karunaseeli, 23, showed Masao pictures of Aslin Nona in the  family album. "I am very happy to see her," he said.  </P> <P> "This is like as if our grandmother has returned home," said Tillekeratne, one  of Aslin Nona's grandsons.  </P> <P> The Eye Donation Society formed by Silva started donating eyes to local  hospitals for grafting in 1961.  </P> <P> "Before we started this scheme, the eyes were obtained from people sent to the  gallows. But, when in 1956 the government stopped executions, the flow of eyes  to the hospitals dried up," he said.  </P> <P> Three years after the society started collecting corneas of dead people, there  was an excess over the number required by the local hospitals, he said.  </P> <P> "We then started donating the excess eyes to foreign countries. The first batch  of six eyes was sent to Singapore on the full-moon day of the month of May,  1964." Silva said.  </P> <P> He said giving the eyes on full-moon day was significant because the day is  sacred to Buddhists, who form 70% of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.  </P> <P> The Eye Donation Society has a list of more than 550,000 people, mostly  Buddhists, who have signed forms offering their corneas for grafting after  death.  </P></p>

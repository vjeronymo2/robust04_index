			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / International Company News: Radical changes for Stillwater - The platinum group could double production Stillwater Mining, the only producer of primary platinum group metals outside South Africa, is to be floated on terms that value the Montana-based company at about Dollars 230m. Last year, Stillwater produced 3 per cent of the world's platinum and palladium, metals essential for some anti-pollution catalysts. Apart from South Africa, Russia's Norilsk is a big producer of platinum metals, but as a by-product from its nickel operations. Some Dollars 40m of the Dollars 54m net proceeds from the offering will go to help double production by mid-1997. In 1993, output was 66,000 troy ounces of platinum and 218,000 oz of palladium. If the first expansion is successful, Stillwater might develop a second underground mine to quadruple output. A 'red herring' prospectus issued to international investors shows Stillwater to have one of the richest platinum-palladium deposits but also to be one of the highest-cost producers. Nevertheless, the new management suggests it could become one of the lowest-cost producers by implementing the expansion plan, by making radical changes to mining methods and by building a base metals refinery. This would extract copper and nickel from the ore locally whereas at present Stillwater has to send material to Belgium for processing by Union Miniere. Stillwater, which started operating in 1986, was jointly owned until recently by Chevron, the US oil company, and Manville Corporation, one of the US groups that suffered financially from a previous involvement in asbestos mining. Chevron, as part of its strategic decision to quit mining, disposed of its stake in September. Stillwater funded the purchase of Chevron's holding by privately placing shares and subordinated notes worth Dollars 49m. Now the company intends to offer 4.5m shares and Manville will offer 1.2m Stillwater shares at between Dollars 12 and Dollars 14 each. They shares will be traded on Nasdaq. Co-lead managers of the issue are Salomon Brothers, Kemper Securities and Fleming Martin. Manville will cut its holding in Stillwater from 50 to 31 per cent - or 27 per cent if an underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised. Stillwater suffered a net loss of Dollars 5.63m on revenues of Dollars 53.8m last year, including a Dollars 7.9m one-time provision arising from the reorganisation of the Chevron-Manville partnership. For 1992, there was a net loss of Dollars 5.4m on revenues of Dollars 46.2m. In the first nine months of this year Stillwater made a net profit of Dollars 2.1m compared with a Dollars 1.5m profit in the same period a year earlier. Average cash costs fell to Dollars 177 a troy ounce last year against Dollars 191 in 1992. However, in the first nine months of this year, cash costs went up to Dollars 183 an ounce because Stillwater's smelter was closed for three weeks for maintenance. Average realised prices last year were Dollars 376 an ounce for platinum and Dollars 125 for palladium. In the first nine months of this year realised prices were Dollars 377 and Dollars 124 respectively.</p>

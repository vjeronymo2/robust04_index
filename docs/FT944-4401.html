			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: ICI to make Pounds 45m from sale of SA chemicals ICI is to make a Pounds 45m exceptional fourth quarter pre-tax gain on the sale yesterday of its remaining stake in AECI, the South African chemicals company. The sale of 20.6m shares raised about Pounds 80m and leaves as ICI's main interest in South Africa a 51 per cent stake in AECI Explosives. About two thirds of the shares were bought by South African institutions and the remaining investment came from the US and Europe. The sale followed a prolonged and steep rise in the AECI share price from less than R6 to almost R35 since early 1993. ICI held 38 per cent of the company until October 1993, when it announced an exchange of part of its stake for a direct 51 per cent holding in AECI's explosives division. Apart from the explosives business, which employs about 5,000, ICI's South African businesses are: ICI South Africa, a wholly owned subsidiary selling imported products made by ICI and other companies. The business employs 100 people Tioxide Southern Africa, with 330 staff, is 60 per cent owned by ICI subsidiary Tioxide. The rest belongs to AECI. ICI will keep strong links with AECI, besides those through the explosive and titanium dioxide businesses. Mr Alan Pedder, Tioxide's chief executive, who represented ICI on the AECI board, will continue as a non-executive director of AECI. The sale was conducted by SG Warburg over a two-day period. It is the latest in a series of modest transactions this year by ICI, which is seeking to divest its self of businesses and minority holdings deemed not to be central. Mr Martin Evans of Hoare Govett said the sale of the remaining stake in AECI was not a surprise. 'It is part of the long-running reorganisation that has been carried out before and especially since the demerger of (pharmaceuticals company) Zeneca.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Romanian Transportation Minister </F> Traian Basescu by Ana Maria Vintan; place and date not given:  "As Long as They Are in Power, I Will Not Give the Evidence to  the General Prosecution"]    [Text] [Vintan] Mr. Basescu, in what sense in President  [Ion] Iliescu involved in the espionage case you mentioned?    [Basescu] I clearly said that confidential documents of the  Petromin company were transferred to General [Nikos] Grylakis in  Greece, the route being Romanuel Posedaru [one of the directors  of Petromin], [former Romanian Transportation] Minister [Paul]  Teodoru, and General Grylakis. I do not know whether the  documents were personally handed over by Minister Teodoru or  rather [presidential counselor] General [Vasile] Ionel. I  presume, it was General Ionel. My presumption is based on the  fact that I cannot imagine Minister Teodoru holding talks with  an intelligence general [Grylakis], because he is too bright to  establish direct ties with an intelligence general.    [Vintan] Do you mean you never referred to President Ion  Iliescu?    [Basescu] No, I never referred to him. It is the merit of  your daily to have also mentioned Iliescu's name, although I am  not prepared to state that the things published by ROMANIA  LIBERA were lies.    [Vintan] For how long have you been holding these pieces of  information?    [Basescu] For a very short time, and I also have evidence.  Otherwise I would not venture to make such assertions. I have  never asserted anything publicly without also being able to  prove it. The case of Romanuel Posedaru may be explained in the  following way: He handed them [the documents] over upon the  orders of Minister Teodoru. The responsibility for delivering  those documents to Grylakis mostly lies with Teodoru.    [Vintan] The persons you accused are asking why you need to  interpret a commercial transaction as an espionage case  involving the highest-level officials of the state power.    [Basescu] First let us take a look at the Forum  Maritime-Petromin deal. There was this insignificant and honest  Katounis, a person who did not have either a bad or a good  reputation in the shipping business; he was merely an obscure  shipping businessman. Well, one fine day he unexpectedly comes  to conclude a contract by which he would have taken control of  51 percent of Romania's oil tankers and ore carrier ships [the  Petromin fleet]. This man had received the necessary  information, by way of that Arab, Taher, before he came here to  conclude the contract. He held information both regarding the  financing contracts and the commercial contracts that had been  concluded by Petromin. He is not a dumb person and this is  proved by the fact that by the end of 1993 the company began to  make profit. Currently its profits amount to 500 million lei.  So he came precisely at the right time. In 1993, he intended to  sign a contract by which he would have taken over the company.  At the same time, Minister Teodoru was making a great fuss  everywhere claiming that Basescu had left him a bankrupt  Petromin [company]. But look here, it is not bankrupt at all. In  June 1993, Teodoru and [Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae]  Vacaroiu claimed vehemently that 51 percent of Petromin ought to  have been sold to Katounis because the company was going  bankrupt. And look what happened, eventually the contract did  not become effective and the company is making money. This  means that they [Teodoru and Vacaroiu] lied to justify an  unfavorable contract. Under such circumstances, if a prime  minister and a minister sign a contract that is later declared  illegal, normally they should have no other choice but to step  down.    [Vintan] What is your opinion about the arrest of the four  former Petromin directors?    [Basescu] This is a political game, in which --  considering that the contract has been declared illegal -- the  state power, Teodoru and [Ion] Honcescu [head of the Prime  Minister's Control Corps] have staged the whole thing by having  the four former Petromin directors arrested.    [Vintan] Do you think they are innocent?    [Basescu] Absolutely! They are victims of a major hoax  intended to fool public opinion. The press also made a great  fuss about it, of course, because it is a spectacular case. All  this happened on the eve of the court ruling on the  Petromin-Forum Maritime contract, in which Teodoru and Vacaroiu  are fully involved. Everyone let themselves be led astray by the  hoax and ignored precisely what was essential, namely that, for  the first time ever, a government decision is rejected by our  justice. And that the prime minister and a minister, who were  coauthors of that illegal decision are now fine, thank you very  much, and on top of it they are given the chance to be appear as  the defenders of the people for having ordered the arrest of the  four [directors].    [Vintan] What do you intend to do with the evidence you  have?    [Basescu] My number one priority is to convince [the court]  that the four persons have been arrested for nothing. You might  also find it difficult to believe that. I was not involved in  any illegal dealings together with the four, they are simply  four colleagues of mine, four innocent people who are victims of  the dispute between myself, on the one hand, and Vacaroiu and  Teodoru on the other. I hope I will be able to address an open  letter to Teodoru and Vacaroiu to point out the illegal dealings  they are involved in and to prove that they are abusing these  people, and that the day will come when they will be held  responsible for it.    [Vintan] Do you intend to hand the evidence over to the  General Prosecution?    [Basescu] No, as long as those people are in power I will  not do that. I know they control the prosecution.    [Vintan] You know that your party [Democratic Party -- PD]  has concluded a nonaggression pact with the PDSR [Social  Democracy Party of Romania -- ruling party]. The majority of  the persons accused by you are orbiting around that party.    [Vintan] I do not want to hear about political pacts. If  need be, I will become an independent parliamentarian, but I  will still defend my opinions. They wanted me to be a member of  the [PD] commission that held negotiations with the PDSR, but I  refused, precisely because there is nothing I can negotiate with  such partners.</p>

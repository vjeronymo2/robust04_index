			<p>BFN     [Text] The deputy chairman of Hungarian Radio [Laszlo  Csucs] has terminated the program "Sign of Thought." According  to a report by PESTI HIRLAP, Laszlo Csucs explained his decision  by stating that the editors of the Sunday cultural program --  Gabor Ocsovai, Miklos Gyoerffy, and Julia Varadi -- have been  producing programs which were biased and have incited passions.    The deputy chairman expressed the view that the producers of  the last edition did not adhere to even the most elementary  ethical requirements. In Laszlo Csucs's judgment, further  experimentation would be an abuse of the patience of the  audience, and although the radio's cultural weekly was still  needed, it would be produced not by the current staff and  probably not under its current name.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Drug cost reform finalised today The Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare will today finalise reforms aimed at further controlling government expenditure on medicines. These represent about 25 per cent of health care costs. The latest moves threaten to undermine growth of the Japanese market, the world's second largest. The ministry has already announced a price cut averaging 6.6 per cent due to be implemented at the beginning of April. The package being considered today includes measures to extend fixed-cost reimbursement to psychiatric hospitals, controls on spending on drugs used during blood dialysis, and an end to reimbursement for vitamins prescribed to out-patients. The move to extend fixed-cost reimbursement to psychiatric hospitals could seriously affect the market for Japanese central nervous system drugs. Broker BZW estimates sales for such medicines reached Y538bn (Pounds 3.4bn) in 1992, making it the second largest therapeutic category. Most sales are through hospitals. A similar fixed reimbursement scheme introduced during the early 1990s covering chronic care of the elderly led to a significant reduction in drugs spending in affected hospitals. Under the schemes, a fixed amount is paid by the government for treating certain conditions. The hospitals, whose margins became dependent on keeping down costs, therefore have an incentive to reduce prescribing. The new rules covering dialysis would set a fixed limit on medical costs per day and should lead to an increase in prescribing of cheaper drugs. Broker Baring Securities estimated the market for associated products is worth Y37bn-Y39bn a year. It predicted sales of Kissei Pharmaceutical's product Fragmin could fall 10 per cent, while drugs marketed by Banyu Pharmaceutical, a subsidiary of Merck of the US, and Torii would drop further. But these drugs are a small proportion of the groups' sales. The package is expected to be implemented in April, apart from the de-listing of vitamins, which would be introduced in October.

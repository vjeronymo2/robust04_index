			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Kravchuk moves to end Ukrainian stalemate PRESIDENT Leonid Kravchuk yesterday ordered special measures to end the stalemate between president and parliament and halt an economic crisis gripping Ukraine, AP reports from Kiev. He issued a decree creating a 10-member committee to co-ordinate reform efforts by the central government, regional governments and business. His action came a day after he took full executive control of government following MPs' demands last week he assume responsibility for the faltering economy. Mr Kravchuk's press secretary, Mr Volodymyr Shlaposhnikov, said: 'There has been a vacuum between the government and parliament. We're aiming to fix that.' Before Monday's decree giving Mr Kravchuk direct control of the economy, the prime minister was in charge of economic reform and day-to-day operation of the government. His action followed parliament's approval last week of early legislative and presidential elections in 1994. The president's term was originally set to expire in the autumn of 1996 and the parliament's in the spring of 1995. Mr Vadym Redko, acting director of foreign relations, said yesterday ministers had not yet seen a copy of the decree. 'We know of its existence, but no one has told us what to do.' Mr Kravchuk appeared to be hoping for a boost in popularity before presidential elections in June 1994. His popularity has plummeted since he signed an agreement earlier this month with President Boris Yeltsin to give Russia the Black Sea fleet and nuclear weapons in exchange for debt relief and uranium to run Ukraine's nuclear plants. Mr Yefim Zviagilsky, who was named acting prime minister last week, will stay on until Mr Kravchuk nominates a new candidate. Mr Zviagilsky, seen as a conservative opposed to speedy market reforms, replaced Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma, who resigned last week after lawmakers denied him extra powers.</p>

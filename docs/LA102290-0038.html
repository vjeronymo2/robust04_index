			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'NIGHT ANGEL' PRETTY TO LOOK AT BUT HAS ECLIPSE OF HUMOR  </P> <P> The moral of "Night Angel" (at selected theaters), a fast-paced, elegant  thriller of the supernatural for the viewer is: Beware lunar eclipses.  </P> <P> For filmmakers it is this: When you're spinning lush, erotic horror stories  don't forget your sense of humor -- or to weigh the implications of what you're  evoking. Visually, "Night Angel" is terrific, but director Dominique  Othenin-Girard and writers Joe Augustyn and Walter Josten take themselves both  too seriously and too thoughtlessly.  </P> <P> According to Talmudic fable, Adam had a first wife named Lilith, who refused to  submit to him. She left Paradise and haunts the night to this day. The  filmmakers' Lilith is a standard issue horror movie monster who emerges from a  bog during a prolonged eclipse and takes the form of a beautiful woman (Isa  Andersen) who proceeds to wreak destruction on the staff of a fashion magazine  through her irresistible sexual allure.  </P> <P> Apparently, she figures that getting her picture on the cover on a trendy mag  -- before that eclipse is over -- is somehow the perfect way to spread evil for  evil's sake. What the film gives us is yet another myth of Woman as the  Destroyer, with the inference that in this instance she is a lesbian who  pretends to have a feminist agenda. In any case, neither lesbians nor feminists  nor women in general deserve to be given this retrograde image.  </P> <P> Andersen comes on with the solemnity of Theda Bara, the original screen vamp,  or the campy '40s movie goddess Maria Montez. Having led two male Siren  Magazine staffers to grisly deaths, Andersen's Lilith zeroes in on art director  Linden Ashby and his jewelry designer girlfriend Debra Feuer, whose sister  Karen Black is Siren's publisher.  </P> <P> Ashby, Feuer and especially Black acquit themselves as real pros, throwing  themselves wholeheartedly into this hokum, as does Helen Martin as an elderly  lady who is the one person who has Lilith's number. Available credits for  "Night Angel" (rated R for sex and violence) are scant, but among its various  skilled craftsmen cinematographer David Lewis deserves singling out for his  virtuoso contribution in making the film look better than it is.  </P></p>

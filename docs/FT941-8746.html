			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Mirror to raise bid for Independent The consortium backed by Mirror Group Newspapers is preparing to increase its bid for Newspaper Publishing, owners of The Independent and the Independent on Sunday. No final decision has been taken but discussions took place yesterday involving Hambros and Schroders, representing members of the consortium, and SG Warburg, which acts for Newspaper Publishing. Earlier this month the consortium, which apart from MGN, includes the two largest existing shareholders of The Independent, El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy and a group of founders led by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, bid 261.6p a share for the company. The bid was immediately trumped by Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland which bought 24.99 per cent of the company at 350p a share. The consortium already controls just under 48 per cent of Newspaper Publishing. An increased offer to persuade some of the remaining institutional shareholders of the company to sell would give the consortium a majority stake and allow it to go ahead with its plans. These include following MGN staff to Canary Wharf in London's Docklands and offering MGN a contract to provide all the services the paper needs apart from editorial. Talks could continue over the weekend with a planned meeting between Mr O'Reilly and Mr Whittam Smith. Meanwhile Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, said yesterday in a written answer that he had received an application from the consortium to acquire a controlling interest in Newspaper Publishing. The consortium is asking that such a deal should not be referred to the Monopolies Commission. Mr Heseltine can allow the transfer of ownership of a newspaper without an inquiry if he is satisfied 'the newspaper concerned is not economic as a going concern and as a separate newspaper'.</p>

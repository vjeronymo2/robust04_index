			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Observer team moves on to Serbia's borders The vanguard of a 135-strong group of international observers is to begin operations today to ensure that Serbia's embargo of Serb-held territory in Bosnia is being maintained. If the team confirms that the blockade, imposed at the beginning of August, is genuine then the UN Security Council will almost certainly respond by easing sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. The team, led by retired Swedish general Bo Pellnas, met Serbian officials for talks in Belgrade yesterday which focused on where the inspectors would be placed and the nature of their powers. Speaking in Geneva on Wednesday, the international mediator, Lord Owen, said the team - not officially termed 'observers' or 'monitors' in deference to Serbian sensibilities - would keep a low profile. 'We don't want them to be terribly visible,' Lord Owen said, adding it would be up to Serbian and Montenegrin officials to carry out physical checks. There would be no challenges to trucks crossing the border into Bosnia without the co-operation of local officials. 'Otherwise, we are putting their lives at risk,' Lord Owen said. Despite the restrictions, Lord Owen told reporters: 'We are satisfied (the mission) will be able to make sure that only humanitarian supplies are going across.' He warned that the team would be withdrawn if there were any doubts that the Serbian authorities were complying but stressed that they had every interest in co-operating. 'If everyone is satisfied, it is agreed there should be a relaxation of sanctions,' he added. 'We would very much appreciate to do our work without the world media on our back,' said Gen Pellnas after the Belgrade talks. He refused to say where his men would be stationed. The state-controlled media in Belgrade describes the mission as 'a group of humanitarian civilians' to assist in the improved provision of aid to the people of Bosnia-Hercegovina. The fact that the group's real purpose is to monitor observance of an embargo against the Bosnian Serbs is conveniently ignored. Opposition leaders have attacked Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic for agreeing to allow inspection of a border which, they argue, merely divides fellow Serbs. There are no great hopes that the blockade, or its inspection, will cause Bosnian Serbs to reverse their opposition to the peace plan proposed by the five-member international Contact Group. Lord Owen said the mission was not trying to force an immediate 'change of heart' among the Bosnian Serbs. Efforts have meanwhile been made to shore up a shaky alliance between Bosnia's Moslems and Croats. Croat and Moslem leaders, meeting in Zagreb on Wednesday, agreed to open a key road between the two republics and to establish joint authorities in parts of the Moslem-Croat federation. The federation was formed in March, but the two erstwhile enemies have yet to implement much of the agreement. Observers fear that rising tensions among Croats and Moslems could degenerate into another round of hostilities.</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / International Company News: Volvo loan to extend debt profile VOLVO, the Swedish car group, is launching a Dollars 600m syndicated loan which will replace an existing facility and help to extend its debt maturity profile. The new credit consists of three separate tranches: a Dollars 150m 364-day revolving credit; a Dollars 200m five-year revolving credit; and a Dollars 250m five-year term loan. The short-term revolving credit has a commitment fee of 12.5 basis points and a margin of 37.5 basis points over the London interbank offered rate. The five-year revolving credit has a commitment fee of 22.5 basis points and a margin of 45 basis points over Libor. The five-year term loan also has a margin of 45 basis points over Libor and front-end fees ranging from 7.5 to 12.5 basis points. Credit Suisse First Boston, the arranger of the transaction, said the credit facilities are intended to replace a Dollars 700m credit facility which was set up in 1988 and which is due to expire shortly.</p>

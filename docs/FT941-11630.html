			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / North-east's last working pit may close within weeks: British Coal likely to begin review procedure for Ellington colliery British Coal is likely today to start the process that will result in the closure of its last working colliery in the north-east of England, once considered the heart of the industry. The move will shock the workforce at Ellington colliery, Northumberland, which was confident the pit's future was secure after it recently won lucrative contracts to supply a nearby Alcan aluminium smelter. Regional executives are expected to tell union leaders representing more than 1,000 workers at the pit that they want to hold a review meeting soon. This could mean rationalisation, but is more likely to lead to closure within the next few weeks. As part of its pre-privatisation rationalisation, British Coal yesterday signalled the closure of its Manton pit in Nottinghamshire by calling a meeting to review its future. Other Nottinghamshire pits will be told their fate today. The north-east will react angrily to the developments at Ellington. In the industry's heyday at the turn of the century, the region boasted hundreds of pits. For more than a century the region has been host to the Durham Miners' Gala, the most celebrated of the industry's annual gatherings. The expression - 'Sending coals to Newcastle' - was coined because the region had such plentiful supplies of the mineral it would never need to import it. Although the resource remains plentiful, it is difficult to supply it to customers at competitive prices. British Coal recently told regional representatives, including MPs and council leaders, there were severe geological problems at Ellington. Seams were thin and the pit had lost Pounds 6m in the previous nine months. Mr Jack Thompson, MP for Wansbeck constituency and a former worker at the pit, said he was not optimistic about today's meeting, but he hoped the private sector would show interest in the pit. Most of Ellington's employees at the pit had believed its short-term future was secure because of the Alcan contracts. Alcan last week announced it had joined forces with Ryan, the mining group, to consider a bid to buy British Coal's operations in the north-east, including Ellington and open-cast mines. Today's announcement should not affect Ryan and Alcan's ability to mine at Ellington. British Coal has said it will keep all pits it closes in a state where they can be re-opened by private operators. Ellington is still likely to be offered in the north-east regional package which forms one of five companies to be sold by the government in the forthcoming privatisation. Separately the government yesterday announced offers of coal subsidies to RJB Mining in support of additional sales from Blenkinsopp drift mine in Northumberland to National Power, and to Monktonhall Mineworkers in support of additional sales to Scottish Power.

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Repossession prices fall PRICES of properties reposs-essed by mortgage lenders are falling at a much faster rate than house prices in general, according to a survey by Special Risk Services, an insurance broker which specialises in financial insurances. The survey examined sales of properties repossessed between 1988 and 1992 by looking at 1,058 settled mortgage indemnity insurance claims. It found that on average the values of the properties had fallen by 33 per cent. By contrast general house prices have fallen by up to 20 per cent since 1988. Mr Dane Douetil, a mortgage indemnity specialist with SRS, said: 'The financial impact on both borrowers and lenders is worse in a repossession situation than the headline figures suggest.' The extent of the fall indicates that some mortgage lenders may be underestimating the extent of their losses arising from mortgage default. Mortgage indemnity insurance covers lenders against a portion of losses they suffer on the sale of repossessed properties. In the SRS sample of repossessed properties the average drop in value was steepest in East Anglia (40.45 per cent), while Greater London, the south-west and the south-east show reductions of 35.26 per cent, 34.97 per cent and 30.69 per cent respectively. Factors responsible for the sharp fall in value of repossessed properties include: the poor state of repair of properties before and after repossession; the fact that an empty house does not 'show well' for potential buyers; and the need for lenders to sell the property within a reasonable period of time following repossession. The survey also shows that on average over the last three years it has taken 166 days for a lender to apply to the courts for a repossession of a property following the first arrears by the borrower. A Pounds 577m government programme to buy empty properties in England to aid the housing market and provide accommodation for the homeless has beaten its target of 16,000 homes by the end of March, the Housing Corporation said yesterday. The scheme, had approved purchases of 18,000 homes.</p>

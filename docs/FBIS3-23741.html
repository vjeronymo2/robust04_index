			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Anin, under the "Carte Blanche" </F> rubric: "The Lubyanka Reform as an Iceberg. One Must Guess at  What One Cannot See"]    [Text] The current reform of the Russian special services  is proceeding with indirect support from the CIA, within the  framework of the "Freedom Support Project," with its center in  Langley and a branch in Moscow. Certain state security officers  are convinced that Lubyanka is already operating under political  control from the West. Here they refer to information from  agency sources--their own and the Foreign Intelligence Service.    In principle, this is no sensation at all, because one of  the  mandatory areas of special service activity is monitoring  various of the enemy's functional units--by operational methods  and through political lobbying. If one pays attention to the  total "Atlantism" of the new Russian policy, the above  assessment of the concrete situation can be accepted, at least  as one version.    Boris Yeltsin's December edict on abolishing the Ministry of  Security was a surprise to people working behind the granite  walls of Lubyanka. They had expected something like this after  the October events. They received reassurances from the Kremlin  in November: Go ahead and work, nothing of the kind will happen.  But that very edict came from the president on the heels of the  election. At Lubyanka they were sure that there was a  connection. I was told that it was suggested from above "by the  powers that be and the media" that they support the campaign of  Russia's Choice, which did not happen. We know the results of  the voting on 12 December. Plus there was the quite  understandable fear of the organized structure, which sometimes  has too much information that is harmful to the regime, and in  principle, if something were to happen, is capable of taking  forceful actions. Plus there is the desire that follows from  this to finally take the "dangerous" organization in hand, right  down to the point of creating a new system in a new place.    In any state, the special services operate within the  framework of the concept of national security. By and large,  there is no such thing in modern Russia. Therefore, Lubyanka is  still operating with a view to basically the priorities and  experience of past times. Which sometimes stands in  contradiction to the strategic and, shall we say, local  interests of the new powers. I was told that when Anatoliy  Chubays came to Lubyanka, he rebuked the officers of the  Ministry of Security for the fact that he had received from them  nothing but negative developments pertaining to privatization.  And these developments illustrate the extreme criminalization of  a process; they are above all corruption and entanglement of  Chubays' favorite brainchild by the Mafia structures. The chief  of the State Committee on the Administration of State Property  asked why he does not receive good news from the privatization  front. He was given to understand that publicizing positive  experience was the work of a different organization. Chubays was  dissatisfied with this answer.    Only the deaf are not talking about corruption at all levels  of Russian power today. And also about the Russian economy as  the nutritive environment for economic banditry. The career  interests of at least three administrations and one department  of the disbanded Ministry of Security were concentrated  precisely here. And almost 90 percent of the cases of the  Ministry of Security of Russia involved corruption and organized  crime. It was these three administrations--economic  counterintelligence, transportation control, and the fight  against contraband and corruption--that were separated from the  general structure and transformed into two independent  departments. The investigatory department was turned over to the  procuracy. The Lefortovo Prison went to the militia. Just for  good measure, the border troops were taken away from Lubyanka  and also the operational-mobilization administration, which is  in charge of the system of secret underground structures and  utilities.    By taking direct charge of special services, the president  precluded the very possibility of their being controlled by the  government, parliament, or public organizations. Thus,  counterintelligence was again transformed into a completely  secret structure completely under the control of the "party in  power."    When the president said that there would be no political  detective work in Russia, he might as well have said that snow  would not fall in Russia. Political detective work always has  and always will exist in any state in the form of certain agency  measures. This is necessary, to put it crudely, to reveal people  or groups that intend to cause one or another kind of harm to  the political regime or one of its representatives. It is boring  to talk about this, it is primary. And no matter what Yeltsin  may say, among the population this will be done by the same  people who have always done it, only under a new name, and  political detective work at the highest level will be done by a  new structure, one might say, under the president himself.    Aleksandr Korzhakov is called Yeltsin's shadow. Yeltsin  brought him along with him from back in Sverdlovsk, and he has  been in charge of the group of the president's personal guard  since the times when the current Russian leader was riding in a  Moskvich. Since that time, if something has kept Korzhakov from  gaining more power, it has been the need to interact in his work  with the Kremlin guard, headed by the chief of Alpha, General  Barsukov. On 3 October, after Alpha refused to storm the White  House, Boris Yeltsin resolutely pushed Barsukov away, and now  the president's personal guard is completely in Korzhakov's  hands. One can judge the staff of the structure they created  from the fact that, as we have learned from informed people, the  staff distribution table includes several general slots.  Moreover, as other sources assert, the new formation will have  control of the main secret telephone communication lines--ATS-1,  ATS-2, and operational communications.    All this plus the fact that in a presidential republic,  which  the post-October Russia intends to become, the actual power is  the president and the president's circle, means that an  extremely important task has been assigned to Aleksandr  Korzhakov--to defend the presidential power. This is a new  structure in a new place, which, in addition to guarding the  president's actual body, will engage, it seems, in serious  counterintelligence activity at the highest level, namely:  political detective work along the line of  parliament-party-government-Yeltsin's inner circle.</p>

			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Dispute over Lambeth fraud inquiry LAMBETH council's ruling Labour group has failed to agree the form of an inquiry into its chief executive's allegations of 'unprecedented' fraud, in spite of meetings lasting into the early hours of Saturday morning. Mr Steve Whaley, Labour leader on the south London borough, said yesterday that reports that Mr Andrew Arden QC, a leading housing-law practitioner, would carry out the inquiry were 'premature' and that a decision would not be taken until further meetings in 10 days' time. One Labour councillor reported 'strong disagreement' over the nature of the inquiry while opposition councillors said they were not consulted about either the remit of the investigation or the choice of investigator. The Labour leadership, dismayed at the resurrection of its 'loony left' local government image, is anxious for a swift response to allegations in the report by Mr Herman Ouseley, the chief executive, that over the last 10 years payments of more than Pounds 10m were not properly authorised, with contracts and redundancy payments awarded illegally and many cases of over-charging. It could be several weeks before any inquiry starts and Lambeth's Labour group has agreed it should have until June to report. Mr Michael English, secretary of the Labour group, said any inquiry should be 'as wide-ranging as possible'. As well as a QC he wants it to include an accountant, a civil engineer and possibly a trade unionist. Mr Arden conducted Hackney council's inquiry into claims of a freemasons' corruption racket in the late 1980s. Mr Keith Fitchett, deputy leader of Lambeth's Liberal Democrats, said that further inquiry into the Mr Ouseley's report was 'superfluous'. He added: 'It should now be a matter for the police. One of the major reasons for the current scandal is that recommendations of the last full inquiry into malpractice in the borough, in 1987, were not implemented.' Friday night's debate on Mr Ouseley's report was acrimonious. The council's housing and direct-services departments tabled responses of more than 100 pages. Opposition councillors claimed that information in the hands of some Labour members had not been made available to them. Police are already investigating claims made in Mr Ouseley's report.

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Arts: A revolutionary in salmon-pink silk - Joan Smith talks to Erica Jong, a 'serious person of letters' dogged by her early, famous erotic novel I first met Erica Jong over dinner at Christ Church, one of Oxford's most traditional colleges. At high table, under the painted gaze of monarchs, prime ministers and colonial governors, she talked fluently about literature, the role of the writer and the future of feminism. Then, as we sipped coffee in the company of Frank Weston, Archdeacon of Oxford, she leaned forward and inquired innocently: 'Joan, do you get many request for soiled underwear?' In the startled silence that followed, she explained that, in the US, any woman who writes about sex is deluged with readers' letters soliciting cast-off undies. At the time she seemed amused by these and the other, even weirder overtures she went on to describe. But a less flippant, more spontaneous response emerges in her autobiography, Fear of Fifty: A Mid-life Memoir. In the book Jong admits to being troubled by these requests, a reaction which earned the disapproval of the author Henry Miller. 'Why don't you take it as a joke?' Miller asked, a piece of advice Jong has clearly done her best to follow. But the story neatly encapsulates her dilemma as a writer who makes the erotic a major theme of her work yet has to live with the perception that she is no more than the author of a very famous dirty book. That Jong takes her writing seriously is in no doubt. Sitting in her airy apartment on the Upper East Side of New York, overlooked by a portrait of herself cross-legged and naked except for a salmon-pink wrap, she could be taken for an archetypal, if unusually successful, child of the 1960s. Yet her literary ambitions are positively 18th-century. She says she always wanted to be 'a person of letters', reeling off a list of writers who, in her opinion, also fit this definition - Updike, Burgess, Colette, de Beauvoir. 'If you were a person of letters,' she continues, explaining why she writes poetry as well as prose, 'it was a point of honour to write in different forms'. Yet in spite of her substantial output, Jong knows that her public persona is still refracted through the lens of her early success, the runaway bestseller Fear of Flying. Although she has published six volumes of poetry, five other novels (including Fanny, a pastiche of 18th-century picaresque) and a critical appraisal of Henry Miller, readers remember her above all for a single phrase on the first page of Fear of Flying: the 'zipless fuck'. That phrase, which held out the promise to women of guilt-free, uncomplicated sex, leapt out at reviewers and readers alike in 1973. Its timing was crucial, coming at a moment when many women were puzzled by an inarticulate sense that the sexual revolution had not worked for them. Fear of Flying captured the zeitgeist and sold 12 million copies in 27 languages. Jong's heroine, Isadora Wing, embodied the angst and the ambition of a generation of sexually-awakened but dissatisfied women. Yet Jong immediately felt trapped by its success. 'Whoever pushes America's sex button must be prepared for sirens and alarms', she writes in Fear of Fifty. 'Whatever else we do in our lives will be drowned out by them'. In New York a few days before publication, Jong reiterates this complaint. 'People don't make any distinction between pornography and writing about sensuality or feelings or the body', she insists. She says that a new generation of readers, young women in their 20s, has expressed surprise that Fear of Flying has a reputation as an erotic novel. 'There isn't very much sex in it,' she protests. Inevitably though, when Fear of Fifty was published in the US last month, it was greeted in the mass circulation newspaper USA Today with the inch-high headline, 'Jong unzipped'. Her problem, in essence, is how far she can exploit her fame as a sexual pioneer without running the risk that the rest of her ideas will be ignored. Fear of Fifty is an irresistible title, playfully reminding readers of Fear of Flying while suggesting that Jong, now 52, is grappling with a current American obsession. (Betty Friedan, author of The Feminine Mystique, tackled the subject of age head-on last year in a rambling, 600-page tome.) Yet the very act of calling attention to the origin of Jong's fame raises the expectation of sexual revelations. Fear of Fifty does not disappoint, containing extraordinarily frank accounts of Jong's love affairs and four marriages. In fact Jong has much more to say about sex than age, her seemingly inexhaustible energy producing a tone that is sometimes angry but never defeated. There is a real danger, which Jong recognises, that the book's other themes  -rivalry between mothers and daughters, how women develop a sense of identity, the relationship between secular Jews and the past - will be ignored. 'Here in the States, the interviews have been so silly', she protests. 'Because I've revealed aspects of my personal life they want to ask more about that. They don't get the ideas at all'. Her first draft had an extra 100 pages, statistics from UN reports to shore up her arguments about continuing discrimination against women. Her editor suggested cutting them in favour of the personal details which American reviewers have found so seductive. Jong gives the impression of continually being caught by such dilemmas, wanting to be taken seriously but finding herself steered towards the populist writing she does so well. Fear of Fifty bounds along with jokey chapter headings like 'How I got to be the second sex'. Rivalry is a constant theme in the book: with her mother (a thwarted artist who gave up her career for marriage to a jazz musician and motherhood), with husbands, lovers, and the literary establishment. 'What so angered people was a woman speaking frankly about her feelings', she says of her critics. 'If a woman claims this territory men get so angry. Sometimes I think they're angry because we've taken away one of their devices. They created a female character to express the female side of their own natures - Pope's Eloisa, Madame Bovary, Anna Karenina. They can no longer blithely plunder our psyches for their subject-matter'. In spite of her fame and success, Jong still presents herself as something of an outsider. She has a strong sense of mischief without always being able to predict how her audience will react. She seems genuinely puzzled by the inability of reviewers and profile writers to see her as she sees herself: a revolutionary in salmon-pink silk. Fear of Fifty is published by Chatto &amp; Windus (Pounds 16, 390 pages).</p>

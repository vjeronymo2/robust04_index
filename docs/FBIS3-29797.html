			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] SUVA, Feb 22 (AFP) -- Fiji's Chief Justice Sir  Timoci Tuivaga rejected Tuesday an attempt by the governing  Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) party to stop polling in  Tailevu Province to allow renominations for this week's  election. The SVT, headed by Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka,  wanted to nominate another candidate followed the death of Home  Affairs Minister Ratu William Toganivalu during the period  allowed for objections.    However, Tuivaga rejected the application for an injunction  on the grounds that Toganivalu had died during this period and  his nomination papers had become irrelevant in the election for  Tailevu. Toganivalu had been replaced by a close associate who  had entered the election as an independent.    Meantime, election officials said they were concerned by  what  is considered here to be a low voter turnout at the start of  Fiji's week-long general election, particularly in Suva. They  reported that in some areas turnout was down to between 60 and  70 percent.    "We have given the snap general election a lot of publicity  but people have not been turning up to vote since we began last  Friday," an election official said.    "It's now up to election candidates to provide transport for  their supporters and take them to their respective polling  stations," he said. Polling has been quiet and incident-free.</p>

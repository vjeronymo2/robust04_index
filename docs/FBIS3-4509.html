In a routine press briefing for both Chinese and foreign  press members, Wu said Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Jiang Zemin  agreed on a three-point principle in connection with the Korean  situation.    The principle was the maintenance of peace and stability on  the Korean peninsula, resolution of the North Korean nuclear  question through dialogue, and non-use of pressure against North  Korea over the nuclear issue.    Reiterating China's opposition to any resolution by the U.N.  Security Council, spokesman Wu said, "since dialogue alone will  be the only means of resolving the question, Security Council  president's statement containing considerate contents would  implant patience for constructive dialogue among the parties  involved and would thus make it possible to resume dialogue."    He said the summit between Presidents Kim and Jiang did not  discuss the issues of the Team Spirit and Patriot missiles.    "But, China's policy is against any acts of threatening  stability and building up tension on the Korean peninsula, such  as the staging of a military exercise and deployment of Patriot  missiles," Wu said.    Stating that President Kim's visit to China was highly  successful, the spokesman said South Korea and China will  closely cooperate in the economic and trade areas based on the  mutual understanding made through a series of meetings between  President Kim and Chinese leaders.</p>

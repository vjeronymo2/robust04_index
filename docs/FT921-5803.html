			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Civil servants' pay set to beat inflation THE PAY BILL for more than 300,000 civil servants whose salaries are linked to rises in the private sector is set to rise by more than the current rate of inflation, and possibly well above it following a government-commissioned survey of private-sector settlements. Under a formula agreed in the late 1980s, pay settlements for the 300,000 civil servants must fall within the 'interquartile range' - or middle half - of private-sector deals in the previous year. Most of the civil servants are in junior or middle grades. The survey, results of which will be confirmed today, shows that the middle 50 per cent of pay rises in the private sector in the past year were between 4.5 per cent and 8 per cent. In the year to January, the inflation rate was 4.1 per cent. That may rise by April, when the pay rise for the civil servants takes effect. But it is not expected to rise far above 4.5 per cent, the lowest level at which a deal is possible under the Civil Service 'interquartile' mechanism. Any settlement above the level of inflation would be likely to draw criticism from the private sector, which is already concerned about the effects on government spending of high pay settlements in the public sector. Earlier this month workers whose pay rises are determined by public-sector review bodies were awarded increases averaging 6.5 per cent from April. In the talks for the junior and middle-ranking civil servants there are pressures for the settlement to be well above the 4.5 per cent minimum. The survey, carried out by the Office of Manpower Economics, showed that the median rise for comparable private-sector jobs last year was 6.5 per cent. The NUCPS and CPSA Civil Service unions, which negotiate for junior and middle-ranking civil servants, will argue that 6.5 per cent is the minimum acceptable to their members. They will also seek compensation for big changes in pay bargaining demanded by the Treasury. The changes are aimed at extending performance-related pay and increasing the scope for government departments and agencies to opt out of centralised pay bargaining. Negotiations about the changes are some way from settlement. The unions are concerned about introducing performance-related pay to civil servants who have not reached the top of the pay scales for their jobs. There is also opposition to proposals which would mean that workers whose performance is judged unsatisfactory would lose annual increments. Traditionally, these have been paid each year to all civil servants on top of a general pay rise.</p>

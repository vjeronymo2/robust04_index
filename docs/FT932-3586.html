			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Azerbaijan turns to old guard MR Geidar Aliyev, former Communist party boss in Azerbaijan, was set yesterday to sweep back into power on the coat-tails of nationalist democracy's failings, writes Leyla Boulton. The protege of former Kremlin leader Leonid Brezhnev was offered the powerful post of parliamentary chairman after Mr Isa Gambarov, one of the leaders of the anti-Communist Popular Front, said he was resigning for the sake of 'civic accord'. Mr Aliyev, 70, was invited back to the capital Baku after an uprising launched by one of his supporters in Gyandzha, Azerbaijan's second largest city. The leader of the insurrection, Mr Suret Guseinov, who is holding government officials hostage, has called for the resignation of President Abulfaz Elchibey, who sacked him from his military command in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region earlier this year. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan switches fully to its own currency - the manat - tomorrow, according to a presidential decree.</p>

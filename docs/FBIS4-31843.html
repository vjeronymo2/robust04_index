			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ivica Nosic: "Tuzla Like Gorazde?"] </F>   [Text] Tuzla--Will Tuzla experience the fate suffered by  Sarajevo, Zepa, Gorazde, and certain other towns in Bosnia and  Herzegovina whose names are not unknown even to the world  public? The increasingly frequent artillery attacks of the  Bosnian Serbs on this city support such a forecast. Even the  most responsible commanders of the peacekeeping forces  responsible for the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina are no  longer denying that Tuzla could be the most likely next target  of the military strategists in Pale. And that is only a  confirmation of prior voiced reflections and pessimism of the  most prestigious military commentators at an earlier date.    There are several reasons why Tuzla is a real thorn in the  eye of Radovan Karadzic. Neglecting the fact that the  aggressor's teeth have been broken in vain on Tuzla for the last  two years and that over that same period of time the region that  goes with it did not lose the identity of the largest free  territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is well-known that all  the activities of the 2d Corps of the Army of Bosnia and  Herzegovina are directed from that city. Only the viewers,  listeners, and readers of aggressor media are still unaware of  the effectiveness with which combat is being organized and waged  not only defensively along lines from Orasje to Srebrenik,  Kladanj, and Olovo, and on the Majevica, Ozren, and other  battlefields in northeastern Bosnia, because the truth about the  defeats they have experienced is carefully concealed from them.  <H5>  Threats From Pale </H5>   The Tuzla Airport is the largest stumbling block for peace  in  Tuzla. All those to whom the "Serbian cause is dear" clearly and  loudly oppose its being opened to traffic. Saying that that  airport would be used to advance weapons, and this would be done  under the patronage of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces],  Karadzic and his ideological-military team did not even stop  short of outright threats in their "most vigorous opposition to  that intention." When the first aircraft landed at Dubrave, it  became evident that those were not merely empty words. One of  them, a Russian plane with cargo for the peacekeeping forces,  barely avoided a disaster, thanks only to the pilot's quick  thinking. Whether because of the indecisiveness of the man  giving the orders from the East River or for some other reason,  even the Blue Helmets have not shown themselves to be any more  resolute in punishing those who have been striking at their own  lives. It is no wonder, then, that the airport near Tuzla has  received a total of some 20 aircraft.    And the threats from Pale have not been withdrawn; on the  contrary, they are continuing and they are being pursued;  Dubrave is an increasingly frequent target of artillery attacks,  with and without aircraft. What is more, it is an open secret  that Tuzla is a strong logistical center for the Army of Bosnia  and Herzegovina.    Tuzla has also been the target of projectiles from Majevica  in recent days. It is felt that the rebellious Serbs are firing  on that city to take revenge for the defeats they have suffered  on that very mountain, and the still more disastrous defeats at  Konjuh and Ozren. The people of Tuzla, however, are thinking  anxiously about what lies ahead for them. An announcement has  come from the commander in chief of the Army of Bosnia and  Herzegovina, and Rasim Delic has personally confirmed this in  several public statements, that a decisive offensive against  Serbian support points is coming.  <H5>  Admiral Smith's Gloomy Forecasts </H5>   It is clear even to Adm. Smith, commander of the Southern  NATO Flank, that there are serious threats to Tuzla. "I already  have television pictures before my eyes that will show all over  the world how transport planes are burning on the Tuzla Airport  or pictures about yet another massacre like the one in  Sarajevo," the experienced military operative has written to his  superior, General Lapresle, commander in chief of UN forces in  the Balkans. The U.S. naval officer incorporated his horrible  vision into a proposal for establishment of a protected no-arms  zone that would embrace Tuzla and environs. The admiral's letter  and appeal has so far not received a response from those who  make decisions about the life and death of the Bosnian Muslims.    The recent statement of Radovan Karadzic that "the United  Nations is on the side of the Muslims more and more" is in turn  indicative. In that accusation, the leader in Pale creates an  alibi for events soon to come, which comes down to what is  already familiar: They are all against us, we have to defend  ourselves by every means. In that same context, Karadzic said  that "he has long been thinking that some hawk would push the  United States into its second Vietnam" if there is a military  involvement in Bosnia.    Life has been difficult in Tuzla for all of two years now,  but now it is still worse. Along with the chronic shortage of  food, drugs, and other essentials, the attacks have also become  more frequent. To be sure, this city has already been proclaimed  a protected zone in declarative terms in the United Nations, but  the good that does is familiar to members of the Blue Helmets,  who are mainly being put up in the Hotel Tuzla, which has holes  from several direct hits from Serbian artillery.    There is still time and opportunity for Tuzla to be assured  a  different fate from those which have been pessimistically  forecast. It is well-known who is firing on this city, why, and  from where....</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Irish poll gives little comfort to Reynolds: The Fianna Fail leader's rating has fallen 20 percentage points in two weeks THE first opinion poll of the Irish election campaign yesterday did little to boost the hopes of Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, of winning an absolute majority for his Fianna Fail party for the first time in 15 years. The poll showed voter satisfaction with the government at just 23 per cent, the personal rating of Mr Reynolds dropping 20 percentage points in two weeks to 30 per cent, and only 37 per cent of voters wanting to see Fianna Fail win with an absolute majority. The personal feud of honour between Mr Reynolds and Mr Des O'Malley the leader of the Progressive Democrats, which brought about the coalition collapse last week, has not helped the cause of either and in the public's eye precipitated an unnecessary general election on November 25. Most voters appear to believe neither leader in their differing versions of events given to a parliamentary inquiry into the beef industry, which caused the coalition split. The most popular figure of the campaign so far is Mr Dick Spring, the leader of the Labour party, who polled a 66 per cent 'satisfaction rating' against 31 per cent for Mr Reynolds, 30 per cent for Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, and 39 per cent for Mr O'Malley, according to Irish Marketing Surveys which conducted the nationwide poll. While the party leaders exchanged their first salvos of the campaign from TV and radio studios in Dublin over the weekend, it appeared that only the Labour party had got off the starting blocks in the countryside. Labour party activists could be seen canvassing Mass-goers outside churches in Mr Reynolds' own constituency of Longford. Others were out fixing freshly-printed Labour party campaign posters to lampposts along the main roads. Mr Bruton, launched his party's manifesto last Friday promising IPounds 270m in tax concessions and incentives aimed at reducing the country's record jobless figures. The proposal was immediately attacked by Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, who said that these could only be financed either through increased taxes in other areas, by reneging on public sector pay agreements in 1993, or freezing planned social welfare increases. Mr Proinsias de Rossa, the leader of the socialist Democratic Left party, dismissed Mr Bruton's proposals as 'shifting the deckchairs around on the Titanic'. Fianna Fail has been by far the slowest off the mark and will not have its manifesto ready until the middle of the week, while Mr Bruton has already set off on a two-week nationwide tour to visit every constituency in the country to sell his message. Arguably he has a harder job, as only 23 per cent of voters appear to support Fine Gael, against 47 per cent wanting Fianna Fail either to have an absolute majority or to lead a coalition. Labour polled 15 per cent, up from 9 per cent in the 1989 elections. Fianna Fail has consistently won more than 40 per cent of the vote since the 1930s. Under Ireland's single transferable vote system and multiple seat constituencies, 47 per cent could be enough to win Fianna Fail an absolute majority. In the past two elections, however, its support has fallen by election day, leaving it short of the 83 seats necessary for a majority.</p>

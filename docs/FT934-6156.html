			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Asian Moslems score gains Fundamentalist Moslems won two victories over their secular opponents in south-east Asia yesterday, underlining the growing importance of Islam in the region's politics. In Jakarta, the Indonesian government bowed to pressure from students and religious leaders and abolished a national lottery after weeks of demonstrations. Gambling is prohibited under Islam, and the lottery was criticised for the way it was managed and for attracting money from people who could ill-afford it. Ms Endang Kusuma Suweng, Indonesian social affairs minister, told a parliamentary commission that the government was reversing an earlier decision to continue the lottery, which raised money for sports and welfare projects and contributed to the government's tax revenue. Hundreds of students, confronted by riot police outside the parliament buildings, cheered the minister's announcement. In Malaysia's Kelantan State 1,400km to the north west, the state assembly unanimously passed a bill to introduce a sharia criminal code that includes stoning to death for adulterers and the amputation of limbs for thieves. The Kelantan coalition government is led by fundamentalists from the Parti Islam se-Malaysia (PAS) who oppose the federal government of Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister. Malaysian officials say that for the measures to take effect in Kelantan, PAS will have to engineer a two-thirds majority in the national parliament in Kuala Lumpur to change the constitution. A constitutional amendment is likely to be blocked by Chinese Christians and moderate Moslems but the federal government has reason to be concerned: among the state legislators who voted for the sharia bill were two representatives from Dr Mahathir's ruling National Front. 'Let the law of the state be Islamic law,' Mr Wan Najib Wan Mohamad of the National Front was quoted by the Bernama news agency. Jakarta has ruthlessly suppressed an Islamic separatist rebellion in Aceh, northern Sumatra, but both President Suharto of Indonesia and Dr Mahathir have sought to co-opt staunch Moslems by encouraging 'interest-free' Islamic banking and establishing Moslem organisations. Indonesia, with 90 per cent of its 190m inhabitants nominally Moslem, has the world's largest Moslem population. In 1991, Mr Suharto undertook a pilgrimage to Mecca and returned with an honorary first name, Mohammed.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Bitter dispute comes to a head - Licensees claim new leases are onerous 'IT WAS my dream to have my own pub. Now it's turned into a living nightmare,' said Mrs June Varty, licensee at the Gardeners Arms, at Droylsden, near Manchester. Today, Mrs Varty will join other licensees of pubs owned by Inntrepreneur Estates, the Grand Metropolitan/Courage joint venture, in picketing GrandMet's annual meeting in London. They are protesting against 'excessive rents and onerous leases' which, they claim, are forcing hundreds of Inntrepreneur landlords towards bankruptcy. GrandMet insisted yesterday that less than 100 leaseholders were involved in the protests. Long-term leases had been agreed with 4,700 of IEL's 6,850 pub licensees. Since IEL was established nearly two years ago, between 7 per cent and 8 per cent of licensees have gone out of business compared with 15 to 20 per cent a year under the old tenancy system. 'The leases, and the rental, which takes into account turnover, the pub location and other factors such as the likely cost of repairs, are freely negotiated,' the company said. But Mrs Varty added that a show of hands at a meeting of 110 Inntrepreneur leaseholders in north-west England earlier this month showed that many of them had been visited by bailiffs. 'I have had three visits,' said Mrs Varty, 53, 'but I am not going without a fight.' 'Inntrepreneur want Pounds 1,500 a week from me in rent and arrears but my weekly takings are only Pounds 1,000.' Mrs Trisha Boyce, who runs the Britannia Inn, at Alcombe in Somerset, founded the National Association of Inntrepreneur Lessees (Nail) five months ago to contest, including through court action, the terms of the company's leases. She said the lessees would ask the courts, and if necessary the European Court, to declare the leases null and void. Mrs Boyce acquired her lease for Pounds 52,000 in 1991. Her annual rent is Pounds 18,500 - four years earlier when the pub was owned by Ushers, the rent was Pounds 4,250 a year,' she said. Charges, such as insurance, and the cost of repairs to the 300-year-old pub, added to the burden. 'Trade is hit by recession and growth will always be limited. This is a village pub without a car park.' On legal advice, she told GrandMet last year that she did not want to be freed from tied beer supplies. 'If I wasn't freed, they could not increase my rent.' Mr Martin Moore, licensee of The Bridge, at Uckfield, East Sussex, signed the 20-year lease for his pub in 1991. The rent was Pounds 18,000 a year. 'I knew that would be tough to find in a recession,' he said. 'But I spent my Pounds 35,000 savings in refurbishing . . . and I managed to keep my head just above water.' Last October, when the pub was freed, under the government's beer orders, from its beer supply tie with Courage, the rent was increased to Pounds 29,100 a year. 'Courage offered me discounts of Pounds 3,000 a year to continue supplying my beer - but there is no way now that the business can be viable, and the lease is unsaleable.' He added: 'At the start of these leases two to three years ago, the annual rent would be 5 to 7 per cent of the freehold value. Today, it is 18 to 25 per cent.' His only recourse to the rent increases, he said, was 'to attempt to assign an unsaleable lease or slide inexorably into bankruptcy'. 'To afford this lease, I would need to make the pub perform better than it ever did in the boom years, let alone during the deepest recession the trade has ever encountered. In the present economic climate, the sensible action would be to reduce the rent to a level the business can afford.' GrandMet said yesterday 'the leases are popular' and the rents were freely negotiated with the licensees having recourse to arbitration. 'Every single rental agreement made by Inntrepreneur has been agreed through negotiation by both parties. The only exceptions have been in cases where leases have been assigned by the original leaseholder.' The company added that sitting tenants had 'a pretty good idea' of a pub's performance. New entrants could take independent advice about trading prospects.</p>

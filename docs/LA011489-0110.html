			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHOLESALE PRICES CLIMB 4% IN 1988, THE HIGHEST ANNUAL RATE OF INFLATION IN 8  YEARS  </P> <P> Wholesale prices rose by 0.4% in December as inflation at the wholesale level  hit 4% for 1988, the highest annual pace in eight years, the Labor Department  reported Friday.  </P> <P> The government report showed wholesale prices ending the year on an  accelerating trend. The broad range of increases in goods, while not unexpected  by the financial markets, was greeted as an ominous sign by experts fearful of  a resurgence of inflation.  </P> <P> "Pressure is clearly growing," said Bruce Steinberg of the Merrill Lynch  investment firm in New York. "You can still see signs of more increases in  basic metal prices and industrial materials and not much sign of moderation.  There's plenty more reason here for the Fed to be concerned."  </P> <P> Economists believe that the Federal Reserve soon may be prompted to push up  interest rates to curb an inflationary spiral and keep the economy from  overheating.  </P> <P> Food prices were virtually unchanged for the fourth month in a row, while  energy prices, normally volatile, increased only slightly. But prices for most  other finished goods were on an upward march and prices for all items other  than food and energy in December advanced by a relatively steep 0.6%.  </P> <P> "If the core rate, without food and energy, is up to 0.6% in a month, that's  worrying," said Steinberg.  </P> <P> The pattern of increases for the year as a whole was similar to December's.  Excluding food and energy, wholesale price inflation in 1988 was 4.3%, while  all intermediate goods -- such as industrial materials and partly finished  components of consumer goods, leaped ahead 5.8%.  </P> <P> All these yearly statistics point to higher inflation in 1989 at both the  wholesale level and the consumer price level, which in turn could force an  upward ratchet on wages as well. The 4% increase in wholesale prices was the  biggest December-to-December jump since a much steeper 7.1% increase in 1981,  when the high inflation of the 1970s was still dominant.  </P> <P> Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Assn. of Wholesaler-Distributors,  found little cause for optimism in the December statistics.  </P> <P> He hailed as "good news" the relative stability in food and energy prices. But,  in a statement, he warned that the soaring prices of commodities and industrial  materials "should exert inflationary pressure on the index as these goods work  their way to the consumer in the months ahead."  </P> <P> Prices of crude goods, while up only 2.8% for the year, jumped 3.5% in December  after a 3.1% decline in November. Copper and aluminum scrap jumped a steep 5.6%  and 2.2% respectively in December, and both advanced just over 20% for the  year. In addition, industrial materials fabricated from those crude commodities  moved upward in similarly large steps.  </P> <P> "I imagine there are some furrowed brows at the Fed regarding these numbers,"  Van Dongen said. "They point to a need to carefully monitor demand in the  economy."  </P> <P> Economists said, however, that concern should not yet turn into panic.  </P> <P> Stacy Kottman of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University,  which tracks price movements, said that there is still no sign of 1970s-style  inflation on the horizon. He said aluminum, copper and industrial chemicals  prices should level off, allowing wholesale prices to rise to perhaps 4.5% in  1989, but not much higher.  </P> <P> Similarly, David Wyss of Data Resources, Inc., in Lexington, Mass., said that  he expects the economy to slow by spring, further moderating inflation. He,  too, projected 4.5% wholesale inflation this year and consumer price inflation  at about 5%.  </P> <P> Experts agreed that energy prices probably will move upward only gradually,  though demand in the United States is beginning to accelerate faster than  industrial output.  </P> <P> The December increase in wholesale prices left the producer price index for  finished goods at 110.0, an increase of 0.3 point over the previous month. In  other words, a hypothetical cross-section of goods costing $100 in 1982 would  have cost $110 last month, 30 cents more than in November.  </P> <P> In a separate economic report Friday, the Commerce Department said that retail  sales grew by a strong 6.7% in 1988, the biggest rate of increase in four  years, in a brisk recovery from the temporary buyers' slowdown that followed  the 1987 stock market crash.  </P></p>

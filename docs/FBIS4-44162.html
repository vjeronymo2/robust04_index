			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Jerry Van Waterschoot commentary: "Arbitrary Markets"] </F>   [Text] Next month, it will be 50 years since the  foundations were laid for the postwar international monetary  system at the American coastal town of Bretton Woods, yet  monetary stability is further away than ever. The dollar is  defying the law of gravity, and foreign exchange markets, bond  markets, and stock exchanges are alight.    Not much remains of the fixed parities which, for decades,  ensured law and order in international economic relations.  Exchange rate fluctuations, which earlier would have been  called a devaluation or revaluation, now happen in the space of  a few hours. Since last year, even the European Monetary System  -- the last beacon in the monetary chaos -- is heading toward  fluctuation bands which remind one more of floating exchange  rates than fixed parities.    Leaving the setting of national currencies up to the free  market has given individual countries much more room for  maneuver than they used to have under Bretton Woods.  Unorchestrated leaps in economic policy are no longer held back  by fixed parities; instead they are reflected in wild currency  fluctuations.    At the same time, the financial markets are leading their  own  lives. The reserves held by the central banks are just small  change in comparison with the enormous amounts of capital  shifted every day. Markets for currencies, raw materials,  bonds, and shares influence each other's trends. New,  sophisticated financial instruments cut across existing  patterns. Markets are breaking away from the underlying  economic fundamentals, and are increasingly letting themselves  be driven by expectations of expectations [as published].    The nervousness has increased even more since the recent  turnaround in the economy, a move which is now well established  in the United States, while Europe and Japan are still only just  recovering from the recession. This situation has caused more  distortion than before. In Europe, long-term interest rates are  shooting upward too, although this is not justified by low  growth and inflation. The dollar is sinking, while according to  all the guidebooks and forecasts its should be rising. What  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says or does -- whether  he increases interest rates or waits a while instead -- will  still cause uneasy shivers in the markets. Greenspan has lost  his grip on the greenback.    With all these complications, the markets are forgetting  that  the underlying causes are actually very positive. The American  economy, which not long ago seemed doomed to eternal recession,  is reaching for the stars. Yet, there are no concrete signs of  an inflation backlash.    Do these arbitrary market reactions necessarily mean that we  are heading for a financial crisis? That is what it is called,  after all. The market always finds its balance. It may cause  problems, but it is always the beginning of something new. The  stock market crash of 1987 was also originally called a crisis.  Subsequently, it looked like a correction to an exaggerated  movement, and had no impact on the real economy.    If people want to avoid such corrections, then an ounce of  prevention is worth a pound of cure. A little more coordination  between the industrialized countries in their underlying  economic policy concerning the balance of payments, government  budget, income development, growth, or combatting inflation  would help a lot.</p>

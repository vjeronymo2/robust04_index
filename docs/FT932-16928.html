			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Fairhaven to raise Pounds 24m via 40% flotation of OGC FAIRHAVEN International, the specialist oil contractor, yesterday announced plans to raise more than Pounds 24m by floating off part of its rapidly growing Aberdeen-based offshore business. The company said it planned to invest part of the proceeds of the sale of 40 per cent of OGC International in its US onshore construction business. The US business would then be able to pay off its Dollars 10m (Pounds 7m) debt owed to OGC, leaving Fairhaven with a cash rich balance sheet. Although Mr James Davidson, chairman of Fairhaven, was unable to say exactly how much would be raised, it was expected that OGC would have a market capitalisation in excess of Fairhaven's own Pounds 60m. The company, valued in Fairhaven's books at about Dollars 34m, would seek a listing in May. The decision to float off part of OGC, which reported profits of Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 7.2m) on sales of Pounds 226.5m (Pounds 110m) for the year to December 31, was based on the mature and international nature of the business, Mr Davidson said. There were also strong advance corporation tax reasons for floating OGC. As Fairhaven is a Bermuda-registered company, Mr Davidson said, the dividends were subject to double taxation - once paid by the company and again by UK investors. Mr Davidson denied that Fairhaven was floating off the most profitable part of the business. The US operation would benefit from further investment. 'What interests us greatly are the prospects in natural gas,' he said. He did not expect profits to be depressed by this move. Eventually, Fairhaven might float off part of the US operation and invest in something else. 'In a way, Fairhaven is becoming an investment vehicle,' Mr Davidson said. The announcement was made as Fairhaven reported a sharp jump in pre-tax profits from Dollars 14.1m to Dollars 18.1m for the year to December 31 on sales ahead 70 per cent to Dollars 524.4m. The rise in profits was fuelled by strong orders in the North Sea and were struck after charging Dollars 2.8m for the costs of a dispute over defective print materials involving the company's 3D camera investment. Although a court had ruled in favour of Fairhaven, the process had gone to appeal. Mr Davidson said he decided to write off the costs, without including the potential award. The dividend is doubled to 0.8 cents, while earnings advanced from 4.01 cents to 4.39 cents.</p>

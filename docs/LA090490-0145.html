			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> NOW COMES GORBACHEV, THE PLAY  </P> <P> Mikhail Gorbachev has been a lead player on the stage of history for years, so  maybe it's appropriate that he will soon be portrayed on a real stage.  </P> <P> "Moscow Gold," opening in London later this month, will bring to theater  audiences an array of Communist giants, from Lenin to the present-day Soviet  president, to be played by David Calder.  </P> <P> The play was written by London playwrights Howard Brenton and Tariq Ali, who  were responsible for last year's "Iranian Nights," about the plight of author  Salman Rushdie under Muslim death threats.  </P> <P> Calder says the play treats Gorbachev as someone on whom "the fickle finger of  historical fate suddenly lands, rather than a man of ambition desperate to get  into the old Lenin seat."  </P> <P> "Moscow Gold" opens Sept. 26 at the Royal Shakespeare Company's Barbican  Theater. It runs through Nov. 3.  </P></p>

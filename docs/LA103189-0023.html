			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STILL A HARD LINE IN EAST GERMANY  </P> <P> East German officials invited people to speak their minds this week, and scores  who did so at the East Berlin City Hall responded with a jolting five hours of  indignation, abuse and demands for political change. The public forum, one of a  number in different cities, was meant to be a controlled alternative to the  demonstrations that have swept the country in recent weeks. Authorities,  however, could hardly have anticipated how intense an outpouring of scorn and  bitterness they would be subjected to. Sunday's rally, and Monday's mass  protests in Leipzig and other cities, leave no doubt that East Germany has  become a land of seething discontent.  </P> <P> What will it all lead to? Beyond some safety-valve measures already promised by  Egon Krenz, the new head of the Communist Party, it's hard to discern any signs  of impending major change. Travel restrictions, including those imposed after  the mass flight to the West by East German travelers to Hungary and  Czechoslovakia, are to be eased. The party is prepared to engage in more  "dialogues" with non-party groups and individuals. And that for now is pretty  much it. At Sunday's meeting, Gunter Schabowski, East Berlin's Communist Party  boss, drew an unambiguous line. "The leading role of the party will remain," he  pledged, and on that there will be no discussion.  </P> <P> The party will not, in short, accept the course of reform forced upon its  sister parties in Poland and Hungary. It intends to try to stand firm against  the historic tide of change that is washing over the Soviet Union and other  East European countries.  </P> <P> The risks of sticking to such a course, if they aren't already apparent, are  likely to be explained in detail to Krenz when he sees Soviet leader Mikhail S.  Gorbachev this week in Moscow. Gorbachev has been advising more liberal  policies in East Germany, and has become something of a popular hero there as a  result. It would be surprising against this background if Krenz's trip didn't  raise expectations among his countrymen of better times to come.  </P> <P> The real surprise would be if those expections were realized to any significant  degree, given the party's seemingly implacable determination to maintain its  monopoly on power, no matter what it hears from the people it claims to  represent.  </P></p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Sharif worried over relations with India MR Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani prime minister, yesterday expressed concern about deteriorating relations with India following an upsurge in Hindu-Moslem violence prompted by the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque. 'This tension is not good for either country,' he said in an interview with the Financial Times. India has cut Pakistan's consular staff to retaliate for a similar reduction in India's diplomatic presence in Karachi, in the latest row between the two long-term rivals. Mr Sharif was speaking in the wake of a sharp upsurge in violence in Kashmir, where Indian security forces are battling against Moslem insurgents, and in Bombay, where Moslems and Hindus are fighting in incidents provoked by the sacking of the mosque in Ayodhya, northern India, by militant Hindus. Mr Sharif denied Indian charges that Pakistan was helping Moslem Kashmiri insurgents with money, arms and training. He also dismissed a warning from the US that, if Pakistan persisted with such aid, it risked being branded as a terrorist nation and put on a blacklist consisting of Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya and Syria. Mr Sharif said Islamabad was explaining to Washington that Pakistan was not involved in Kashmir. The prime minister said Pakistan's help was limited to moral and diplomatic support. He added that Pakistan was also concerned about 'the sufferings of India's Moslems' following the Ayodhya incident but there would be no interference in India's internal affairs.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksey Portanskiy report: "Italians Will Have To Be </F> Persuaded To Grant Debt Deferment"]    [Text] The Russian Government has sent a letter to members  of the Paris Club of creditor countries agreeing to hold a  meeting in Paris 3 June on the question of extending the  deadlines for payments of the former Union's debts due in 1994.  This was reported Tuesday [24 May] by Russian Government Vice  Premier A. Shokhin.    Let me remind you that at the beginning of April last year  we  concluded the first agreement with the Paris Club on  restructuring the former USSR's debts, which gave the country an  important financial breathing space. But that agreement applied  only to payments due in 1993 and it has already formally  expired. However, Moscow agreed with its creditors that it  would remain in force until there is a new agreement.    Originally $4.7 billion was allocated to service the debt  this year, which represents only a fraction of the total sum due  for payment in 1994. In cutting all state expenditure, the  State Duma has reduced this figure to $4.1 billion. But even  this may not be final -- the Italians' position could cause  adjustments to be made.    The point is that in the last years of the USSR's existence  Moscow clearly accumulated an excessive amount of loans, a fair  number of them from Italy. Hard bargaining over this has been  going on with the Italians for many months now: We say that  these debts are Soviet but they insist that they are Russian.  Accordingly, if we get our way, the matter in dispute -- the  round sum in foreign currency -- will be subject to  restructuring along with the rest of the Union's debts, or to  put it simply -- we will pay later. But if Rome comes out on  top we will have to pay now. Here everyone realizes that Moscow  is trying to maintain Russia's creditworthy image by not  accumulating purely Russian debts.    The Italians have enlisted the support of Paris Club members  in its claims. But our resources are limited in any case.  Hoping that our creditors are sufficiently well aware of this,  we are saying that we are prepared to pay Italy but in that case  there is unlikely to be anything left to pay other creditors.</p>

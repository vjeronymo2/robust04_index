			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PUPPIES GET PUT THROUGH THEIR PACES  </P> <P> On Sunday, a dog day of its own, about 40 young canines, their tongues  sometimes lolling, took part in guide dog trials on a grassy lawn in Sylmar.  The Labrador, German shepherd and golden retriever puppies, adopted and trained  by volunteers for 15 to 18 months, were being returned to International Guiding  Eyes Inc., a nonprofit organization for the blind, for further instruction. But  first, they showed off their prowess by running an obstacle course filled with  such distractions as a hot dog, a live burro and a ceramic dog.  </P></p>

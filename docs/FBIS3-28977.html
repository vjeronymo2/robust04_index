Chuan said Thailand had the freedom to allow any visitor  into  the country. He reaffirmed the government's adherence to a  "one-China" policy, but said Li had a right to make a private  trip to Thailand.    " We should show principles in conducting our (foreign)  policy. We have the absolute freedom to do so," he said.  "Otherwise the Dalai Lama could not have visited Thailand."  [passage omitted]    The Chinese ambassador to Thailand, Jin Guihua, on Monday  delivered a protest note to the Foreign Ministry, warning  Thailand not to approve Li's visit. [passage omitted]    The premier said previous exchange trips between Taiwanese  and Thai officials and frequent trips by the private sector in  the past were normal for countries with economic relations.

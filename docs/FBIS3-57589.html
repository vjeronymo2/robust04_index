			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jan 26, BNS -- MP Andrius Kubilius, member  of the parliament's rightist opposition, said it would hard to  support an intiative of the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party  [LSDP] to take a no confidence vote in the Lithuanian government.    Kubilius said the LSDP statement, urging other political  forces to back their initiative, lacks forecasts. "It is not  hard to collect 28 votes that are necessary to start the no  confidence process, but 71 votes are needed to express no  confidence." This means that the no confidence vote would have  to be supported by some members of the ruling majority, the  lawmaker said.    Kubilius did not deny reports, however, that several members  of the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party would back to  move in secret voting. In his opinion, the rightist opposition,  the social democrats and those several members of the LDLP may  become "a new parliamentary majority, which will be able to form  a new government."    The lawmaker said the social democrats do not forecast  possible steps of the president -- will he make the government  resign or will he dissolve the parliament.    Kubilius said he has serious doubts about the indicated  motives of the initiative. "I think that the accusations against  the present government should be much more serious than  non-fulfillment of the LSDP's instructions."</p>

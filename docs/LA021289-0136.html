			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NOT A GOD-GIVEN RIGHT  </P> <P> Sheriff's Deputy Lonny G. Brewer was killed by a semiautomatic assault rifle,  and Deputies James Bennetts and Alfred MacKrille were wounded by them. All  three cases took place in North County in the past 18 months.  </P> <P> In the city of San Diego, with its growing problem of gang and drug-dealing  violence, the statistics are even more stark. Seven people were killed in the  city with assault weapons in the past year.  </P> <P> Violence committed with semiautomatic assault rifles is proliferating in San  Diego County.  </P> <P> While the Legislature debates whether to ban their sale -- an action long  overdue -- local officials should take the initiative and prohibit their sale  and possession, as was done recently in the cities of Compton, Los Angeles and  Stockton.  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council will consider such an ordinance this week. We hope  the council will act swiftly and not be swayed by pressure from the National  Rifle Assn.  </P> <P> We would also urge the County Board of Supervisors and the councils of the  other cities to follow suit.  </P> <P> Besides making it a little more difficult to obtain these senseless weapons,  the ordinances would also send a signal to the Legislature and to Congress that  the majority of people do not buy the preposterous idea that there is a  God-given right to own military assault weapons.  </P></p>

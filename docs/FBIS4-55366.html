			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague May 13 (CTK) -- Premier Vaclav Klaus claims  he was misrepresented when he commented about the success of the  Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) in the first round of elections  on Czech Radio on May 10, he says in an interview in the  independent newspaper LIDOVE NOVINY today.    Recalling Klaus's comment that the Czech Republic was  becoming a "little non-leftist island in the centre of Europe",  the LIDOVE NOVINY interviewer asks the premier to explain why  the Hungarian Socialists have what is considered to be a very  similar economic policy to the Czech Government.    Klaus responds by saying that his statements on the  Hungarian  election results had been "very balanced", and that the "cheap  joke" about the island came at the very end and was taken out of  context.    He emphasises he did not simplify the election results in  Hungary and Poland -- where the left also recently returned to  power -- and it would never have occurred to him to regard them  as constituting the "return of the communists." He said he  never had doubts that the left-wing parties in question could  not conduct a "more or less balanced and reasonable economic  policy."    Klaus adds that his participation in a panel discussion with  MSZP chairman Gyula Horn at the World European Forum last year  revealed a profound difference in their views. Horn's arguments  reminded him, he says, of the debates about economic reform in  Czechoslovakia in 1990-91 with opponents of his economic  strategy. It would be mistaken to conceal those differences.    Nonetheless Hungary remains a "very close partner in all  areas." He is convinced the Czech Republic will be able to  cooperate just as effectively as with the previous government  and says he believes the thorny issue of minorities, which  always worried him about the former government, might now recede  into the background.</p>

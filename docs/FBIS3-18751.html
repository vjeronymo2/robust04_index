In a  report to the UN Security Council, a summary of which REUTER  news agency reported this morning, Butrus-Ghali also notes that  the proximity talks can not drag on for long. An agreement in  Cyprus, he adds, would represent the most significant  development on the island in two decades and would create a new  and more positive prospect for the future. However, the  secretary general warns, the consequences of a failure would  certainly be very negative. In his report, Butrus-Ghali  describes as positive the fact that President Glavkos Kliridhis  and [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas accepted the package  of confidence-building measures in principle, and that they have  begun intensive negotiations in Nicosia with his representatives  on the basis of agreed arrangements to work out ways to  implement the package. Finally, in his report, Butrus-Ghali  notes that with the show of the necessary goodwill, leaders of  the two communities will be able to bring the proximity talks to  a positive conclusion within a few weeks.</p>

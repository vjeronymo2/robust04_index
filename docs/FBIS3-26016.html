			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Shanghai WEN HUI BAO in Chinese on 22  January carries a 4,000-character article by Lieutenant General  Shi Zhiqing, political commissar of the Air Force of the Nanjing  Military Region, entitled: "Being Too Slow in Development Cannot  Be Called Socialism" on page 7 of the paper's special column on  seriously studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping.    The article cited Deng Xiaoing's remarks made in October  1987  saying "poorness is not socialism, and being too slow in  development is also not socialism," Deng Xiaoing's talks during  his southern inspection tour, and Deng Xiaoping's remarks saying  "whether China can resist the pressure of hegemonism and power  politics and firmly adhere to our socialist system, the key lies  in whether we can gain a relatively fast speed in growth and  realize our development strategy or not." The article cites  rapid economic growth during period from 1984 to 1988, in which  the average annual growth of industrial output was 21.7 percent.  The article says the speed stressed by Deng Xiaoping is  different from the speed stressed during the "Great Leap  Forward" in 1958. It says Deng Xiaoping has drawn a bitter  lesson from the "Great Leap Forward" and attached importance to  quality and efficiency in seeking development speed. Deng  Xiaoping has always linked accelerating development with  deepening reform and further opening up and called for turning  science and technology into productive forces. In conclusion,  the article says such speed as advocated by Deng Xiaoping is a  genuine and sustained speed which can promote China's economic  development amid widespread recession in the world.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Jia Fenyong (6328 1164 0516)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 25 May (XINHUA) -- The National Work  Conference on Educating and Training Court Cadres opened today  in Beijing. Ren Jianxin, member of the CPC Central Committee  Secretariat and president of the Supreme People's Court, spoke  at the meeting, stressing the need to step up efforts to raise  court cadres' academic levels and to train a number of  professional judges.    Ren Jianxin said that since the Third Plenary Session of the  11th CPC Central Committee and with the development of reform,  opening up, and of the building of the socialist legal system,  courts have made great progress in strengthening the rank of  court cadres and achieved marked results in educating and  training court cadres. Work on multi-level education and  training of court cadres was comprehensively carried out  particularly since the establishment of the Sparetime Law  University for the nation's court cadres in 1985, of the China  Senior Judge Training Center, and of provincial-level judge  training centers in 1988. Now China has basically realized the  goal of raising court cadres' professional levels to the college  law department level or higher, of having trained more than 600  holders of master's degrees in law and over 1,000 senior judges  and reserve forces for senior judges, and sent a number of court  cadres to make further studies abroad. The decade-long efforts  of educating and training court cadres have greatly changed the  phenomenon of low educational and professional levels among  court cadres due to historical reasons and helped courts raise  the quality of and efficiency in handling cases.    Ren Jianxin said the gradual establishment of a socialist  market economic system and of a legal system that is adapted to  the socialist market economic system have markedly increased  courts' roles and responsibilities. This sets greater demands  on court cadres. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a  sound and regularized judge training system and to train judges  in a planned and systematic manner. It is also necessary to  establish a state institute for judges. Provinces, autonomous  regions, and municipalities should step up establishing  institutes for judges in their localities. Only through this  way can we meet the requirements for and improve China's  modernized judge system.    Vice President of the Supreme People's Court Zhu Mingshan  said at the meeting that courts will provide a complete pre-post  training for their 42,000 new members in the next several years,  will sponsor special seminars on new laws in a timely manner,  and will regularly hold training classes for judges, so as to  constantly raise court cadres' quality and academic levels.    The current national work conference on educating and  training court cadres was the second meeting following the first  meeting, which was held in 1990. Some 100 leaders from all of  the nation's levels of courts and from relevant departments  attended the meeting.</p>

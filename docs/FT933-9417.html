			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / International Company News: Barlow Rand to split into four parts BARLOW Rand, South Africa's largest industrial company, has announced details of a corporate restructuring which will see the group broken up into four separate parts. The announcement comes a week after Gencor, the country's second-largest mining house, announced details of plans to break up the group. It is not, however, expected to herald an unbundling trend among the country's big groups. Anglo American and Rembrandt, two of the largest conglomerates, have both said they have no such plans. Although there are political pressures, notably from the ANC, for the big groups to unbundle, there is no indication that this was a factor in Barlow's decision. Key points in the plan are: The rump of Barlow will include a 79 per cent holding in J Bibby &amp; Sons, the group's offshore arm, a 60 per cent holding in Pretoria Portland Cement, and wholly-owned businesses ranging from domestic appliances to capital equipment; CG Smith, which will have a consumer focus, and include the group's food, pharmaceutical, packaging, and textiles interests; Reunert, which will focus on electronics and information technology; Rand Mines, whose main asset is a 71 per cent stake in Randcoal, one of the country's main coal houses, and Rand Mines Properties (RMP). Existing Barlow shareholders will receive separate shares in CG Smith, Reunert, Rand Mines and RMP. To repay debt and build up funds after its reconstitution, Barlow will raise R607m (Dollars 180m) by selling 7.5 per cent of the share capital of CG Smith, Reunert, Rand Mines and RMP shares, to Old Mutual, its largest shareholder. A detailed announcement will be made by September 30 and the implementation of the proposals should be completed by the end of February 1994.</p>

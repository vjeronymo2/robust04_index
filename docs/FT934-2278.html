			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Donors seek to weigh priorities Richer governments responsible for most of the flow of official aid to poorer countries yesterday unveiled a formula to balance needs of the third world with newer aid demands from eastern Europe, writes David Buchan in Paris. The Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said it was putting eight of the poorest republics of the former Soviet Union on its list of countries receiving 'official development assistance'. Such aid would count towards the pledge of OECD governments to try to raise their aid budgets to 0.7 per cent of national output. Donors yesterday promised Zimbabwe enough official aid to bridge its 1994 financing gap of some Dollars 789m, but urged Harare to continue liberalising, cut public spending and foster investment.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Budget cuts to hit rail services, BR chief says Train services will have to be reduced when timetables are revised next May as a result of the Pounds 300m cut in railway finances announced in the Budget, Mr John Welsby, British Rail chief executive, said yesterday. Rail travellers are already faced with fare increases at least twice the level of inflation from early next year. Mr Welsby told the Central Rail Users' Consultative Committee, a rail watchdog, that these had been announced at a time when the punctuality and reliability of the railway had still to recover from the signalmen's strike. If British Rail is called on to absorb a large part of the spending cuts, substantial reductions in services may be necessary. But if Railtrack, European Passenger Services and the other companies supplying rail services take a large share, the basic BR timetable can be spared. Mr Welsby said: 'At the moment I am hopeful we may not have to engage in major service reductions. There will be some. Of that I have no doubt. But I hope we can stay clear of major and draconian reductions.' British Rail had been expecting to receive government funding of Pounds 1.3bn next year but its external financing limit was cut to Pounds 975m in the Budget, he added. The government had allowed BR an extra Pounds 200m to take account of the cost of the strike and the delayed start to Eurostar train services through the Channel tunnel, but that was compensation for lost revenues and not additional money. In addition BR expects to lose Pounds 70m to Pounds 80m of revenues next year as a result of the decline in coal shipments as the power generating industry has switched to gas. The move towards the privatisation of the railway network caused difficulties for rail travellers seeking information, Mr Welsby said. Train operators were no longer providing information about rival companies' services in every case. He said: 'We have got a problem in controlling this. In the new world, train operators are not willing to tell people what their competitors are doing. We have to find a private company to give dispassionate information about the network.'</p>

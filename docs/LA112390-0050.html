			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILDREN, LIKE ADULTS, ARE SUFFERING BURNOUT;  </P> <P> HEALTH: EXPECTATIONS, IMAGES OF PERFECTION, FEARS AND GUILT CAN BRING CHILDREN  TO THE EDGE OF OVERLOAD.  </P> <P> The terrible toos afflict children of all ages.  </P> <P> Too many expectations.  </P> <P> Too many media images of perfection.  </P> <P> Too many fears.  </P> <P> Too much guilt brought on by too many "shoulds."  </P> <P> These "toos" douse the energy and enthusiasm of too many fired-up kids.  </P> <P> And they ignite another terrible too: too much burnout, a malady that has  affected parents for some time and has now spread to their children, some as  young as 7 or 8.  </P> <P> According to Joseph Procaccini, associate professor of education at Loyola  College in Baltimore and the author of two parenting books, "20 to 30% of kids  experience some kind of burnout." Procaccini, who has for at least a decade  focused on parent burnout -- the subject of one of his books -- is expanding  his interest to the other side of the family.  </P> <P> Child burnout may be relatively minor and fleeting, marked by a temporary lack  of interest in school or occasional temper tantrums. Or it may persist until a  child feels trapped and begins dropping out -- socially, mentally, even  physically -- from school or home.  </P> <P> Burnout happens when the demands on a child outweigh his energy, Procaccini  says. There is, however, a delicate balance to work with. Imposing demands on  children is not wrong; it is, in fact, a good way to motivate them, he says.  When energy and demand are equal, a person is performing at his peak; when  those demands get out of hand, burnout threatens.  </P> <P> "Unrealistic expectations are the real culprit" in burnout, he says. These  expectations can come from within a person, from parents and teachers, from  peers and from the media.  </P> <P> Procaccini lays a good part of the blame on parents. "I think most parents  overestimate their kids' abilities. Many parents will not accept anything but  an A," he observes. "There's a whole group of parents out there . . . just  waiting to get kids into programs" -- soccer teams, computer camps, language  clubs or tot gym classes.  </P> <P> Children bombarded with unrealistic demands and expectations begin to believe  that their parents' love is based on their achievements, that it depends on how  well they do some thing or many things, Procaccini says.  </P> <P> "A burned-out kid is an angry kid," says Procaccini. "To burn out you have to  be on fire." That fire is fueled by frustration over the conflict between what  a youngster assumes "should be" and what he knows "is."  </P> <P> Here Procaccini sees television as a big contributor. It is not the programs  that affect youngsters as much as the advertising that prompts them to "try to  become something that's impossible to become," he says. Anyone 20 and younger  has grown up with "constant images of perfection" that lead to "an awful lot of  anger."  </P> <P> A burned-out child will also feel guilt, which Procaccini describes as anger  turned inward, over the disparity between "should" and "is."  </P> <P> This anger eats away at a child's energy, he says, imbalancing even further the  energy-demand scale.  </P> <P> A child's unrealized expectations combine with the stresses that are inherent  in both childhood and family life. "Stress is caused by change. Change is  constant. Bodies change, lives change, people change," says Procaccini. "Every  day in our lives, families are changing."  </P> <P> With 40% of all American families breaking apart, many children have more than  their normal share of change, he adds. Even children from intact families have  "a sense of impending loss," because they know so many children from broken  families.  </P> <P> These natural, and human-derived, stresses add to the possibility of burnout  among children.  </P> <P> The signs of it are several, says Procaccini:  </P> <P> * Fatigue. A child may become "abnormally sluggish" physically and mentally  lethargic.  </P> <P> * Irritability. Temper tantrums may become frequent or more intense than usual.  </P> <P> * Mental exhaustion. This is often characterized by forgetfulness, especially  of well-known facts.  </P> <P> * Paranoia and disassociation. These mark the "serious stage" of burnout, when  a child is feeling trapped and may be questioning his values, talking about  dropping out of school or society, and even threatening suicide.  </P> <P> He cautions parents to "factor out normal types of behavior" for their child  before determining burnout. But, if a parent detects a trapped feeling or  paranoia, "your child probably needs counseling," he says.  </P> <P> What can a parent do to prevent burnout?  </P> <P> Parents need to show, Procaccini suggests, that their love is unconditional,  that nothing a child does or fails to do will diminish that love and that  children do not have the power to make or break their parents emotionally by  their actions or achievements.  </P> <P> Parents can also foster a tolerance for ambiguity, so children learn that life  does not work like a math formula: That just because they play -- and play hard  -- they don't necessarily win. "We're not letting them know that in some areas  you can be fourth or fifth," he says.  </P> <P> Even the best hitters in baseball "fail twice for each hit. The game of life is  the same way."  </P> <P> "The only way to survive in the '90s, as adults, is to trade off," he says. For  example, if a woman gets an A-plus this week as a mother, she may get only a C  in her workplace. She can't get an A-plus in all facets of her life  simultaneously, he explains. Nor can her children.  </P> <P> Parents can give their children responsibility for their own happiness by  teaching them they can control their feelings rather than being tossed about by  others' actions and opinions. "Teach children to establish their own criteria  by which to judge themselves."  </P> <P> Parents must also listen, he says. "Kids have reached the conclusion that their  parents don't really know them," Procaccini says. And rather than telling their  parents who they are, such youngsters suffer silently because they are not the  children of their parents' imaginations. Hence, "a lot of kids are very lonely  today," says Procaccini.  </P></p>

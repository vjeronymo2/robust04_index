Samonte] </F>   [Text] Portfolio investments infused into the country by  non- residents last year went up 298 percent to $2.257 billion  from the previous year's $566 million.    Latest Bangko Sentral [Central Bank] figures furnished  BUSINESS WORLD also indicate an uptrend in new foreign equity  infusions last year, which can be attributed primarily to the  improving investment climate. Fresh foreign equity infusions  into the country in 1993 climbed 42.7 percent to $334 million,  from the previous year's level of $234 million.    Almost half of the new foreign investments, or $43 million,  financed projects undertaken via the build-operate-transfer  (BOT) scheme, the figures showed.    Although a positive trend in foreign direct inflows was  noted, the Philippines continued to pale against some Southeast  Asian countries.    Based on World Bank figures contained in a 1994 report on  financial flows to Asian countries, the Philippines barely  accounted for a tenth of net foreign direct investment flows to  Indonesia in 1992.    Save for Thailand, which experienced a slight investment  drop  in 1991 but had since posted positive strides, China, Indonesia,  and Malaysia reported steady investment inflows since 1986.    In 1992, foreign investments in China stood at $11.156  billion; Indonesia, $1.774 billion; Malaysia, $4.117 billion;  Thailand, $2.115 billion; and the Philippines $228 million.    The advocacy group Freedom from Debt Coalition (FDC) said  foreign direct investments -- and not the net transfers in  external debt -- are a better indicator of structural  improvements in the country.    "Recent researches in international trends suggest the flow  of foreign direct investments have increasingly been responsive  to structural factors such as the availability of an educated  and highly skilled work force, market size, quality of  infrastructure, and level of industrialization," it said.    Arguing against what Finance Undersecretary Romeo L.  Bernardo  earlier heralded as a success in government's efforts to  maintain the positive trend in the country's external debt  situation, the FDC said the positive net transfers posted by the  economy last year was mainly traced to the debt service  reduction package under the Brady deal and the low interest  rates then prevailing in the global markets.    "The trend can turn out to be the reverse because no  commensurate increase in direct foreign investments is apparent.  It is also not clear how this flow of capital can be sustained  in the medium-term, given that it is initially only a result of  the recession in the United States and elsewhere," the FDC said.</p>

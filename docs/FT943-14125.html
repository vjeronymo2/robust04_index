			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal Pensions (22): Look hard at the old firm before you jump - Protecting the opters-out / Alison Smith examines the latest advice available to those who would switch schemes A pilot study, showing widespread failure to meet proper standards in the sale of a personal pensions to people transferring lump sums out of occupational schemes, sent a tidal wave of shock through the financial services sector last December. Even as life companies insisted that they were not sharks mis-selling to innocent clients, and that anyway standards had already been raised, City regulators were considering how to ensure that potential customers felt it was safe to go back in the water. Immediately after the publication of the study, and well before any proposals to improve standards had been implemented, the regulators were sending past customers a 'don't panic' message. They stopped short of banning pension transfer business, saying that in the right circumstances personal pensions could work well; but the effect of the outcry caused by the study was itself enough to act as some form of deterrent. The two main elements of the regulators' plans have recently been announced, but some of the proposals will not be in place for some time. The most straightforward measure intended to prevent mis-selling was the issue in May of advice from the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), the City's chief watchdog, directly to customers. This dealt with the questions they should ask their financial advisers about pension transfers, or about opting out of an employer's scheme into a private plan. The leaflets, published by SIB and available from public libraries, citizens advice bureaux and - SIB hopes - through other organisations, including the Trades Union Congress and occupational pension schemes, are not DIY pension kits. They do, however, highlight some of the issues that potential customers should consider in deciding whether to go for a pension transfer or opt-out, and they list some issues the financial adviser should have raised in the course of giving advice. One of the main messages is that, before you can decide, you need to ensure that you know enough about your employer's scheme to be aware what you would be giving up by transferring or opting out. While personal pensions will still make sense for many people, good reasons are needed to take out a pension transfer; and very good reasons are needed to opt out of an occupational scheme. Other important pieces of advice are that you should shop around and ask about charges and commission, since these costs will affect the pension to which you are entitled on retirement. The checklists in the leaflets cover the questions which you need to ensure that either you or your adviser, or both of you, have addressed. Broadly, these are: Have your personal circumstances - including your attitude to risk - been discussed in detail, and do you realise that in taking a personal pension you are taking an investment risk? Has your adviser discussed benefits, such as early retirement, which you might lose through leaving the scheme? Have you discussed the decision with your spouse or partner? Has your adviser explained the differences between occupational schemes based on final salary and a personal pension? But the regulators are not relying solely, or even mainly, on making caveat emptor work more effectively in the personal pensions market. A report published by SIB in March was directed at imposing tougher guidelines on sales agents and advisers. It also proposed that customers should be allowed a 'cooling off' period of at least 14 days, in which to decide whether to go ahead with a transfer. From the first day of this month, the new rules should prevent sales agents and advisers evading their responsibility to give proper advice to clients. They should make it much less likely that sales agents will say that they were simply following a client's wishes or that their advice was overruled. These explanations have sometimes been offered by sales agents in cases where clients have acted against what seemed to be their best financial interests. Beginning later this month, the regulators themselves will require life companies and independent financial advisers to tell them if such cases make up more than a tiny proportion of their business, so that they can keep them under particularly close supervision. Other changes are a requirement that firms use a computerised system to check the value of a lump sum which a client would take out of an occupational scheme; and a requirement to produce a 'reason why' letter. This letter, which would accompany every transaction, to explain the advice given to the customer, would go to the investor and would also have to be filed by the sales agent. For the longer term, the report recommends that pension transfers and opt-outs be treated as a special category of business. This would enable regulators to consider whether a firm was suited to that specific activity, and to discourage any that were merely dabbling in the area. The impact of the changes will be assessed by the regulators in September next year. But long before then, one hopes, individual customers will know, from the quality of advice they receive, whether the reforms have worked.</p>

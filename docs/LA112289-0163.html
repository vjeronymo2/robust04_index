			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> EVEN A BERTH IN THE WORLD CUP CAN'T PUT U.S. ON A SOCCER KICK  </P> <P> If he lived in almost any other country, Paul Caligiuri wouldn't have to buy a  beer for the rest of his life. The bartender would always beat him to it.  </P> <P> Caligiuri is a soccer player from Diamond Bar, and Sunday he scored a goal that  put his country in the World Cup for the first time in 40 years. Such a feat  would make him a sporting legend in almost any country except the one where he  lives.  </P> <P> That is the United States, and even though his left-footed shot made soccer  history, most Americans still don't know his name. Soccer may cause riots  elsewhere and stir more passion than any other game in the world, but most  Americans prefer not to watch unless their kids are playing.  </P> <P> In Trinidad, where Caligiuri scored his goal and ruined the home team's hopes  of becoming the smallest country to play in the Cup, the game was treated as an  epochal event. A national holiday was declared. Fans filled the stadium hours  before kickoff. Such reaction is a worldwide tradition.  </P> <P> There was less excitement in the States -- almost none, to be specific. The  game was televised on tape and cable, opposite pro football, no doubt to a  small audience. The victory did not result in network bulletins, as it did in  Italy, where the Cup will be played next summer. Had the game been in the  United States, it probably would not have drawn 20,000 fans.  </P> <P> Caligiuri's goal should help matters. Playing in the Cup will raise the soccer  consciousness of the American public, and the United States is now assured of  playing in the next two; the Cup will be played in the United States in 1994,  and the home team automatically qualifies. There will be no problem finding  sponsors, a concern that might have forced the national team to disband  temporarily had it not won Sunday and qualified for Italy.  </P> <P> The hardy souls still trying to sell the game here will, surely, pronounce the  victory as the start of something big. They do have reason to be excited.  Staging a World Cup in the United States will focus tremendous attention on  their game. They could attract millions of fans.  </P> <P> It is debatable how high the public's soccer consciousness can go, however. The  sport has been stuck at a curious station in America for some time now:  Millions of kids are playing, but no one wants to pay to watch pros. This quirk  has existed for so long that it is beginning to seem permanent.  </P> <P> Youth soccer has grown exponentially in the last 20 years, all but rubbing out  football as a game for youngsters. The reasons are obvious. It's relatively  safe, it's good exercise, and everyone gets to kick the ball. But this  popularity hasn't spawned a ticket-buying public. The one league that had some  success, the North American Soccer League, folded. An indoor league remains  viable on a small scale.  </P> <P> The traditional explanation for this failure is that there is little scoring in  soccer, and Americans are an impatient lot who become bored unless bells are  ringing and the score is changing every two minutes. There may be something to  that, although personally I'm a little insulted.  </P> <P> To me, a better reason is that Americans don't understand the game, having no  background in it. Plus, there is no room on the sporting landscape here.  Football, baseball, basketball, hockey -- is there room in that glut for  another major sport? No, particularly when Americans invest only in ones they  invent. (Hockey is the only exception.)  </P> <P> If there is any chance for soccer to become popular, it will come when the kids  weaned on it grow up and have soccer-playing kids of their own, creating  families where it is the No. 1 sport. By then, the 1994 Cup will have created  more fans, and there should be enough competent American players to fill a  credible league. It might work.  </P> <P> It probably won't, though. There just aren't enough interested souls. Try as I  might, for I find the sport and its culture fascinating, it is difficult to  envision soccer as anything other than a cult in the United States. That is  unfortunate, for the United States has made enormous strides in the last 20  years.  </P> <P> It is true the Americans probably would not have qualified for Italy had Mexico  not been banned for falsifying the ages of junior players and Canada not been  upset in earlier qualifying. And, even then, the United States barely made it,  struggling in important games against such countries as El Salvador and  Guatemala.  </P> <P> That sounds embarrassing, but isn't when one considers that, only 20 years ago,  the United States could not have stayed within a half-dozen goals of the worst  of those teams. Populations were irrelevant. Soccer had no structure in the  United States. Almost no one played. The national team had played in the World  Cup in 1950 only because it had been invited. It never could have qualified.  </P> <P> In that larger framework, the victory in Trinidad is significant and symbolic.  The United States will get beaten in Italy, but it is now a legitimate player  in the international game and, with its army of youngsters kicking endlessly,  will improve. Any successes will continue to be celebrated only by a small band  of believers, however. Too bad.  </P></p>

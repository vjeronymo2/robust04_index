			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Britannic Assurance dividend raised 10% Britannic Assurance, the life insurance company, yesterday announced a 10.4 per cent rise in its interim dividend, from 3.85p to 4.25p. For the six months to June 30 total life premium income fell from Pounds 193.3m to Pounds 186.1m. However, premium income on the general insurance side held up at Pounds 17.8m (Pounds 17.9m) and an improvement in UK weather helped to turn a Pounds 1.43m underwriting loss into a profit of Pounds 930,000. 'Bearing in mind the background, we think the progress is good this year, and we are expecting reasonably healthy profit growth for the year,' said Mr Brian Shaw, general manager and actuary. Many large life insurers have already reported sharp falls in new life and pensions business for the first half of this year, compared with the equivalent period for new business in 1993. Britannic, like other life insurance companies, is not required to release interim profits figures. Mr Shaw said that a fall in single premium personal pensions sold to people transferring out of an occupational scheme had contributed to the overall fall in ordinary branch pensions income from Pounds 68.6m to Pounds 50.4m. He said that while maturity values for policies of longer than 25 years were unchanged, maturity values for shorter-term policies would fall by 2 to 3 per cent as a result of reductions to terminal bonus scales for the six months from end-September this year. Highlighting the turnround in the performance of the underwriting business after losses over the last few years, he said that most of it related to better weather. The company had had to pay out Pounds 1m less in weather-related claims than in the first half of last year. Some increases in premiums had also helped towards the costs of meeting theft claims.</p>

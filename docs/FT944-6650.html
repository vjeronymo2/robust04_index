			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Howard suffers court defeat on 'miscarriage' appeals The government suffered a further defeat in the courts yesterday when the High Court ruled that Home Office procedures for dealing with alleged miscarriages of justice were unfair. Two judges ruled unfair the ability of the home secretary to deny convicted criminals access to new evidence considered by him when deciding whether to refer their cases back to the Court of Appeal. Lord Justice Simon Brown, laying down new guidelines for the handling of cases of alleged miscarriage of justice, said such evidence should be disclosed to those seeking to have their convictions overturned before the home secretary reached his decision. Applicants had to have sufficient access to evidence to present their cases properly. He said: 'Only the highest standards of fairness will suffice.' The case that prompted yesterday's ruling was brought by six men, including three convicted of the killing of newspaper boy Carl Bridgewater in 1978. The ruling was welcomed by Justice, the civil liberties organisation. It said: 'It is an extremely important decision which goes to the very heart of how criminal cases work. It will affect every case before the home secretary and shows he must be more flexible and broader in his approach.' The ruling marks the third significant defeat for the government in the courts in as many weeks. It follows a Court of Appeal ruling that the home secretary abused his powers by introducing a compensation scheme for victims of violent crime without consulting parliament, and a High Court ruling that Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, unlawfully approved aid for the Pergau dam project. Until yesterday convicted criminals applying for their cases to be reconsidered by the Court of Appeal were unable to see experts' reports and other documents considered by the home secretary. Applicants have usually been shown only a summary of this evidence after the minister had reached his decision. Lord Justice Brown, sitting with Mr Justice Buckley, said these arrangements were 'significantly too closed'. The judges rejected the argument of Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, that present procedures were fair and that increased disclosure would make the process unmanageable and prone to delays. They ruled that disclosure of evidence before the home secretary had reached his decision was required in the interests of fairness and informed decision-making. Without prior disclosure, an adverse decision might not be right and would not be fair. Lord Justice Brown said: 'I have no doubt that fairness requires not merely prior disclosure, but a substantial increase in the level of disclosure made.' The judges ruled that the handling of the Bridgewater case by successive home secretaries had been 'plainly most unsatisfactory'. The other cases where disclosure was ordered involved Mr Sammy Davis, who served a six-year sentence for rape; Mr Jeremy Bamber, convicted of the murders of his adoptive parents, sister and her two children; and Mr Paul Malone, who was convicted of four armed robberies. The home secretary was yesterday considering whether to appeal against the ruling.</p>

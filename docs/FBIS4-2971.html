			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Questions of Policy"] </F>   [Text] The conclusions of Parliament's Foreign Affairs  Committee are as unremarkable as expected. Having no power to  alter British Government policy, and with no influence over  China (except perhaps in provoking further outbursts of venom  over British perfidy), the committee has largely confined itself  to voicing support for the Governor's political reform proposals.    It endorses Chris Patten's handling of the reform package  and  the thinking behind it - even though it warns that the  Government will have to weigh up how far China will be prepared  to use economic weapons as a reprisal for democratic changes  here and admits that Britain will be powerless to prevent China  disbanding the Legislative Council elected in 1995.    Given the all-party support the Governor's policies have  enjoyed to date, any different conclusion would have been  astonishing. The Governor need not fear his stance will be  undermined by Parliament in such a public manner, whatever may  happen behind the scenes at the Foreign Office.    But in areas where it has gone out on a limb, the committee  deserves a serious hearing. On matters of citizenship, it  recommends that both the wives and widows of ex-servicemen and  the non-Chinese ethnic minority population should be given full  British citizenship.    It also has come out in support of proposals for a statutory  Human Rights Commission, despite the negative attitude of the  Hong Kong Government, and the Governor's assumption that this  would antagonise China. The committee has been more outspoken  on China's human rights record than anyone in the British or  Hong Kong governments, and is scornful of those who claim to  detect "significant progress" on this front.    Sadly, the ruling Conservative Party is too bound up in its  own internal problems at present to heed the awkward suggestions  of an all-party foreign affairs watchdog. Nevertheless, other  Members of Parliament will take note. There is still hope the  committee's positions will prompt some tough questioning of  Government policy in future debates on Hong Kong, immigration  and human rights.</p>

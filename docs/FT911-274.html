			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Breakdown in trust seen at British Rail STRICT financial constraints on British Rail's managers have led to a breakdown in trust between them and local union officials, according to a study. It says the constraints have prevented BR from replacing its traditional style of industrial relations with improved consultation. The study of attitudes among local representatives of the Aslef train drivers' union found that most believed managers were more likely to breach locally-negotiated agreements at the end of the 1980s than at the beginning of that decade. The survey of 181 union representatives on local departmental committees at train depots found a decline in contact between union leaders and local BR managers, partly because of new management structures. The committees set working conditions such as rosters. The survey found little evidence that BR was developing forms of consultation with individuals to replace this weakening of traditional union mechanisms. Consultation was being 'squeezed out' by pressures of time and financial constraints. The RMT rail union is planning an industrial action ballot on what BR says is a final pay offer of 7 per cent. Aslef and the TSSA white-collar union are seeking arbitration on the offer through the Railway Staffs National Tribunal. The unpublished study by Mr Andrew Pendleton, an industrial-relations lecturer at the University of Bradford, found a decline in the commitment to 'constitutionalism' which has marked industrial relations at BR. BR was prevented from implementing a reform of its union consultation structures in 1989 by a series of one-day strikes by rail unions. It has yet to make fresh proposals for the devolving of pay bargaining to match its corporate structure. The study found that the proportion of union representatives who thought managers could be relied on to observe agreements all or most of the time had dropped from 81 per cent in 1980 to 54 per cent in the summer of 1989. Mr Pendleton says the impression is less of 'an aggressive, confident management decisively removing or ignoring those agreements that stand in their way' than of managers reacting in an ad hoc manner to intense budgetary pressures. 'The overriding impression is one of managers under pressure, caught between the imperative of cost reduction and the constitutionalism of their subordinates, seeking room for manoeuvre in day-to-day depot management.'

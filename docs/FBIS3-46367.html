It involves all the  fields of the contemporary social and political life and  summarizes all the basic viewpoints of the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. Although it embraces  such extensive knowledge and profound scholarship, it explains  them in simple terms in close connection with reality, thus  touching our hearts. Many things it mentions are what we have  personally experienced, but never conscientiously summarized.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instructions enable us to suddenly see  the light and gain much benefit. Reading through Volume 3, we  have a particular feeling that, at the beginning, we often  cannot not understand or can understand merely superficially the  whole meaning of Comrade Xiaoping's profound ideological  viewpoints and broad and long-term policy decisions; and that,  as time goes by, as we are educated through practice, and, in  particular, as these viewpoints and policy decisions yield  tremendous achievements in the course of practice, we will be  able to gain a fairly profound understanding after we review  them. It is thus clear that it is not easy to acquire a true  understanding, not to mention mastery, of the book after reading.    The Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping is underlined by the ideological line of  emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, which is the  quintessence and soul of the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. The great practice of reform, opening  up, and the modernization drive after the Third Plenary Session  of the 11th party Central Committee was started exactly with  this reestablished ideological line. This line is a condensed  summary of dialectical materialism and historical materialism  and the epitome of the proletarian world outlook and  methodology. Following this line to understand reality from  objective viewpoints, we will find correct answers to the many  theoretical and practical questions, however complicated they  may be. In the following, proceeding from the ideological line,  I will discuss my shallow understanding on some major  theoretical and practical questions.  <H5>  1. Why Should China "Take Its Own Road" for Its Development? </H5>   The opening article of Volume 3 of the Selected Works  of Deng Xiaoping contains a very incisive theory: "Our  modernization drive should proceed from China's reality. In  either revolution or construction, we should pay attention to  learning and drawing lessons from foreign experiences. However,  success can never be achieved by mechanically copying the  experiences and patterns of foreign countries. We have had many  lessons in this. The basic conclusion we have reached after  summarizing the long historical experiences is that we should  integrate the universal truth of Marxism with the specific  reality of our country, take our own road, and build socialism  with Chinese characteristics." (Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping, pp 2-3) These 100-odd characters  coagulate the achievements of the party's long practice and  experiences and its theoretical explorations, show the party's  basic political proposition concerning the road of development,  and epitomize the basic essence of the ideological line of  emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts.    Socialist construction and the road of development are basic  issues deciding on the future and destiny of socialism.  Historical experiences told us that leaving these issues  unresolved, it is impossible for us to find a universally  applicable pattern or road of development. "Taking our own road  and building socialism with Chinese characteristics" is a  concise and comprehensive theory that pinpoints the essence of  the issue on the road of development. Its meaning in theory and  practice also lies in the fact that it corrects the tendency of  deviation from practice concerning the issues on socialist  construction and road of development and provides answers to  both the doubts and censures form the "left" and the right. It  opens up the only correct course for our socialist modernization.    Why should China "take its own road and build socialism  with Chinese characteristics?" According to my understanding,  we should answer this question from three aspects.    First, because we cannot find a correct road from books.  "Because such a thing as building socialism in China cannot be  found either in the books on Marxism or the books of Lenin."  (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p  260) Although Marxist theory on socialism provided principled  plans for socialist construction, neither Marx nor Lenin  provided or could provide a ready plan for a country to build  socialism after they died. Just as Comrade Xiaoping said: "We  should never ask Marx to provide ready answers to the questions  arising 100 years or several hundred years after he died.  Likewise, neither could Lenin bear the task of providing ready  answers to the questions arising 50 or 100 years after he died."  (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p  291) "After the revolution succeeds, a country should build  socialism according to its own conditions. There is no fixed  pattern, and it is impossible to have one. Views sticking to  conventions will only lead to backwardness and even failure."  (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p  292) This is to say that we should integrate the basic  principle of Marxism with the reality of our own country and  explore "our own road" in practice.    Second, it will not work to mechanically copy the pattern of  other countries. Because "with a different foundation,  different history, different environment, different neighbors,  and many other differences, one country can learn from, but  never mechanically copy the experiences of others. China  suffered a lot from mechanically copying others' experiences.  China can develop only Chinese socialism." (Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 265)    The above-mentioned two answers are the summary of our  successful experiences and lessons of failure gained in our  explorations on building socialism. For example, in the process  of socialist transformation, our party did not rigidly adhere to  Marxist books, nor did it mechanically copy the methods of other  countries. Instead, it adopted the principles and policies  compatible with China's conditions. Therefore, the socialist  transformation was completed fairly smoothly and it promoted the  development of productive forces and created successful  experiences. Beginning in the late 1950's, however, the  "leftist" erroneous ideology gained ground in the party.  Instead of applying and developing theories in a creative  manner in line with our national conditions and formulating the  principles and policies compatible with reality, we were  divorced from reality in judging China's conditions. We either  mechanically copied what books said or mechanically copied the  patterns of other countries, resulting in being overanxious for  quick results, pursuit of absolute perfection, and such  erroneous guiding thoughts, principles, and policies as "taking  class struggle as the key link." Many things hindering the  development of productive forces were regarded as "socialist  principles" and adhered to, and many others compatible with  reality and the masses' desires and helpful to the development  of productive forces were regarded as the "tails of capitalism"  and the "restoration of capitalism" and were opposed and  criticized. As a result, we established an ownership structure  that was too unitary, adhered for a long time to a highly  centralized and rigid planned economy system and a political  system whereby power was too centralized, and seriously fettered  the development of productive forces. Such a situation  developed into the "Great Cultural Revolution," which led the  national economy to the brink of collapse. We should learn from  this bitter lesson.    Third, because it is not realistic to follow the capitalist  road in the path, and it also will not be realistic to do so in  the future. China can only practice socialism. This is a major  theoretical issue as well as a rigorous practical issue. Since  reform and opening up, particularly during recent years, due to  the rapid changes in the international situation, some major and  minor events have also taken place in the country, making us  more clear-headed and alert of this issue.    During the time when the ideological trend of bourgeois  liberalization ran rampant, one erroneous viewpoint once emerged  which believed that the capitalist stage should not be  overstepped and that China should "go back to its old road."  Going back to the old road means practicing "total  westernization. This "theoretical" influence once made many  comrades, some young people, in particular, have doubts in our  systems. This viewpoint still has a certain market to this day.  In view of this erroneous viewpoint, Comrade Xiaoping once  talked about modern Chinese history on different occasions. He  pointed out: Some people have raised such a question: Is it  possible for the people of China to stand up and for China to  turn over if it fails to practice socialism but follows the  capitalist road? After more than 20 years of efforts of the  Kuomintang, China had still remained a semi-colonial and semi-  feudal society. This showed that it is impossible for China to  have success if it follows the capitalist road. The one that  changed the image of China is not the Kuomintang or the father  and son of the Chiang's but the Chinese people led by the CPC  and socialism. It is socialism that makes China marches toward  unification and independence and ends a long period of a  chaotic, poor and backward state. Here, Comrade Xiaoping used  facts to show a true theory: In China where imperialism and the  feudal influence are too strong and national bourgeoisie is too  weak, it is absolutely unrealistic for it to follow the  capitalist road; it is an inevitable choice for China to follow  the socialist road during the development of its history.    In modern Chinese history, the "locally born and bred"  bourgeoisie will not get anywhere and, after all, capitalism is  only its dream. Then, will it be possible for the dreams of  some people who have attempted to "introduce" the capitalist  system of Western countries turn into reality today when  socialism has experienced more than 40 years of trials and  hardships? Will China's ship of socialism change its course in  the fierce wind and waves of "peaceful evolution" and bourgeois  liberalization? In face of these major questions of right and  wrong, not all the people are clear-headed. Some people always  think of using the prescription of the Western capitalist system  to fundamentally cure the "disease of poverty" in China and  believe that once they accept the capitalist systems, China will  attain the highest level in one step and the pockets of all the  people will be full. Certainly, this is a naive illusion. As  Comrade Xiaoping has analyzed, China is a big country with a  large population but a small county in economy. If it discards  socialism in a single day, it will go back to the semi-colonial  and semi-feudal society with a majority of poor people and a few  rich people, and it will be impossible to attain the goal of  becoming "well-off," and will have no guarantee for having  enough food and clothing; if China discards socialism in a very  short time, it will be unable to gain a foothold at all today  when the strong capitalist countries have monopolized the  international market, and it will be surely controlled by other  people and become the appendage of the big Western countries,  and will even be unable to maintain the current independent  status. What it can do is to act in line with others'  expressions and to live at the "mercy" of other people; if once  China discards socialism and implements "democracy," "freedom,"  and "human rights" of the big Western countries, it will lose  its political situation of stability and unity and even have  civil wars which will not only bring harms to China but also  bring disasters to the world. In short, if China practices  capitalism, about one-fifth of the world population will have a  major retrogression and there will be great disasters in  history. This is a scene which each and every Chinese person  with intuitive knowledge does not want to see as well as one  which the people of foreign countries with insight do not want  to see. This is absolutely not talking out of the void. The  present situations of some countries have provided examples to  prove this conclusion.    When adhering to "our own road," we do not rule out opening  to the outside world. Just as Comrade Xiaoping said: "For  socialism to win the advantages comparable to capitalism, we  should bravely absorb and learn from the achievements in all the  civilizations created by human societies and all the advanced  operating forms and managerial methods, that reflect the law of  modern socialized production, of all the countries in the  present-day world, including developed capitalist countries."  (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p  373) Both history and reality show that to build the country,  we should open to the outside world and never put ourselves in a  closed or isolate position. A closed position will lead to  nowhere. Opening to the outside world is an irreversible world  trend, a prerequisite for "taking our own road," and a major  characteristic of China's socialism. Without opening to the  outside world, we cannot succeed in "taking our own road," and  building socialism with Chinese characteristics will be out of  the question.    To blaze our own road of development, the only correct  method  is "experimenting and blazing new trails bravely." It is a  basic method for social practice in new historical conditions, a  basic form of practicing the ideological line, and the only  correct measure to seek integration between theory and practice.  "Taking our own road" means, in fact, to blaze new trails in  places where there are no roads. Without experiment and blazing  new trails, the road can never by found. In the 15-year  practice of reform and opening up, Comrade Xiaoping always asked  us to "have greater courage in reform and opening up, experiment  and blaze new trails bravely, and never be like women with bound  feet. When we are sure of the worth of an endeavor, we should  experiment with it and have a go at it boldly." (Volume 3 of  the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping,, p 372) Comrade  Xiaoping has always encouraged, respected, and wholeheartedly  protected innovations. He regards "no argument" as his own  "great creation." His purpose is not only to avoid dispersion  of energy and to "race against time" but also to protect the  spirit of innovation. Another of his noted viewpoint is to  allow people to see, but they should experiment resolutely and  lift control if it proves correct and should make correction if  it proves wrong. His viewpoint of "experimenting and blazing  new trails bravely" is aimed at facilitating reform and opening  up and promoting economic development and is based on the  political advantage of the socialist system. He has always  reminded people to have greater courage because there will be no  large risks, and the sky will not fall down. Even if there are  some risks, problems will be solved fairly easily because we  have the leadership of the communist party, have public  ownership as the mainstay, and have power in our hands.    2. Why is it that the basic line and basic principles and  policies should "not waver" and "not change?"    Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping  mentions on several occasions that the basic line and basic  principles and policies should "not waver" and "not change." In  my understanding, this is the most important "political  instruction" of Comrade Xiaoping to the comrades of the entire  party and will be the most important issue in practice our party  and state will face in the coming decades.    We should adhere to the basic line without wavering for 100  years because, first of all, this line has been formulated  according to the basic national conditions in the initial stage  of socialism and is also used to guide the social practice of  the entire initial stage. The basic national conditions in the  initial stage can be summarized as the following. 1) China's  socialism has been built on a semi-feudal and semi-colonial  basis, and the contradiction between the large population, the  backward productive forces, and the ever growing material and  cultural needs of the people on the one side and the backward  social production on the other has become the major  contradiction of society. 2) The political and economic systems  of socialism are not yet mature and perfect. Many things  between the superstructure and the economic foundation as well  as between productive relations and productive forces do not  suit each other. 3) The socialist system of the people's  democratic dictatorship under the leadership of the communist  party has been established, and the class struggle will persist  to a certain extent for a long time. Owing to the  aforementioned reality which will remain unchanged for a fairly  long historic period, our party's basic political line can only  be one of "one center and two basic points," and we adhere to it  without wavering for the next 100 years. Meanwhile, the series  of principles and policies formulated in line with the party's  basic line to conform with the country's conditions should also  be unswervingly and persistently upheld and remain unchanged.  Else, our undertakings will end in failure.    The effort to adhere to the party's basic line without  wavering for 100 years is related with our efforts to realize  the three-step strategic objective. The period from the general  completion of socialist transformation in the 1950's to the  realization of the three-step strategic objective of having per  capita GNP reach the levels of moderately developed countries  and achieving socialist modernization overall in the middle of  the next century, amounts to about 100 years. During the  period, it is imperative to unswervingly uphold the center of  economic construction and to follow Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  instructions, like, "persist in pursuit," "remain a bit stubborn  in upholding the center," and "forcing ourselves to boost the  economy". To this end, we must continuously deepen reform;  broaden opening up; uphold the four cardinal principles; stick  to the principle of building the two civilizations  simultaneously; maintain social stability; and provide a  powerful guarantee for economic construction. Only by ensuring  the stability of one center and two basic points will we be  certain in realizing the strategic target by the set date and to  win one victory after another in socialist undertakings.    Not shaking our will in upholding the party's basic line in  the 100 years represents the correct conclusion found out by our  party from its bitter lessons and experiences. Just as Comrade  Xiaoping pointed out: "The line adopted at the Eighth CPC  Congress was correct. However, many correct opinions in the  line adopted at the congress had not been persistently carried  forward in practice because the party's ideological preparations  at that time for building socialism in the country as a whole  were insufficient". This finally led to such a tragedy as "the  Great Cultural Revolution." "The reason why we had put forward  a series of policies during the period from the end of 1970's to  the beginning of 1980's was that we had summarized the  experience and lesson gained in the `Great Cultural  Revolution'." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, p 172)    Not shaking our will in upholding the party's basic line in  the 100 years epitomizes the experience gained over the past 15  years in the practice of reform and opening up. During the  earth-shaking change effected in the 15 years, the economy has  achieved fastest development; practical benefits enjoyed by the  people have been most; and the international position of our  country has been unprecedentedly upgraded. All of these  represent the outcome scored in upholding the basic line as well  as the basic principles and policies. Comrade Xioaping pointed  out: "The basic line will be effective in the 100 years and  never be shaken. Only by upholding the basic line can our party  win the people's trust and support. People will not allow the  attempt to bring about a change to the line, principles, and  policies formulated since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th  CPC Central Committee,.... Without the achievements in reform  and opening up, we would have been unable to pass the test  presented by the "4 June" incident.... The reason why our  country has been stable since the "4 June" incident is that we  have promoted the economic development and improved the people's  livelihood through the programs of conducting reform and opening  up. Therefore, the armed forces and state officials should  support the line, systems, and policies". He stressed  continuously: "That our country has developed at such a rapid  pace in as few as 10-odd years, which has delighted the  country's people and attracted world attention, has fully proven  the correctness of the line, principles, and policies laid down  since the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, and has proven that no one can change them even  though he wants to change. These remarks can be summarized as:  The adherence to the basic line, principles, and policies  should remain unchanged." "It will be all right even though  there are no new ideas. What we stress is that we should remain  unchanged and should not let the people feel about the change in  policies. With these line, principles, and policies, China will  have hope." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, p 371) Comrade Xiaoping has used simple remarks  to explain the following truth, that calls for our deep thought:  A political line that can promote the development of productive  forces is a correct line and is compatible with reality; a  correct political line is not easily changed; if the line  changes, history will go backwards, the state will experience  internal disorder, and thus the people will not agree to the  change; and whoever attempts to change them will be overthrown.    Why has Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly stressed that the basic  line, principles, and policies "cannot be wavered and changed?"  In my opinion, on the one hand, the basic line, principles, and  policies are truly very important to the future and destiny of a  party, a state, and a nation; and, on the other hand, there are  actually some people who disagree to persist in them. If we  fail in this aspect, and, in particular, if we cannot clearly  and correctly approach certain events taken place at home and  abroad, then, it is not impossible for us to witness a waver in  the party's basic line. Over recent years, it is precisely the  correct attitude and measures, adopted by the second generation  of leading collective, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the core,  and by the third generation of leading collective, with Comrade  Jiang Zemin as the core, for the series of major events taken  place at home and abroad, that have ensured the implementation  and execution of the party's basic line. For instance, the  ideological train of bourgeois liberalization taken place in  1987 was precisely a grave interference to our adherence to the  basic line. The essence of this ideological train was to make  China deviate from the socialist road. When we resisted this  ideological train with a clear-cut stand, many people at home  and abroad argued about whether China would change its set  principles and policies. Comrade Xiaoping definitely pointed  out: "Our set principles and policies will never change. Now  that these principles and polices have been proven feasible in  practice for eight years, why do we change them?" (Volume 3 of  the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 207) Then, he  further pointed out: "The issue of "remaining unchanged" is an  issue argued about by the people. And, I believe that this issue  will be argued about until the end of this century and even the  next century. We should use facts to prove this issue. (Volume  3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 218) For  another instance, the political turbulence taken place in our  country in 1989 and the sharp change in the international  situation taken place right after the political turbulence posed  the most rigorous trials on the party's basic line and policies  regarding internal and external affairs. After reviewing this  section of history, we can, through the study of Comrade  Xiaoping's pertinent expositions, see that it is not our party  that wants to change the basic line, principles, and policies,  and our party has never changed them over the past dozen of  years; and it is the "left" or "right" ideological train and the  international hostile force that have forced us to give up these  lines, principles, and policies. Therefore, in his speeches made  during his south China tour, Comrade Xiaoping again stressed the  necessity of guarding against the right and, what is more  important, preventing the "left." So long as we persist in the  basic line without wavering, we will be able to cope with  multifarious changes by remaining unchanged and will be in an  impregnable position forever.    In my understanding, Comrade Xiaoping's theory that the  basic line and the basic principles and policies not waver or  change is not only a serious "political instruction" but also an  ardent expectation and earnest admonition for the generations to  come. Comrade Xiaoping firmly believes that the general  historical trend for socialism to replace capitalism will not  regress or change. However, he also knows deeply that the road  ahead of us will be tortuous and risky. He hopes that our party  will become increasingly mature theoretically, that China's  socialism will gradually become the "finalized system," and that  our millions of people and the party's generation upon  generation of leaders will have the political awareness in  adhering to the basic line. As high-ranking cadres of the  party, we deeply feel the heavy responsibility on our shoulders.  Comrade Xiaoping said that "the key to whether the correct  political line can be implemented lies in whether the  ideological line is correct." This is because when the  ideological line is correct, the theories compatible with  China's reality and the basic guidelines and basic principles of  the line will pass on from generation to generation and create  endless material achievements in the integration process with  practice. In addition, the principles and policies themselves  will also be developed creatively and always maintain their  robust vitality.    3. How Should We Understand the Endeavor of "Seizing the  Opportunity To Accelerate Development" as Both an Economic Issue  and a Political Issue?    In the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, development is a major topic of discussion  which holds a central position. The core of the party's basic  line is development, and the key to adhering to the basic line  without wavering for 100 years is to persist in economic  construction, the central task, without wavering. In Volume 3  of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, development  is what is discussed most. Comrade Xiaoping's noted theses that  "the basic task of socialism is developing productive forces"  and that "development is the essential criterion" represent the  most important theoretical innovation Marxist viewpoint of  development. Also, in Comrade Xiaoping's theory on development,  "seizing the opportunity to accelerate development and  concentrating efforts to promote economic construction" is an  important idea that can most embody China's characteristics,  reflect the characteristics of this era, and represent the  desires of the party and the people. For example, if we say  that Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line have  indicated and opened up the course of China's modernization  drive, Comrade Xiaoping's brand-new theories on development,  then, have hoisted the sails for the historical ship to advance  more rapidly.    The development viewpoint of seizing the opportunity to  accelerate development is one based on the ideological line of  emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. This  brand-new development viewpoint contains Comrade Xiaoping's  intense sorrow over the historical experience of "suffering from  a backwardness attack," his profound reflection over mistakes  and setbacks, such as "taking class struggle as the key link"  and "premature transition," his thorough understanding of the  basic national situation characterized by "a large population  and a poor foundation," his sober judgment of the international  environment and climate China faces, and also his scientific  foresight about the future of China and the world.    In Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping and in many other of Comrade Xiaoping's works, the  issue of the speed of China's development has been regarded as a  serious political issue, and thus it is closely linked with the  life or death of the party, the rise or decline of the country,  and the future and destiny of the socialist system. Comrade  Xiaoping maintained: China is faced with a rigorous challenge  on this issue. We should effectively resist hegemonism, power  politics, and "peaceful evolution." The key to always holding  high the banner of socialism and maintaining the position of  independence lies in accelerating economic development, whether  we can achieve a relatively rapid growth rate, and whether we  can fulfill our development strategy on schedule. After the  sharp change in Eastern Europe, Comrade Xiaoping warned us in a  timely manner: "Now, we should pay special attention to the  landslide in the economic growth rate." He also sharply pointed  out: "Whether we can avoid economic landslide and whether we  can achieve the quadrupling task is a major question. This  question may be one preventing us from being fast asleep for a  long time, 10 years at least." (Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 355)    Comrade Xiaoping maintained: The rapid development of  neighboring countries constitutes a challenge for us. In his  speeches made during his south China trip, he pointed out: "The  key to seize the opportunity to develop ourselves lies in  developing the economy. The economic development of some  neighboring countries and regions is now faster than our's. If  we refuse to develop our economy or if we develop our economy  too slowly, the people will catch sight of problems through  comparison." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, p 375) From this, we can see that "slow growth  means stop growing and even means going backwards." Comrade  Xiaoping's sense of anxiety and urgency manifested in the issue  of development has greatly educated us.    In Comrade Xiaoping's theory of development, the idea of  seizing and making good use of the opportunity has been very  prominent. The opportunity mentioned here means refers to a  good international environment. At the moment, although various  kinds of contradictions and conflicts have taken place  continuously in the world and the world remains turbulent, peace  and development are still the main trend of the times. The old  polarization pattern has come to the end, and the world is  developing toward multi-polarization. We can have a relatively  long period of peaceful development. Moreover, Asia is  relatively stable when compared with other areas in the world,  and the economy in Asia is developing at a high speed.  Relations between China and its neighboring countries have been  relaxed and improved, therefore China has been provided an  extremely favorable condition for opening its border areas to  the outside world. Now, the worldwide new technology revolution  is developing very fiercely, the international industrial  structure is under reorganization, and a huge amount of surplus  funds and advanced technologies need to seek new markets. All  these have provided a historical opportunity for our  development. With the farsightedness of a strategist, Comrade  Xiaoping has repeatedly exhorted us: "There are not many such  opportunities;" "the opportunity should be seized;" "on no  account should this opportunity be missed;" "development should  not be slowed down so long as it can be accelerated," "rapid  development should not be hampered so long as it can be  accelerated," and "the growth speed that can be achieved should  be achieved as far as possible." In line with the experience on  economic "leap" gained by China and some foreign countries in  the past several years, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "It is  essential for us to witness several stages during the long  process of modernization in the future characterized by  relatively rapid growth and relatively good efficiency." (Volume  3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 377)  Then, Comrade Xiaoping again set forth the development idea and  objective of "going all out to embark on a new stage every  several years." In studying Comrade Xiaoping's expositions on  accelerating development, we can feel about a force that presses  us to forge ahead. This is a force produced by the ideological  line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts and  is a force that encourages us to work hard.    While stressing the rate, Comrade Xiaoping always  simultaneously emphasized such points as "paying attention to  efficiency, quality and export-oriented items," and believed  that as long as we have these three points, we will not be  afraid of even a higher rate. On the issue concerning the  relationship between "acceleration of development" and "steady  development," Comrade Xiaoping has proposed a keen ideology,  that is, "it is right to stress stability, however,  overstressing it may make us lose the opportunity. ... Perhaps,  our economic development law will advance in a wave upon wave  manner and it will have a leap forward and will jump to a new  stage after several years." (Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 368) We should not be surprised  or alarmed at some disturbances in the course of economic  development. This ideology has clearly explained the relations  of dialectical unity between rate and efficiency, quickness and  steadiness, and actually, it has also clearly explained the  relationship between seeking truth from facts and emancipating  the mind. This is the viewpoint of the dynamic theory of  reflection which is in conformity with not only the objective  law of economic development but it also stresses the factor of  man's subjective dynamic role, having a practical and guiding  significance in actual work.    How to realize a fairly high rate and to seek the  integration  of rate and efficiency? Comrade Xiaoping has always maintained  that the fundamental way out is to conduct reform and opening up  and to establish a new socialist market economic system. In his  works, reform and opening up and acceleration of development are  unseparated. Only by reforming the economic system, implementing  opening up and breaking the old systems that shackle the  development of the productive forces; using foreign advanced  knowledge and experience for reference and adopting foreign  advanced technology, can we be able to see a high rate and  efficiency. At present, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee has issued the "decision on some issues  concerning the establishment of the socialist market economic  system," which makes our country's reform of the economic system  more clear and specific. If we continue to follow this road,  the reform pace will inevitably be greatly accelerated, and this  will give rise to a tremendous motivation for economic  development. We should strive to do a good job in reform.    To talk about development, it is also natural for us to talk  about the affairs of our Inner Mongolia. As all people know,  since its establishment more than 40 years ago, the Inner  Mongolia Autonomous Region has witnessed rapid economic and  social development and made tremendous achievements. Since  reform and opening up, earth-shaking changes have taken place  and a new situation of economic development, social stability,  cultural invigoration and harmony among people of various  nationalities has emerged. What is more gratifying is that we  have gradually found a road to develop the economy and society.  Being restricted by some conditions, we should not  unrealistically emulate the rate of coastal and other developed  areas or hope to catch up with the level of developed areas  within a short time. However, we are determined to give play to  the advantages of our region through reform, opening up and the  arduous struggle of the people of various nationalities; to give  full play to the advantages and favorable conditions of having  "natural resources, good geographic conditions and policies,"  promote strong points and avoid shortcomings, strive to quicker  the rate and raise efficiency, unceasingly shorten the gap with  developed areas, and attain the goal of becoming well-off and  prosperous. In 1987, in a speech on our country's nationalities  policy and on the development of minority areas , Comrade  Xiaoping particularly talked about the Inner Mongolia Autonomous  Region. He said: "In the case of Inner Mongolia, it has vast  grasslands but a small population; it may probably march toward  the front rank during its development in the future."  "Observing the minority areas, we should mainly see whether  they can be developed." "While approaching this issue, we should  pay attention to the central point and not to its form." (Volume  3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 247)  Comrade Xiaoping's remarks have given a profound lesson to our  people of various nationalities. In this connection, Comrade  Xiaoping has put forward his remark by regarding development as  a core issue in the work undertaken by regions with the people  of multiple nationalities. The "essence" pointed out by him  means the issues of achieving development and making progress.  We should deeply understand the important ideology of Comrade  Xiaoping and earnestly summarize the work done over the past few  years by regarding his ideology as a guidance. We should also  further improve the guiding ideology, principles, and policies  for work; bring all contributing factors into full play; unite  with or lead the people of various nationalities to accelerate  the economic and social development in the region; and realize  the grand target of "being the advanced" put forward by Comrade  Xiaoping through unswerving and protracted efforts. Party  organizations and the people of various nationalities throughout  the region possess their glorious tradition of uniting as one in  struggles and waging arduous struggles and have a strong desire  and confidence in "being the advanced". They will certainly be  able to perform the miracles of latecomers surpassing the  old-timers because they are facing the opportunity and many  favorable conditions for accelerating the development.  4. In Upholding the Ideological Line, What Consciousness and  Morals Should Leaders Have?    Emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts represent a  scientific proposition full with dialectical and historical  materialism and concentratedly reflect the world outlook and  methodology of the proletarian class. It is uneasy for us to  understand the ideological line and even uneasy for us to  conduct practice on it. Whether the ideological line has been  unswervingly upheld represents a practical yardstick in  measuring the level and consciousness of every leading  personnel. It not only can give a test to our capabilities of  understanding and of handling problems and particularly to our  party spirit, work style, and morals.    Unswervingly upholding the line of emancipating minds and  seeking truth from facts requires a scientific attitude and the  spirit of dealing with matters relating to work. First of all  we should honestly do things in line with the objective law of  development. This requires us to frequently go deep into  reality, to keep extensive contacts with the masses, to  understand at all times the changes of objective conditions, to  realistically and accurately know the masses' ideological trend,  and to seize the turning point of the age so as to enable our  policies to conform with the reality. In this connection, the  bureaucracy losing contact with reality should be resolutely  overcome. The attitude and method of paying lip service and  considering oneself in the right should be resolutely cast away.  Efforts should be made to be the honest persons often praised  by Chairman Mao. In view of Chairman Mao, Marx, Lenin, and  scientists are honest people who are doing things honestly  according to a scientific attitude. Comrade Xiaoping is just an  honest person of such a kind, always advocates the spirit of  doing matters relating to work, and always sets himself an  example in work. His works and speeches are in simple styles  and have no empty talks losing contact with reality. His  practice scored over the past several decades even represents  the glorious example and vivid teaching materials of displaying  the spirit of doing matters relating to work.    There is a bad practice at present, in which some leading  personnel have often adopted an attitude of undiscriminatingly  copying and relaying the higher authorities' directives and the  experience gained by outside places. After accepting the  documents, they have often got through with only relaying them  any old way and few of them are to earnestly study them; to  conduct earnest discussion; and to take an earnest consideration  about them. They never ask "whys" and "hows" relating to the  documents and never put forward their opinions on implementing  the documents in line with the local reality. They often  perform their duties in a perfunctory manner by only relaying  these documents to their subordinate units. Among those who have  adopted such an irresponsible attitude, hundred percent of them  will suffer a failure. Since the programs of conducting reform  and opening up, many localities have brought about tremendous  changes to their economic and social outlooks. Some of them  have even improved their economic and social outlooks to a new  level within two or three years. The witness of such a progress  has inspired the people very much. However, some localities  have brought about slight changes in this regard and some of  them have not accurately found out their ways of developing  their local economy as of now. They are only repeating some  formalist slogans. Such an irresponsible attitude adopted by the  leading personnel in these localities represents the  manifestations of their weak party spirit and professional  ambition. If we leave this attitude unchecked, these localities  will have no future.    In specific work, it is, of course, important to put  forward the policies compatible with reality. However, it is  more important to turn the correct policies into actions through  everyone's earnest efforts in doing solid work. Without this,  no policies, however perfect, can be turned into material  achievements. Making earnest efforts to do solid work is not  only a work style and the basic method to implement policies but  also a test on the party spirit and sense of responsibility of  every leader. Comrade Xiaoping has always advocated earnest  efforts and solid work. Over the past few years, he has urged  us on many occasions to "devote some time to more solid work and  speak less," to "accomplish some work in a down-to-earth manner  and score real achievements to win trust of the people," to  "concentrate on doing some work with which the masses are  satisfied and pleased," and to "work hard to make our own work  successful." He has particularly emphasized: "Leaders must do  more solid work. They must change the bad work styles of  spending the day by giving orders and empty talks." (Volume 3  of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 121)  Comrade Xiaoping's instruction and example are the force to  spur us on to work in a down-to-earth manner.    Another very important issue concerning the need for leaders  to adopt a scientific approach of seeking truth from facts is  that they should learn to analyze and address problems in a  dialectical manner and not from a lopsided viewpoint or in terms  of absolutes. This is not only a theoretical issue but also an  issue on practice that leaders will often encounter during  leadership work. To those assuming higher-level leadership  work, this issue is more important. For example, the party's  basic line clearly consists of "two basic points," but some  leaders see only one; and the "two basic points" constitute an  organic whole, but some leaders separate them and even set one  against the other. The reason why there are "leftist" and  rightist ideological interference within the party and why the  party is "strong in one task and weak in the other" is closely  related to the lopsided way of thinking in addition to some  factors. Another example, Comrade Xiaoping has a very important  thinking, namely to take the overall situation into account,  subject to the overall situation, and consider issues from the  angle of the overall situation. Here, the overall situation  means the "large reality," and the partial situation is merely  the "small reality." Proceeding from the overall situation  means proceeding from the large reality. Concerning the issue on  "fools [sha zi 0247 1311] and melons [gua zi 3900 1311]," he  looked back and said: "Many people felt uneasy at that time,  saying that he had earned 1 million yuan and should be  criticized. I said no, because when we criticize him, people  would think that policies have changed. Then, the loss will  outweigh the gain. Issues like this are still many. If we fail  to handle them properly, our principles will be shaken easily,  and the overall situation of reform will be affected." (Volume  3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 371) In  Comrade Xiaoping's opinion, leaving the issues on "fools and  melons" unresolved does not affect the overall situation; and  solving them would be harmful to the overall situation. When  faced with major issues and important junctures, Comrade  Xiaoping has always been so clear-headed and so profound,  comprehensive, and sharp in analyzing issues; and when solving  problems, he has always solved them properly in order of  importance and urgency. This cannot be achieved without well  versed dialectical thinking and the foresight and strategy of a  strategist. We should learn from Comrade Xiaoping's thinking and  practice and learn to use materialist dialectics to think over  and handle issues. Many things in reality show that when  leaders' way of thinking is wrong, they will be confused about  the cardinal issues of right and wrong an even commit political  mistakes to cause irretrievable losses to our cause.    We must have the spirit of blazing new trails and the  awareness of taking risks in order to unswervingly persist in  the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth  from facts. Modern leaders must have this kind of spirit and  awareness. The theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is the most creative. The ideological line of  emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts involves  ceaselessly blazing new trails. Our country's achievements in  reform and modernization made over the past 10 years or so are  just the achievements made by hundreds of millions of the people  who have made ceaseless efforts to blaze new trails and  vigorously keep forging ahead under the guidance of the party.  Nothing will be accomplished and no progress will be made  without this spirit. Comrade Xiaoping has the following  heartening words: "Without the spirit of blazing new trails,  the spirit of `taking risks,' or vitality, we cannot pioneer a  good and new way or accomplish new undertakings. Who has the  daring to declare that he does not take any risks and has  certainty of success in doing anything." (Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 372) What Comrade  Xiaoping advocates here is just the spirit of blazing new trails  and the awareness of taking risks. The "vitality" that he  talked about is revolutionary courage, heroism, and momentum.  It is from the lofty ideals and the boundless faithfulness to  the people. The spirit of blazing new trails and taking risks in  the course of reform and opening up is extremely precious and  merits vigorous carriage forward. Those who are very lazy,  accomplish nothing, and lack the sense of responsibility cannot  do this, neither can those who strive to avoid contributions and  only make mistakes. Those who do not keep the people and  undertakings in mind but only seek benefits for themselves and  their small groups can not only accomplish nothing but also not  understand the spirit of blazing new trails and the awareness of  taking risks. They even criticize and vilify the comrades with  this kind of spirit.    The ideological line of the party is a truly materialist  line. So, only true materialists can completely understand and  unswervingly persist in it. Because we must take risks, pay  prices, and make sacrifice to persist in this line. Those  without the sense of responsibility for the wealth and happiness  of the people or enthusiasm for undertakings, like a raging  fire, are unwilling to pay this price. For instance, many  things in our practical life should be done by the leaders with  the daring to persistently seek truth from facts. For instance,  the masses have complaints about the unhealthy trends, the  corrosive phenomena, and the indicators for political liberalism  that seriously exist within the party; and it is difficult to  correct them. One of the important reasons is that some leading  comrades lack the daring to seek truth from facts and to persist  in truth, are afraid of offending others, and are not willing to  take risks by themselves. These comrades do not understand that  the party must pay big prices if they are not willing to pay  small prices. As long as justice prevails, evil trends will be  overwhelmed. Truth and justice are, after all, not befuddled.  What will we be afraid of? Another example is that some of our  leaders often come across the situation of having two completely  different viewpoints and assessments on the same thing, the same  person, the same section of history, and the same locality. All  of them think that they are seeking truth from facts. There are  many factors to these problems. There may be problems in  ability and level; there may be problems in the degree of  understanding of circumstances and in the angle of approaching  issues; and there may also be problems of having different ideas  and standards for what is right and wrong. Such a situation is  understandable. What is important is that leaders of various  localities and units must take the position of upholding party  spirit and the basic point of seeking truth from facts to speak  and act impartially, to correct the prejudices of some comrades,  and to encourage the cadres who persist in seeking truth from  facts.    The basic point of the party's ideological line is that the  people's interest is higher than everything else. The source of  the courage and the strength to persist in this ideological line  is among the people. Over the scores of years, Comrade Xiaoping  has considered himself the "son of Chinese people," always  respected the masses and loved the people, always borne in mind  the people's interest and aspirations, and regarded "whether the  people support it," "whether the people agree to it," "whether  the people are happy," and "whether the people cooperate" as the  starting point and ending point to formulating all principles  and policies and as the fundamental criterion to judge right  from wrong. Precisely for this reason, Comrade Xiaoping has had  tremendous courage in theory and practice; his correct policy  decisions have naturally become the conscious actions of  hundreds of millions of people; and he himself has been able to  undauntedly lead the people to continuously charge forward  during the great process of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Comrade Xiaoping has undergone a rough life  characterized by "three ups and three downs," and his  revolutionary character of steadfastly persisting in truth and  principles regardless of his personal honor or disgrace, his  personal feelings of gratitude or resentment, and his personal  gains or losses has truly manifested his lofty awareness of  steadfastly seeking truth from facts. The great experience of  Comrade Xiaoping has taught and inspired us a lot. Dauntless  are the Communists who consider the people's interest higher as  being more important than everything else, and no personal costs  should waver Communists' steadfastness in persisting in the  party's ideological line.    In his memorial article for Comrade Liu Bocheng, Comrade  Xiaoping stated: "He bent his back and was willing to risk any  danger to realize his beliefs. At any time and any place, in  smooth or adverse circumstance, and no matter how objective the  environment changes, he has always contributed and submitted his  all to the party and has merged himself with the party's cause  regardless of his personal honor or disgrace, thus truly  attaining the state of forgetting himself." (Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, pp 188-189) How  much we are educated and spurred on by these remarks of Comrade  Xiaoping! If all generations of our leaders can attain such a  "oblivious state," all levels of the party's leading bodies will  become strong headquarters of fighting, will be able to foster a  very good atmosphere, and will be able to steadfastly persist in  the ideological line of seeking truth from facts. So, the ship  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics will never  deviate from the correct course amid terrifying waves and will  always sail towards glorious destinations.</p>

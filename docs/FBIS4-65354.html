			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Henning Krumrey, Christian Reiermann, and Heiner </F> Sieger: "Fatal Upswing; Positive Economic Data Conceal Pressing  Structural Problems"]    [Text] They are now rejoicing again. There is no holding  back the members of the coalition since the economic research  institutes sighted a cautious cyclical recovery on Tuesday [26  April] of last week. Rainer Haungs, economist with the CDU  [Christian Democratic Union], derives "new confidence for  Germany as a business location."    The first figures support him: the long-distressed chemical  industry is reporting increased sales and even the ailing  automotive industry is moving toward the future with confidence.    "The upswing in Germany is falling in step," rejoices Count  Otto Lambsdorff (FDP [Free Democratic Party of Germany]). The  "stagnation that we have suffered through" has by "no means been  the most dramatic crisis of all time," says Kurt Faltlhauser,  financial expert for the CSU [Christian Social Union]. And the  federal chancellor again sees the German enterprises on the way  to the top spot in the world.    If he is not deceiving himself. As cynical as it may seem,  the upswing is coming too early. The happy news coming just in  time for the election campaign makes structural reforms to  secure the industrial site Germany seem superfluous.    One might have to pay dearly for this recklessness:    --If the state puts off urgent reform measures such as  reduction of enterprise taxes or making the bloated public  service more efficient and reorganizing the social state,    --if the trade unions drive wages up too soon,    --and if the enterprises fail to push the structural  adjustments systematically, then the decline of the Germans to  second-class status is programmed in advance. Germany could  become the Argentina of the 21st century.    Warning voices: "The cyclical recovery is not a  signal that the course has been set correctly," says Gernot  Nerb, chief economist for the Ifo Institute in Munich.    Economic Minister Guenter Rexrodt is already feeling  pressure  from the environmental and labor ministries to set aside the  reform proposals in his industrial site program.    "I will not abandon my course," promises Rexrodt. "It is  impossible to give up cost relief for trade and industry just  because we half a half percent more growth."    Germany's decline can be calculated. The share of  German exports in the world market has fallen for eight  consecutive years. For more than a decade, productivity in  German industry has been growing much more slowly than in the  biggest competitors, the United States, Japan, France, and Great  Britain. Whereas the English have achieved an increase in  productivity of 4.4 percent in manufacturing since 1985, the  German industry is lagging far behind with 1.6 percent.    The supposedly higher efficiency must nevertheless serve  again and again to justify higher wages. "We must consider  whether we can continue to afford this advantage in incomes,"  says Herbert hax, chairman of the council of experts.    The trade unions are already demanding an  adjustment in view of the delicate "economic spring"  (Kohl). Their motto: we have sacrificed wages in favor of the  upswing and now we want to harvest the fruit. "The bitter lesson  of the 1993 recession for the employment situation will soon be  written off," fears Horst Siebert, one of the Five Wise Men.    "The trade unions expect employees to have an appropriate  part in this success," is the slogan of Heinz-Werner Meyer,  chairman of the German Federation of Trade Unions, for the next  round of collective bargaining.    "The moderate wage agreements in the last round were not  advance action for the upswing but only a partial correction of  the excesses of the past," counters Alexander von Tippelskirch,  board spokesman for the IKB German Industrial Bank.    If there is no reversal in wages, predicts Klaus-Werner  Schatz, professor at the Institute for World Economics in Kiel,  "then the upswing will go nowhere and there will not be a strong  recovery." Stagnation will be followed by the next setback.    Political risk: Finance and tax policy determines  prosperity and jobs more than ever, warn the research institutes  in unison. The taxes for enterpreneurs and citizens must come  down to stimulate growth and at the same time to force the state  into vigorous economy measures.    But there is no sign of that. With respect to the subject of  tax increases, the parties are arguing "only about how and not  about whether," criticizes Ruediger Pohl, president of the  Institute for Economic Research in Halle. "The tax burden for  the next five years is no longer calculable."    On the executive floors of leading enterprises as well,  there  is growing concern about the incipient optimism in regard to the  economy. In an upswing, the usual defensive fronts develop  against painful but necessary cuts in the wild growth from 40  years of success.    "Once the good mood is established, it will be much more  difficult to rationalize," believes Helmut Werner, chief of  Mercedes-Benz. In the most severe cyclical decline in the  postwar era, the automotive concern eliminated one-fourth of all  management positions and cut costs by 4 billion marks. "That was  unthinkable a few years ago."    Fellow entrepreneur Peter Vischer, business manager of the  medical equipment manufacturer Heraeus-Holding GmbH, has  "concluded not even half of the massive reorganization in the  enterprise." He sees the danger that "things will not be  accomplished if suddenly everything goes well."    Anyone who thinks that he can lean back and relax in view of  the looming upswing is missing the boat, thinks Siemens-chief  Heinrich von Pierer as well: "We urgently need to resolve the  structural problems to secure our international competitiveness  in the long term," he says to damp rising optimism.    Some buckle under more quickly. At Volkswagen in  Wolfsburg, the workers are not working more efficiently after  the parallel reduction of working time and wages but only more  briefly and still too expensively. The cars are not becoming  less costly. There are just fewer salable cars being built.    Still: the enterprises have come the farthest on the way to  reorganization. "They will accomplish the change in any case,"  believes banker von Tippelskirch. Only a small share will be  left behind. The rest would be "stronger in international  competition than before." It depends on the politicians and  trade unionists "whether the jobs will be created here or  abroad."    "The shock of the recession had a lasting effect,"  recapitulates economic researcher Pohl. The enterprises had  reduced their costs, opened up new markets, and "are now letting  sales people participate in product development rather than just  the engineers."    Whereas the reorganization is proceeding only slowly  domestically, the international competition is applying  pressure. In Japan and the United States, enterprises trimmed  down much faster and much more drastically. China is on the way  to being a technology nation and is offering high-tech at  favorable prices.    Danger is threatening from the immediate east as well. The  reform countries in Central Europe are offering wages like those  of developing countries but have educated specialists as in the  industrial states, the Institute for World Economics has  discovered. German firms are already also moving  research-intensive production to the east.    The pressure could become ominous if the reforms  do not take place. Economist Schatz fears a deadly chain  reaction:    --the upswing is soon exhausted;    --the build-up of the new laender fades;    --unemployment remains high;    --taxes and contributions must rise to finance it;    --the distribution conflicts increase;    --the infrastructure decays;    --the development of new products and processes fails  because  of unwillingless to take risks and protracted approval  procedures;    --with their obsolete products, the enterprises are no  longer  competitive and lose larger and larger market shares worldwide;  and    --they invest increasingly in production sites abroad.    Gloomy outlook: Germany will become second-class,  just an industrial museum. Such a decline is nothing new:  Argentina has gone through it.    Still, there is growing resistance to the decline, at least  verbally. "We must not idly watch developments," Tyll Necker,  president of the Federal Association of German Industry,  encourages himself.    Upswing '94--the danger is perceived but not yet averted.</p>

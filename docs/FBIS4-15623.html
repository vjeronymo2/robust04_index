			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Is Ukraine Flexing Its Muscles?"] </F>   [Text] On 5 April, a group of officers under the  leadership of Hennadiy Hurin, first deputy chief of Ukraine's  Ministry of Defense General Staff, visited the Crimea. The aim  of the visit was to check, as scheduled, the state of affairs  and to study problems in Ukraine's military units. On that day,  Hennadiy Hurin visited the headquarters of Ukraine's Naval  Forces in Sevastopol and ships of the Ukrainian Fleet. The  group of officers also included Ukrainian presidential adviser  for military issues Major General Volodymyr Petepko, who visited  commander of the Black Sea Fleet Admiral E. Baltin in a naval  hospital.    On the same day, Ukraine's first deputy minister of internal  affairs Colonel General Valentyn Nedryhaylo also visited the  Crimea. He headed a group of the ministry's officials that  arrived in order to render assistance in the operational work on  combating crime.    Both the Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Internal  Affairs  of Ukraine rejected the assumption by a number of mass media on  Ukraine's alleged flexing its muscles in the absence of  President Yu. Meshkov [who was on a visit to Cyprus at the time].</p>

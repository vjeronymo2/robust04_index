			<p>BFN     [Text] Erfurt (DDP/ADN) -- Defense Minister Volker Ruehe  says that the Bundeswehr had invested around 2.7 billion German  marks [DM] in the infrastructure of the new Laender by the end  of 1993. Of this amount, DM330 million has been spent in  Thuringia, Ruehe told correspondents in Erfurt today. In 1994,  another DM140 million would be allocated there. This afternoon  Ruehe attended a dedication ceremony for the first 128  Thuringian Bundeswehr apartments in Bad Frankenhausen (Artern  district).    According to Ruehe, 295 Bundeswehr apartments in eastern  Germany are to be ready for occupancy this year. The overall  plan at 44 sites amounts to approximately 7,800 apartments.  From 1993 to 1995, DM275 million has been earmarked for this  purpose. For the moment the German Government is helping build  some 3,000 apartments at 29 sites in eastern Germany.    Ruehe said that the Bundeswehr is regarded with growing  trust  in the east. A clear indication of this in Thuringia is, for  example, the links between units stationed there and many local  communities. Public swearing-in ceremonies are meeting with a  "positive response." During the floods in April, 1,300 soldiers  were deployed in Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia.    The minister stressed that the training level of the 11,000  east German Bundeswehr soldiers, including 3,000 officers and  5,000 noncommissioned officers, is "scarcely below" that of the  west. They will achieve the same operational capability as in  western Germany by 1995.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the </F> Palestinian delegation to the Cairo talks, in Tunis, by Moshe  Shlonsky, commander of IDF Radio in Tunis, "earlier today" --  recorded in English]    [Text] [Shlonsky] Mr. Sha'th, what is your reaction to  this morning's terror attack in Hadera?    [Sha'th] I have heard of this incident, and it makes me very  sad and very angry to see civilians, innocent people get killed  in Hadera, in 'Afula, in Hebron, or in Gaza. To me this is all  needless bloodshed of innocent people that should be stopped  immediately; by continuing the peace process, it can be stopped.    [Shlonsky] You know, the Israelis are waiting for an  official condemnation by Chairman Yasir 'Arafat...    [Sha'th, interrupting] The chairman has just made a  statement in Strasbourg that I believe has been communicated  everywhere.    [Shlonsky] In which he is condemning the attack?    [Sha'th] Yes.    [Shlonsky] You know, the Israelis were very surprised after  the Hebron...not surprised, but maybe disappointed, that after  the Hebron attack the Palestinians withdrew from the talks. Do  you expect the Israelis to do the same now or to continue it?    [Sha'th] I think we should continue this peace process,  because I think we should not confuse the cause and effect -- I  mean the more we delay this peace process the more it will  encourage the enemies of the peace process to continue doing  things like this, whether in Hebron or in Hadera. And I see now  more than ever that we need to finish as quickly as possible and  implement our peace on the ground in order to swing the whole  public opinion in the Palestinian areas, in the Palestinian  occupied territories and in Israel to support the peace process.    [Shlonsky] You know, there is a feeling in Israel that you  cannot control your people, or the Palestinians as a whole, to  continue terrorist attacks [sentence as heard]. The peace  process is continuing, and while the peace process is continuing  these terrorist attacks are occurring here and there.    [Sha'th] Yes, this is very natural, because so long as we  have absolutely no way to control these matters -- our police  force is still totally outside the territories, and our people  also have occurrences such as the massacre in the Hebron mosque  -- there is no way to either control by police or to control by  public support. We have a peace process, but this peace process  has not been implemented on the ground and people have not seen  any of its benefits, nor any of its police manifestations.</p>

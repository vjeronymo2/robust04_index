			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Tory policies pump up numbers in Whitehall: Agencies recruit for market testing - Civil Service grows bt more than 11,000 recent Treasury statistics on staffing show a 11,456 increase in the year to April 1 1992 - is partly the result of government initiatives such as contracting out. According to one Whitehall mandarin: 'Every department and agency now has to have a market-testing unit - which means extra people on the payroll.' Analysis by the Financial Times shows that one area of growth has been the executive agencies set up to provide government services on more businesslike lines. One agency chief suggested to the FT that the process of creating agencies had itself required extra staff to manage the new units. 'Devolution of management responsibilities means replicating functions in each agency which were previously provided by centralised Whitehall departments,' he said. Mrs Ann Robinson, head of the Policy Unit at the Institute of Directors, condemned the growth: 'There has been no overall reduction in number of people employed in the public sector, which has failed to match the efficiency gains made in private sector companies such as BT. 'If the chancellor is going to reduce public spending to curb the budget deficit, he has no alternative but to look at the number of people employed in the public services.' Of the 28 oldest Whitehall agencies 21 have taken on more staff since being freed from direct control of Whitehall departments. Substantial growth in the Employment Service is linked to the rise in unemployment. But many smaller agencies such as the Radiocommunications Agency and the Social Security IT Services Agency have also added numbers since 1990. In many cases, the extra staff have been taken on to meet increased demand for services once agencies have been given their entrepreneurial head. However, the 28 oldest agencies had increased their staff from 74,927 at inception to 84,081 by April 1992, a 12 per cent increase. The growth in staff in the agencies raises questions over the success of executive agencies in controlling costs, says Professor Peter Hennessey, professor of contemporary history at Queen Mary College, London and a specialist on Whitehall. 'It is very depressing that Mrs Thatcher's crude axe of fixed targets appears to be the only approach which works,' he said. The growth in the Civil Service - which now has a total staff of 565,319 - runs contrary to the government's claim at the last general election that it has reduced the number of civil servants to the lowest level since the second world war. While the blue-collar Civil Service continues to shrink, the drive to reduce the number of white-collar civil servants appears to have run out of steam. The number of white-collar civil servants increased last year, taking the total back to the level of 1984. Reducing the number of civil servants was one of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's highest priorities when the Conservatives came to power in 1979. She inherited a Civil Service of 732,000 and launched a campaign to reduce the number of civil servants by 100,000 by April 1994. That target was comfortably achieved, with the number of white-collar staff falling by more than 60,000. This drop of 11 per cent was largely achieved by setting across-the-board staffing targets which forced departments to become more streamlined and abandon some activities. However, the biggest cuts proportionately fell on the industrial civil servants, the blue-collar employees working mainly in defence areas and the Property Services Agency. Their numbers fell by more than a quarter as naval dockyards were closed and Royal Ordnance Factories privatised. While overall staffing in the Civil Service has continued to shrink since 1984, the reduction has been entirely among the industrial staff. By April 1992 the industrial Civil Service had fallen to 61,082 employees, 37 per cent of the total in 1979. The number of white-collar civil servants has stuck around 500,000 since 1984. Although some departments such as trade and industry have reduced their white-collar payrolls, others such as the Home Office and the social security department have grown. Ministerial policy decisions are often responsible for the growth in departmental staff. For example, the expansion of the prison service has contributed to the growth in the size of the Home Office. The creation of the Crown Prosecution Service has added almost 5,700 civil servants to the total to do work previously done by the police. The economy also influences numbers of civil servants. For example, growing unemployment has required 9,000 extra staff in the in the past two years to pay benefits, counsel the unemployed and run schemes for the long-term jobless. The housing boom in the 1980s greatly increased the work of the Land Registry. Similarly, when the economy was buoyant, more cars were bought, adding to the burden of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency at Swansea.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        WORKING FOR THE STATE:          the decline and rise of the government's labour force  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- White-collar staff in government departments          Jan 1st   Apr 1st                                                          1980      1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Agriculture                                            12,608     9,392 Customs and Excise                                     27,429    26,398 Defence                                               113,161    90,682 Education                                               2,588     2,689 Employment                                             44,535    52,365 Environment                                             9,969     6,887 Foreign Office (includes Overseas Development)         11,386     9,853 Health and Safety Executive                             4,048     4,094 Health and Social Security                             95,108    82,928 Home Office                                            29,909    46,783 Inland Revenue                                         78,940    68,893 Land Registry                                           5,799     9,553 Lord Chancellor's Department                            9,905    11,598 Scottish Office                                         9,809     9,802 Trade and Industry                                     15,745    11,198 Transport                                              12,925    14,392 Welsh Office                                            2,371     2,304 Others                                                 62,318    44,286  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                                                 548,553   504,237  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Civil Service Statistics, 1980, 1992, HMSO  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

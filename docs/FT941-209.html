			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Record-beating legislator of the old school Congressman William Natcher, chairman of the House of Representatives appropriations committee, died on Tuesday night at the age of 84. In his 40 years in Congress Mr Natcher never accepted a campaign contribution nor, until illness kept him away earlier this month, missed a single vote. His record of appearing in person for 18,401 consecutive roll call votes and quorum calls appears unlikely to be surpassed. Although scarcely known outside the confines of Capitol Hill - he never hired a press secretary, and attracted substantial media coverage almost for the first time when his voting record ended - Mr Natcher was viewed by congressional insiders as the epitome of the old-style legislator, committed to getting results. 'What distinguishes the best of the old bulls from the rest of the House is their dedication to making things happen when something needs to be done but there is no consensus, to fulfilling their charge as legislators. What distinguishes many of the junior colleagues from old bulls is their dedication to posturing over legislating,' lamented Mr Norman Ornstein, a political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, in an article in Roll Call, Congress's village newspaper. Mr Natcher, who represented northwestern Kentucky, left his mark on decades of labour, health and education spending through his long chairmanship of the appropriations subcommittee in charge of these sectors. Although the appropriations committee is supposed merely to dole out annual spending allocations within the policy framework set by the various congressional authorising committees, its decisions on whether to provide the money for a programme more often than not has the effect of fixing US policy. The House and Senate appropriations committees have long been the bastions of the seniority system, in which members of Congress climb to power in accordance with their length of service. Mr Natcher himself only took over as chairman of the full committee in 1992, succeeding the ailing Congressman Jamie Whitten of Mississippi. Mr Whitten is seven months younger than Mr Natcher, but holds a record of his own with 52 years of continuous service in the House. When Mr Natcher himself became too ill to continue, Democratic House members voted to break with the seniority system, picking the outspoken Congressman David Obey of Wisconsin to take over the appropriations committee, rather than Congressman Neal Smith of Iowa, the 74-year-old, next in line to Mr Natcher.</p>

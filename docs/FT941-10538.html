			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / People: Melbourn promoted at NatWest A chain of moves in the top management of National Westminster Bank was disclosed yesterday, led by the appointment of John Melbourn, the bank's head of group risk, to succeed Bert Morris as the bank's deputy chief executive. The reshuffle is one of the most significant changes to the bank's senior roster since Derek Wanless was appointed chief executive in 1992. The changes, which all involve bank insiders, will take place from March 1. Melbourn, a 56-year-old who was thought to be a contender for the chief executive's job when Derek Wanless was appointed, is one of the bank's most experienced hands, having headed international operations and its relationships with large companies. Wanless says that Melbourn is 'a tremendous banker' who would bring a wide range of experience to the post. Melbourn will work alongside Morris until September, when the latter is due to retire. Melbourn will retain board responsibility for credit risk, and the handling of large corporate restructurings. But his current deputy, Fred Pointon, has been appointed to the post of general manager of group risk in his place. A second significant change announced yesterday is the appointment of Phil Wise, the current chief executive of group services, as chief operating officer at NatWest Markets, the bank's corporate and investment banking arm. Wise, 45, has worked with Martin Owen, the chief executive of NatWest Markets, before when the men brought together the bank's treasury operations. Like other securities houses, NatWest Markets had a good year amid buoyant bond and equity markets. Wanless has signalled that the bank is considering ways of building on its investment banking business to help raise revenues. NatWest Markets' two senior managing directors, Roger Byatt and John Howland-Jackson, have been appointed deputy chief executives. Wise will be succeeded at group services by Trevor Blackler, general manager of UK branch business. Stuart Chandler, general manager for human resources and strategic development, has been appointed to the new post of deputy chief executive for UK branch business with responsibility for technology and human resources.</p>

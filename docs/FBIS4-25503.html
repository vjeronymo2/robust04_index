			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 10 (CNA) -- Taiwan's information and  electronics industries saw a major turnaround last year,  contributing much to the growth of the manufacturing sector,  according to a survey by COMMONWEALTH magazine.    The information and electronics industries were hard hit by  a  worldwide economic recession in 1992, and many companies in the  fields went bankrupt.    However, the two industries rebounded strongly last year,  with the information industry registering an average profit rate  of 4.9 percent and electronics makers achieving an even more  impressive 8.3 percent profit rate, the Chinese-language  business magazine said in its June issue.    The average profit rates for the information and electronics  industries were 1.4 percent and 3.9 percent respectively in 1992.    The magazine said aggregate business turnover of Taiwan's  top  1,000 manufacturing companies totaled NT$3 trillion (us$111.11  billion) in 1993, up 11 percent from the year-earlier level.  About 54 percent of the increased turnover came from the  information and electronics industries, the magazine added.    A total of 257 information and electronics firms made the  "COMMONWEALTH top 1,000" list.    The magazine said the top 1,000 firms' business turnover  accounted for 65 percent of the manufacturing industry's total  production for 1993, compared with 51 percent recorded in 1987.    The figures show large enterprises have gradually become the  mainstay of Taiwan's manufacturing industry following an exodus  of small and medium sized companies in recent years, the  magazine noted.    It added that although cumulative turnover of the top 1,000  firms rose only 11 percent in 1993, their net profits increased  by an average of 30 percent, indicating their efforts to  streamline management and control operational costs have paid  off.    The commonwealth survey also found non-metal furniture and  wooden product manufacturers saw 69 percent growth in their  business turnover last year, the highest among the 24 industries  under study. On the other hand, chemical, paper and automaking  industries suffered turnover declines.</p>

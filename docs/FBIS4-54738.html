			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government  approved today the draft law on registration offices which makes  it possible for the ethnic minorities to use their first names  and surnames without having to adopt Slovak forms. The leaders  of the 560,000 ethnic Hungarians have demanded that the law be  passed. Its adoption was among the conditions Slovakia pledged  to observe when it was admitted to the Council of Europe (CE)  last June. The law in force, passed under former Meciar's  cabinet, did not fully comply with the CE conditions.    The members of ethnic minorities will be allowed to write  their first names and surnames as it is usual in their  languages, Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner said. This means  that the female surnames will not have to add the Slovak suffix  "ova," and may retain the Hungarian suffix "ne." "Retroactive  change in first names and surnames, stipulated by the law, will  be free of charge," Pittner told CTK.    After the law is passed, there will remain only one unmet  pledge to the CE: bilingual names of the communities inhabited  by ethnic minorities. Last autumn Meciar's cabinet decided to  remove bilingual (mostly Slovak-Hungarian) signposts, replacing  them with only Slovak ones.</p>

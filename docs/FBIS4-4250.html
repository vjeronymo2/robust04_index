			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xu Jingyong (6079 4842 0516) of Xiamen University </F> Economics Department, edited by Lu Yang (6424 7122): "Three  Stages of China's Reform of Prices of Agricultural Products"]    [Text] I. First Step in Agricultural Products Price  Reform Is To Reform Their Formation Mechanism and Change From  Setting Prices By Administration to the Market Price System    The success of microeconomic structural reform in China's  rural areas greatly promotes them in changing from the  self-sufficient and semi-self-sufficient economy to the  commodity economy and the dominant role of market mechanism over  the behavior of contractors is increasingly strengthened. The  peasants are paying increased attention to weighing and  comparing the high and low amounts of interests. With such a  background, the growth in the market for agricultural products  and the improvement of their market mechanism will inevitably  become principal contradictions which must be overcome.    The microeconomic structural reform in China's rural areas  has enabled the peasants to obtain the right of operation and  use of land that belongs to the collective but it takes as  prerequisites the identity of land ownership by the collective  and the guarantee of land ownership in achieving economically  residual recourse; moreover, it must also identify itself with  the governmental privilege of compulsory fixed quota purchases  of agricultural products at low cost. Under such an economic  operational mechanism, the peasant families cannot always accept  regulation by market price signals but must also accept, on many  occasions, regulation by quantity signals transmitted by the  government to the lower levels. This makes the reform of the  traditional purchasing and marketing system and pricing system  for agricultural products the central link in building a normal  socialist market economy system and in improving the market  mechanism.    The agricultural products price reform carried out by China  for more than 10 years was aimed at reforming the pricing  system, i.e., changing the pricing structure, which was  originally seriously twisted, into a rational pricing structure  which truly reflects values and supply and demand relations and  to build price parity and price difference relations which have  and economic basis, so that various trades and industries can  get more or less the same level of profit rate from funds. On  the other hand, it was also aimed at reforming the pricing  formation mechanism, achieving the transition from setting  prices by administration to a market price system, and letting  prices give play to their functions under an open, unified, and  competitive market system. In reforms in these two aspects, the  reform of the latter aspect is the more important and essential.  Only by reforming the price formation mechanism, and by letting  prices build up by themselves in market exchanges, can prices  truly reflect the extent of deficiency of resources and the  market supply and demand relations, to make relative price  changes beneficial to the rationalization of the pricing  structure.    The basic functions of prices are mainly manifested in two  respects, resources allocation and exchanges. Under the state  monopoly for purchasing and marketing agricultural products and  the old microeconomic organization, compulsory purchase (or  monopoly imposed purchase) added the functions of regulating  income and distribution into the prices of agricultural  products, which mixed up the functions of income and  distribution with those of exchanges. The functions of resources  allocation were completely replaced by mandatory plans, which  led to the twisting of price functions and seriously inhibited  the growth of the agricultural products market. The starting  point for price setting and price regulation of agricultural  products by administration lay in carrying out the functions of  income and distribution and in stimulating the initiatives of  the producers of agricultural products by raising their  purchasing prices which had remained low over a long period of  time. When purchasing prices were raised and selling prices  remained unchanged, financial burdens increased. Price  subsidies which the state spent on domestic purchases and sales  of agricultural products and on the purchases and sales of  imported products rose from 6.995 billion yuan in 1978 to 36.262  billion yuan in 1984, an annual average progressive increase of  31.5 percent, greatly exceeding the rate of annual progressive  increase of 4.6 percent in total revenue during this period.  The proportion of revenue it accounted for also rose from 6.24  percent in 1978 to 24.8 percent in 1984. The accumulative total  spent on these subsidies in six years reached 167.439 billion  yuan, equivalent to 24.3 percent of the revenue during the  corresponding period. It was inevitable that it would bring  about a serious imbalance between revenue and expenditure. In  the traditional purchases and sales system for agricultural  products, which was linked with prices regulation by  administration, there were no equal market relations between  purchases and sales. Because of low prices, purchases had  partly the nature of paying taxes and, because of low prices,  sales had partly the nature of welfare. Administrative price  regulations linking income and distribution with product  exchanges could only acquire supply prosperity by increases in  hidden subsidies without fundamentally solving the problem of  the price formation mechanism.    Practical experience in China's rural reforms shows that  certain conditions are required to completely restore the  resources allocation and exchange functions which prices should  have, enable the product market to grow fully, and to finally  achieve the transformation from the system of setting prices by  the state to the market price system. These functions require  that both exchanging parties should be built on the basis of  voluntariness, mutual benefit, and true equality. The income  and distribution functions embodied in such prices would be  separate from exchange functions. On that basis, the functions  of resources allocation by prices can be truly brought into play  by the producers' reorientation of production and promotion of  the flow of productive factors.    After the mid-1980's, China released, by stages and in  groups, the purchases and sales as well as the prices of  agricultural products, thus bringing essential changes in the  generating mechanism for agricultural products prices. More  than 10 years have elapsed since the first step in China's  agricultural prices reform which started in 1979 and has lasted  up till now and the guiding position of market prices in the  sphere of agricultural products has been basically established,  with market mechanism playing a dominant role in price formation.  <H5>  II. The Second Step in Agricultural Products Prices Reform </H5> Is To Achieve Merchandization and Marketization of the  Productive Factors    Practical experience tells us that: To enable the peasants  to achieve the goal of increasing income through increased  production, we must release the purchases and sales, as well as  the prices of agricultural products, and let supply and demand,  production, and sales meet face to face, so that the peasants  can produce more products with a large market demand and whose  prices are expected to rise according to the information of  changes in social demand structure. However, the readjustment  of rural industries or product mix with the market as guidance  presupposes changes in factor structure. It thus requires that  various productive factors should be allowed to flow freely  among various peasant households and, therefore a flexible and  developed factor market is the basic guarantee for the  industries or product mix to make rapid readjustment according  to market demand.    The essence of the reform of factor prices lies in a  developed factor market. Viewed from the angle of economic  development, this is more important than a developed product  market because: 1) without resources allocation of the factor  market, only the relative comparative superiority of the  allocation subject, that is, each individual peasant household  itself can be brought into play but the relative comparative  superiority among peasant households and between various areas  cannot be used, nor can the factor compensation rate be raised  with the aid of factor flow. The extent of optimization of such  resources allocation mechanism is extremely limited; 2) By  re-composition of land, labor, funds, and technology between  areas, a developed factor market can help the economy of  developed areas to promote the economic development of backward  areas, thus gradually minimizing the gap in the economic  development level between areas.    The purchases and sales, as well as the agricultural product  prices, in China at present have been basically released and the  agricultural products market has developed on a preliminary  basis. However, the market prices of labor, funds, land, and  other factors are still far from being built up and, therefore,  greatly restrict the market from bringing its role of resources  allocation into full play. This is an extremely important  reason why the second stage reform (reform of the circulation  system and the industrial structure) in China's rural areas,  which started in 1985, could not achieve a fundamental essential  breakthrough. It should be fully realized that the difficulties  and risks in agricultural factors price reform are far greater  than those in agricultural products price reforms. First, this  reform is incompatible with traditional theories and concepts.  If the market and prices of agricultural products remain  incompatible with traditional theories and concepts, then the  market and prices of agricultural productive factors (such as  funds, labor, land, etc.) will seriously deviate from the  standards and criteria of traditional theories and concepts.  Secondly, before China's economic structural reform, there was  neither a market nor prices of agricultural productive factors.  Therefore, after economic structural reform in the rural areas,  the growth of the market for agricultural productive factors was  extremely slow, and the phenomena of the absence of their  prices, were quite serious, not to mention the possibility of  building up their normal supply and demand relations.    The allocation of agricultural productive factors is  generally first expressed in the allocation of funds. The  readjustment of the agricultural production structure, in the  final analysis, is the readjustment of the structure of funds.  This requires opening up the fund market to meet the needs of  the merchandization and marketization of the rural economy.  Essentially speaking, it is aimed at developing various kinds  of financial activities according to the requirements of the law  of market economy.    Besides relying on its own slow accumulation of funds,  China's agriculture also relies on indirect merging of funds as  its major source. Unitary banking assets and shortage of bank  funds inevitably require breaking the unitary finance channel  and building many kinds of optional credit forms and finance  channels to solve the problems of fund shortages for production  and construction.    To develop fund markets in the rural areas, we should attach  importance to developing nonsystematized banking, that is,  borrowing among the people. However, its limitations are  enormous and requires further developing transregional  systematized banking. Fund prices are the outcome of the  marketization of funds. The development of fund market will  inevitably be followed by corresponding reforms in fund prices,  that is, in the interest rate system. China's traditional  interest rate system was the outcome of the planned economy and  its major problem was to inhibit, or even repel, the  marketization of fund prices, making the price of funds as  deficient resources excessively low. This requires changing the  current interest rate system, readjusting the irrational  interest rate structure, and gradually building a floating  interest rate system with the central bank's loan interest rates  as hte standards, to bring into play the regulatory role of the  interest rate lever over the supply and demand of funds. Once  the conditions are ripe for building the market economy system,  interest rates will then immediately follow up and become  marketized and compete freely.    China's agricultural labor factor is quite abundant and in  the rural areas there is no such thing as a labor employment  system, with state responsibility and overall assignment as in  cities, which is favorable to promoting the building of rural  labor market and reducing the difficulty in reform of prices of  rural labor. Under the circumstances of the unlimited supply of  labor in China's rural areas at present, labor market and the  prices of labor related to it can only grow gradually in the  course of economic development. The method is to readjust the  rural employment structure and increase the number of jobs in  the course of speeding up rural industrialization and promoting  urbanization. When the market economy in the rural areas  develops, it will inevitably open up new economic spheres,  provide ever-developing employment opportunities, and create  conditions for the building of labor market prices.    The building of a land market in China's rural areas was a  fairly difficult process. The initial growth started from the  contract- based land management responsibility system carried  out in the late 1970's and early 1980's. For the nearly 30  years before that, because land ownership and the right of  operation of land were highly centralized, a land market had  always been strictly prohibited by the government. However,  after land was operated on a contract basis by peasant  households, land transfer and subcontracting exchanges between  peasant households increased daily. As regards government  policies, in 1984 it was clearly put forward that it was  necessary to encourage the transfer and concentration of  farmland in good farming hands; in 1985 peasant households were  allowed to transfer and subcontract land with pay and a  contract- based system of land with pay was encouraged; in 1987  subcontracting of land in legal forms was allowed; and in 1988  legal provisions on prohibiting buying and selling, leasing, or  transferring land were revised by the government. These were  favorable to the building and growth of the rural land market  and land prices.    The major problems hindering the growth of China's land  market and land prices at present are: 1) in the great majority  of areas, land contracts are still based on low compensation or  even gratis. In economically developed areas, there is still the  situation wherein subsidies are given to the peasants for  growing grain and sugar cane instead of putting into effect the  use of land for payment. Land ceases to be a commodity and  actually becomes pure welfare with no value at all; 2) land has  not yet truly become a commodity and is still prohibited by law  from entering the circulation market. In particular, it is  still impossible for land ownership to be bought and sold  through the market and to flow rationally. For example, in  requisitioning collective land for use, the state generally  compensates for agricultural loss alone without recognizing that  land has value. However, after land requisition, the unit that  uses the land changes hands and sells it, reaping staggering  profits from the real estate operation and making the value of  collective land flow in large amounts into the unit engaged in  real estate operation. In light of the abovementioned problems,  it is necessary to recognize, in theory and practice and even in  law, that land is a commodity (a special kind of commodity), and  that collective land should be allowed to enter the market to be  bought, sold, transferred, mortgaged, and leased under  leadership and in a planned way under strict supervision and  management by various levels of state land departments and  within the scope of the use and plan for land. Of course, to  prevent privatization of land, it must be clearly stipulated  that the buying, selling, and transferral of land ownership can  only be conducted between units of public ownership. As for  leasing, buying, and selling the rights to use land within a  given period of time, these should not be subject to this kind  of restriction.    Whether land market operations are normal or not, the key  lies in the rationality of land prices. If land prices can  accurately reflect the supply and demand situation for land,  they will stimulate and guide the flow and use of land in  conformity with demand. No particular system has yet been set  up as to how to decide the prices in China's rural land market  at present; there is no standardization and scientific methods  are lacking. Such a situation must be changed. Scientific  price setting should be based on land appraisal and land market  forecasts. The fixing of land prices should include land  contract fees, transferral fees, and buying and selling prices.  We should gradually accomplish regulated land prices and rent  by the market competition mechanism and the transparency of  market transactions should be improved. When a state unit  requisitions collective land, both parties should discuss and  negotiate a price according to the local market situation and  must not adopt the method of requisition at low cost or without  pay. With the development of the commodity economy and the  secondary and tertiary industries in the rural areas, it is  necessary to introduce a market competition mechanism gradually  into the land contract-based system and recognize the  merchandization and valuation of land, to gradually build up a  land resources allocation system regulated by the market  mechanism.  <H5>  III. The Third Step in Agricultural Products Price Reform </H5> Will Be To Build a Mechanism Which Fits in With the Requirements  of the Development of Market Economy and Avoids the Risks of  Price Fluctuation    At present, transactions for most agricultural products are  made in a primitive markets of a primary nature and those done  in wholesale markets are extremely limited. Due to the lack of  a unified market system, the markets which have been built are  not just separate in space, the problems of regional blockades  and departmental monopolies have not yet been overcome, let  alone the possibility of building a mechanism for macroeconomic  regulation and control which effectively avoids the risks of  price fluctuation. Under such an undeveloped and constrained  market system, when there are crop failures or when prices are  expected to rise, individual, collective, or state-run  businesses will all try to force up prices and rush to make  purchases; conversely, there will be less purchases or no  purchases. There is now difficulty in selling, then in buying;  sometimes there appears to be a steep fall in market prices,  sometimes soaring prices appear and such a posture is often  expressed in a relationship of cause and effect emerging  alternately. The extent ofthe risks in circulation and prices  of agricultural products is extremely high, causing the  producers and consumers of agricultural products to suffer  serious losses. What requires pointing out especially is that,  in the industrial replacement of the national economy,  agriculture belongs to an industry with a weak nature and bears  the characteristics of low price elasticity in supply, low  income, and low price elasticity in demand, making the problem  extremely conspicuous.    In view of the above, the building a unified domestic market  for agricultural products on the basis of full market  development is needed That is, a market in which agricultural  products can flow freely on a nationwide basis and in which the  state can intervene by means of macroeconomic regulation and  control, thus placing the trade of major agricultural products  throughout China under government supervision, guidance, and  control. In a modern market economy there are two main methods  of avoiding the risks of price fluctuation: One is that the  government bears a part or all of the price risks. For  important agricultural products, the government carries out a  price guarantee or a price support system. At present, to  prevent agricultural products producers from suffering huge  economic losses due to steep falls in price, and to prevent  having a negative impact on the national economy, it is a basic  policy in most countries to carry out a general price protection  policy or price support policy for purchasing important  agricultural products.    The grain purchase and price policy implemented by the  Chinese Government in 1990 meant that, in essence, the  government bore all the risks in grain prices. The grain  protection prices or support prices formulated by the state that  year was generally 20 percent higher than market prices. Under  such circumstances, the grain peasants vied with each other to  sell grain to the state and were unwilling to sell it through  the grain trade market, thus abruptly depressing grain market  transactions. The result was that the problem whereby the  peasants had difficulty selling grain could in no way be  fundamentally overcome due to the extremely limited amount of  funds, bad circulation facilities, and insufficient storage  capacity on the part of the state. The government then worked  out guide or target prices and price risks (minor risks), within  a certain range, were borne by the producers and operators of  agricultural products, and price risks (major risks) beyond the  ceiling and lower limit of guide or target prices were borne by  the government. Whether or not the government bears all or a  part of the abovementioned risks in the prices of agricultural  products, it requires the setting up of equalization funds at  the levels of the central authorities and provinces  (municipalities), to regulate the market and to play the role of  storage ponds. It should be clearly pointed out that such  regulation comes under government behavior and the greater part  of the equalization funds should be included in the central and  provincial financial budgets. Of course, the income built up by  using the equalization funds in the course of buying and selling  agricultural products and in curbing market prices should also  serve as supplementary sources of equalization funds.    It is obvious from the above that it is impractical and  impossible for the Chinese Government to bear all the price  risks of agricultural products because government financial  resources in China up to the present stage have always been  quite tense. Moreover, such a way of doing things would be  unfavorable to the growth and maturity of the market economy in  China. Therefore, we should have our eyes on another method to  reform the mechanism for avoiding the risk of price fluctuations  in agricultural products, i.e., with the aid of self-regulation,  compensation, and balance functions peculiar to the market  economy, we should break down and shift the price risks of  agricultural products and let them be borne by risk investors.  Such a method meets the objective requirements for the  development of market economy and is an intrinsic mechanism and  function which is developing and improving in the modern market  economy. Its role is realized by a modern futures market.    The so-called modern futures market refers to one in which  special transactions of standardized futures contracts are made  and which has the special functions of index-linked arbitrage  futures and of avoiding the risks of price fluctuation. The  futures and spot markets complement each other and together  constitute a complete modern market system. A modern futures  market is an indispensable part of a modern market economy and  has the following two most basic and important functions:    The first function is that a modern futures market can avoid  the risks of price fluctuation. That is, the risks of price  fluctuation which appear on the spot market can be effectively  broken down and transferred by index-linked arbitrage futures  onto the futures market. The forms of futures transactions for  agricultural products are many and varied but can be divided  into two types according to the purpose of the transactions:  One is a transaction involving index-linked arbitrage futures  with the purpose of shifting the price risks of agricultural  products; the other is a speculative transaction with the  purpose of making profits. Under such circumstances, the  bearers of price fluctuation of agricultural products are the  investors seeking risk profits or risk income on the futures  market and it is unnecessary for the production operators and  consumers of agricultural products to pay the price. For those  engaged in index-linked arbitage futures, it is for the purpose  of avoiding the risks of prices of agricultural products by  giving up possible maximum profits. As for the risk investors,  they dare to bear the greatest risks for the purpose of possibly  gaining the greatest profits.    The second function is that a modern futures market can  provide quite correct and stable price signals, which is  favorable to reducing blindness in action and the short-term  nature of resources allocation. As the futures market of  agricultural products makes long-term transactions, the supply  and demand relations they reflect are also long-term and the  prices built up are relatively stable. Moreover, the building of  futures prices of agricultural products is the outcome of full  competition among the numerous market participants, representing  the expectations of all market participants for future prices  and can therefore, quite correctly, reflect the supply and  demand relations of the market in the future. Thus, the prices  of futures transactions of agricultural products are not only of  a stronger expected nature than spot transaction prices but also  of a stronger expected nature than forward contract transaction  prices. On this basis, the rationality of decisionmaking in  production and operation by producers and operators of  agricultural products can also be strengthened. This explains  why the futures market and futures prices of agricultural  products are the highest forms of operation of market mechanism  of agricultural products. It thus decides that the third step  of the reform of China's agricultural prices should be one of  building a mechanism which avoids the risks of price fluctuation  of agricultural products. It should be carried out around the  center of building and developing a socialist futures market, to  make full use of and bring into full play the intrinsic  self-regulation and balance functions of the market economy  itself and to enable price signals to play their proper role to  the maximum in agricultural resources allocation.</p>

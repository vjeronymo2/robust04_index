			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Tosco Corp. reported net income for 1988 jumped 71% to $90.4 million on  revenues of $1.14 billion, down 4% from 1987. The Santa Monica-based  independent oil refiner said the year-end results represented the highest  earnings from operations since 1979, and that the improvement in 1988 was  primarily due to a significant increase in refining margins.  </P></p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / International Company News: Australian pay-TV alliance to be disbanded Australian Pay Television, the consortium of powerful media and telecommunication interests which was formed to pursue pay-TV opportunities in the country, is to be disbanded. The consortium included Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Limited, Mr Kerry Packer's Nine Network, and Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications group. The Ten network, which runs Australia's other commercial channel, withdrew from the grouping in July. Yesterday, Mr Frank Blount, Telecom chief executive, said it had 'become increasingly clear that the consortium, having failed to win a satellite licence, has not reached consensus on a business plan for alternative delivery for pay-TV services in Australia'. Pay-TV is not yet available to Australian households. However, Australis, holder of one of the satellite licences, has pledged to have a system ready this year.</p>

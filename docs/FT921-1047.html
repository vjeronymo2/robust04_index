			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Hepworth contains fall to Pounds 70.4m HEPWORTH, the building materials and home products company, managed to contain last year's expected fall in UK profits due to higher than anticipated growth in Europe. Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 70.4m (Pounds 90.1m) in the year to December 31. Turnover slipped to Pounds 661.3m (Pounds 686.2m) as UK operations were affected by the depressed construction industry and recession. Mr John Carter, who took over as chief executive last month after Mr Sinclair Thomson was forced to resign through ill health, said the company did not expect a quick economic recovery but remained confident in the medium term. Operating profits in the building products division, which includes drainage pipes and plastic plumbing, fell 39 per cent to Pounds 20.6m. Despite a severe downturn in the UK, clayware products increased sales in Europe. Saunier Duval, the French boiler maker acquired in 1990, lifted operating profits to Pounds 22.9m and reported continuing strong growth in Spain and Italy. Home products, which includes garage doors and heating products, managed to increase profits 10 per cent to Pounds 16.8m, despite declining markets. Most of the growth came in the second half from Glow-worm boilers, which improved sales and profits. Refractories and minerals saw profits decline 21 per cent and 27 per cent respectively, mainly due to recession. Earnings fell to 24.3p (30.9p) but the final dividend is held at 9.35p for an unchanged total of 14.85p. Cash flow remained strong and net borrowings fell to Pounds 57.5m following a Pounds 6.5m debt reduction. This, combined with an increase in shareholders's funds, reduced gearing from 44 per cent to 33 per cent. COMMENT Hepworth's results were in line with expectations so the 14p rise in the share price to 379p was slightly surprising. Perhaps the shares are merely making up for losses since the appointment of Mr Carter. Certainly the City seemed pleased with his performance yesterday, and is reassured that Hepworth's strategy will remain essentially the same. The company has long been touted as an early beneficiary of recovery, and Glow-worm's performance again demonstrated the potential of the group's brand names. The only dark spots are refractories and minerals which are likely to do no better than maintain profits and could fare worse if further rationalisation costs are incurred. Forecast profits for the year range from Pounds 71m to Pounds 77m, putting the shares on a multiple of about 15, suggesting most of the good news is in the price.</p>

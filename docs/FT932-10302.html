			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Agreement near on drugs price plan FINAL negotiations are expected to start today between the department of health and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry aimed at concluding the scheme that sets the rate of return for drugs companies operating in the UK. Talks about the scheme, known as the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme, started eight months ago. One drugs group executive said: 'There is quite a lot of good will. We hope to conclude the negotiations over the next few weeks, although there is still quite a gap between what we want and the department's proposals.' The industry is anxious to end the negotiations. The government needs to save money on its drugs bill during this financial year and if the scheme is not settled early ministers could be tempted to introduce a freeze on drugs prices - or even price cuts similar to those recently introduced in Germany. According to the association, the National Health Service drugs bill was Pounds 3.49bn last year and is estimated to be increasing by between 12 per cent and 14 per cent a year. Meanwhile, the NHS advisory committee on drugs, set up to decide which drugs within 10 therapeutic areas the NHS will no longer pay for, met on Thursday. The committee is expected to publish its final conclusions soon on topical anti-rheumatics, anti-diarrhoeal medicines, appetite suppressants and drugs for vaginal and vulval conditions. The association wants any recommendations to be the subject of full parliamentary debate. The committee is also expected to inform companies soon of its preliminary recommendations on three other groups - hypnotics and anxiolitics, drugs used in anaemia, and topical cortico-steroids. The association is anxious that the rate of return on capital employed set by the scheme should not be reduced. It claims the rate, set at between 17 per cent and 21 per cent, is reasonable and that the actual return is less than 10 per cent. The association is also anxious to correct an element within the scheme which appears to provide a disincentive for exporting. Under the present complex rules any increase in exports in effect reduces permitted UK profits. American members of the association are known to be worried about measures to control promotional expenditure, which is limited to about 9 per cent of sales to the National Health Service.</p>

In Canada on a tour of North American Free Trade Agreement  (NAFTA) members, Han said he expects North Korea to come forward  with a positive response soon.    "Chances are high that North Korea will reopen contact with  the United States this week in New York and reveal its  position," said Han.    Han's optimism follows a statement last Saturday by the  North  Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman claiming Washington has told  Pyongyang it wants to solve the nuclear problem through dialogue  and that North Korea also wants such a solution.    He called the statement "a meaningful change" on North  Korea's part and predicted a meeting with the United States  before the IAEA negotiations.    South Korean sources explained that North Korea and the  United States have had opportunities to exchange views, although  not in official surroundings like the New York contact. [passage  omitted]    U.S. congressmen and the press have been pressing the  administration to take punitive action against North Korea for  refusing to submit to IAEA inspections.    Han, however, emphasized a diplomatic solution in his talks  with U.S. officials last week.    Washington had left the inspection issue to be solved by  North Korea and the IAEA, refusing to negotiate on behalf of the  Agency or to meddle in details.    But the United States decided to reopen contact with North  Korea this week at South Korea's urging for another try at a  diplomatic solution, according to the sources. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mayhew seeks US backing on Ulster SIR PATRICK Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, is to visit the US early next month in an attempt to win backing for British policy on the province, Ralph Atkins writes. His trip comes amid continuing anxiety in Whitehall about how US policy on Northern Ireland will develop under President Bill Clinton. Sir Patrick will concentrate on explaining Britain's 'neutral' role in the province but also its commitment to keeping the province as part of the UK so long as that is backed by a majority of its population. Visits to the US by Northern Ireland Office ministers in recent years have tended to concentrate more on promoting investment in the province. Sir Patrick hopes to re-start political talks after the local elections in the province on May 19, involving Unionists, nationalists, and the British and Irish governments. He is opposed to the sending of a US 'peace envoy' as mooted by President Clinton but would accept a delegation with a less specific role. Britain is concerned about the adoption of the so-called 'MacBride principles' for company investment polices by US state and city governments. The principles are meant to promote employment of Catholics but Britain argues that existing 'fair employment' laws are sufficiently tough. On his visits to New York, Washington and Boston Sir Patrick will meet members of the government, Senate, and churches as well as the media. As the government steps up efforts to bring the participants back to negotiations, Mr John Major, prime minister, yesterday met Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, last night called on Unionist politicians to enter unconditional talks on the future of the province. He also made it clear that any proposed political solution for Ulster based on purely internal arrangements would not secure support in Dublin.</p>

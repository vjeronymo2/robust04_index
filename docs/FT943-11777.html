			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: All-round growth lifts Menvier-Swain 23% Growing recovery in the UK helped Menvier-Swain Group, the emergency lighting and alarms manufacturer, increase pre-tax profits by 23 per cent from Pounds 7.62m to Pounds 9.36m during the year to April 30. Sales rose 24 per cent to Pounds 70.3m. The Oxfordshire-based group, which came to the USM in 1986, said it would move to a full listing as soon as possible. The shares closed 13p higher at 237p. Mr Roy McDowell, chairman, said: 'This has been a year of steady progress in all areas in which the group operates. The improvement in the UK market has continued with sales levels moving ahead strongly.' Having made five acquisitions in the previous year, the group had deliberately concentrated on the integration of previous purchases and internal investment. The board and senior management had also been strengthened. Mr Roger Fletcher, chief executive, said capital expenditure of Pounds 6m was unusually high, which would be reflected in future profits and sales. The group spent more than Pounds 2m on a new lighting factory in France, to be occupied next month, and Pounds 500,000 on production equipment for a new emergency lighting product, Britelite, which would be sold throughout Europe. More than half of sales are overseas, and the strong performance in the UK was partly offset by problems in continental Europe. A recent German acquisition received faulty products from a third party and the French lighting market continued to suffer from margin pressure. However, businesses in the Netherlands and Denmark continued to improve. Mr Fletcher said: 'Acquisitions are now on the cards again - particularly in security and fire alarms.' Mr McDowell will step down as non-executive chairman in September. He will be replaced by Mr Tony McCann, chief executive of Bricom, the airport servicing and parcel delivery company, who joined the board in January as a non-executive director along with Mr Peter Pollock, former chief executive of ML Holdings. Mr McDowell said: 'The financial year has started well with sales and profits in the first two months significantly ahead of last year. Improving market conditions, management changes and investment in new products and plant are all expected to contribute to another year of solid growth.' Earnings per share increased by 14 per cent to 12.94p (11.37p). A recommended final dividend of 2.9p makes a total of 4.2p (3.67p).</p>

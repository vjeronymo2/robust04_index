			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> ALR LANDS DEAL WITH COMPUTER RETAIL CHAIN  </P> <P> Advanced Logic Research Inc., the Irvine personal computer maker, said  Wednesday that it has signed its first deal with a major retail chain, while at  the same time reporting a 7% increase in earnings for its latest quarter.  </P> <P> ALR computers will now be sold in the 440 stores owned by Intelligent  Electronics, an Exton, Pa.-based retail chain that owns Todays Computers  Business Centers and Entre Computer Centers. The Pennsylvania firm could add  400 outlets if its pending acquisition of the Connecting Point of America chain  is completed.  </P> <P> "This deal opens doors for ALR's name exposure and a new channel of  distribution," said Dave Kirkey, ALR's vice president of marketing. "It will  bring a new level of credibility for us in the computer industry. We're not  just another clone, not just another box."  </P> <P> Under the two-year agreement, Intelligent Electronics will be the exclusive  national franchise retailer for ALR's line of personal computers.  </P> <P> In the past, ALR computers have been sold primarily through a group of about  1,000 resellers and through individual agreements with computer stores. Kirkey  said the deal with Intelligent Electronics could help sales in the reseller  channel by boosting the company's name recognition. Intelligent Electronics  reported revenue of $700 million last year.  </P> <P> Also Wednesday, ALR reported its quarterly results for the first time since  going public on April 11. For the second quarter ended March 31, the company  reported net income of $3.2 million, up 7% compared to $3 million for the  year-ago period. Sales were a record $44.8 million, up 207% from $14.6 million  a year ago.  </P> <P> For the six months ended March 31, the company reported net income of $6.2  million on revenue of $84.3 million, contrasted with net income of $1.5 million  on revenue of $27.5 million a year earlier.  </P> <P> Kirkey attributed the improved second-quarter results to growing acceptance of  the company's top-of-the-line computers.  </P> <P> He said the figures do not reflect sales resulting from another agreement  announced two weeks ago in which a national distributor, Softsel/Microamerica,  agreed to sell ALR's line of computers.  </P> <P> The company's underwriters for its stock offering, PaineWebber and  Prudential-Bache Capital Funding, announced Wednesday that they would exercise  their option to issue 450,000 additional shares of common stock.  </P> <P> After the offering, about 36.9% of ALR's stock will be in the public's hands.  </P> <P> The offering will yield about $5.4 million in proceeds for ALR, bringing its  total proceeds from going public to $36.8 million.  </P></p>

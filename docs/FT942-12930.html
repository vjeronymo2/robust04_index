The long-awaited announcement, aimed at reducing Tenneco's exposure to cyclical businesses, comes a day after Varity of the US revealed it is close to selling Massey Ferguson, a big rival to Tenneco's CaseIH brand in world tractor markets. Announcement of the sale of Massey to Atlanta-based Agco could be made today. Industry analysts estimate the Case IPO will yield about Dollars 500m for Tenneco, which the company plans to use to repay short-term debt and to pursue expansion of core businesses and new acquisitions. Case, Tenneco's largest division, employs 17,000 worldwide. It is the second-largest tractor producer in the US after Deere, and is second to Caterpillar in the manufacture of construction equipment in the US. In Europe, Case is one of the top three companies in the tractor market and is a significant producer of construction equipment through Case Poclain of France, of which it owns 98.4 per cent. Case is enjoying an increasein demand from US farm and construction industries. In the first quarter, it earned Dollars 81m, nearly matching profits for full-year 1993 of Dollars 82m. But its European operations continue to make losses. Tenneco reported first-quarter operating earnings rose to Dollars 301m or 67 cents a share on sales of Dollars 3.3bn, from year-ago earnings of Dollars 275m or 46 cents on sales of Dollars 3.2bn. Shares of the new Case Corporation would be listed in New York. Tenneco did not include an offering price in its filing. Analysts said that with Dollars 1.1bn in equity and Dollars 1.5bn in debt, and projected 1994 earnings of Dollars 300m, Case Corporation's 70m shares would be priced somewhere in the range of Dollars 16 to Dollars 24.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Weasel words The IRA is not ready for peace; last week's attacks show that. Yet Sinn Fein, the terrorists' political wing, is wriggling. Its president, Mr Gerry Adams, has sought refuge in confusion. He has made a series of contradictory comments on the declaration signed by the Irish and British prime ministers at Downing Street before Christmas. So has Mr Martin McGuinness, another senior spokesman. This is a measure of the strength of the Downing Street document. Its signatories, Mr Albert Reynolds and Mr John Major, offer nationalists a chance to fulfil their dream of a united Ireland, if a majority of the inhabitants of Ulster concur. If Sinn Fein wants to take part in the democratic process, the IRA has only to lay down its arms. That, in time, would lead to a fading away of the British military presence in Ulster - the 'demilitarisation' that Mr Reynolds speaks of, using nationalist language to the consternation of unionists. Linguistic wobbles aside, London and Dublin have so far kept their balance while addressing their respective constituencies. They have won international support, notably in Washington, by placing themselves on the side of peace, democracy and self-determination. The world now knows that Britain has no interest in Northern Ireland beyond protecting the right of its inhabitants to determine their future. Leaving aside some Paisley blather, the unionists have kept remarkably cool. Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, elected by nationalists, says, rightly, that an end to IRA violence would be 'one of the greatest acts of moral courage of this century'. The net effect, in public relations terms, is to present a choice to the IRA. It can end the violence, and thus begin a long march through the democratic process. Alternatively, it can reject peace, at the risk of political isolation. Mr Major is right to allow more time. He and Mr Reynolds must counter IRA propaganda with steady re-iteration of the Downing Street principles, preferably in public but if necessary through the 'lines of communication' referred to by Mr Hume. Publishing the Hume-Adams agreement, which the inter-governmental declaration is said to resemble, would add to the pressure.</p>

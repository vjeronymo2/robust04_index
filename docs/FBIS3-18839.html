			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: "Office for the Protection of the </F> Constitution Fears Political Murders"]    [Text] Berlin -- The Berlin security authorities are  preparing for a "hot and bloody" spring. According to a  confidential analysis of the Office for the Protection of the  Constitution, an escalation of violence is imminent in the  German capital. Above all an increase in the number of  political murders has to be expected, the Office for the  Protection of the Constitution warned the Berlin Senate and the  police.    The background of the alarming assessment of the situation  is  the formation of a new "trend" in the autonomous scene in  Berlin. According to DIE WELT information, it "is offensively  advocating that the killing of fascists be deliberately accepted  now when they are attacked."    The authorities fear massive riots, particularly in  connection with the international soccer match between Germany  and England. It is supposed to take place in Berlin on 20  April, Adolf Hitler's birthday. In the scene paper INTERIM (No.  274) it is stated that the match planned "on the Fuehrer's  birthday in the stadium built by the Fuehrer in the capital of  the Fuehrer's Reich" is a provocation.    INTERIM takes the view that the politically responsible  persons want to use the opportunity to provoke riots "for the  benefit of the `law-and-order' policy in the election year." As  the homes of refugees had to burn after the abolition of the  asylum-law, Berlin has to burn now. It continues literally:  "There must not be such an unspeakable alliance with a  concentration of fascist groups of thugs, hooligans from the FRG  and England who are prepared for violence, thousands of heavily  armed cops, and riots in the surroundings of the stadium and far  beyond it: Let us prevent the match!"    Independently of these calls, extreme-left "groups of  migrants" are currently also canvassing for an FRG-wide  demonstration in Berlin on 20 April. They want to "strike back"  against the "Nazis."    And this is the definition of their terrorist position: "We  are living in hostile surroundings.... It is not surprising  that a fascist might also be killed in a climate that it  politically heated by racist pogroms and oppression."    The authorities estimate the number of autonomous persons  who  are prepared for violence at more than 5,000 in the FRG. They  continue to be concentrated in the conurbations of Berlin,  Hamburg, Frankfurt/Main, and the Ruhr area.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 3 Apr (INA)--Yemeni gunmen today kidnapped  two members of a Chinese team that is working on the  Jihanah-Ma'rib road project, 49 km northeast of the Yemeni  capital, Sanaa.    To free the two Chinese experts, the kidnappers are  demanding  that work on the road, which extends over 76 km along the Saudi-  Yemeni border, be stopped. The project was started in 1991.    On 12 February, Yemeni gunmen kidnapped three Chinese  experts  working on the same project. The experts were released on 21  February.    Informed Yemeni sources have indicated that the Saudi regime  is behind the kidnapping, and that this regime seeks to obstruct  the project, which, once completed, would allow the Yemeni  authorities to control smuggling, curb acts of economic  sabotage, and check the Saudi regime's ambition to expand into  Yemeni territory.</p>

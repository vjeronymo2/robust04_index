			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OCEANSIDE CITY COUNCIL ACTS TO HONOR DR. KING  </P> <P> The Oceanside City Council, anxious to avoid the controversy that has erupted  in San Diego over choosing an appropriate tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King  Jr., Wednesday approved six proposals to honor the slain civil-rights leader.  </P> <P> The five council members unanimously supported all but one recommendation  drafted by an ad hoc committee established last June by the council that is  charged with developing ideas for a memorial to King.  </P> <P> The council approved the committee's recommendations to name a new public park  and a meeting room in the city's new Civic Center in honor of King, acquire a  statue or bust, create a scholarship fund and a citizen award and establish a  Dr. Martin Luther King book collection at the public library.  </P> <P> But, to the disappointment of leaders from the National Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the council declined to adopt a proposal  by the committee to change the name of the Oceanside Public Library to the Dr.  Martin Luther King Jr. Library when it moves to its new home.  </P> <P> The public library, which has maintained its existing name for 84 years, will  be expanded and housed in the Civic Center, which is under construction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Somewhat Disappointed'  </P> <P> "I'm somewhat disappointed," said Reginald Owens, president of the North County  Chapter of the NAACP, who also served on the committee. "I thought we could  have made a little more progress. But I feel good that we can do those other  things. It's a move in the right direction."  </P> <P> To the relief of community leaders, that direction steered council and  committee members away from a King tribute controversy similar to the one that  has raged in San Diego.  </P> <P> A proposal to place King's name on the $160-million San Diego Convention Center  has once again stirred an emotional debate that first emerged more than a year  ago when San Diego voters stripped King's name from Market Street.  </P> <P> The seven-member board of the San Diego Unified Port District is expected to  address the name change this month. The port commissioners' vote is required  because the uncompleted convention center sits on Port District land. The San  Diego City Council must also approve the change.  </P> <P> "This is something we were trying to do to honor Dr. King in a spirit of  harmony," said Dana Whitson, who was the city's liaison to the committee. "It  wasn't supposed to be divisive. We wanted to avoid the controversy that's going  on in San Diego."  </P> <P> The recommendation to name the new library after King was supported by a  majority of the committee, which included representatives from the NAACP, the  Oceanside Chamber of Commerce, the library's trustees, community residents and  representatives from the city's Human Relations and Parks and Recreation  commissions.  </P> <P> Library trustees previously voted to oppose the name change, arguing that they  wanted to maintain the existing name, Oceanside Public Library, which has wide  public recognition and has been in use for 84 years.  </P> <P> They were also concerned that the proposed name, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  Library, would give a false impression that it contains a significant  collection of books and materials about King. That could also imply, it was  feared, that the library serves a limited purpose rather than the needs of the  general reader.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Library Name  </P> <P> "We have built our history, our knowledge, our reputation as one of the best  libraries in the state as the Oceanside Public Library," said Irene Duehren,  chairwoman of the library's board of trustees. "The name has been in use since  the city was incorporated. It's just like the name of a well-established  business that has recognition. You wouldn't change its name either."  </P> <P> The trustees, however, endorsed the recommendation to establish a King book  collection at the new library.  </P> <P> "Those of us who been exposed to the library have been very proud of its  success," said Mayor Larry Bagley, who sympathized with the trustees' concerns.  "I resist changing the library's name."  </P> <P> But Owens, the committee spokesman, disagreed.  </P> <P> "I understand their concern for historic preservation, but I think it's a tired  rationale," Owens said. "We have to keep in tune with progress. The nation has  a new holiday to honor not only a national hero, but an international hero. The  city is going to have a new civic center and a new library. I think it's  appropriate that the library be named after Dr. King."  </P></p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Flying in the face of recession DOWN has come the hammer and sickle to be replaced by the flags of the independent republics that used to be components of the Soviet Union, Chris Tighe writes. With British companies anxious to strike the right note with overseas visitors to their premises, the change has proved to be good news for Leeds-based Northern Flags. Since last summer, the company, founded six years ago by Mr Sandy Goodall (above), has sold hundreds of the white, blue and red horizontal-striped Russian tricolour. The influx of work has helped Northern Flags to defy the recession, increase its workforce and boost 1991 turnover by 10 per cent to about Pounds 750,000.</p>

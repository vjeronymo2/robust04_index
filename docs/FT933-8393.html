However, Observer hears that in the past the man who moves markets and terrifies central bankers has occasionally had to wait his turn. Soros, who has donated a lot of money to fund higher education in eastern Europe, has been making several trips to Oxford to talk to academics and often arrives before student tutorials are finished. But rather than use the time to check on the fate of the latest currency in his sights, or pen another Op-Ed piece, the world's greatest financier has taken to sitting in the porter's lodge of Holywell Manor, Balliol's graduate centre, and watching cricket. Just goes to show that it never pays to under-estimate the college porter.</p>

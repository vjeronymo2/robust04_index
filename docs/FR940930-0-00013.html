			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> AD 93&hyph;19&hyph;02 was prompted by reports of 2 additional diffuser case failures. Both failures occurred within significantly shorter time intervals since last inspection than that specified in AD 86&hyph;11&hyph;04. In an effort to better understand the diffuser case failure mode, a rig test was performed. This test examined crack initiation and growth rates in weld-repaired versus non-weld-repaired diffuser cases. Results of the test established that cracks initiate and propagate more rapidly in weld-repaired diffuser cases. In addition, weld repairs at the Boss 6 location were determined to have even greater potential for rapid crack growth and resultant diffuser case failure. That condition, if not corrected, could result in diffuser case rupture and an uncontained engine failure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although AD 93&hyph;19&hyph;02 was issued as a final rule without prior notice and an opportunity for public comment, the FAA requested comment on the AD. Due consideration has been given to the comments received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter states that paragraph (c)(3) of AD 93&hyph;19&hyph;02 refers incorrectly to paragraphs (d) and (f), as those paragraphs are applicable to those diffuser cases that have been weld-repaired. The FAA concurs. Paragraph (c)(3) of this Revision to AD 93&hyph;19&hyph;02 has been changed to refer to paragraphs (e), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), and (l). These paragraphs are applicable to those diffuser cases that have not been weld-repaired.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter states that paragraph (o) of AD 93&hyph;19&hyph;02 requires modifications to the diffuser case in accordance with PW Service Bulletin (SB) No. 5805, Revision 6, dated September 15, 1993. The commenter maintains that modifications performed in accordance with the earlier revisions to this SB should be considered in compliance with this AD. The FAA concurs. All previous revisions of PW SB No. 5805 differ from Revision 6 only in editorial clarifications or corrections of typographical errors and do not impact the intent of the document. Modifications performed to the diffuser case in accordance with the previous revisions of PW SB No. 5805 constitute an acceptable alternate means of compliance to paragraph (o) of this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the revision of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of PW SB No. 5805, Revision 6, dated September 15, 1993, that describes procedures for modification of the rear rail by detaching the diffuser case rear rail from the strut boss, thus extending the serviceable life of the diffuser case by reducing crack initiation and propagation rates; PW Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 6076, Revision 1, dated August 20, 1992, that describes ultrasonic and metallographic inspection of the shell wall, and ultrasonic inspection of the rear rail at the Boss 6 location to determine weld size; PW SB No. 6088, dated August 5, 1992, that describes an X-ray inspection of the rear rail and sides of bosses for detection of poor weld quality; PW SB No. 5591, Revision 7, dated August 25, 1992, that describe initial and repetitive on-wing eddy current inspections of the diffuser case rear rail; and PW SB No. 6105, Revision 2, dated May 14, 1993, that describes installation of a new, improved diffuser case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional information regarding weld repair requirements for the diffuser case rear rail is contained in PW JT9D Engine Manual, Part Number 686028, dated September 1, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

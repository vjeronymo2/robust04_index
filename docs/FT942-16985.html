			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Small businesses set to benefit in wide review of company law Wide-ranging reform of company law aimed at helping the growth of small businesses was signalled yesterday by Mr Neil Hamilton, the corporate affairs minister. Simplification of the 1985 Companies Act and the creation of a new corporate organisation along the lines of an incorporated partnership are two ideas to be considered by a Law Commission review, he said. The review, announced yesterday, follows a Department of Trade and Industry working party set up to study possible reforms of company law. Part of the government's deregulation policy, the action is seen by ministers as a means of removing obstacles to the growth of small businesses into medium-sized companies better able to compete, particularly in the European single market, and to provide increased employ-ment. The DTI stressed, however, that the review should be seen as a necessary updating of current legislation rather than dramatic root and branch reform. An incorporated partnership might dispense with some existing concepts of company law such as the distinction between shareholders and directors while retaining other features such as separate legal responsibility and limited liability. The simplification of the Companies Act might allow companies to opt out of some of its provisions. The protection provided for creditors and others would not be diminished, Mr Hamilton said. The commission will also look at reform of laws on legally binding corporate documents like contracts and loan agreements. The DTI considers there are still fundamental problems with the law regarding such documents, such as conflicting and inconsistent statutory provisions. It is expected that a consultation paper will be issued by the commission on this subject in 1995. The announcements were welcomed yesterday by the Federation of Small Businesses. A spokesman said: 'A move towards incorporated partnerships would be particularly important. It would help bridge the gap between partnerships and companies which is currently a serious weakness in Britain's industrial structure. At the moment, this gap means we are losing out in our trade with the rest of Europe.' The commission will identify specific areas needing attention. It will now begin consultation to pinpoint the main problems facing small businesses before making firm proposals. The commission is expected to report to ministers by July. A DTI spokesman said legislation would not follow immediately as recommendations would then have to be studied fully.</p>

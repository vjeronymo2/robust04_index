			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / FT Law Report: Digest of cases reported in Michaelmas Term HARBOUR ASSURANCE CO (UK) LTD v KANSA GENERAL INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE CO LTD AND OTHERS (FT, October 15) The plaintiff claimed a declaration that it was not liable to the defendants under allegedly illegal retrocession agreements on the ground that they had carried on unauthorised insurance or reinsurance business in breach of the Insurance Companies Acts. The defendants contested the allegations and sought that the proceedings be stayed under section 1 of the Arbitration Act 1975. They argued that the arbitration was a severable and self-contained agreement that survived the hypothetical illegality.  On a preliminary issue as to whether an arbitration clause calling for all disputes to be referred to arbitration was null and void by reason of the illegality, Mr Justice Steyn stated that an issue of initial illegality was always beyond the arbitrator's jurisdiction (see Smith, Coney &amp; Barrett v Becker Gray &amp; Co (1916) 2 Ch 86). While the distinction between initial invalidity and illegality was not one which should nowadays prevail, Gray compelled the court to hold that the principle of separability did not extend to ab initio illegality of the contract in which the arbitration clause was embedded. The application for a stay of the illegality issue would be dismissed. MARC RICH &amp; CO AG v SOCIETA ITALIANA IMPIANTI PA (FT, October 16) The Court of Appeal referred to the European Court a question on a preliminary ruling concerning the first paragraph of the Convention which provided that it was to apply in civil and commercial matters but, under Article 1(4), did not apply to arbitration. The question was whether 1(4) extended to (a) any litigation or judgments and, if so, (b) to litigation or judgments where the initial existence of an arbitration agreement was in issue. The court decided that by excluding arbitration from the scope of the Convention on the ground that it was already covered by international conventions, it followed that the contracting parties intended to exclude arbitration in its entirety, including proceedings brought before national courts. Appointment of an arbitrator by a national court was a measure adopted by the state as part of the process of setting arbitration proceedings in motion. Such a measure therefore came within the sphere of arbitration and was covered by the exclusion in Article 1(4) of the Convention. ROSSEEL NV v ORIENTAL COMMERCIAL AND SHIPPING (UK) LTD AND OTHERS (FT, October 18) The plaintiffs, who were judgment debtors, obtained a charging order over property, allegedly owned beneficially by a Mr Bokhari, pursuant to the Charging Orders Act 1979 and Order 50 rule 1 of RSC. That order was discharged on application of members of the Hitta family who claimed to be legal and beneficial owners of the property. Rosseel argued that although the family owned legal title of the property, the whole beneficial interest was held by Mr Bokhari and that the transaction transferring ownership was a sham. Allowing Rosseel's appeal against the discharge of the order, the Court of Appeal stated that where there was a real dispute it was necessary, in order to do justice, that an issue should be tried. The court could, in the exercise of its power to regulate its own procedure, direct such an issue. It could not be accepted that the direction of an issue would be hardship on the Hitta family; there was no hardship if, having made a claim which on its face was highly suspect, they were called upon to discharge the burden or take the consequences. KENNETH ALLISON LTD v A E LI MEHOUSE &amp; CO (FT, October 22) The plaintiff issued a writ against the defendant firm of accountants and the senior partner's personal assistant, after referring the matter to him, said that she had been authorised to accept the writ. The defendants succeeded at first instance and in the Court of Appeal (Lord Donaldson dissenting) in their contention that the writ had not been duly served. Allowing the plaintiffs' appeal, the House of Lords stated that the crucial question was whether the express provision in the Rules for consensual service in contract cases excluded consensual service in any other case. In the light of the legislative history it did not. Lord Donaldson had summed the matter up correctly when he said that the Rules were the servants of the courts and of their customers, not their master, except where expressed in a wholly mandatory and exclusive fashion. The Rules concerned with the service of writs were not so expressed. CURACAO TRADING CO BV v J HARKISANDAS &amp; CO (FT, October 23) An umpire was appointed under the Rules of the International General Produce Association (IGPA) in a dispute over a contract in which the sellers had failed to deliver. They pr ovided that an umpire could make an interim award which the appeal committee had power to reassess or amend. Rule 132(a) provided that whenever it was decided that a party had failed to fulfil the contract terms, the arbitrators were to base the invoicing back price on the estimated market value ruling on the day of default. In his first award, the umpire found in the buyers' favour; his award was upheld by the IGPA appeal committee which also stated that the contract should be closed in accordance with Rule 132(a). The sellers objected on the ground that the arbitration procedure had been exhausted but a second award was made under that Rule and the buyers were given leave to enforce it as a judgment. Refusing application to set aside the order, Mr Justice Hirst stated that it was fully consistent with Rule 132(a) that the appeal committee's direction that the contract should be closed in accordance with that Rule should be fulfilled at a further hearing before the original umpire. INDIAN GRACE (FT, October 25) The cargo-owners claimed from the shipowners for 136m rupees for the total loss of the whole cargo after 51 shells had been jettisoned as result of a fire in the hold. That claim was agreed to be subject to English law and jurisdiction. They also gave notice of a smaller claim seeking damages for the 51 shells not delivered in the court in Cochin which concluded that the shipowners were liable for short delivery. Six months later the writ in the English action was served but was struck out on the grounds that the cause of action was the same as that in the Indian action; and that section 34 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 was an absolute bar to bringing proceedings. Dismissing the cargo-owners' appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that Section 34 of the 1982 Act provided that no proceedings might be brought by a person in the UK on a cause of action in respect of which a judgment had been given in his favour in foreign proceedings between the same parties, unless that judgment was not enforceable or entitled to recognition in the UK. Parties could not, by agreement or by reservation, confer on the court a jurisdiction of which it had been deprived by statute. CARGILL SRL MILAN v P KADINOPOLOUS SA (FT, October 29) The plaintiffs were buyers of a cargo of wheat from the defendants on Gafta Form 64 but they rejected the cargo on its arrival in Sicily. An arbitrator was appointed who held in his absolute discretion, in an 'interim award', that the claim had been deemed to have lapsed, been withdrawn or abandoned. The sellers then appealed to the Gafta Board of Appeal invoking Rule 8.2 which stated that if a party were dissatisfied with an award, a right of appeal lay to the Board. The Board then allowed the arbitration to proceed. The buyers unsuccessfully contended before the High Court and the Court of Appeal that the arbitrator's decision that the claim was withdrawn was not an arbitration award so that there was in fact no right of appeal. Dismissing a further appeal, the House of Lords held (a) that although the arbitrator's decision did not determine the merits of the claim, it did finally dispose of the matters in dispute and that such a determination was properly the subject matter of an award; and (b) under Rule 8.2 a party had a right to appeal if dissatisfied with an award and the appeal correctly took the form of a re-hearing so that the Board of Appeal had jurisdiction to substitute its own discretion for the arbitrator's.</p>

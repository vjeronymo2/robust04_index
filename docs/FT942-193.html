			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Costs keep two unions out of Labour election Two unions affiliated to the Labour party will not participate in its leadership election because they say they cannot afford the cost of holding postal or workplace ballots, it was disclosed yesterday. Labour's ruling national executive committee refused to allow the National Union of Mineworkers and Ucatt, the construction union, to hold cheaper branch ballots instead. Officials said the decision was intended to send 'a powerful signal' to union activists about the NEC's commitment to the one-member-one-vote electoral system approved by last year's party conference. Branch ballots are regarded with suspicion because they exclude members who do not attend. They are also open to manipulation by union officials. The decision followed a letter to the NEC from Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, pleading that his once-mighty union has no money to spend on a postal or workplace ballot for its 30,000 members. The NEC urged Mr Scargill to reconsider. Party officials said pithead ballots were traditional in the NUM and there was no reason why they should not be used for the leadership election. Mr Scargill yesterday voiced a desire for the union's levy-payers to take part in the ballot - the NUM has nominated Mr John Prescott for leader and Mrs Margaret Beckett for deputy leader. The NEC also decided that Ucatt would not be able to participate in Labour's leadership election. Ucatt, which has serious financial problems, told the party it did not have the money available to spend an estimated Pounds 70,000 on a postal ballot of its 130,000 political levy-paying members. The NEC said it was not acceptable for the union to distribute ballot papers through its branches. Labour is insisting that all unions involved in the elections carry out a ballot that gives members a secret vote. 'The vast majority of trade unions are holding postal ballots,' the party said. But it added: 'We have agreed in four cases that they can make different arrangements as long as everybody entitled to vote is able to take part if they wish to do so.' The unions concerned are the print union GPMU, the pit deputies union Nacods, the fire brigades' union and the bakers' union.</p>

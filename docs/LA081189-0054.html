			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: SOUTH CAROLINA COACHES SENTENCED  </P> <P> Three former University of South Carolina football coaches and a Maryland man,  convicted on the testimony of players, drew relatively light sentences Thursday  for distributing steroids to their athletes in the mid-1980s.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge G. Ross Anderson sentenced the four to one-year terms in a  halfway house, then suspended six months to nine months of each sentence and  placed all four on three years' probation.  </P> <P> Former coach Tom Kurucz, who pleaded guilty June 1 to one misdemeanor count of  dispensing steroids to players and a felony count of lying to a grand jury,  received the harshest sentence -- six months. It was the minimum term allowed  under federal sentencing guidelines. Kurucz had faced a maximum of six years in  prison and $350,000 in fines.  </P> <P> "I'm sorry and ashamed," Kurucz told Anderson before he was sentenced. "I now  have a new job and I request you let me continue to make a living for my  family."  </P> <P> Jim Washburn and Keith Kephart, two other former coaches convicted along with  John L. Carter of Bethesda, Md., on lesser charges, were each sentenced to  three months.  </P></p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Sale-of-goods laws to be reviewed England's ancient sale-of-goods laws, which set out the ways in which a purchaser can get good title to goods bought in good faith from someone who does not own them, are to be reviewed, the government announced yesterday. A consultation paper proposes replacing the detailed rules in the 1979 Sale of Goods Act with a broad principle that where goods have been entrusted to someone by the owner an innocent purchaser should get good title, abolishing the rule on sales in market overt (ancient markets), and extending the protection given to purchasers of cars on hire purchase to other goods.</p>

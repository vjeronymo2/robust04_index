			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Railtrack claims support for strike is on the wane A record number of signal workers reported for work during the latest 24-hour rail strike, prompting claims from Railtrack that support for the RMT transport union's 10-week action was waning. But hopes for a quick return to peace received a setback when another rail union, Aslef, announced plans to ballot 2,000 London Underground workers to assess support for strike action over an imposed 2 per cent pay rise. Strikes on the Underground would increase problems for commuters if they were timed to coincide with rail stoppages. Railtrack said that 599 signal workers, including 342 RMT members, had reported for duty during the stoppage which ended at midday yesterday. During last week's shutdown 530 signal workers had reported for duty, including 309 members of RMT. Mr John Ellis, Railtrack's production director, said: 'It is clear from these figures that an increasing number of signalmen and women are now willing to return to work despite the pressure that has been put upon them to keep the strike solid. 'The RMT executive should listen to their members and stop forcing them to gamble on their future and that of this business. The RMT mandate for strike action is clearly falling away as every day goes by.' Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, denied that support was crumbling and accused Railtrack of increasing the number of train services by a better 'exploitation of supervisors' rather than because of any return to work by signalling staff. He said: 'The significant figure is that there are still 4,000 people - 98 per cent of RMT members - on strike. That resolve is as strong as ever. Railtrack should get down to serious negotiation about their problems.' He rejected Railtrack's claim to have run more than 40 per cent of normal services. In many parts of the country the service was less at than a quarter of its normal level and most of the trains were poorly patronised, he added. The RMT has called another 48-hour strike from noon next Tuesday. Its executive is expected to meet later this week to call another stoppage in the week starting September 5. This would coincide with the Trades Union Congress conference in Blackpool. InterCity West Coast has announced plans to operate a limited service from London Euston to Manchester and Glasgow via Wolverhampton and Crewe next week. This would be the first through service to run on the west coast main line since the dispute started.</p>

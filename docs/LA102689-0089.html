			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: REGION;  </P> <P> TOXIC DUMPING IS CHARGED  </P> <P> City Atty. James Hahn has filed criminal charges against officials of a  Westside furniture-manufacturing company accused of dumping hazardous materials  near Ballona Creek.  </P> <P> Among those named in the criminal complaint is Donald Lee Alderson, 40,  president of Don Alderson Associates Inc. The firm makes specialty furniture  for hotels, other businesses and residences at its facility at 3327 S. La  Cienega Place.  </P> <P> Hahn's office said charges grew out of an investigation by the Los Angeles  County Department of Health, which found evidence of illegal dumping of paint  and paint thinners at the plant after receiving a citizen complaint.  </P> <P> According to Deputy City Atty. Teresa Luhan, who is handling the case,  inspectors found evidence of illegal dumping on the ground along a chain-link  fence behind the factory, which is located on an embankment overlooking Ballona  Creek.  </P> <P> "Paint stains and splatters were visible along the fence line, and paint stains  were also visible on the creek side of the fence on the vegetation and bushes  and running down the concrete embankment to the creek," Hahn said. "It appeared  that the illegal dumping had been going on for some time, since the inspectors  determined as they were taking samples that the paint contamination had soaked  six to eight inches deep into the soil."  </P> <P> Illegal dumping of such materials is a crime punishable by up to one year in  jail and/or a fine of $5,000 to $100,000 per day of such activity.  </P></p>

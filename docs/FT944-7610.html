			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Oil groups sued in Australia Shell Australia and BP Australia, both part of the larger international oil groups, are being sued by the Trade Practices Commission, Australia's competition watchdog, over alleged price collusion in the Sydney and Melbourne retail petrol markets. Shell issued a statement yesterday stating that it would 'mount a vigorous defence' against allegations that it colluded with other oil companies to increase retail petroleum prices in Melbourne and Sydney between 1988 and 1991. BP Australia confirmed that it, too, was served with legal proceedings by the Commission yesterday. These, it said, alleged certain anti-competitive practices in the Sydney and Melbourne motor spirit markets between May 1991 and June 1992.</p>

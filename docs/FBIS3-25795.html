In various mainland  provinces, rural laborers have began to move back to their home  villages like an ebbing tide in order to hold family reunions.  In this period, such means of transportation as trains and  buses are getting extremely crowded, and this has become a  special scene at the turn of the year. It is expected that  before and after the Spring Festival, over 10 million migrant  workers will travel.    Why is there such a special phenomenon? Individual income in  the countryside is low, and young peasants always try to seek  jobs and earn a bit more money as long as there are  opportunities to enter the city. After the beginning of reform  and opening up in the Chinese mainland, the southeast coastal  provinces and areas got rich first, and the people's living  standards became much higher. This stimulated the people in the  interior provinces and regions. As the popular saying goes,  "water flows downward and people hope to move upward." This is  an inevitable phenomenon. In the final analysis, the movement  of rural laborers arose because there was a labor surplus in the  rural areas. At present, the rural working population in the  Chinese mainland is about 450 million people, accounting for 74  percent of the country's total labor resources. However, there  is only some 1.4 billion mu of farmland, which requires only 200  million laborers. Fortunately, the township and town  enterprises arising in recent years have absorbed 110 million  working people, thus substantially reducing the surplus labor  force in the countryside. However, the surplus labor force in  the countryside still stands at about 130 million. Peasants now  spend three months on farming, one month on celebrating the new  year holidays, and eight months on doing nothing. Such a  description is quite true. Because there is too little land to  support too many people, the peasants' income remains very low.  Going out to seek jobs has become the main means of living for  young peasants.    The emergence of the migrant laborer tides should be  regarded  as an inevitable phenomenon, but this also exposes the people's  difficulties in seeking jobs and many problems in the field of  labor management. Reportedly, a crowd of peasants recently  gathered around Beijing's Chongwen Men, and there appeared a  "labor market" where employers might select workers. However,  many laborers from the countryside failed to find a job after  waiting there for over two weeks or even one month. First, they  were not well-informed, as they came from the countryside;  second, they were not skilled workers and could not compete with  other people in seeking jobs. As a result, they wasted time and  money traveling back and forth, and also suffered psychological  pain. Similar phenomena also exist in the "labor markets" of  Shanghai and Guangzhou. So far, the authorities have not  included migrant laborers in the scope of labor registration and  distribution. This should not be regarded as an accidental  oversight.    Migrant rural laborers also cause serious problems to  transportation. Because of the large scale of population  movement and the limited number of destinations, tremendous  pressure is caused for the transport industry, which has long  been the bottleneck of the economy. The movement of rural  laborers also causes difficulties to urban management, public  order and security, and public health.    In fact, migrant laborers are from the countryside, but they  work all year round in cities and only return home for a number  of days around the Chinese New Year. Some of them even bring  their whole families to the city and do not return to the  countryside for many consecutive years. Gradually, the migrant  laborers have formed a unique community, and these people also  have their special social status. Some sociologists point out  that migrant laborers are not rural people in real terms, nor  urban people in real terms. They are living in a "marginal"  condition. They are living in cities, but they are not accepted  by cities and do not achieve the social status of urban  residents. When the economy cools down, they are the first to  be forced to leave the cities and return to the countryside.  However, they are no longer accustomed to rural work. According  to statistics in some cities, over half of criminal cases in  cities are related to migrant laborers from the countryside.  Maybe this is because they are not accepted and admitted by  cities, and their livelihood has no guarantee. Some cities tell  all institutions not to hire new laborers from other provinces,  and reject migrant laborers. The correctness of such a practice  is open to question.    It seems that in order to reduce the negative effects of the  movement of over 10 million rural laborers, the authorities must  formulate corresponding control and guidance measures. For  example, the urban household registration system should be  reformed; institutions for providing consulting and guiding  services to migrant laborers from the countryside should be set  up; and people living in difficult conditions should be helped  to return home; and opportunities should be given to educated  and skilled laborers from the countryside. All these points are  worth considering.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine  [DFLP] regards the new U.S. attitude toward the UN Security  Council resolution as a disturbing retreat from the stands  adopted by previous U.S. Administrations. The front called  Resolution No. 904 weak and colorless with no firm decisions on  protecting the Palestinian people.    The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, rejected the  resolution and considered it insufficient and incomplete. Hamas  voiced its disappointment with the stands of the Arab sides,  including that of the PLO.</p>

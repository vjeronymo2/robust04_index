			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed Commentary: "Government Amends Own Decision </F> on Import Duties"]    [Text] Having heeded the voice of the business world, the  majority of which spoke out against the hasty and sudden  imposition of customs import duties, the government has adopted  a decision which somewhat amends Decree No. 196, which has  become well known throughout the country. The essence of the  amendments is as follows. Import duties on goods which have not  been increased when compared with previous rates are to operate  from 15 March. But those which have risen will not go into  force until 1 July. This means that importers who concluded  contracts before 15 March have been given a breathing space.    This is the response to the complaint of businessmen buying  goods abroad for the Russian consumer who have rightly  criticized the authors of the decree for the fact that importers  were not forewarned of the planned changes and could not prepare  for them. Meanwhile, an amendment to the law on customs tariffs  is now being examined which will envisage that after a decision  on the imposition of new duties, importers are to be given at  least 90 days to adapt to the changed conditions.    Before the end of the year it is planned initially to reduce  a number of customs duties which exceed 30 percent of the  customs value of certain commodities. This government intention  is in keeping with the GATT requirement for an average world  level of rates no higher than 7-8 percent, whereas the rate in  our country currently exceeds 14 percent.</p>

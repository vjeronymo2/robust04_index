			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / 'Big increase' predicted in New Zealand's fiscal '94 budget surplus New Zealand's high growth rate will lead to 'a big increase' in the NZDollars 1.28bn (Pounds 520m) budget surplus forecast for the current fiscal year by the government as recently as June, Mr Bill Birch, finance minister, said yesterday, Peter Montagnon, our Asia Editor, reports. Small increases can also be expected in the surpluses of NZDollars 3.1bn and NZDollars 5bn forecast for the two following years to June 1996 and 1997. Growth had boosted tax revenues and reduced welfare payments, he said. 'I share the opinion that continued fiscal discipline is essential to maintaining low inflation and strong growth,' he added. The government would maintain its goal of reducing net public debt to 30 per cent of gross domestic product by June 1997 from 42 per cent in the middle of this year. The Organisation for Economic Development and Co-operation said last week that New Zealand should use its improved fiscal position to pay expensive debt rather than increase public spending.</p>

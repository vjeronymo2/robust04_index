			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEESE TESTIMONY  </P> <P> Now we know, from his own testimony under oath in a courtroom, to whom Edwin  Meese III swore his oath on taking office as U.S. attorney general (Part I,  March 29). He didn't mean it when he swore to uphold the Constitution of the  United States. His first loyalty he now testifies was to Ronald Reagan, and he  cheerfully broke his oath to his country to serve Reagan in breaking his oath.  </P> <P> This action is, of course, grounds for impeachment -- of both of them. It is  too late for a trial, perhaps. But let the record show how the Great  Communicator and his police toady stack up as patriots.  </P> <P> FREDERIC E. PAMP  </P> <P> Santa Ynez  </P></p>

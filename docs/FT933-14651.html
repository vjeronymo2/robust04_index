			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Coors to cut white collar staff by 20% ADOLPH Coors, the third biggest US brewer, is to cut 500 jobs, or about 20 per cent of its white collar workforce, in an attempt to reduce costs and improve long-term profitability. Coors, which is trying to compete more successfully with market leaders Anheuser-Busch and Philip Morris, hopes to achieve the job reductions through enhanced early retirement packages, incentives for voluntary redundancy and attrition. The company said the job cuts were part of a a wider plan which will include reducing inventories of raw and finished goods, improving productivity, using excess capacity and increasing the effectiveness of market spending. In addition to reducing general and administrative costs, Coors plans to farm out a large part of its marketing services and field marketing. It said it would create a free-standing, independent marketing services company - to be called Front Range Communications - which will provide marketing support for Coors ranging from merchandising to trademark sales. About 100 Coors employees will be offered jobs in the new agency. Mr Leo Kiely, president and chief operating officer, said: 'Coors Brewing Company has outpaced the industry in volume growth rate for eight consecutive years. 'At the same time, we have lagged in providing adequate returns to our shareholders. We are committed to improved profitability while continuing to build our competitive position in the marketplace.' Mr Arthur Wegner has been appointed chairman and chief executive of Raytheon's Beech Aircraft unit, from July 19, Reuter reports. Mr Wegner, also appointed a senior vice president, succeeds Mr Max Bleck, who remains Raytheon president and group executive for aircraft products.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, a meeting was held in Almaty of  representatives of Supreme Kenges deputies from all the regions  of the Republic. At the request of the parliamentarians,  President Nazarbayev took part and spoke to the deputies. He  congratulated the people's deputies on the high confidence in  them and wished them every success in their work.    The head of state shared his opinion on the nature of the  work and activity expected from the Supreme Kenges of the new  convocation. He expressed his hope that from the very beginning  the first ever democratically elected professional parliament  will work constructively in the interest of the state and for  the whole Kazakh nation. The president stated his readiness to  work in a close, concerted, and efficient way with the Supreme  Kenges in order to lift our society out of the crisis as quickly  as possible and to pave the way toward a civilized future.    Nursultan Nazarbayev believes that the Kazakhstani  parliamentarians have every possibility to formulate their own  specific style of law-making, which will take into account the  particular features of our Republic, in particular its  multiethnic population. He also answered deputies' questions.  At issue were proposals regarding an initiative deputy group on  how to begin the first session of the Supreme Kenges in an  organized way. The proposals were approved in general.    On the same day, at the House of parliament, Central  Election  Commission Chairman Karatay Turysov awarded the deputies their  newly designed badges. The session will open tomorrow at 1000.</p>

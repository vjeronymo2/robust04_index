			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / World Trade News: US finds itself friendless in Gatt The United States found itself friendless in Gatt yesterday in its heightening trade row with Japan following the breakdown of talks between President Bill Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, last weekend. Fellow members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade seized the chance during discussion of a Gatt report on US trade policy to slam what they saw as Washington's attempt to manage bilateral trade with Japan, to the detriment of other nations and the multilateral system as a whole. The US argument - that its goal is to open markets for the benefit of all - failed to mollify trading partners. More than 20 rich and poor countries, among them European Union states, Mexico, Australia, Canada, South Korea and Poland, expressed concern over US demands for numerical targets for Japanese imports and threats of trade retaliation. Mr Tran Van Thinh, EU ambassador to Gatt, said these threats highlighted 'the doubtful and disquieting nature' of the US aims. While the EU agreed with the need to reduce the excessive and persistent Japanese trade surplus, the remedies proposed by the US would be worse than the disease. Mr Mitoji Yabunaka, of the Japanese mission in Geneva, said Tokyo 'could not, did not and will not agree to set numerical targets' for imports. The Japanese government was, however, prepared to tackle the trade surplus by stimulating the economy and opening markets on a non-discriminatory basis. The US federal budget deficit was the key to redressing the trade balance, Mr Yabunaka argued, noting that the US had failed to deliver on previous assurances made to Japan in 1990 that it would eliminate the deficit within 3-4 years. The US-Japan dispute was given an extra twist this week when Japanese officials accused Washington of 'dirty tricks' in withdrawing certain tariff offers made during the Uruguay Round talks. US negotiators say the offers, on wood, white spirits and some industrial electronic goods, were always conditional on tariff concessions by Japan which never materialised. However, Mr Nobutoshi Akao, Japan's chief negotiator in the Uruguay Round, claimed on Wednesday that offers in place when the round ended in December could only be improved upon, not retracted. Trade diplomats said yesterday that the US, EU and Canada had made clear that they would scrap tariffs on wood and white spirits only if Japan did so as well. EU officials say the withdrawal of certain tariff offers to Japan is currently 'under consideration'.</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL OKS RESIGNATIONS, DELAYS PORT REPLACEMENTS  </P> <P> Over the objections of the mayor, San Diego City Council on Monday accepted the  resignations of two veteran port commissioners, but put off for two weeks the  politically volatile issues of naming replacements and seeking the ouster of  recalcitrant commissioner W. Daniel Larsen.  </P> <P> In a surprise move, Mayor Maureen O'Connor vowed not to support any nominee to  the Board of Port Commissioners, because, she said, new commissioners should be  elected officials rather than political appointees.  </P> <P> Calling the 1962 state law that created the San Diego Unified Port District  obsolete, the mayor said the city should push for changes to abolish political  appointees on the powerful seven-member board and to give San Diego a majority  on the commission.  </P> <P> The city has three commissioners and the cities of National City, Coronado,  Chula Vista and Imperial Beach each have one, a condition O'Connor called  unfair because San Diego has by far the most people.  </P> <P> Although her sentiment about the need for fundamental change seemed to win  favor from the rest of the City Council, it was, on this day, the solitary item  of unanimity about the Port District.  </P> <P> A council majority led by Bob Filner pushed through a vote to accept the  resignations of Port Commissioners Louis Wolfsheimer and Bill Rick, effective  Feb. 7, and set Jan. 22 as the date to appoint new commissioners. Both  Wolfsheimer and Rick had offered to stay on temporarily until the new  Convention Center is finished and an expected lawsuit by the center's general  contractor against the Port District is dealt with.  </P> <P> The majority -- consisting of Filner, Wes Pratt, John Hartley, Abbe  Wolfsheimer, Judy McCarty and Linda Bernhardt -- also called on the council's  Rules Commission to analyze and make recommendations on changes to the Port  Act, such as electing representatives. Any changes would require action by the  Legislature.  </P> <P> Lastly, the majority delayed until Jan. 22 the question of whether to replace  Larsen, who has angered several council members by reneging on his promise to  vote for renaming the Convention Center for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  </P> <P> Larsen, who was reappointed to a four-year term last year, has said he will not  step down, even if the council unanimously moves for his ouster.  </P> <P> As part of the vote, Filner, who along with Pratt and Hartley has publicly  campaigned to recall Larsen, asked City Atty. John Witt to furnish the council  by Jan. 22 with a written opinion about the council's power to remove Larsen,  although he never mentioned Larsen by name.  </P> <P> Witt has consistently advised council members that they lack the authority to  recall Larsen without demonstrating malfeasance on Larsen's part.  </P> <P> Although part of the debate included glowing kudos for the work Rick and  Wolfsheimer have done as commissioners over the years, another part was  punctuated with a venom-laced exchange between Filner and the mayor that  surprised even City Hall veterans.  </P> <P> The mayor suggested that all nominees for the Board of Port Commissioners face  a rigorous conflict-of-interest test. Filner, his voice rising and cracking  with anger, responded by saying that no one has yet been officially nominated  and that, by bringing up conflict-of-interest questions now, the mayor was  "slurring" the reputations of those who will be nominated.  </P> <P> O'Connor denied the accusation and tried to cut Filner off, but Filner wouldn't  be stopped. He told the mayor that, if she is interested in having a  conflict-of-interest policy, then it should be applied to the range of agencies  with City Council appointees, such as the Centre City Development Corp.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RIFLE FOUND IN HOME; BOY, 11, WOUNDED  </P> <P> An 11-year-old South El Monte boy playing at a friend's home was accidentally  shot in the head after he and the friend found a .22-caliber rifle they did not  realize was loaded, sheriff's deputies said. The boy, whose name was not  released, was in extremely critical condition on a life-support system at  Greater El Monte Community Hospital, a nursing supervisor said.  </P> <P> Deputy Dan Cox said the boy was one of four playing at a friend's home when the  friend, a 14-year-old boy, began handling the gun. "Unbeknownst to him, it was  loaded," Cox said.  </P> <P> When the older boy pulled the trigger, the gun fired once, and the single  bullet hit the 11-year-old in the head, Cox said. Neither the 14-year-old nor  the other two boys playing in the house were hurt, he said. Sheriff's homicide  detectives have declared it an accidental shooting.  </P> <P> Cox said deputies did not yet know whether either parent was home at the time,  nor had they learned where the rifle was kept.  </P></p>

But project officials at the NASA Goddard  Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., reported that the $1.5-billion telescope  was brought back to normal "quickly and effectively," in part because of the  practice the controllers received during the telescope's problem-plagued first  week in orbit.  </P></p>

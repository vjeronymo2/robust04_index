			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: The big winners and losers LONE PARENTS will be relieved to hear that the government has made up to Pounds 28 a week available to those on family credit to help pay for childcare. The move is aimed at taking some of the sting out of recent controversy on the government's 'back to basics' policy, which has been criticised for its approach to single parents. While it may enable more single parents to return to the workplace, it is questionable whether Pounds 28 a week is sufficient to pay for childcare, or even whether the jobs will be available for those seeking them. Single parents may also benefit from the job-seekers allowance which will offer increased guidance, assessment and financial incentives to the long-term unemployed. PENSIONERS were compensated for the last Budget battering by Mr Norman Lamont. All will receive the same help with their fuel bills as those on income-related benefits, which are set to rise by 3.5 per cent. The poorest will receive the benefit increases as VAT is imposed on fuel, so money is available when the bills arrive. The poorest and disabled will also receive special increases in the income-related benefits of between 50p and 70p a week, which will be doubled in 1995. All OAPs will also now be eligible for financial assistance on home insulation. Meanwhile, savers will be offered a five-year guaranteed income bond at 'a competitive rate'. ENTREPRENEURS get a big boost with changes in capital gains tax exemption limits when they sell a business on retirement. Complete exemptions will be given on the first Pounds 250,000 of capital gains and a half exemption on the next Pounds 750,000. Mr Clarke has also introduced a new tax-efficient venture capital trust to channel savings into the unquoted trading company. Perhaps the most surprising change allows anyone facing a capital gains charge to defer tax indefinitely by reinvesting those gains in unquoted companies. Finally, the enterprise investment scheme gives 20 per cent up-front tax relief, but will also allow income and capital gains tax relief on investment losses. YOUNGER WORKING WOMEN will lose substantially by the decision to equalise the retirement age at 65. Employers may welcome the decision, however, as it eases the burden of pension responsibilities. The change will be phased in over 10 years, starting in 2010, leaving women over the age of 44 now free to leave work with full benefits at 60. The justification is that since more women are now in paid employment, and since they live longer, an equal pension age is more appropriate. Mr Clarke says the move will bring Britain 'broadly in line with most of our industrial competitors' while it will leave women better off than their counterparts in the US, where the retirement age is 67. MARRIED COUPLES are likely to lose on several fronts. Most significantly, the married couples' allowance, which had already been reduced for 1994 from 25 per cent to 20 per cent, will fall further in 1995 to 15 per cent. The homeowner will also face a similar reduction in mortgage interest relief from 20 per cent to 15 per cent in 1995. This is likely to add a further Pounds 10 a month to a mortgage of Pounds 30,000, the limit at which loans qualifying for mortgage interest relief was frozen. Insurance premiums, which have already increased substantially in recent years, will go up by an average of 35p a week for the typical family with home contents, motor and buildings insurance. HEDONISTS were big losers yesterday, or at least all smoking, car-driving air travellers. The 7.3 per cent increase in excise duty on tobacco is high compared with the low rate of inflation. Travellers will also be hit by the Pounds 5 airport departure tax for flights within the EU and Pounds 10 for other destinations. Surprisingly this hits both the business and private traveller. Had this been introduced under VAT, it would have been reclaimable. The vehicle excise duty on cars - the tax disc - will add Pounds 5 a year in the immediate future, while road fuel was increased by 3p a litre. The only good news for fun-lovers was that duties on beer and spirits was not increased.</p>

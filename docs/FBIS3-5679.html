			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of Keidanren [Japan  Federation of Economic Organizations], at a news conference in  Nagoya city on 3 March, commented on the issue of setting  sector-by-sector numerical targets over which Japan and the  United States failed to reach agreement at the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks.    Hiraiwa said this issue should be settled by the industries  of the two nations, insisting: "The problem should be resolved  not by governments setting numbers, but by the private sectors  talking to each other." He added: "Negotiations are continuing  and we will try to find a compromise through these negotiations."</p>

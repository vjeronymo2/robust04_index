			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE CALLS FOR MORE DAMAGES IN AMOCO SPILL  </P> <P> A retired judge Tuesday recommended a $30-million increase in his $85.2-million  judgment against Amoco Corp. for oil-spill damage from the 1978 wreck of a  supertanker off the French coast.  </P> <P> The revised award would be shared by the government of France -- which would  receive the single largest portion, $44.4 million -- and some 100 French towns  affected by the spill that fouled 100 miles of coastline.  </P> <P> Frank McGarr, who retired as a U.S. District Court judge after his 1988 ruling,  continues to serve as special master in the case and made the recommendation  after being asked by parties in the case to reconsider the award.  </P> <P> The recommendation is subject to approval by another federal judge; no date has  been set for a final judgment.  </P> <P> Both sides objected to the revised award as well and vowed to appeal. None of  the money has been paid. The towns had received $7.3 million in the original  judgment and sought an additional $8 million but received only $200,000 more.  </P></p>

This  is stressed in a communique on the plenary setting of the  Interparliamentary Assembly which ended today.    The participants in the sitting agreed with the proposal to  draw up a model criminal code and a model code of criminal  procedure and to speed up the preparation of legislative acts to  fight crime in the CIS. Stressing the urgency of maintaining  and recreating on new foundations a single educational and  culture space within the framework of the CIS, the Assembly  recommended that national parliaments adopt measures for the  development of cooperation. A recommendation was approved to  raise the social status of pupils in the system of education and  science, and to join the UNESCO convention "Agreement on the  importation of materials of an educational, scientific and  cultural nature". It was found expedient to draw up a  recommended act for keeping internal waters in CIS ecologically  safe. Measures were defined to prepare for the celebration of  victory in the 1941-1945 Great Patriotic War.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: McLeod Russel ahead 10% Pre-tax profits at McLeod Russel Holdings advanced 10 per cent, from Pounds 1.91m to Pounds 2.11m, in the six months to March 31. Mr Nigel Openshaw, chairman, said the benefits of reorganising Wheway, acquired in March last year, were beginning to show. He added that further improvement from the Wheway companies could be expected in the second half in addition to the seasonal bias towards the period. Turnover for the group, which has interests in surface coatings, environmental engineering and property investment, more than doubled to Pounds 55.1m (Pounds 21.5m). Operating profit rose 86 per cent to Pounds 2.79m (Pounds 1.5m) but the pre-tax figure was held back by net interest costs of Pounds 708,000 against income of Pounds 326,000. Group earnings per share were lower at 2.81p, against 3.01p, as a result of shares issued for Wheway. However, the interim dividend is maintained at 2.75p.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A four-lane bridge, the only direct link between Pensacola and suburban Gulf  Breeze, Fla., and used by thousands of commuters daily, was knocked out of  operation when a barge slammed into a concrete pillar supporting the center of  the 3-mile structure, knocking the pillar into the water. The bridge was clear  of traffic at the time and no injuries were reported. It will remain closed to  traffic for three weeks. The only other land access is a detour of about 60  miles. Officials said it was not known why the barge was unable to navigate  away from the pillar.  </P></p>

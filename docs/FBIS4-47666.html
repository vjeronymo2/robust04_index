			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 29 Apr (AFP) -- Christian Badibangi,  deputy external relations minister in Tshisekedi's radical  opposition government, yesterday at a news conference advocated  "armed struggle against the current government to achieve  democracy in Zaire."    Mr. Badibangi, leader of the Zairian Socialist Union  affiliated to the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition  hard-line faction [USOR], said he was convinced that the only  way to find a solution to the current political deadlock is "by  resorting to arms." The problem will be quickly resolved by  "engaging the people in an armed struggle, instead of hesitating  and wasting time with consultations and other meetings by the  High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament."    Mr. Badibangi also said his party reserved the right to quit  the USOR in case the latter "would prefer to continue to toe the  line of nonviolence, a principle which has still not proven to  be effective.    Another radical opposition political leader, Jacques  Malanda,  of the Convention of Nationalist Reformers, also affiliated to  USOR, had earlier threatened to resort to an "armed resistance"  at a news conference held on 2 March in the Angolan capital.</p>

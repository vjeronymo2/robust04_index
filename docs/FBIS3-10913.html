			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Interior Ministry this morning issued a  communique, addressed to the public, on the events scheduled for  15 March.    The communique notes that in view of the various  demonstrations by various sectors of society, the authorities  responsible for domestic security and public order report -- in  keeping with the people's constitutional rights and guarantees  -- that they will guarantee the people's right to peacefully  meet and demonstrate.    The communique also points out that the deployment of police  patrols during these demonstrations will serve to protect the  demonstrators and others who have nothing to do with the  demonstration and will prevent acts of vandalism against public  and private interests.    The communique ends by reminding those participating in the  demonstrations that they must act within the limits established  by their rights and prerogatives, without violating the rights  of third parties and that the sponsors of these demonstrations  are responsible for the development and outcome of the  demonstration and the collective attitude of those participating.</p>

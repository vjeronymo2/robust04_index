			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: Fondiaria debts put at L2,000bn FONDIARIA, Italy's third biggest private-sector insurance group, which posted consolidated losses of about L580bn (Dollars 392m) last year, is believed to have run up debts of about L2,000bn to finance foreign insurance expansion and diversification at home. The debt estimate, yet to be confirmed at Fondiaria's annual meeting, is appreciably higher than formerly believed. The size of borrowings indicates the task facing the group's new management under Mr Arrigo Bianchi di Lavagna, appointed managing director earlier this year. The debts stem from Fondiaria's investment in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs, Germany's second-biggest insurer, and expansion into areas such as hotels and clinics in Italy. The German venture, effectively wound up last month with the DM985m (Dollars 615.6m) sale of Fondiaria's 21 per cent stake in AMB, cost about DM1.2bn, excluding financing charges. No figures are available for the size of the domestic diversification. However, the move into hotels and clinics, involving management as well as ownership, is not believed to have been profitable. Mr Bianchi di Lavagna, in his first newspaper interview, said about L185bn of last year's losses stemmed from difficulties in reinsurance, handled by the holding company on behalf of subsidiaries. A large proportion had come from 'stop loss' policies for one subsidiary. Earnings had also been hit by extraordinary losses on equity stakes, notably AMB and the diversified operations, and by interest charges on borrowings. He said turning round the Fondiaria group, which comprises La Fondiaria Assicurazioni, La Previdente and Milano Assicurazioni as its three main operating subsidiaries, involved tariff increases and more selective vetting of policies on the loss-making third party car insurance side. The group is Italy's leader in third-party motor risks, with over 13.5 per cent of the market. Fondiaria would also have to reinforce and 're-educate' its sales agents to sell a wider range of policies and products, he said. The group has already indicated it intends to sell non-core activities to reduce debts. Negotiations on the disposal of Banca Mercantile, a 13-branch Florence-based bank owned jointly with Ferruzzi, are already under way. Other assets suitable for disposal include the group's five hotels and health activities. However, Mr Bianchi di Lavagna stressed the company would avoid a fire sale, and was currently weighing up the possibility of using a bank intermediary to obtain the proceeds for its stakes in AMB and the EPIC insurance partnership ahead of the May 1994 payment date.</p>

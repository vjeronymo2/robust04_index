			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Go-Ahead executives take pay-cuts In a move which appears to fly in the face of recent corporate trends, executive directors of Go-Ahead Group - which floated in May - have taken a pay cut. The reduction applies to the year to July 2 when the Gateshead-based bus service operator lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 315,000 to Pounds 2.87m, exceeding the prospectus forecast by 25 per cent. The total remuneration for Mr Martin Ballinger, managing director and highest paid director, declined from Pounds 131,000 to Pounds 101,000, with his salary falling to Pounds 90,000 (Pounds 117,000). The emoluments (excluding pension contributions) of Mr Trevor Shears, finance director, and Mr Christopher Moyes, commercial director, fell from the Pounds 115,000-Pounds 120,000 band into the Pounds 80,001-Pounds 85,000 band. Mr Shears said that directors sold some 6.63m shares at 120p at the flotation, and said that previous pay had included a 'bonus ownership reward'. From next year this will replaced by dividends on the directors' 34 per cent holding. Mr Shears said the executive salary levels were 'what we believe to be right for a business of our size'. He added that they were still tied to a public sector background, from the management buy-out in 1987. The fear of being seen as 'nasty capitalists' and the recommendations of the Monk Survey on size of business and regional position also contributed. A recent survey of directors' pay by actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow showed that executive salaries have risen by 8.5 per cent this year. Mr Shears said he expected Go-Ahead directors' salaries to rise in line with inflation next time. The annual results included some four months' contribution from Oxford Bus Company and six months from Brighton &amp; Hove Bus Company. On Tuesday, the group completed the near-Pounds 24m acquisition of London Central Bus Company.</p>

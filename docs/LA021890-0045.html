			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> TULIP GROWERS' PESTICIDES FLOOD WATERWAYS, DUTCH OFFICIALS SAY  </P> <P> Tulip growers are flooding local waterways in this flower-growing region with  pesticides, including such banned substances as DDT, to protect their crops,  water officials said Friday.  </P> <P> "All kinds of pesticides were found in surface waters in the bulb-growing area,  and their levels were far above the norms in most cases," said Hans van der  Hoek, a spokesman for the local water management board.  </P> <P> "In samples, we've even found long-banned substances such as DDT, aldrin, and  dieldrin," Van der Hoek said.  </P> <P> All three are highly toxic substances, but Van der Hoek said it had not been  determined if the pesticide levels in the water were a threat to public health.  </P> <P> One-fifth of the Netherlands' 39,500-acre bulb-growing area lies just north of  this western Dutch city. The remainder is spread over the northwestern and  central Netherlands.  </P> <P> Van der Hoek said that the water management board had launched a joint study  with the bulb growers on how to tackle the problem.  </P></p>

			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / UN peacekeepers pull out of Sarajevo UNITED Nations peacekeeping forces yesterday left Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, as Serb irregulars tightened their grip on the republic. A convoy of 40 vehicles, carrying 80 UN soldiers and personnel, including General Satish Nambiar, the Indian force commander, yesterday split in two and headed for safety in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, and Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital. This followed the withdrawal on Saturday of some 200 peacekeepers, which left about 120 soldiers and unarmed military observers in the besieged capital. The UN was forced to pull out by increasing violence in the fighting between Serb irregulars, backed by the federal army, and the mainly Moslem Bosnian forces for control of the capital. Although a lull in the fighting was reported yesterday, a demand by Bosnian authorities for the federal army to quit two barracks in Sarajevo was expected to lead to new clashes. Mr Hajrudin Somun, an official of the Bosnian presidency, also demanded that the army leave their weapons. Bosnia's poorly-armed forces have been unable to stop Serb irregulars from seizing control of two-thirds of Bosnia's territory. Belgrade radio yesterday reported that Serb forces surrounding the eastern town of Gorazde demanded that Moslem forces surrender in order to 'liberate' the town, near the River Drina which marks Bosnia's eastern frontier with Serbia. Gorazde, which is 70 per cent Moslem, is one of the last outposts of Moslem control in eastern Bosnia. The European Community and the US have placed most of the blame on Serbia for destabilising Bosnia. International attempts to stop the violence in Bosnia have so far failed to force Serbia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, into a change of policy. Instead, in an effort to further isolate the young republic, the Serb-led federal army yesterday refused to allow journalists to cross into Bosnia from Serbia. The UN withdrawal from Sarajevo, which will remain the symbolic headquarters of peacekeeping operations in neighbouring Croatia, is likely to demoralise its battered population. Crowds of Moslems threw lilacs and cheered the UN convoy, though it was forced to stop at dozens of Serb barricades as it crawled through Bosnia. But Serb villagers, showing their anger at international diplomatic pressure against Serbia, spat and jeered as the white UN lorries passed through self-proclaimed Serb territory. Most Serbs, who make up 31 per cent of the 4.35m population, oppose independence, which is backed by Moslems and Croatia. Meanwhile, the inhabitants of the north-eastern city of Tuzla feared that the army would retaliate for the death of nine federal soldiers on Friday night. Local authorities said fierce explosions shook Tuzla and Bihac, in north-west Bosnia, when the Serb-led federal air force detonated explosions at airports, including underground runways and hangars.</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Arts: Fringe developments showbiz and sexual politics, the former exemplified by their biopic Valentino, the latter by a trilogy culminating in the provocatively titled The Woman Who Cooked her Husband. They have one style, a gutsy physical theatre, strongly influenced by film and punctuated with recordings of popular song. Their latest show combines the lot in what I wish I could report as a ground-breaking venture. But this talented young company, led by writer, director and sometime performer Debbie Isitt, has developed a patter as repetitive in its way as the jokes of a down-beat stand-up. You Never Know Who's Out There, which is being premiered at London's Drill Hall Arts Centre by the Other Theatre of Comedy, follows a group of club performers from scratch to scratch, using their work as a mirror for their lives. Bobby Vincent, the king of comedy, sublimates a deep streak of misogyny in an act based on sexist jibes, to which his wife, 'the lovely Faye", responds by getting sozzled. Manager Sonny plays each off against the other, while tolerating his tatty ventriloquist brother, and running in terror from his guest artiste, a dumpy drag queen who 'does Cher'. Isitt's big problem is structure. She writes pithily and funnily, but increasingly I feel she uses her trademark style as a shield against the demands of developing a fully satisfying play. She certainly has a knack of assembling fine performers (James Gaddas and Beverley Klein stand out alongside a rather subdued Mark Kilmurry), but her plot merely serves to illustrate the scenario of second-rate people living second-rate lives. There is nothing second rate about Medea, the original snarling beastie, who is dragged kicking and screaming to to the Lilian Baylis Theatre by the veteran women's ensemble Monstrous Regiment. Clare Venables, the company's new artistic director, has modernised Euripedes' tragedy into a feminist stock-taking exercise which dispenses with higher wisdoms to represent Jason (Martin Gower) as a patronising opportunist who, notwithstanding that he has ostensibly walked out on his wife for no very good reason, would seem entitled to sue for divorce on grounds of unreasonable behaviour. Ishia Bennison's thoroughly modern Medea hurls books and crocks, scribbles on walls and finally kills her two strapping sons in what one can only regard as a tantrum. Oh, how one longs to offer her a coffee and a Kleenex - as indeed Sue Holland's pained Chorus does at one point. This is the third adaptation of Medea to hit the stage in the last few months and it is the least convincing, because it gives no sense of a divine or historic injustice bearing down on an individual. Women do pick the wrong men, and husbands do walk out on their wives, but a crisis is not the same as a tragedy. The crisis of David Mamet's short 1985 play The Shawl is not of faith but of agnosticism. Is it possible, he asks, that a charlatan faith healer could have some sort of psychic powers? If so, could he find the language to express what he sees, when his act is so entirely geared to duping people. This is a virtuoso piece of linguistic juggling which is very adequately served by a young cast at Camden Town's Etcetera Theatre under the direction of Bryce Pedersen. They could, however, take a lesson from the Snarling Beasties and find themselves a better name. Uneasy in my Easy Chair Theatre Company hardly promises a pleasurable evening's fringe-going.</p>

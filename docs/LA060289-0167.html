			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT;  </P> <P> DUSTIN HOFFMAN PANNED AS SHYLOCK  </P> <P> Dustin Hoffman received mixed reviews today after his British stage debut as  Shylock in Shakespeare's play, "The Merchant of Venice."  </P> <P> While the production won cheers Thursday night from a celebrity-studded  first-night audience at London's Phoenix Theater, critic Irving Wardle wrote in  The Times of London today:  </P> <P> "All the clamorous hype and slavering expectation is a poor preparation for the  modest Shylock who arrived on the Phoenix stage last night. . . . Hoffman's is  much the most genial Shylock that I have seen."  </P> <P> Jack Tinker wrote in the London tabloid the Daily Mail: "Without being great,  he is most certainly good."  </P></p>

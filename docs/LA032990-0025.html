			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Shalom to the Berlin Orchestra: At last, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra will  visit Israel on April 10-18.  </P> <P> Until Herbert Von Karajan resigned as the orchestra's chief conductor shortly  before his death last year, a visit to Israel was taboo because of Karajan's  reported links to the Nazi party. Israeli conductor Daniel Barenboim will lead  the orchestra in Jerusalem, Haifa and Tel Aviv. At the final concert on April  18 in Tel Aviv, the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Zubin Mehta,  will play a joint concert with the Berlin ensemble. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

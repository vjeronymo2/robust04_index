			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 7% UTILITY TAX UP TO VOTERS TUESDAY IN CASH-STRAPPED HUNTINGTON PARK  </P> <P> The city's voters on Tuesday will decide the fate of a 7% utility tax that  would raise an estimated $2.74 million a year in additional revenue for this  financially strapped city.  </P> <P> The city's five councilmen are strong proponents of the measure. They say the  tax is essential if the city is to hire more police officers to keep pace with  a growing population and gain stable financial footing.  </P> <P> "The future of the city will be determined on the 12th of September," said  Councilman Jim Roberts, who heads a political action committee in support of  the measure. "If we don't get this passed, we're going to go back to some major  cuts."  </P> <P> But opponents contend that the council has made some poor financial decisions,  which include tying up million of dollars in the city's redevelopment program.  That money could have been used for police salaries, among other things,  opponents argue. They also say residents of Huntington Park, which was recently  rated one of the poorest communities in the nation, should not have to pay for  those decisions.  </P> <P> "It is not a police issue. . . . It's a money issue," said Louis Hernandez,  chairman of a group called Huntington Park Citizens for Responsible Government.  "The City Council stresses (the need for more police) to cover up their  mistakes in redevelopment."  </P> <P> Roberts' Committee for Utility Users Tax is sending out several flyers and  campaigning door-to-door in support of the measure, the councilman said. The  Huntington Park Police Officers Assn. has been campaigning for the utility tax.  Signs urging "Yes" votes on the measure are in the windows of some businesses  near City Hall.  </P> <P> The Committee for Utility Users Tax raised $4,548 and spent $2,385 as of Aug.  27, according to campaign disclosure statements.  </P> <P> Roberts donated $100 to the effort. Curtis Fresch, listed as president of Poker  Club Management, which controls the Huntington Park Casino, donated $500, as  did his brother, Eric Fresch, agent for H. P. Disposal, a garbage company that  holds the city's commercial trash collection franchise.  </P> <P> The joint reelection committee for councilmen Thomas E. Jackson and Jack Parks  donated $479.99, and the reelection committee for City Clerk Marilyn Boyette  and City Treasurer Eileen F. Gerardi provided $995.12, according to the  statements. The Huntington Park Police Officers Assn. donated $1,472.  </P> <P> Hernandez's group, Huntington Park Citizens for Responsible Government, is  working to defeat the measure by telephoning voters, going door-to-door and  sending out a mailer, he said.  </P> <P> The group raised $800 as of last week to oppose the ballot measure, Hernandez  said. The contributions include $100 from Hernandez and $200 from Morrison  Escrow Co., which is owned by the wife of former Huntington Park Police Chief  Geano Contessotto, Hernandez said. The committee is not required to file a  campaign disclosure statement unless it raises or spends $1,000, Boyette said.  </P> <P> City officials thought their financial problems were solved and that they would  be able to hire more police last May 15, when the council approved a 7% tax on  electricity, gas, water and telephone usage. The tax was to have taken effect  when the fiscal year started on July 1.  </P> <P> But a recent state Supreme Court decision undercut the council's authority to  impose the tax without voter approval. The council decided against collecting  the tax and scheduled Tuesday's special election.  </P> <P> If approved by voters, the tax will raise about $2.74 million for the city's  anemic general fund, which pays for most city services, including police  protection.  </P> <P> City officials say they want to use about $1 million of the tax money to hire  22 new Police Department employees, including two sergeants and 13 officers.  </P> <P> The rest of the money would probably go toward employee raises and to restore  some positions that have been cut to reduce city spending over the past two  years, Chief Administrative Officer Donald L. Jeffers said.  </P> <P> Earlier this summer, the council approved an austerity budget that had more  than $150,000 in cuts from last year's spending plan. Those cuts included the  elimination of three maintenance and painting positions that were vacant or  filled with temporary employees, Jeffers said.  </P> <P> No raises were budgeted for city employees. The city's three employee  associations have agreed that their members will continue working at current  pay levels, pending the outcome of the election. Huntington Park employees  received a 4.2% raise last year, which costs the city about $300,000 annually.  </P> <P> The budget projects spending of about $10.2 million from the general fund,  leaving a scant reserve of $11,400 for the year. The city finished the last  year with a $475,000 general fund reserve.  </P> <P> City officials say Huntington Park's financial problems are the result of  various factors. Federal and state subsidies have been reduced or eliminated,  depriving the city of more than $1 million annually for the past two years.  </P> <P> The city also has lost three truck and car dealerships in the past year that  generated about $1 million in annual sales tax revenue, Jeffers said.  </P> <P> The city has picked up new businesses and sales tax money, which has kept  general fund revenues relatively stable, but labor and other costs have  increased, Jeffers noted.  </P> <P> Those financial difficulties have been complicated by the city's Redevelopment  Agency, which has borrowed about $14 million from the city in the past several  years to pay its debts.  </P> <P> The city loaned the Redevelopment Agency about $1.5 million in sales tax  revenue during 1987-88 and about $750,000 last year, Jeffers said. He estimates  that the city will have to loan the agency as much as $500,000 this year.  </P> <P> Tax opponent Hernandez said city residents and businesses should not have to  pay for the "mismanaged, debt-ridden and overly aggressive redevelopment  agency."  </P> <P> Councilman Roberts admitted that the council should not have let the  Redevelopment Agency get into debt it could not repay without draining city  resources. The council doubles as the board of directors for the Redevelopment  Agency.  </P> <P> But Roberts argued that most of the $14 million should have been held in  reserve, anyway, for unforeseen costs, such as rebuilding after an earthquake.  He said the utility tax revenue is still needed to pay for additional police  and other services.  </P> <P> Roberts also said city residents and businesses could afford the tax. He  estimates the tax for the average residential customer will be about $10 a  month.  </P> <P> "The bill is not an unreasonable price to pay for a community when you're going  to have improved law enforcement, improved protection," Roberts said.  </P> <P> The council's call for more officers is supported by a recent study by the  Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.  The study indicated the city's ratio of officers to residents is lower than the  state average.  </P> <P> The Police Department is authorized to have 59 sworn officers. With a  population of about 52,000, Huntington Park has 1.13 officers per 1,000  residents. The average city police department in the state has a 1.51 officers  per 1,000 residents, the report said.  </P> <P> Hernandez and other tax opponents said they agree there is a need for more  police, but they said many residents, especially senior citizens on fixed  incomes, would unfairly feel the bite.  </P> <P> "I have $90 to live for the month," said senior citizen Ann Tribolet, who is  opposed to the levy. "With the tax I'd have $80."  </P> <P> A recently released study by Chicago-based urbanologist Pierre deVise listed  Huntington Park as the seventh poorest community in the country with a  per-capita income of $6,298.  </P> <P> Opponents also have contended that there is no guarantee the money will be used  for police enforcement. In an attempt to neutralize that argument, the City  Council voted last week to authorize the hiring of 15 policemen, if the tax  measure passes. Police Chief Patrick M. Connolly said it would take a minimum  of six months to fill the positions.  </P> <P> If the measure is unsuccessful, city officials will review the budget to  identify cuts to free money for employee raises, Jeffers said.  </P> <P> Huntington Park Police Officers Assn. President William Diers said failure of  the measure would be a "major disappointment" to the department's overworked  officers. But he said there is no threat of a police strike.  </P></p>

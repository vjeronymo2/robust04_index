			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Walesa snub for parliament POLAND'S President Lech Walesa yesterday snubbed both houses of Parliament when he failed to attend a ceremonial joint session to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the country's first modern constitution. Instead, Mr Walesa went to the Catholic shrine of Czestochowa for celebrations traditionally held on May 3. He returned to Warsaw at noon to attend a military parade and wreath-laying ceremony at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The president failed to attend parliament against the advice of Cardinal Joseph Glemp, the Polish primate, and Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, the prime minister. His gesture clearly signals that he attaches more importance to the church and the military as sources of support than to Parliament as an institution. He is particularly concerned to distance himself from this parliament, which was elected in June 1989 under a deal between Solidarity and the Communist authorities.</p>

The latest poll conducted by the  National Consulting Center and reported today by Caracol shows  that presidential hopeful Ernesto Samper Pizano has a five-point  advantage over Andres Pastrana in the first president election  and a seven-point advantage in the runoff election.    This poll, conducted between 3 and 8 February, days before  the official announcement of the Pastrana candidacy, also  includes other candidates. Some 38 percent of those polled said  they would vote for Ernesto Samper, 33 percent said they would  vote for Pastrana, 11 percent for Antonio Navarro Wolff, 4  percent for Miguel Maza Marquez, 3 percent for Enrique Parejo, 3  percent for Regina 11, 1 percent for Rodrigo Marin, and 1  percent for Juan Diego Jaramillo.    In the runoff election, 50 percent of those polled said they  would vote for Ernesto Samper and 43 percent favored Andres  Pastrana. In the poll, interviewees were also asked about the  Liberal Party [PL] consultation. Samper came in first with 59  percent, while De La Calle came in second with 12 percent.    Amid this myriad of figures, candidates, polls, surveys, and  elections, some people remain confused. To better inform the  public, five elections will be held this year. The election to  select congressional and presidential candidates for the PL will  be held on 13 March. The first round of presidential elections  will be held on 8 May; the runoff presidential election is  scheduled for 29 May. The elections for governors, deputies,  councilmembers, and local administrative boards will be held on  30 October. This will be the end of a long political year.</p>

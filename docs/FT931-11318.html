			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Goulding ends role as peace negotiator MR MARRACK Goulding, the senior Briton in the United Nations secretariat, who has been in charge of its peacekeeping operations for the past six years, is to become under-secretary general for political affairs as part of a reorganisation programme initiated by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary general. Mr Goulding's successor will be his Ghanaian deputy, Mr Kofi Annan. Mr Goulding, a former member of Britain's UN mission and later ambassador to Angola, replaces Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, a former Soviet deputy foreign minister, who moves to Geneva as head of the UN European Office. Mr Antoine Blanca, current UN chief in Geneva, will be returning to the French government service from which he was seconded. The changes are effective on March 1. Mr Boutros Ghali will soon have to replace Mr Dick Thornburgh, former US attorney-general, who has been serving as head of UN administration and management but resigned after President Bill Clinton's victory.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>   [Text] China and the United States yesterday reached a  last- minute agreement on the textile trade thereby forestalling  a major trade war which would have left Hong Kong caught in the  middle. Under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by  chief U.S. negotiator Jennifer Hillman and Chinese Deputy Trade  Minister Shi Guangsheng, the United States agreed not to impose  the quota reductions of up to 35 percent threatened two weeks  ago, while China agreed to take strict measures to crack down on  the illegal transshipment of textiles to the United States.    Mr Shi said both parties were "satisfied" with the agreement  and had pledged to work closely together to ensure such disputes  did not arise again. The agreement was in the interests of both  China and the United States and would also be of considerable  benefit to Hong Kong and Macau, he said.    Wu Yi, China's Foreign Trade Minister, hailed the agreement  as a breakthrough after months of fruitless talks between  Beijing and Washington. "The strengthening of our co-operation  will not only help to strengthen our bilateral economic and  trade relations but also promote peace and world development,"  Ms Wu told Ms Hillman before the pact was signed yesterday. "We  should join hands on cracking down on middlemen and hope for  close co-operation to implement the agreement," Ms Wu said.    Ms Hillman said she was also pleased to announce the  agreement.    Under the U.S. trade system, textile trade is controlled by  agreements that set export quotas for different kinds of cloth  products. The United States claimed that China has exceeded its  quota by US$2 billion (HK$15.5 billion) a year, mostly by  shipping goods with fake labels through third countries.    In a briefing for the mainland and Hong Kong press after the  signing ceremony, Mr Shi admitted that China had been using  "fraudulent means" to violate the quotas established by the last  Sino-American bilateral textile agreement. But he said such  fraudulent and illegal activities damaged the interests of both  countries and had led to "chaos in the market".    Although the United States has agreed not to impose drastic  cuts on Chinese imports this year, China did agree to accept  some quota reduction but no more than three times the amount of  textiles conclusively proven to have been illegally  trans-shipped. However, the exact quotas have apparently yet to  be worked out. In addition to the trans-shipment issue, China  also agreed to major adjustments of some categories of the  textile quota proposed by the Americans.    MOU was only a prelude to a full bilateral textile  agreement,  Chinese trade officials said. But China has agreed on a key  issue of trans-shipments of Chinese textiles to the United  States via third countries. It will significantly step up its  inspection of local and joint venture textile exporters to  ensure that transshipments are controlled. China will  rigorously enforce its own laws and regulations and severely  punish those companies found to be engaging in illegal  activities, Mr Shi said. Companies will have their export  licences cancelled and in certain cases legal proceedings will  be taken against the company managers and directors responsible.    China also agreed to allow U.S. Embassy personnel in Beijing  to accompany Chinese officials on inspection tours of textile  factories on the mainland, providing the factories concerned  agreed, Mr Shi said. The deputy trade minister said that both  parties had made "great efforts" and each side had made  compromises to ensure that an agreement was reached.    But while a tentative agreement has been reached, analysts  said it would be several months before it could establish if  China's promise to crack down on transshipments really was being  implemented. "This is obviously an encouraging sign, but it  remains to be seen if China can live up to the agreement," a  Western diplomat in Beijing said.    Yesterday's agreement came just two days before U.S.  Treasury  Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's scheduled visit to China. Mr Bentsen  will become the highest ranking Clinton administration official  to visit China.</p>

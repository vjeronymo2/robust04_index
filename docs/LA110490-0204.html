			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHIP TECHNOLOGY WITHOUT THE MANUFACTURING  </P> <P> It's long been an article of faith in the computer chip business that because  the tiny slivers of silicon are so difficult to make efficiently, manufacturing  technology is crucial to success.  </P> <P> But that conventional wisdom is being challenged by the "fabless" chip  companies, who maintain that manufacturing capability is now a commodity, and  good design is what matters.  </P> <P> Chip industry pundit Andrew Rappaport, president of Technology Research Group  in Boston, likes to rile conference audiences by asserting that silicon is now  effectively "free." So many circuits can now be engraved on a chip with  relative ease, he says, that good design rather than good production technology  is the key to good products.  </P> <P> If that hypothesis is true, it portends a fundamental change in the structure  of the chip business. The industry would divide into two types of companies: a  small number of "foundries," mostly in Asia, that spend the $50 million to $500  million needed for each "fab," and a plethora of chip-design firms that work  closely with customers and use foundries for manufacturing.  </P> <P> At least one Asian company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., has gone  into business explicitly to make products for others. Other firms have actively  pursued foundry work while also doing their own designs.  </P> <P> But foundry arrangements work much better for some types of products than  others. Chips &amp; Technologies, for example, designs chip sets for personal  computers that are relatively unsophisticated from a manufacturing point of  view.  </P> <P> On the other hand, fabless firms such as Xilinx, Lattice Semiconductor and  Vitilec have products that do in fact require a leading-edge production  process.  </P> <P> "There are companies for whom the value-added is in the process, and there are  companies whose products are primarily intellectual property, and are less  dependent on the process," said George Alexy, vice president of marketing at  Milpitas-based Cirrus Logic.  </P> <P> Many simply do not buy the notion that the foundry function will ever be  entirely split off from design and marketing. Hector Ruiz, senior vice  president at Motorola's semiconductor unit, says the biggest chip companies are  continuing to gain market share at the expense of smaller firms. The future, he  says, is with companies that can design, market and manufacture their products.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'FABLESS' CHIP FIRMS  </P> <P> A sampling of some larger 'fabless' semiconductor firms and the manufacturers  of their chips.  </P> <P> Company: Actel  </P> <P> Year Founded: 1985  </P> <P> Revenues (latest fiscal year): NA (privately held)  </P> <P> Manufacturers: Matsushita, Texas Instruments, Hewlett-Packard  </P> <P> </P> <P> Company: Altera  </P> <P> Year Founded: 1983  </P> <P> Revenues (latest fiscal year): $58.9 million  </P> <P> Manufacturers: Sharp, Intel, Cypress, Texas Instruments  </P> <P> </P> <P> Company: Chips &amp; Technologies  </P> <P> Year Founded: 1984  </P> <P> Revenues (latest fiscal year): $293.4 million  </P> <P> Manufacturers: Toshiba, Fujitsu, NEC, Yamaha, Taiwan Semiconductor, LSI Logic,  National Semiconductor, NCR  </P> <P> </P> <P> Company: Cirrus Logic  </P> <P> Year Founded: 1984  </P> <P> Revenues (latest fiscal year): $85 million  </P> <P> Manufacturers: NA  </P> <P> </P> <P> Company: Crystal Semiconductor  </P> <P> Year Founded: 1984  </P> <P> Revenues (latest fiscal year): NA (privately held)  </P> <P> Manufacturers: NA  </P> <P> </P> <P> Company: Lattice Semiconductor  </P> <P> Year Founded: 1983  </P> <P> Revenues (latest fiscal year): $38.9 million  </P> <P> Manufacturers: Seiko-Epson  </P> <P> </P> <P> Company: Maxim Integrated Products  </P> <P> Year Founded: 1985  </P> <P> Revenues (latest fiscal year): $56 million  </P> <P> Manufacturers: NA  </P> <P> </P> <P> Company: Weitek  </P> <P> Year Founded: 1981  </P> <P> Revenues (latest fiscal year): $49.2 million  </P> <P> Manufacturers: Hewlett-Packard, Matsushita, Toshiba  </P> <P> </P> <P> Company: Xilinx  </P> <P> Year Founded: 1984  </P> <P> Revenues (latest fiscal year): $50 million  </P> <P> Manufacturers: Seiko-Epson  </P> <P> Other small, privately held fabless firms: Simtek, Plus Logic, International  CMOS Technology, Integrated Information Technology, Cyrix, Cascade  Microdevices.  </P> <P> Sources: Hambrecht &amp; Quist, Technologic Partners, individual companies  </P> <P> </P></p>

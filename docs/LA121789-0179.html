			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SKI RESORTS FIND HELP 'DOWN UNDER';  </P> <P> RECREATION: ALONG WITH AUSSIE AND KIWI ACCENTS, SKIERS ALSO ARE ENCOUNTERING  HIGHER PRICES FOR LIFT TICKETS, ICIER ROADS AND A PROLIFERATION OF PREVIOUSLY  BANNED SNOW BOARDS.  </P> <P> With young ski bums fading from the scene -- another phenomenon of the aging  American population -- California mountain resorts are reaching south for  workers willing to endure low pay in order to ski for free all winter.  </P> <P> "G'day mate," said Brian Ross, self-proclaimed "year-round skier" and part-time  food server, sitting with friends inside the Bar of America here. He is one of  300 or more Australians and New Zealanders imported for the season at Sierra  ski areas.  </P> <P> The "down under" English of the Aussies and Kiwis has -- along with $35 lift  tickets, icier roads and the proliferation of snow boards -- dealt tradition a  beating this ski season, which began before Thanksgiving at most Northern  California resorts.  </P> <P> In past winters, ski areas employed a few dozen Australians and New Zealanders,  mostly as ski instructors. But this year the ski resorts have recruited  overseas even for less-skilled jobs as groomers, lift operators and cafeteria  workers -- with the blessing of U.S. and state labor officials.  </P> <P> The reason is that ski areas are finding it harder to entice Americans to take  the low-paying, often bone-chilling jobs running lifts, grooming slopes and  checking tickets. The work itself hasn't changed much. But there are fewer  young people willing to endure the hardships, even for the chance to ski for  free and enjoy a white Christmas.  </P> <P> "These ski resorts hire literally thousands of people in season, and the  numbers (of job seekers) just aren't here," said Michael Henriques, Lake Tahoe  manager of the state Employment Development Department. "Typically these ski  jobs are filled by younger people. And there are just fewer 20-year-olds coming  into the labor market."  </P> <P> The U.S. Department of Labor, which must certify that the foreign workers are  necessary, began in late November to publicize that the jobs were going  begging. But officials found little demand, even in the Truckee area, where the  town's landmark sawmill closed down before Thanksgiving.  </P> <P> "It puzzles us," said Paul Nelson, who oversees the foreign visa program for  the Department of Labor in San Francisco. "We've had no one apply as a result  of any publicity."  </P> <P> Ski area managers say the shortage of workers has worsened steadily through the  late 1980s. Low-paying employers in many parts of California face the same  problem in attracting help, but it is more acute in resort areas such as the  Lake Tahoe region, where casinos, motels and restaurants also compete for  workers.  </P> <P> Ski areas have fought the trend with more aggressive recruiting and higher  wages. During the summer, for example, Mammoth Mountain decided to increase  wages by 20% for some jobs. A ski lift crew member with no experience makes $6  an hour this season, up $1 from last season. (Lift prices also shot up by $5,  to $35).  </P> <P> "As recently as five years ago there were lines to get jobs here," said Mammoth  personnel director John Denault. "Now we have to recruit."  </P> <P> The supply of available, willing help has shrunk with the slow demise of the  ski bum, that breed of American youth who would scrape by at odd jobs in order  to ski their legs off all winter. Recruiters for the ski areas say they cannot  find enough students and recent graduates who are willing to delay their  careers to ski.  </P> <P> "They are not giving themselves time to go off and play for awhile," said Tim  Newhart, marketing director at Heavenly Valley, the large South Lake Tahoe ski  area with slopes on both sides of the California-Nevada border.  </P> <P> Heavenly Valley so far has hired about 65 workers from overseas, not a high  percentage of its 1,200 employees, but more than in past years. Elsewhere in  the Tahoe area, half a dozen smaller resorts have applied for government  approval to hire more than 200 Australians and New Zealanders, and as many as  100 may also be employed under cultural exchange programs.  </P> <P> For the ski areas the imports are a near-perfect match. They speak English and  treasure the free ski lift pass. "I like to ski -- and this lets me ski most of  the year," said Ross, 24, who said he is from a small town outside Sydney. Like  Ross, many come directly from a full winter of ski resort work in the Southern  hemisphere and need little training.  </P> <P> "They are generally the cream of the crop from Australian and New Zealand  resorts," said Greg Peterman, vice president for human resources at Heavenly  Valley.  </P> <P> Foreigners are also attractive to the resorts because they tend to stay until  spring. Every January the ski areas are thrown into disarray when many of their  American employees rush back to college campuses, an annual ritual that  depletes the staff at a time when the snow is often good and crowds are high.  </P> <P> "We lose about half our staff when school starts up in January," said Mammoth's  Denault. "And it's real difficult to recruit in January."  </P> <P> Besides recruiting in the Southern Hemisphere, ski areas are also trying a  packet of other tactics to lure and keep more workers. Mammoth is helping  underwrite the costs of community college classes to begin next month in  Mammoth Lakes, the town at the foot of the ski area, in the hope of enticing  more student workers to stay past January.  </P> <P> Mammoth also offered more jobs to people whose usual employment gives them  winters off -- seasonal forestry workers and, for the first time, to Southern  California beach lifeguards.  </P> <P> Some ski areas also have been forced to help pay the housing costs of workers.  Heavenly Valley bought an apartment building and displaced local residents to  make room for ski area workers -- a controversial move in South Lake Tahoe,  where new apartments have not been built in many years and where housing is at  a premium.  </P> <P> Northstar, a north Tahoe resort, recently took over a hilltop lodge in Truckee  for its employees. Northstar also has arranged to exchange employees with  summer resorts in the upper Midwest -- sending workers in summer to Mackinaw  Island, Mich., and Brainard, Minn., and receiving workers in winter. But still,  about 10% of Northstar's 800 employees are foreign, most of them exchange  students and recent graduates from Australia, New Zealand and Europe, said  personnel manager Jacquelyn Cleary.  </P> <P> Besides hearing more Aussie accents, many skiers this season will also share  the slopes with snow boards for the first time. Mammoth and most of the larger  Tahoe ski areas -- which forbade snow boards in past years -- have opened their  mountains to board riders, usually without restriction.  </P> <P> In part, the ski areas have learned not to fear the "shredders," who carve  turns down the slopes on boards that resemble a large skateboard. As with  skateboards, the aficionados enjoy performing radical jumps and maneuvers, a  practice that resorts feared would annoy family skiers.  </P> <P> But the ski industry has lured fewer new customers in recent years, and snow  boarders are now seen by many ski areas as their best opportunity for growth.  </P> <P> "Snow boards are here to stay," said Tim Newhart, spokesman for Heavenly  Valley.  </P> <P> Another new feature in the Tahoe area this season is likely to be icier roads.  After several thousand trees along Tahoe highways died last winter from tainted  runoff water, the Legislature ordered the state Department of Transportation to  use less salt on roads this winter. The salt melts snow and helps de-ice the  roads.  </P> <P> For motorists, the use of less salt and experiments with other chemicals are  expected to require more use of tire chains.  </P></p>

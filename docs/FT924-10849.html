			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Power struggle starts to affect government: The LDP's search for leader of a key faction IT began late last year as a financial scandal at an obscure trucking company called Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin. Two weeks ago it claimed the career of Japan's most powerful politician, Mr Shin Kanemaru. This week the struggle to succeed him could begin to hamper seriously the government of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa as the Diet, the Japanese parliament, reopens tomorrow. The battle to succeed Mr Kanemaru as head of the Takeshita faction, the biggest LDP grouping, comes at a particularly delicate time for the government as it attempts to revive a rapidly flagging economy, waits anxiously for the outcome of the Gatt world trade talks and ponders what may lie in store if the US elects a Democrat president. A majority of the LDP leaders have thrown their weight behind Mr Keizo Obuchi as Mr Kanemaru's successor. They face determined opposition from Mr Ichiro Ozawa, architect of the LDP's 1990 election victory who became used to wielding power as Mr Kanemaru's right-hand man. The struggle is far from over. Much depends on how Mr Ozawa pursues the fight. Although he is in a minority in the 109-member faction as a whole, he claims a majority among its 67 representatives in the lower house, the most powerful part of the legislature. The creation of a new party is out of the question. The New Liberal Club, which broke away from the LDP in 1975, returned to the fold ignominiously defeated after 11 years. The risk of starting a new Ozawa faction within the LDP is that it might be marginalised. Since the 1960s, when the LDP was made up of about 10 factions, the party has been dominated by four very large groupings all named after their current leaders or founders - Mr Takeshita; prime minister Mr Miyazawa; Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister; and Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, the party's former policy research chairman. Long-running and vicious personal feuds have been a hallmark of LDP politics from the party's foundation in the mid-1950s. The significance of this dispute is that it comes at a time when political leadership and stability will be at a premium on foreign and domestic issues. The power struggle could delay and complicate the Diet's main task, to enact the emergency Y10,700bn (Pounds 54bn) public spending package announced in August. The authority of Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, will not have been enhanced by his public siding with Mr Ozawa. The opposition parties may yet threaten to delay passage of the measures until Mr Takeshita agrees to submit to questioning in the Diet. Mr Kanemaru's authority was vital in forcing an often unwieldy and fractious bureaucracy to pull the package together. The Ministry of Finance wanted to delay announcing a package until late September. Officials were ordered to bring it forward. When Mr Kanemaru gave his approval to the package in mid-August, that endorsement quelled LDP criticism of the Finance Ministry. There is no one of his stature and authority to exert that kind of discipline over policymaking at a time when government spending is crucial to encourage domestic economic growth. The debate over Japanese fiscal policy and public spending, in which many LDP politicians have already called for higher borrowing and income tax cuts, could become unruly. In the 1980s political and economic disciplines worked in tandem in Japan. Tight control of public spending exerted discipline over the LDP factions because there was less scope for interest groups to bid for subsidies and spending projects. The Takeshita faction's unity and authority was central to the introduction of the controversial 3 per cent consumption tax in 1989. The combination of a rise in public spending and a decline in political discipline could encourage interest groups to outbid one another in offering political support in return for government help to see them through the downturn. On international issues too, it could become more difficult for the government to agree clear responses swiftly. The election of a Democrat President Bill Clinton would spell a period of unsettling uncertainty in Japan over the direction of US foreign and trade policy. US diplomats say Mr Ozawa and Mr Kanemaru played a vital role in drumming up Japan's contribution to the Gulf war effort and passing the peacekeeping bill last year. Their familiarity with the Washington establishment may be lacking at a vital time. A deal between the US and Europe to cut agricultural subsidies through the Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)talks would also put the LDP on the spot over the domestically contentious issue of opening up the Japanese rice market. Mr Kozo Watanabe, the trade minister and an Ozawa supporter, had hurriedly to return home and cover his tracks at the weekend after suggesting Japan would have to respond positively to a Gatt deal. It is thought that only someone of Mr Kanemaru's stature would have the authority to push through measures to liberalise the rice market for the sake of a Gatt agreement. As a senior western diplomat in Tokyo put it: 'Mr Miyazawa started as prime minister by trying to manage the Diet and the party without the Takeshita faction and he failed, that is why he had to rely upon Kanemaru and Ozawa.' The alliance supporting Mr Miyazawa is held together only by a common determination to stop Mr Ozawa. The grouping will soon have to address a range of issues - not least a delicate cabinet reshuffle - which could test its unity. If the alliance members start squabbling among themselves Mr Miyzawa's job will become doubly difficult. Westerners have two contrasting views of Japan's leadership. One is that Japan is blessed with highly effective institutions such as the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, staffed by far-sighted bureaucrats. The other is that Japanese politics is bedevilled by near-paralysis because no one has the authority to pull together conflicting ministries, politicians and interest groups. Over the next few weeks Japan's politics could swing - possibly quite sharply - towards paralysis.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Room for Confidence in Civil Service"] </F>   [Text] A survey conducted by eminent commentator on public  affairs Dr Joseph Cheng at the City Polytechnic has raised some  alarm in some quarters about staff morale in the civil service.  More than 1,00 directorate-grade officers were asked about their  plans. Thirty five per cent said they wanted to leave  government service after 1997. Also, 60 per cent trusted the  monitoring role of the Legislative Council, saying they would  find it difficult to adjust to China sovereignty, against 17 per  cent expressing confidence in the accountability of the China  authorities. The overall conclusion seemed to be a negative one  where civil servants' confidence in the future is concerned.  "There is strong resentment against political interference from  China," the poll found. "A sense of impotence is evident among  senior bureaucrats."    In the light of the division in the civil service, as in the  public -- occasioned by the ongoing Sino-British tug-of-war --  the survey was not altogether surprising. But there is no need  to panic. One aspect of the statistics is interesting and could  have some hidden meaning. The results said that 77 per cent of  those surveyed held foreign passports -- 66 per cent of these  being of the exclusively "home" British variety. It is to be  assumed that those intending to leave the civil service will not  be lost to Hong Kong completely but will be seeking  opportunities in the private sector.  <H5>  Ideology </H5>   But even should the 350-odd senior-rankers make good their  intention, there should be no undue cause for alarm. There are  substantially more people in the civil service with commitments  to Hong Kong as a place secure and stable enough for a contented  livelihood, than those influenced by ideology.    Throughout the 45-year history of this newspaper, we have  constantly observed and remarked on the ever-inflationary trend  of the government bureaucracy. It has been our view, that the  government tended always to ensure its own safety in numbers,  disregarding the consequences to taxpayers.    In recent years, and as we grind on towards 1997, there have  been more reasons for the government to enlarge and fatten  itself, this time with less inhibition -- the public is  preoccupied with successive political crises. The civil service  and its problems are a rice-bowl issue that should command a  higher priority. Government service today is the envy of many  wage earners.    It is not convincing to the average man in the street, that  government employment with all its protective and even pampering  perks, will not be able to retain or attract what Hong Kong  needs to maintain its civil service at the present par of  efficiency at least.    There is nothing worthwhile without some amount of risk.  Government service is worthwhile. Furthermore, the risk is  clearly addressed in the assurances which the Basic Law provides.</p>

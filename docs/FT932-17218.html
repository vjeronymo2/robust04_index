			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hotel sector shaken SUSPENSION of shares in Queens Moat Houses sent shock waves throughout the hotel sector and prompted speculation about the group's future. Queens Moat said it was suspending its shares 'pending clarification of the company's financial position'. After the dust had settled, speculation began over which rival companies might benefit from the situation. Bass was the immediate favourite, following its recent agreement extending the deal to convert Queens Moat hotels into Holiday Inns. While analysts ruled out a full-scale rescue by Bass, some selected purchases could be made, they thought. Queens Moat now runs 20 Holiday Inns in Europe. Other names touted included Forte, which has long coveted a major presence in Europe. Queens Moat is due to report its final results next week, although analysts were growing increasingly gloomy as the day wore on that the situation was so serious that they will have to be postponed. While the nub of the problem appeared to be a preference dividend payment of around Pounds 7m, due yesterday, analysts close to the company suggested that the problem might have occurred as a result of debt restructuring talks being held with the group's chief lenders. Queens Moat's debts are estimated at more than Pounds 1bn by leisure specialists, who say the company's gearing is around 100 per cent. Queens Moat shares were suspended at 47 1/2 p. Although some cherry-picking of the assets may benefit selected companies, the fear that a major player had run into difficulties hit sentiment in the sector. Forte tumbled 9 to 192p, Friendly Hotels 6 to 155p, Ladbroke 4 1/2 to 181p and Rank Organisation 8 to 655p. Bass shares came off 10p on news of the suspension, but later recovered with support from a programme trade to finish 3 ahead at 546p.</p>

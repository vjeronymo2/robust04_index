			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY PSYCHIATRIC TO SPIN OFF 2 OF ITS 3 DIVISIONS INTO NEW FIRM  </P> <P> The directors of Community Psychiatric Centers in Laguna Hills approved a plan  Wednesday to spin off two of the company's three divisions into a new  corporation.  </P> <P> The operator of psychiatric hospitals and other medical businesses said the  move is intended to speed growth of both the remaining company and the newly  formed business, which will be named Vivra.  </P> <P> Community Psychiatric will retain ownership of its national psychiatric  hospital chain, which accounted for 76% of the company's fiscal 1988 revenue of  $355 million. Vivra will operate a national chain of kidney dialysis centers  and a home health care services business.  </P> <P> Newly issued shares of Vivra will be distributed at no cost to holders of  Community Psychiatric stock, who will retain their ownership in the existing  company. The distribution will be based on a ratio of one Vivra share for every  five to 10 Community Psychiatric shares, with the exact number to be determined  later.  </P> <P> James W. Conti, Community Psychiatric's chief executive, said Vivra's stock  probably will be traded in the over-the-counter market.  </P> <P> Conti said the spinoff is intended to enhance the growth opportunities of the  two companies, and also to make Community Psychiatric's stock more attractive  to investors.  </P> <P> "CPC stock has been hampered in the past year because of the slower growth rate  and smaller profit margins" of the kidney dialysis and home health care units,  Conti said.  </P> <P> In Wall Street jargon, Community Psychiatric stock will become "a pure play" in  which its business is devoted virtually entirely to one line of business --  psychiatric clinics. Since many investors prefer to buy stocks of tightly  focused companies instead of more diversified firms, that could fuel more  investor interest and higher stock prices, he said.  </P> <P> Newly formed Vivra should benefit, Conti said, because it will be able to seek  acquisitions of companies in related businesses that Community Psychiatric  previously shunned as too speculative.  </P> <P> Roger L. Green, Community Psychiatric's chairman, will leave that post to serve  as chief executive of Vivra. He will continue as a consultant and director of  Community Psychiatric.  </P> <P> Conte will continue as president and chief executive of Community Psychiatric.  He also will become a director of Vivra.  </P> <P> Community Psychiatric stock closed Wednesday at a 52-week high of $29.875 per  share, up $1, in New York Stock Exchange trading.  </P> <P> The company employs about 5,000 people nationwide, about 300 of whom work in  Orange County.  </P></p>

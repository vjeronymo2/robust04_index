			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sheikh quits Circle K buy-out SHEIKH Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, who as Kuwait's finance minister strongly influenced the activities of the Kuwait Investment Office, has withdrawn from the Investcorp organisation consortium which is attempting to buy and reorganise Circle K, the bankrupt US convenience store chain. However, the Arizona-based retailer added that Investcorp  - an investment organisation with offices in Bahrain, London and New York, and a sizeable shareholder in the likes of Saks Fifth Avenue and Tiffany  - had said that it would provide the equity funding. There was no immediate response from the Circle K bondholders, who have been urging a rival reorganisation plan. The situation at Circle K has been mired in controversy for months. Investcorp, via a vehicle called CK Acquisitions, put forward a proposal to buy Circle K, which runs about 2,900 stores in the south-west, for Dollars 399.5m. This scheme was opposed by bondholders, who submitted a rival plan. Since the end of 1992, the bondholders have been arguing that the CK Acquisitions scheme was jeopardised by the involvement of Skeikh Ali Khalifa in the Investcorp-led consortium. Their lawyers filed an emergency motion with the bankruptcy court in January, urging more information about the finances of the Sheikh and those of Mr Javier de la Rosa, the Spanish financier. The bondholders seized upon a scandal surrounding investments in Spain by the KIO in the late 1980s. These were managed by Mr de la Rosa. Sheikh Ali Khalifa, although not directly involved in the KIO's Spanish investments has been indirectly criticised in Kuwait for allowing the KIO, while he was finance minister, to risk large sums of money in Spain. Sheikh Ali Khalifa and Mr de la Rosa were stockholders in CK, and were reported to be players at Grupo Torras, the lead company in the KIO's Spanish operation. The statement yesterday from Circle K gave no explanation for Sheikh Ali Khalifa's withdrawal from the CK Acquisitions consortium, but said that Investcorp 'has satisfied Circle K and the principal creditor constituencies that CK has the financing necessary for the successful completion of the purchase.' 'We look forward to confirmation hearings set for April 7 which will signal the end of Circle K's bankruptcy,' it said.</p>

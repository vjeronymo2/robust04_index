			<p>Language: <F P=105> Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Armenian Government in Yerevan on 8 </F> January]    [Text] Having once again rejected the CSCE and the Russian  Federation plan for the peaceful resolution of the Karabakh  conflict, Azerbaijan unilaterally renounced the cease-fire and  launched new military operations, not only against  Nagorno-Karbakh but also all along the Armenian-Azerbaijani  border. This time an intensified economic blockade, now being  implemented even on the territory of a neutral country, is  accompanying the military operations. The gas pipeline entering  Armenia was again blown up on Georgian territory. It has not  yet been repaired.    All this proves that Azerbaijan, having chosen the use of  force as the only way to solve the problem, is trying at all  costs to drag Armenia into the conflict. Azerbaijan is  attempting to internationalize the conflict by using armed men  from other countries in its combat operations. It obstinately  tries to implement a visionless plan: Every time its aggressive  operations fail, it resorts to every propaganda gimmick to  present itself to the international community and various  international forums as the victim of Armenian aggression. All  such statements are then followed by massive new offensives.    The Armenian Government resolutely condemns Azerbaijan's  policy of solving the problem by the use of force, a policy that  is fraught with the danger of the eventual deepening of the  conflict between the two peoples and will in the end lead to  further human loss on the Azerbaijani side and diminish the  possibility of a peaceful resolution of the Karabakh-Azerbaijani  conflict.    Armenia has always favored a peaceful solution to the  problem  and is ready to continue its efforts in this direction.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Kerry raises Dollars 155m to cut US debt KERRY GROUP, the international dairy products and foods company based in Ireland, has raised Dollars 155m (Pounds 101m) in its first private placing of senior loan notes with US investors, with a view to reducing debt charges in its US operations. The placement is split into two nearly equal tranches with maturities of seven and 10 years, and carries a fixed, but undisclosed, interest rate. The company's approach to US capital markets aimed to take advantage of both attractive rates and what it described as keen investor appetites for investment-grade corporate issues. The funds will facilitate a total restructuring of Kerry's current indebtedness in the US. A small portion will remain to finance further acquisitions, but total group debt at the year-end will not be significantly greater than the IPounds 109m (Pounds 104m) at the end of 1992. The company has also acquired Research Foods, a subsidiary of F&amp;C International of the US, for CDollars 10m (Pounds 5m). This is the second acquisition of a food ingredients company in Canada by Kerry this year, the first being Malcolm Foods last March. The combined turnover of the two subsidiaries will be approximately CDollars 30m, and will give Kerry a 50 per cent share of the specialist snack food ingredients business in Canada. The company is also looking at several acquisition options in Mexico as the development of the Nafta agreement gives opportunities for expansion in both Mexico and South America.</p>

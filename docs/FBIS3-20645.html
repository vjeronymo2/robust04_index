			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] About one-fourth of the construction on China's  largest offshore drilling field is now complete, and engineers  say the project is on schedule for opening January 1, 1996.    The YA 13-1 Gas Field in the South China Sea will supply  Hong  Kong and Hainan Province with natural gas. Estimates put the  field's reserve capacity at 100 billion cubic metres.    By January 30, more than 240 kilometres of underwater  pipelines were laid, about one-fourth of the total, according  [to] yesterday's overseas edition of PEOPLE'S DAILY.    Eventually two underwater pipelines will be constructed:  one,  91 kilometres, will connect the field with Hainan; the other,  778 kilometres, will connect it with Hong Kong.    As a joint venture, more than 300 Chinese and foreign  engineers and technicians work on the field. The foreigners come  from 14 countries, including Italy, Britain, the Netherlands,  and Norway.

In its election statement, the  Bloc of Patriotic Forces heavily criticized the U.S. and  Ukrainian presidents for "plotting to continue Ukraine's  Nazi-style occupation of the Russian peninsula of Crimea." The  participants in the rally voiced their unanimous contempt for  Clinton and Kravchuk, saying they are doomed to "the pitiful  fate of all invaders of Russian territories."    The rally approved an appeal to Yevhen Saburov, the future  prime minister of Crimea, demanding "an end to all talk of  Crimea being a part of Ukraine." The rally urged "all patriots  of Russia" to boycott the election to the Supreme Council of  Ukraine and the election to the Supreme Council of Crimea  according to party lists. The "patriots of Russia" proposed  voting for their own candidates to the Supreme Council of  Crimea, whose list was announced at the end of the rally.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Polemics Among PPI Members Over </F> Floor Leaders"]    [Text] Rome -- A controversy is raging within the PPI  [Italian Popular Party] over the appointment of [Interior  Minister] Nicola Mancino and [Foreign Minister] Beniamino  Andreatta as the floor leaders in the lower and upper houses  respectively. Replying to [Pact for Italy member] Rocco  Buttiglione, who criticized the appointment by referring to an  "old faction-based logic," [Institutional Reform Minister]  Leopoldo Elia said curtly: "Nobody is trying to exclude anybody  else through the choices made." [PPI member] Roberto Formigoni,  on the other hand, interpreted Mancino and Andreatta's election  as "a very serious political signal," because "the choice fell  on two members of the old DC [Christian Democratic Party] Left."    On the other hand, the CCD [Christian Democratic Center]  deputies' assembly took place without any apparent tensions,  with Clemente Mastella being elected as the CCD's floor leader.  Furthermore, the CCD decided to form an autonomous group, which  will, however, join forces with Forza Italia.    National Alliance [AN] also elected its floor leaders.  Giuseppe Tatarella was elected to Montecitorio [Chamber of  Deputies], and Giulio Maceratini to Palazzo Madama [Senate],  both of them unanimously.    These first appointments were criticized by [Pannella List]  Reformers Deputy Elio Vito, in whose view the parties that have  already proceeded to elect their floor leaders have committed "a  serious political and institutional blunder. In the lower  house," Vito recalled, "deputies must indicate the group they  belong to within two days after the first sitting; in the upper  house, the same statement must be made within four days after  the first sitting." Only then, the deputy asserted, should the  parliamentary groups make any appointments.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / International Company News: Uni to retain stake in Skandia UNI STOREBRAND, Norway's biggest insurance group, has been allowed to retain its 28 per cent stake in Skandia, Sweden's biggest insurer, for a further year. Uni, which recently acquired its NKr4bn (Dollars 673m) Skandia shareholding, was granted the concession by the Finance Ministry so long as Skandia disposed of Vesta, its Norwegian subsidiary. Skandia has previously refused to sell Vesta. Under the terms of the concession, Uni will be forced to reduce the 28 per cent shareholding to below 10 per cent by the beginning of next July unless Skandia sells Vesta. On Tuesday, Uni suffered a blow when its share price fell 15 per cent on the Oslo bourse following a domestic media report alleging the company was technically bankrupt. Uni was forced to issue a clarification of its financial position and denied the report. Yesterday, Uni's A-shares shed another NKr1 to end at NKr30 and Free shares fell NKr1.50 to NKr32.50. Gjensidige Skadeforsikring, one of Norway's biggest insurers, has paid NKr365m for a 63.39 per cent stake in the Forenede group, in a preparatory move to a full takeover by next August. Approval for the deal by the Finance Ministry cleared the way after a long battle with Codan, the Danish subsidiary of Britain's Sun Alliance group, which had also pursued Forenede. Forenede holds 10 per cent of the domestic insurance market. The ministry favoured Gjensidige because the company plans to maintain its operations in Trondheim.</p>

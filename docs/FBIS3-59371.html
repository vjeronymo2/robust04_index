Implementation of Agricultural Preferential Policies Is  Not Very Ideal    To protect the interests of farmers and arouse their  enthusiasm for production, the state has decided to improve  management of agricultural material prices and set maximum  prices for major products. But in several localities operations  greatly exceeding authority and unauthorized operations have  occurred. According to data supplied by the Hubei provincial  supply and marketing association, in that province's Tianmen  City there are 1,469 primary business units that are engaged in  agricultural material business in violation of state  regulations. Of those 1,043 are individuals and other fixed  primary business units exceeding their operating authority reach  42. The Ezhou City Huarong District Putuan Credit Union replaced  loans with fertilizer for all of the entire township's 600,000  yuan in loans this year. All of the farmers who wanted loans,  whether to buy farm cattle or to buy farm implements, were given  fertilizer in place of loans. The farmers poured out endless  grievances. To support agricultural production and solve the  farmers' shortage of funds, the state decided at the beginning  of the year to provide advance purchase earnest money. But  according to a Hunan provincial survey, most of the rural  households did not receive the advance purchase earnest money at  the beginning of the year. Of the 80 Linli County rural  households that responded to the survey, approximately 60  percent had not received the advance purchase earnest money, and  the minority of the rural households that did get the earnest  money did not get the full amount. After the March issuance of  the urgent "Two Managements" notice regarding lightening  farmers' burdens, governments and departments concerned at every  level adopted a series of positive measures and in the first  half of the year farmers' burdens were lightened somewhat. But  some regions continued to increase them. For example, the per  capita increase in Nei Mongol was 5.57 yuan, in Liaoning it was  3.57 yuan, and in Fujian it was 2.68 yuan.    The Contradiction of Tight Funds Is Still  Pronounced    Despite the fact that the central government has expended a  great deal of effort to resolve the fund problem, this year  agricultural product procurement funds still are tight. The  third and fourth quarters are peak periods for purchase of  agricultural products and the contradiction of tight purchasing  funds is pronounced. For example, 1.33 billion yuan is required  to purchase Jiangxi cotton and the deficiency reaches 910  million yuan. Gansu's cotton purchasing fund deficiency reaches  45 percent. Henan Province has indicated that since the  beginning of August it has had extreme difficulty raising grain  and oil purchasing funds. In seventeen localities and cities  throughout the province, as of 20 September, the grain system  had only completed 5.4 percent of its fund raising task and of  the 2.4 billion kilogram wheat negotiated purchase task, only  1.1 billion kilograms had been completed. This fall the  province's planned purchase of grain, oil-bearing crops, cotton,  hemp, and tobacco leaves requires 9.706 billion yuan. As of 20  September, they had only raised 3.218 billion yuan.    Prices of Agricultural Means of Production Have Risen  Abruptly, the Scissors of Industrial and Agricultural Product  Prices Continues To Expand    Beginning this year, despite the fact that the state  formulated a policy to limit agricultural material prices, in  the first half of the year, they still increased by 12 percent  over the same period last year, but in the same period,  agricultural product purchasing prices rose 8.1 percent.  Abruptly rising agricultural material prices on the one hand  restrain farmers' investment in agricultural production, and on  the other hand, they erode farmers' earnings, and farmers are  caught in a vicious circle of "small income--small investment."    Grain Purchases Decrease, State Ability To Exert  Macroeconomic Control on the Market Is Weakened    This year because purchasing funds were inadequate, after  grain prices were freed up, with multichannel business  competition, after the grain department had essentially  completed its quota purchases, negotiated purchase progress was  slow. As of the end of September, only 66 percent of the planned  summer grain negotiated purchases had been completed. In  previous years by the end of September, early rice purchases  were completed. This year by 20 September, about 50 percent of  the planned purchases were completed.    So, we must now further implement the central government's  preferential policies regarding agriculture, realistically  reduce farmers' burdens, guarantee funds for agricultural  product purchases by every possible means, and adopt measures to  improve management of rural market prices to safeguard the  enthusiasm of farmers for production and ensure stable growth of  agriculture.</p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: HELLFIRE, THE SEQUEL  </P> <P> Those protests over "The Last Temptation of Christ" aren't finished yet -- not  with Martin Scorsese among those nominated for the Best Director Oscar.  Although conservative Christian leader Donald E. Wildmon won't be demonstrating  Oscar night, Dr. R. L. Hymers Jr. -- pastor of the Fundamentalist Baptist  Tabernacle of L.A. -- will.  </P> <P> Hymers told us he plans to lead an anti-Scorsese protest outside the Shrine  Auditorium on March 29. "If he wins, that would seem to put the seal of  approval on attacks against Christianity," Hymers said.  </P> <P> Hymers added that he'll be accompanied by members of his congregation, and  "probably, the man with the cross," referring to the anonymous protester who  wears Jesus-like garb and drags a massive cross.  </P> <P> Hymers said he'll be "a bit more strident" -- than in previous protests -- for  his Oscar appearance. "I'll be very careful of what I say. I don't want  anything misconstrued." (He was accused of making anti-Semitic comments during  earlier protests, and later apologized.)  </P> <P> Wildmon, exec director of the Tupelo, Miss.-based American Family Assn., told  us an Oscar protest "would be money unwisely spent" in his view, and considers  the fundamentalist boycott of "Temptation" already "a huge success."  </P> <P> Scorsese, figured Wildmon, has a fair chance of winning the Oscar: "It would be  Hollywood's way of getting back at us."

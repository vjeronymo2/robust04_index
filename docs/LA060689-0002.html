			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Israel's six-member diplomatic delegation moved into its old embassy in Moscow  in another tiny step toward normalized relations with the Soviet Union. The  building is still officially under the control of the Netherlands, which has  looked after Israel's interests since the Kremlin broke relations with the  Jewish state in 1967, and the refurnished Israeli Embassy cannot fly the  blue-and-white Israeli flag or display any emblem. President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev has been re-establishing contacts with the Jewish state, leading to a  Soviet consular group going to Tel Aviv and the Israeli delegation to Moscow.  </P></p>

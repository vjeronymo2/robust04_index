			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Observer: Family feuds The Volvo-Procordia battle in Sweden has opened up old wounds. It is not just the Swedish state, as Procordia's second largest shareholder, that is upset by Pehr Gyllenhammar's bold move, but also the corporate establishment led by the Wallenberg dynasty. One man, in particular, 70-year-old Curt Nicolin, will play a pivotal role in the outcome. As chairman of the nine strong privatisation commission, Nicolin has spent most of his life working for the Asea engineering group, one of the crown jewels of the Wallenberg empire, and remains one of the family's most trusted advisers. Nicolin has sound business reasons for giving the thumbs down to Gyllenhammar's latest power play with Procordia and it would be wrong to suggest this represents the revenge of the Wallenbergs on Gyllenhammar for past slights. Nevertheless, the Wallenbergs must be forgiven for more than a half smile at the predicament of Volvo's charismatic chairman after Nicolin has rejected his offer.</p>

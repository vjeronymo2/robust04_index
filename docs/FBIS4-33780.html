			<p>BFN     [Text] Belem, 10 Jun (AE) -- The 24th OAS General Assembly  has concluded with the approval of the Declaration of Belem do  Para. The OAS has now turned its attention to the Summit of the  Americas, organized by U.S. President Bill Clinton for December  in Washington [as received] with the participation of all the  chiefs of state and government of the hemisphere. The main  subject of the summit has yet to be announced. Brazilian  Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said today he expects the summit  will produce concrete measures to strengthen Inter-American  cooperation and to enhance social development.    In his closing speech to the 24th OAS general assembly,  Amorim described the results of the deliberations in Belem as  "extremely encouraging," especially in the field of human  rights. He called the attention of the plenary to the "deep  social difficulties that affect broad sectors" of the Latin  American community and to the "serious economic problems" that  challenge their governments. After admitting that there are no  easy answers to such problems, he spoke of the need "for a real  partnership for development that includes free trade, increased  financial inflow, and total access to state-of-the-art  technologies."    The OAS secretary general made a resume of the results of  the  assembly, recalling one of the most important points of the  final declaration: The document begins by stating the firm  commitment of the OAS to become the main hemispheric forum of  political understanding, and thus "promote and consolidate  peace, democracy, social justice, and development" in the  Americas.    The Declaration of Belem reasserts the OAS commitment to  contribute to the prompt and total implementation of the  decisions agreed during the Uruguay Round of the GATT so as to  reestablish a non-discriminatory, fair, and multilateral open  trade system to effectively support efforts toward the total  development of the countries of the continent. He reasserted  the commitment of the OAS to intensify cooperation in the  economic, social, educational, cultural, technological, and  political fields; to study measures, within the juridical  framework of each country, seeking to combat corruption and  improve the efficiency of public administration; to continue to  promote the Common Market of Knowledge [Mercado Comun do  Conhecimento] (Mercocyt) as an instrument to share experiences  and progress among OAS member countries; to strengthen  cooperation and thus make drug enforcement efforts more  efficient; and to contribute as much as possible toward the  success of the Summit of the Americas organized by the U.S.  President.    Celso Amorim took the opportunity to encourage those member  countries that have yet to sign the Tlatelolco Treaty -- to  denuclearize Latin America -- to do so as soon as possible to  thus inspire other regions of the world to support the idea of  global disarmament. Finally, after briefly referring to the  efforts to restore democracy in Haiti where the OAS expects to  carry out its 25th General Assembly, the Brazilian foreign  minister highlighted the importance of the friendly atmosphere  created by the foreign ministers and chiefs of delegations in  Belem. Amorim's final words were: "We have achieved challenging  works and obtained a positive balance. I think everyone has the  feeling of having fulfilled his duty."</p>

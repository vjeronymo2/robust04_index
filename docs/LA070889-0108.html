			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE THEATER FUND-RAISER THAT DISAPPEARED  </P> <P> Regarding Mark Pinsky's article "O.C. 'Sorcery' Fund-Raiser Goes Poof"  (Calendar, June 15):  </P> <P> I read this article with great interest, as I was one of the many psychics  invited to volunteer my time to provide entertainment at this fund-raiser for  the Laguna Playhouse. It was very unfortunate that the fund-raiser was canceled  as a result of the Rev. Jerry Tankersley's letter to his congregation at the  Laguna Presbyterian Church. It is difficult to imagine that anyone living in  the 20th Century would refer to contemporary psychics as "those who are  representatives and voices of spiritual powers that at times have proven to be  destructive of human life." Tankersley and his supporters obviously have no  idea regarding what type of services professional psychics actually provide.  </P> <P> The psychic work I engage in has nothing whatsoever to do with activities  "destructive to human life." It involves providing consulting services to the  public in a positive and constructive manner. I frequently volunteer my  services to organizations such as the Laguna playhouse that are engaged in fund  raising. I know this to be true of many psychics.  </P> <P> Although it would have been only beneficial for psychics to provide their  services for the Laguna Playhouse fund-raiser, I can assure you that we do and  will have plenty of other platform opportunities in Orange County and  elsewhere. Tankersley and his supporters may have succeeded in canceling the  Laguna Playhouse fund-raiser, but they won't stop professional psychics from  providing their services to members of the public who request them.  </P> <P> Tankersley and his supporters might be surprised to know that I, a practicing  psychic, also believe in God, and I am not familiar with any psychic who does  not. I would invite Tankersley and his supporters to read First Corinthians,  12:4-6: "There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are  different kinds of service, but the same Lord. There are different kinds of  working, but the same God works all of them in all men."  </P> <P> In closing, I can't help but think of one of my favorite passages from the  Bible: "Judge not, that you be not judged. For with what judgment you judge,  you will be judged; and with the same measure you use, it will be measured back  to you."  </P> <P> JO MARIE LISA  </P> <P> Placentia  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SIGNS COME DOWN  </P> <P> Residents of Santa Ana and other users of Santa Ana streets: Have you noticed  how "clean" our city is? The day after the April 4 election, the majority of  campaign signs began coming down.  </P> <P> I think it is just great and a sincere "Thank you" is due to those responsible  for removing these eyesores. Hopefully all future candidates will take note and  remove their campaign signs immediately after Election Day.  </P> <P> LUELLA TUCKER  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Republic of Turkey is the first country to open  an embassy in the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina. At today's  modest ceremony, Sukru Tufan, Turkish ambassador to  Bosnia-Herzegovina, unveiled the sign on the embassy building,  thus officially opening the embassy and marking the beginning of  its work.    Ambassador Tufan spoke about the friendly attitude of his  country toward Bosnia-Herzegovina and the insistence of Ankara  on the implementation of all the UN Security Council resolutions  concerning Bosnia-Herzegovina. By sending in its armed forces,  Turkey will be directly participating in the establishment of  peace in our country. It is obliged to do so by both the deep  roots and the links between our cultures and traditions. Thus  the link between these two friendly and close countries is  natural.    Turkey will continue to (rally) all the international forces  in order to reach a just settlement to the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible, Ambassador Tufan said.    Another ceremony will be held this afternoon to mark the  opening of the Turkish embassy in Sarajevo.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- The Korean  Religionists Association (KRA) held an enlarged meeting here  today calling on the South Korean religious organizations,  clergymen and believers to take a resolute action for  overthrowing the Kim Yong-sam regime of flunkeyist traitors for  the reunification of the country in the 90s.    The meeting discussed measures concerning the refusal of the  Kim Yong-sam puppet clique to allow the joint celebration of the  centenary of the Kabo (1894) Peasants War by Chondoists in the  North and the South. It was attended by members of the KRA and  officials of the Central Guidance Committee of the Korean  Chondoists Association, the Central Committee of the Korean  Buddhists Federation, the Central Committee of the Korean  Christians Federation and the Central Committee of the Korean  Roman Catholics Association.    A relevant resolution and a letter to the South Korean  religious organizations, clergymen and believers were adopted at  the meeting.    The letter said the Kim Yong-sam regime's anti-national acts  in blocking all the contacts and travel between the North and  the South and the joint commemoration by the North and the South  of the centenary of the peasants war, an anti-feudal,  anti-aggression mass struggle of the nation, could never be  justified and tolerated.    It noted that if such an anti-national group as the Kim  Yong-sam clique, which takes no account of the nation and  ancestors, were left in the country, neither the peace of the  Korean peninsula nor the independent and peaceful reunification  of the country could be expected and there would be only a  nuclear holocaust.    It called on the South Korean religious organizations,  clergymen and believers who love the country and the nation and  hope for national reunification to decisively break with the Kim  Yong-sam regime and join in the struggle for the establishment  of a genuine independent, democratic government.</p>

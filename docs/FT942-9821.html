			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Regal Hotel plans four more purchases Regal Hotel Group, the USM-traded provincial hotel operator, is set to almost double in size via the planned purchase of four more hotels for Pounds 9.5m. To partly fund the acquisitions, Regal is proposing to raise about Pounds 11m by way of a placing and open offer of 628.57m new ordinary shares, 47.4 per cent of the enlarged capital, at 1 3/4 p. Some Pounds 6.4m of the proceeds will be used to satisfy part of the purchase consideration with the balance being satisfied by bank debt of Pounds 3m and the issue of 5.71m new shares. The remaining proceeds will be set aside to fund the acquisition of a further hotel and to provide additional working capital. Of the placing and open offer shares 312.5m have been placed firm by Guinness Mahon with institutions and other investors, while 316.07m have been placed subject to a clawback by ordinary shareholders on a 7-for-15 basis. Mr Keith Goldie-Morrison, chairman, said the acquisitions represent further progress in Regal's strategy of assembling a chain of 3 star provincial hotels in commercial locations. Regal is paying Pounds 1.65m for the Time Out Hotel at Blaby, near Leicester, Pounds 3.5m for the Hillcrest Hotel, Widnes, Pounds 3m for the Hall Garth Hotel, near Darlington, and Pounds 1.35m for the Cumbrian Hotel, Carlisle. The acquisitions increase the total number of hotels owned by Regal to nine. A further two are operated under management contract. Dealings in Regal's shares were suspended at 2p yesterday. They are expected to resume on June 10, following completion of the placing and open offer and shareholders approval of the purchase.</p>

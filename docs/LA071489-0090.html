			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROBBINS, RAMS' ROOKIE TACKLE, JUST A SHADOW OF MANDARICH  </P> <P> Can you image anything more unnerving than playing opposite tackle to Tony  Mandarich in college? Asking Zsa Zsa Gabor to step out of the car, maybe?  </P> <P> It's difficult to gather newspaper headlines when your former tackle partner at  Michigan State on any given day is (a) ravaging through supermarket aisles with  his now-famous Neanderthal-man hunger and shopping list, (b) challenging the  heavyweight champion of the world to a fist fight or (c) holding the Green Bay  Packers financial hostage.  </P> <P> Mandarich makes sure everyone knows what Tony Mandarich is all about,  especially when it's all about money. But the Michigan State All-American and  first-round pick of the Packers is touted as the most menacing lineman to  emerge since Anthony Munoz.  </P> <P> Kevin Robbins is not. Robbins is but a third-round draft pick of the Rams, one  who will be fighting for the team's eighth offensive lineman position. But  Robbins does share a bond with Mandarich, having played right tackle at  Michigan State last season. Robbins even made honorable-mention All-American,  though hardly anyone mentions it.  </P> <P> He will forever be cast in the long shadow of Mandarich. And get this: it  doesn't bother Robbins. He's not jealous. In fact, he says you can't buy the  kind of publicity Mandarich brought to others at Michigan State.  </P> <P> "I encouraged him," Robbins said of Mandarich after his first morning workout  with the Rams. "He helped me get where I'm at because of all the publicity. He  brought a lot of publicity to the whole line."  </P> <P> Robbins didn't mind being leftovers to the hundred or so scouts who paraded  through Lansing last season to catch a load of Mandarich. Seems a few caught a  glimpse of Robbins, too.  </P> <P> "I just have to give it my all, and everything will fall into place, " Robbins  said, "just like in college."  </P> <P> Robbins, who at 286 pounds is a good 30 pounds lighter than Mandarich, says  it's hard not to admire the All-American, despite his antics.  </P> <P> "Even at Michigan State, he was the one," Robbins said. "When he had his mind  set on something he did it."  </P> <P> And what of this proposed fight with Mike Tyson? Robbins actually thinks  Mandarich could go the distance.  </P> <P> "I think he could step in the ring and collect afterwards," he said.  </P> <P> Enough talk of Mandarich. It's time for Robbins to get to work.  </P> <P> "I was pretty much ready to get out of Lansing," he said. "It was hot, humid  and boring."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> The team signed seventh-round pick George Bethune, a linebacker from Alabama,  bringing to five the number of draft choices in camp. Ram coaches expected  fifth-round cornerback Alfred Jackson for Thursday's afternoon practice, but  his signing was held up. . . . Camp expands beyond rookies today as selected  young veterans report, including tailback Gaston Green and receiver Aaron Cox.  </P></p>

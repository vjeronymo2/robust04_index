			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CUSTOMS STRIKES GOLD (AND CASH) SMUGGLED ON JET;  </P> <P> REFUGEES: AGENTS BOARD 'HIGH-RISK FLIGHT' TO CITE 28 VIETNAMESE-AMERICANS,  SEVEN FROM ORANGE COUNTY. MORE THAN $225,000 BELIEVED BOUND FOR RELATIVES IN  VIETNAM IS SEIZED.  </P> <P> More than two dozen Vietnamese-Americans, including seven from Orange County,  who allegedly attempted to smuggle more than $250,000 in cash and gold out of  the United States face stiff fines for violating Customs regulations, officials  said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Customs agents seized the gold and cash Sunday at Los Angeles International  Airport as 28 Vietnamese-Americans were about to board a Philippine Airlines  jet bound for Manila. Investigators believe they were scheduled to take a  connecting flight to Vietnam, said John Miller, public information officer for  the Customs Service in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Customs officials said the number of seizures of Vietnam-bound gold and cash  has risen sharply in recent months and that Sunday's operation was part of the  agency's policy of investigating "high-risk flights" in which large numbers of  Vietnamese-Americans are booked on flights to Asia.  </P> <P> Officials estimate that at least $90 million in cash, gold and property is  shipped to Vietnam annually -- much of it in violation of strict federal laws  that severely limit the amount of cash and goods that can be exported to the  country.  </P> <P> In the last year, customs officials report, more than $600,000 in cash and gold  has been seized on the West Coast alone. Much of the money was being shipped by  refugees to their families in Vietnam, although there is a debate now raging in  the Orange County Vietnamese community over how beneficial such aid is.  </P> <P> On Sunday, authorities discovered $220,000 in cash, $3,240 in gold coins and  $2,280 in gold bars in the suitcases and bags of the 28 people.  </P> <P> Xuan Thi Nguyen, 34, of San Diego, was arrested at the airport and charged with  making false statements to Customs officers and failure to report exported  currency.  </P> <P> Nguyen was carrying $52,430 and $1,600 in gold bars, Miller said.  </P> <P> A breakdown of how much cash and gold the seven Orange County residents are  accused of trying to smuggle was not available.  </P> <P> The other 27 suspects, who were not identified, were cited for various  violations of Customs regulations and released. The seven from Orange County  were each cited for exceeding the $100-per-family monthly limit Customs  regulations placed on exporting cash to Vietnam.  </P> <P> A Customs fines officer will determine what punishment the accused violators  receive, Miller said. Often, the officer orders that Customs keep the money and  property seized, he said.  </P> <P> Customs officials are continuing to investigate whether the 28 people were  working as a group and whether any of them is a professional money runner hired  to make the trip to Vietnam.  </P> <P> Sunday's Customs operation was one of a growing number of "periodic checks" the  Customs Service makes on passengers it believes are headed to Vietnam,  officials said.  </P> <P> "The Customs Service does investigate high-risk flights," Miller said.  "Usually, this is for drug money, but we also do it for export control . . . as  in this case."  </P> <P> Sending money to family member in Vietnam has been a common practice since the  fall of Saigon in 1975. Last fall, the Customs Service held a town hall meeting  in Orange County designed to explain Customs laws and regulations to the  Vietnamese community, Miller said.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, for reasons Customs officials cannot explain, the number of  seizures of Vietnam-bound cash has increased over the last four months -- not  just in Southern California but in San Francisco and San Jose as well.  </P> <P> "Everyone out here is trying to help family that's still over there," said  Marcus Frank, a Westminster police detective who specializes in Vietnamese  affairs. "This is a widespread practice."  </P> <P> Many Vietnamese-Americans who cannot make the trip themselves rely on  professional money runners to get cash and gold to family members, Frank said.  </P> <P> However, there is a growing controversy within the Vietnamese community over  whether the aid is only serving to prop up the Communist regime in Vietnam.  </P> <P> Frank estimated that the Vietnamese government takes up to a 30% cut in cash  that enters the country.  </P> <P> Gold is also a popular item for export to Vietnam because it receives a high  price on the black market, he said.  </P> <P> "The amount of money (being sent to Vietnam) is way in excess of what a family  needs to get by," Frank said. "Many people see the money as continuing to  prolong the Communist government."  </P></p>

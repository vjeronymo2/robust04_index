			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Manit Siwayasirot] </F>   [Text] A fifty-man police task force is being joined by  Malaysian special branch police in the border hunt for six men  believed responsible for two recent bomb attacks in Songkhla,  the southern provincial police chief said yesterday.    Pol Maj Gen [Police Major General] Pricha Saengwan said the  Malaysian police had pledged cooperation in the search for the  suspects, who may have already sneaked into Kelantan state.    "We have deployed about 50 officers for the operation," said  Pricha. "They will coordinate with our own special branch  police and Malaysia's special branch, which operates in  Kelantan."    The Songkhla governor had endorsed police warrants for the  arrest of the six suspects, whom Pricha said have connections  with southern Muslim separatist guerrillas.    "They have links with Pulo (the Pattani United Liberation  Organization). That's all I can say, otherwise the information  may affect the police hunt for suspects," Pricha said.    The suspects were believed to be responsible for a bomb  explosion in Hat Yai's main shopping area early last month that  injured three Thais and four foreign tourists, and a later blast  that derailed a southern passenger train in Songkhla's Na Mom  subdistrict. No serious injuries were reported in the  derailment, but the sabotage triggered protests by railways  workers and resulted in stepped-up security on the southern  railroad.    Police will begin regular helicopter patrols of southern  rail  routes in a few days, Pricha said.    Pricha said it would take at least two more weeks before he  will be able to report the progress of the joint Thai-Malaysian  dragnet.    Pol Lt Gen [Police Lieutenant General] Michai Nukunkit,  assistant police director general responsible for the South,  confirmed that Malaysia's special branch chief had promised to  help hunting down the six suspects.</p>

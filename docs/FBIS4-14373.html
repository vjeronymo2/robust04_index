			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], president of the  state of Palestine and chairman of the PLO Executive Committee,  has asked Palestinian negotiators to open the file of the  Palestinian martyrs who fell during confrontations with the  Israeli occupation troops during the period of armed fedayeen  action that was launched from Jordanian, Syrian, and Lebanese  territories, in addition to the occupied territories.    Palestinian sources said that the Israeli authorities have  been holding the bodies of more than 100 martyrs in morgues for  over two decades, and that they refuse to hand them to their  families. The sources explained that this request was passed on  during the meetings that were held in Tunis over the past two  days.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Unipolar Economics"] </F>   [Text] With the resurrection of US law Super 301 last week,  President Bi11 Clinton has earned the distinction of being the  most "garrulous salesman" of American auto parts, life  insurance, and telecommunications. The Democratic President has  decided to woo big business away from the traditional Republican  camp by acquiring the legal power to wage trade retaliation on  its behalf. The immediate objective is to bring Japan to heel.  But judging by the clarification issued by the administration  that the intention is to issue a "symbolic rather than a real  threat", Washington is in no hurry to risk a trade war with a  nation that can say no. It is clear that given the prevailing  mood in Japan, where the Morihiro Hosokawa Government is under  severe political pressure to stand its ground, the outrageous  American demand for handing over a predetermined share of the  domestic market, will have to be toned down. Even so, the  "symbolic threat" is significant. It seeks to pin down Japan to  bilateral trade negotiations, and abjure redressal from the  multilateral GATT dispute settlement mechanism. In a unipolar  world, not just Japan, no nation dare demur: Washington has  clarified that Super 30l has not been revived for trade  retaliation against any one country which means it can be  directed against any country the US chooses to.    The lone voice of protest against Clinton's megalomania has  come from Peter Sutherland, the director-general of GATT. But he  has phlegmatically pointed merely to the "risk" to  multilateralism when actually it is being aborted. True, the  powerful European Commission is opposed to bilateralism. But  Brussels wants trilateralism. This means carving the Japanese  market between Europe and the US. Why, for instance, should  Motorola Inc. of US alone get the whole of the foreign share of  the telecommunications market of Japan? What about Ericsson of  Sweden? Europe is riding piggyback on the US. Japan is asked to  make its telecommunications technology compatible with those the  US and European companies have developed, including some nearing  obsolescence. But no one talks of America and Europe making  their technologies compatible with Japanese ones. Compatibility  has a cost: who should bear it, the exporter, wanting a market,  or the importer? The American-European gang-up is ominous for  countries like India.    In December last year, the developing countries fell in line  with the iniquitous Dunkel draft in order to ensure  multilateralism and free trade. In less than three months, the  rich countries are racing to carve up the world in a manner  reminiscent of the colonial powers of the 19th century. What is  on is not merely a war among the giants. The US is having second  thoughts on the 10-year MFA [multi-fiber agreement] agreement on  textiles. It proposes to auction import quotas for textiles  (from India and others) to American firms. This is nothing short  of an import duty on textiles. With GATT in hibernation, bully  Clinton is unstoppable.</p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LITTLE LEAGUER KNIFED BY GANG MEMBERS;  </P> <P> LAWNDALE CALLS FOR MORE DEPUTIES  </P> <P> In response to a marked increase in graffiti and gang activity in Lawndale, the  City Council has voted to ask the Sheriff's Department to consider diverting  some deputies from traffic enforcement to crime control duties.  </P> <P> Citing the knifing of a 13-year-old boy who was jumped by gang members on his  way to Little League practice last week, Councilman Larry Rudolph called for  immediate council action Monday night, placing his sheriff's staffing plan on  the agenda as an urgency item.  </P> <P> The boy is recovering from his injuries, but public concern about gangs is  running high in Lawndale, with four meetings in the past week focusing on the  problem.  </P> <P> Rudolph suggested that to combat gangs, two traffic enforcement teams be  reassigned to crime patrol in local parks and residential neighborhoods. He  also proposed designating a third team as an anti-gang unit. These changes  could be made with minimal costs, he said.  </P> <P> The council voted unanimously to seek a Sheriff's Department analysis of the  plan, which also calls for non-uniformed city or county personnel to take  accident reports to free officers to handle crimes.  </P> <P> In casting her vote, Mayor Sarann Kruse said the council should move quickly to  keep gangs out of Lawndale.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Capt. Walt Lanier agrees. "Without question, gang activity has  increased (in Lawndale)," Lanier said Tuesday in an interview. "This is not  like the hard-core gang activity going on in the northern (Lennox) part of the  district, but nevertheless they are using the same names and trappings."  </P> <P> Incidents of graffiti nearly doubled in March over February, according to  records, and Lanier said such public wall writings are "a telltale sign" of  increased activity.  </P> <P> He applauded this week's anti-gang events including a "Say No to Gangs" march  Saturday, City Council discussions Monday and today and a Neighborhood Watch  meeting Tuesday. Without swift intervention, he said, gangs can become a deadly  cancer that cannot be eradicated.  </P> <P> On Saturday, about 125 residents marched a mile through Lawndale to demonstrate  community determination to keep rival gangs from making a battleground out of  Lawndale. Neighborhood Watch coordinator Nancy McKee said that in staging the  march, residents "are saying they don't want that kind of element in our city."  </P> <P> At Monday's council meeting, Planning Commissioner Pam Sturgeon said the recent  attack on the Little League player has made parents fearful for their  children's safety. "Why should we have to lock our children up in our homes to  keep them safe?" she asked.  </P> <P> And on Tuesday night, about 60 Neighborhood Watch coordinators and residents,  many of them elderly, gathered at City Hall for a program on gangs. At the  meeting, Sheriff's Deputy Warren Asmus described gang members as "our own local  terrorists."  </P> <P> Asmus, a member of the Sheriff's Department team that presents anti-drug and  gang-resistance programs in schools, said that while gang activity in Lawndale  may not be as intense as in Lennox or South-Central Los Angeles, the community  should band together now to keep it from becoming entrenched.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Place Immune  </P> <P> In answer to worried queries about where gang activity is worst, Asmus said no  neighborhood is immune from gangs. Drug profits have enabled gang members to  buy cars and range widely throughout Southern California and beyond, he said.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department has received numerous requests from law enforcement  agencies nationwide because local gangs have exported their drug activities to  new territories, he said.  </P> <P> Residents watched intently as Asmus showed slides and interpreted the meanings  of graffiti showing the presence of rival Crips and Bloods. Among the most  active in Lawndale is the Hawthorne Piru Gangsters, whose members wear red to  show their affiliation with the Bloods, Asmus said.  </P> <P> He urged residents to join together to form a neighborhood presence to detect  and report gang activity. A key problem for law enforcement is that people are  reluctant to report crimes by gangs for fear of retaliation, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Retaliations Rate  </P> <P> Asmus said gang members retaliated against witnesses in only about 1% of the  cases he has handled.  </P> <P> At tonight's City Council meeting, Gary McDonald, chairman of the Lawndale  Planning Commission, plans to propose that the city seek damages from the  parents of those who write graffiti on walls.  </P> <P> The council on Monday took some immediate steps to deal with the dramatic  increase in graffiti noted in recent months.  </P> <P> Calls for the city's graffiti removal service have increased considerably, the  staff reported: In February, there were 204 calls for 7,082 square feet of  work, while in March, there were 369 calls for 11,162 square feet of work.  </P> <P> The council directed that one employee who has been spending 60% of his time on  graffiti removal be assigned to work full-time at it.  </P> <P> The council also approved a plan to distribute coupons that entitle residents  to small amounts of free paint for covering graffiti.  </P></p>

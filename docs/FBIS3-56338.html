It has now become  clear that the Federal Investigation Service is putting together  a file on him.    It is now known who invited "Adolfovich" (as one local paper  said) to a mythical "European conference" in Berlin. The names  of industrialists who have established cooperation with  Zhirinovskiy have also found their way into the press.    The news story about the sources of the Liberal Democrats'  capital seems far more convincing than the conjectures about aid  from Saddam Husayn and Gerhard Frey [name as transliterated].    So, what is the source of the Zhirinovskiy party's capital,  according to the new version?    His relations with the well-known Netherlands firm Global  Money Management, and with GMM in Russia, which is headed by  Anton Nenakhov, continue to be discussed. A Dutch journalist  spoke about this in an interview with Radio Liberty.    At the beginning of January, FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE wrote  about Netherlands sources of the LDP's money, citing the Dutch  newspapers DE VOLKSKRANT and ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD. The weekly  WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE reported that Austrian police and German  intelligence service personnel photographed Zhirinovskiy and his  entourage in Austria. The magazine prints photographs of  Zhirinovskiy, Vedenkin, Stoilov, and Neuwirth.    Nenakhov was among the industrialists who were hovering  around Zhirinovskiy in the Reinsberg hotel in Reichenfels  (Austria), WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE writes. German intelligence has  corresponding photographs received from Austrian police, whose  agent, disguised as a skier, secretly filmed what was going on  in the hotel.    In Austria Zhirinovskiy's financial interests are  represented  by 23-year old Dmitriy Klinkov, who calls himself the commercial  director of "IBS GmbH" and is constantly traveling between  Moscow and Klagenfurt, WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE writes. One firm which  is involved in trade with the East belongs to a former timber  dealer, Josef Hambrusch, who is known to have maintained close  contacts with Zhirinovskiy's partner Aleksey Vedenkin for a long  time. According to the periodical PROFIL, he stated in Austria:  "I am concerned that the party should have enough millions of  dollars at its disposal. We are trading with this aim in mind,  and this includes trade with local businessmen." The objects of  trade are -- "petroleum, lumber, and everything that brings a  profit."    With Hambrusch's help Zhirinovskiy has established  connections with another entrepreneur -- Edwin Neuwirth, a man  with a very curious biography. At 16 he voluntarily joined the  SS and to this day remains a member of "Fellowship No. 4," which  brings together former SS men. In 1950 he obtained Austrian  citizenship and started to trade in lumber; he traveled to  Russia and Yugoslavia. It is believed that the LDP conducted its  financial transactions in Austria through him.    The third thread runs through Austria to the Balkans. A  Bulgarian with an Austrian passport, Svetoslav Stoilov, is  acting as middle-man for Zhirinovskiy; they met in Moscow a few  years ago. He has a warrant personally signed by Zhirinovskiy  28 December 1993. It says (I cite the translation from the  German): "I hereby confirm that Mr. Svetoslav Stoilov is my  adviser on questions of economics and entrepreneurship."    An Austrian police camera also captured Stoilov the  consultant. However, he does not even hide his relationship  with Zhirinovskiy. He willingly admits to journalists, for  example, that he flew with him illegally (without a visa) from  Austria to Greece, to Salonika, where "Vladimir bathed in the  Aegean, and told him (Stoilov) there that he would be a most  suitable president for Bulgaria, WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE writes.    Through Stoilov Zhirinovskiy maintains ties with Balkan  entrepreneurs. One of them is the Serb Petar Ivanovic, who has  lived in Austria since 1968 and owns the OWK petrochemical  company.    Finally, another thread runs through Germany, to Berlin.  There, on Kaiserin Augusta Allee, is the "Society for the  Organization of Guardianship and Administration," which is  officially involved in buying up enterprises in the former GDR  and belongs to Werner Girke [surname as transliterated] and  Werner Neumann. Both of them came to Austria in order to meet  Zhirinovskiy.    In actual fact the firm is involved in something quite  different. It has become known that until May 1990 it belonged  to the Swiss holding "ORVAG AG," which laundered Socialist Unity  Party of Germany [SED] money in Switzerland and Liechtenstein,  multiplying the wealth of the GDR's party-state leadership.  Following unification, the legacy of the SED fell to the Party  of Democratic Socialism, the richest of all the FRG political  parties.    FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU writes that Girke is suspected of  laundering SED party money and that his contacts with  Zhirinovskiy have seriously alarmed the Guardianship Council.    The same newspaper writes that the Berlin police have  searched the premises of Girke's firm. According to its  reports, Zhirinovskiy received at least 3 million German marks  for the election campaign with Girke's help. Proof of this is  provided notably by bank accounts and receipts seized by the  Berlin police during the search. According to these documents,  Zhirinovskiy received this money via transfers into bank  accounts in Moscow and Prague in the form of payment for  "consultations."</p>

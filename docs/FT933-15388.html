			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Two face BCCI bribe charges TWO US-based Indian businessmen were charged yesterday by the US authorities with bribing bank officials and fraudulently obtaining more than Dollars 27m (Pounds 18m) in loans from five banks, including the defunct Bank of Credit and Commerce International. A third man, a former high-ranking executive at the Bank of Oman's New York office, was charged with accepting bribes from the two businessmen. Mr Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney who brought the charges, said the indictments stemmed from his department's ongoing investigation into the collapse of BCCI. The three men indicted yesterday were Mr P S Prasad, his brother, Mr Murali Ponnapula, and Mr Nasim Syed, a former Bank of Oman official. In the indictment, they are alleged to have falsely obtained Dollars 16.8m in loans from BCCI, and the rest from the Branch Banking and Trust Company of North Carolina, and US branches of the Bank of India, the State Bank of India, and the Bank of Oman. Mr Morgenthau said some of the money was used for the personal benefit of Mr Girish Sharma, an associate of Mr Prasad and the brother of India's petroleum minister.</p>

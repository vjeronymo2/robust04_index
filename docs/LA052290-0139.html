			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> COUNCIL DELAYS VOTE ON LIBRARY SITE DEAL  </P> <P> The City Council delayed a vote on a land swap agreement between the city and  the Irvine Co. after one council member expressed concern that the exchange may  not be equitable.  </P> <P> The land swap is part of a package put together to gain a site for the city's  new central library, and the agreement must be signed before design plans can  proceed for the new research and community center.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the deal, the city will give two acres of land in Newport  Center, plus development rights, in exchange for four acres near the corner of  Avocado Avenue and Coast Highway. The Irvine Co. would still have some  development rights on the remaining acres it owns at that site.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Jean H. Watt said last week that she was not sure that the  exchange was fair since under the agreement, the Irvine Co. would have  discretion to transfer development rights from the Avocado Avenue site to one  of two Newport Center sites.  </P> <P> If the developer transferred those rights -- which include rights to generate a  certain amount of traffic -- the agreement could result in a larger project  being built because the company would be entitled to combine the traffic  allowances from the Avocado and Newport Center sites.  </P> <P> Along with authorizing the land swap, the architect's contract, and a budget  amendment to pay for the $7-million library building, the City Council must  approve an application for a $1-million federal grant for construction costs.  The city must approve the measures by June 1 to meet the grant deadline, City  Librarian LaDonna Kienitz said.  </P> <P> The City Council will reconsider the land swap at a May 28 meeting.

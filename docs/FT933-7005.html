			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris pre-empts Buba as bourses consolidate THE consolidation which began towards the end of the week extended, and in some cases deepened yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS paid little heed to the decision by the Bank of France to suspend its 24 hour lending facility, having earlier in the day cut the interest rate by another 50 basis points to 7.75 per cent. However, the more important intervention rate remained unchanged at 6.75 per cent and dealers said that the market would probably see cautious trading ahead of Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting. They said that hopes are for Germany to cut rates by up to 0.5 percentage points, enabling the French to cut rates by some 25 basis points. The CAC-40 index lost 16.83 to 2,111.37 in turnover of some FFr2.4bn. Euro Disney was off 4 per cent shortly after the opening following negative weekend media comment and confirmation by the group that summer bookings had been weak. Analysts reiterated sell recommendations on the stock and commented that the future of the company was dependent on the refinancing package currently being negotiated. The shares finally closed off 80 centimes at Fl 56.00, having seen a day's low of FFr54.50. Alcatel Alsthom saw further profit-taking after last Friday's announcement that it had won a South Korean contract, easing FFr10 to FFr722. Lafarge Coppee lost FFr16.50 to FFr423.50 on a report that the European Commission might be about to impose fines on some European cement companies. FRANKFURT fell faster with the DAX index 34.41, or 1.8 per cent lower at 1,888.27 after dropping 16.30 on Friday from a three year high of 1,938.98. Turnover was DM5.7bn. Some observers thought that the consolidation could go a lot further; 1,800 was mentioned. But Mr Patrick Bettscheider, head of equity sales at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, and jointly in charge of the trading desk, said that he saw a further 20-point drop as the worst-case scenario. Mr Bettscheider thought that yesterday's drop was exaggerated by an overhang from the triple options expiry on the Deutsche Terminborse last Friday. Before the consolidation the bank had seen 'quite encouraging' buying from a number of big institutions, he said; he believes that global investors are still underweight in Germany, and that the DAX will break through its April 1990 all time high of 1,976.43 in the near future. DB Research, too, said that the consolidation was healthy. Its chief equities analyst, Mr Thomas Neisse, saw the DAX reaching 2,000 this year and predicted a rise to 2,200 in the first or second quarter of 1994. AMSTERDAM drifted lower in the absence of major corporate news, the CBS Tendency index losing 0.8 to 121.1. Nedlloyd and Wolters Kluwer, which reports half year results today, both went against the trend, with respective rises of Fl 1.10 and 80 cents to Fl 43.10 and Fl 98.30. Polygram eased Fl 1.40 to Fl 63.00. The stock has attracted positive brokers' comments following its good results recently. Kleinwort Benson's Dutch team have restated their buy recommendation, citing its long-term earnings growth of 20 per cent plus per annum. MILAN retreated a little from earlier highs further but most brokers said that sentiment remained firm. The Comit index closed 3.00 higher at 618.68. Italcable featured a 4.3 per cent rise to L10,240 as the issue began to catch up with gains in the telecommunications sector last week. Elsewhere in the sector Sip added L42 to L3,660 and Stet L47 to L4,597. ZURICH's SMI index eased 6.7 to 2,467.3 in calm dealings. Brown Boveri continued to face selling pressure after last week's satisfactory first-half results, falling SFr22 to SFr896. STOCKHOLM remained weak with profit-taking being noted in the banking sector, down 3.7 per cent on the day. The Affarsvarlden general index lost 17.9 to 1,291.6 as turnover remained strong at SKr1.5bn. Handelsbanken A shares shed SKr2 to SKr146 ahead of today's half year results. OSLO extended last week's falls, the All-share index losing 11.03 or 1.9 per cent to 562.11 in turnover of NKr658m. Uni Storebrand, which reported a first half profit of NKr689m, slightly below expectations, lost NKr0.20 to NKr19.30. Moving east, bourses offered various reactions to the day's consolidation. VIENNA followed Frankfurt, but at a distance with the ATX index down 13.30, or 1.3 per cent at 1,000.66. ATHENS continued its downward plunge with a 34.63 drop to 868.53 leaving the general index down 7.9 per cent in a week; and WARSAW ignored the trend altogether in price terms as the all-share WIG index leapt 385.5, or 6.4 per cent to record 6,390.6.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- August 23                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1293.00     1294.86     1295.01     1293.55 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1375.17     1376.87     1376.75     1374.03  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1292.46     1290.18     1291.82     1291.83 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1373.81     1374.03     1373.52     1374.00  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Aug 20    Aug 19    Aug 18    Aug 17    Aug 16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1297.31   1304.07   1303.09   1284.89   1276.32 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1380.12   1385.51   1387.63   1368.15   1359.35  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1295.92; 200 - 1378.03 Low/day: 100 - 1289.74  200 - 1372.23.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

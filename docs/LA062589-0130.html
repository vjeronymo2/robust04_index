			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REMODEL;  </P> <P> SIMPLE STEPS THAT UPGRADED ENTRY  </P> <P> Remodeling the entrance of the Keyohara residence in Del Mar involved softening  a harsh, unappealing entry in a few simple and inexpensive steps that did not  alter the structure.  </P> <P> Before the face lift, at right, the home suffered from a dated and  uninteresting shoe-box look. Below, 1-by-8-inch "shiplap" cedar siding laps  beyond the entry to help tie the existing stucco walls into the entry. The  result is an updated and appealing entry.  </P> <P> Step 1 -- Lap natural-color cedar siding in and around the entry to soften it  and add visual detail. Miter all the corners.  </P> <P> Step 2 -- Add low stucco walls and posts.  </P> <P> Step 3 -- Add trellis and a new front door.  </P> <P> Step 4 -- Add new lighting and tiles.  </P> <P> Step 5 -- Paint.  </P> <P> Contractor: Herb Sandford, Encinitas.  </P> <P> Architect: Stuart MacArthur Resor, Cardiff-by-the-Sea.  </P></p>

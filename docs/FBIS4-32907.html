			<p>BFN     [Text] The presidential elections are just getting started  in Segovia, delayed by the mysterious disappearance of Damian  Orlando Alvarez Cerna, municipal registrar. This occurred  between last night and early today at that northeastern  Antioquia mining site. Department and Segovia authorities, who  fear that the official has been kidnapped, have reported that he  was last seen early Saturday night. Today his apartment was  found empty.    The authorities added that around that same time, members of  the outlawed National Army of Liberation raided the police post  in the Fraguas community where they stole documents assigned to  the two voting tables. Given these events, the department's  Registry Office appointed two of its officials in Medellin, who  were immediately transferred by a National Police helicopter.  The two registrars, one of them [name indistinct], were granted  special powers, while being supplied with additional  documentation to replace what was stolen in Fraguas. Department  Registrar Hector Arango Morales told Caracol that, despite the  difficulties, the elections will be closed at 1600. To speed up  the process the designated officials were given instructions to  increase the 27 tables originally provided for in the urban  areas and, if necessary, those of the rural areas.    Ruben Dario Jaramillo, Antioquia's ombudsman, joined the  protests against what had occurred in Segovia, while urging  those who have knowledge of Mr. Vasquez [name as heard] Cerna's  whereabouts to respect the official's life and release him.</p>
